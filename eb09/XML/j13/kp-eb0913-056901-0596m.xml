                <p>THE empire of Japan consists of a long chain of islands separated from the
                    eastern coast of Asia by the Seas of Japan and Okhotsk, and extending from 24°
                    to 50° 40' N. lat., and from 124° to 156° 38'E. long. It commences with the
                    Kurile Islands and descends in a southwesterly direction to the Loochoo group,
                    to which the Japanese Government reasserted their claim in 1875. The southern
                    portion of the island of Saghalien was ceded to Russia in exchange for the
                    Kuriles. The whole empire is called by the natives <hi rend="italic">Dai
                    Nippon,</hi> or “Great Japan”; but <hi rend="italic">Nippon</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nihon</hi> is often employed alone. <hi rend="italic">Nippon</hi>
                    means literally “sun’s origin,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the land over which
                    the sun first rises, and thus denotes the position the empire occupies in the
                    extreme East. The principal islands may be enumerated as follows :—</p>

                <p>Owing to the lack of reliable surveys, it is exceedingly difficult to form a
                    correct estimate of the area of the Japanese empire. A few years ago the
                    Government instituted surveying operations under the direction of skilled
                    foreign engineers, and an ordnance map of the city of Tôkiô has already been
                    prepared and published; but any correct calculation of the size of the whole
                    country can hardly be obtained for some years to come. In a work on general
                    geography published a few years ago by the Education Department at Tôkiô, the
                    area of Japan is stated to be 24,780 square <hi rend="italic">ri,</hi> which
                    measurement, taking the linear <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> as equal to 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 45 English miles, gives a total of about 148,742
                    miles, or nearly one-fourth more than the area of the United Kingdom. This
                    estimate, however, is founded on maps which are far from correct.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Even in ordinary Japanese
                    maps there are noticeable very glaring discrepancies as to distances, &amp;c.
                    The common measurement of length is the <hi rend="italic">ri,</hi> equivalent,
                    as has been said above, to about 2 ’ 45 miles. The <hi rend="italic">ri</hi>
                    usually contains 36 <hi rend="italic">ch6,</hi> though in the extreme western
                    portion of the country 50 <hi rend="italic">chb</hi> are sometimes reckoned to
                    the <hi rend="italic">ri.</hi> In hilly regions we often meet with what is

                    ,</hi> which is one-half of the ordinary one. In former days, in stating
                    distances along the roads, &amp;c., the space occupied by temple enclosures was
                    not reckoned, and thus the traveller had often to traverse a far longer route
                    than that actually noted in the guide-books. The minor linear measures are the
                    <hi rend="italic">sun,</hi> or inch, 10 of which make the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shcιku,</hi> which is as nearly as possible equivalent to our foot; 6 <hi

                <p>The old division of Japan into provinces was made by the emperor Seimu (131-190
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> in whose time the jurisdiction of the sovereign
                    did not extend further north than to a boundary line running from the Bay of
                    Sendai, on the east coast of the main island, to near the present treaty port of
                    Niigata on the west coast. The northern portion beyond this line was then
                    occupied by barbarous tribes, of whom the Ainos (still to be found in Yezo) are
                    probably the remaining descendants. The whole country was then divided into
                    thirty-two provinces. In the 3d century the empress Jingô, on her return from
                    her victorious expedition against Corea, portioned out the empire into five home
                    provinces and seven circuits, in imitation of the Corean system. By the emperor
                    Mommu (696-707) some of the provinces were subdivided so as to increase the
                    whole number to sixty-six, and the boundaries then fixed by him were resurveyed
                    in the reign of the emperor Shômu (723-756). The old division is as follows

                    which they lie; while the <hi rend="italic">Saikaido</hi> coincides exactly with
                    the large island of <hi rend="italic">Kiushiu</hi> (“the nine provinces ”). This
                    name <hi rend="italic">Kiushiu</hi> must not be confounded with that of the one
                    province of <hi rend="italic">Kishiu</hi> on the main island.</p>
                <p>In 1868, when the rebellious nobles of Ôshiu and Déwa, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tozandô,</hi> had submitted to the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> (the emperor),
                    those two provinces were subdivided, Déwa into Uzen and Ugo, and Oshiu into
                    Iwaki, Iwashiro, Rikuzen, Rikuchiu and Michinoku (sometimes also called Mutsu).
                    This increased the old number of provinces from sixty-six to aeventy-one. At the
                    same time there was created a new circuit, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hokkaido,</hi> or “northern-sea circuit,” which comprised the eleven provinces
                    into which the large island of Yezo was then divided (viz., Oshima, Shiribéshi,
                    Ishikari, Téshiwo, Kitami, Ifuri, Hitaka, Tokachi, Kushiro, and Nemuro) and the
                    Kurile Islands (Chijima).</p>
                <p>Another division of the old sixty-six provinces was made by taking as a central
                    point the ancient barrier of Osaka on the frontier of Omi and Ya*mashiro,—the
                    region lying on the east, which consisted of thirty-three provinces, being
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Kuantô,</hi> or “east of the barrier,” the
                    remaining thirty-three provinces on the west being styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kuansei,</hi> or “west of the barrier.” At the present time, however, the term
                    <hi rend="italic">Kuantô</hi> is only applied to the eight provinces of Musashi,
                    Sagami, Kôdzuké, Shimotsuké, Kadzusa, Shimôsa, Awa, and Hitachi,—all lying
                    immediately to the east of the old barrier of Hakoné, in Sagami.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chiιι-goku,</hi> or “central provinces,” is a name in common
                    use for the <hi rend="italic">Sanindo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sanyodo</hi>
                    taken together. <hi rend="italic">Sai-koku,</hi> or “western provinces,” is
                    another name for Kiushiu, which in books again is frequently called <hi
                    rend="italic">Chinsei.</hi></p>
                <p>Each province <hi rend="italic">(kuni)</hi> is divided into what may be termed
                    departments <hi rend="italic">(kori).</hi> The latter vary in number according
                    to the size of the province. In the old system there were altogether six hundred
                    and twenty-nine departments, but the addition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >HoPkaidô</hi> has raised the number to considerably over seven hundred.</p>
                <p>For purposes of administration the whole of the empire except the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hok'kaidô</hi> was again divided in 1872 into three •cities <hi
                    rend="italic">(fu)</hi> and seventy-two prefectures <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ken).</hi> The three cities are Yedo, Ôzaka, and Kioto. In 1869 Yedo also
                    received the name of Tokio, or “eastern capital,” as opposed to Saikiô (the new
                    name for Kioto), or “western capital.” This was in consequence of the removal of
                    the emperor’s court from his old capital to Yedo. It may, however, be here
                    remarked that, whilst the Japanese invariably speak of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tokio</hi><hi rend="italic">Pu,</hi> “the city of Tokio,” they use the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Kioto</hi><hi rend="italic">Pu,</hi> “the city of Kioto,” and not,
                    as might have been supposed, <hi rend="italic">Saikio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pu.</hi> The limits of the prefectures <hi rend="italic">(ken)</hi> were
                    irrespective of the boundaries of the provinces. There were originally
                    seventy-two, but a gradual process of amalgamation has considerably reduced the
                    list; and in August 1876 a Government notification fixed the prefectures at only
                    thirty-five, the names of which are given in the followino· table ·—</p>

                <p>From the above list it may be noted that in many instances a single <hi
                    rend="italic">ken</hi> now contains several provinces or portions of different
                    provinces. In 1878-9 a separate prefecture (called the Okinawa <hi rend="italic"
                    >ken)</hi> was created, including the Riukiu (Loochoo) group. Until that time
                    Riukiu was governed by a king of its own, but being in fear of its powerful
                    neighbours, China and Japan, it had for many years sent tribute to both. A
                    question of double allegiance thus arose, which was solved by Japan asserting
                    its sovereignty; the king received the title of noble of Japan, and the Okinawa
                    <hi rend="italic">ken</hi> was established. Whether this action on the part of
                    the Japanese Government may not embroil them with China is a point not yet
                    definitely settled.</p>
                <p>The total number of islands in the Japanese group, exclusive of the four main
                    ones, is stated to be over three thousand. Many of these are mere barren rocks,
                    uninhabited and uncultivated. Others, again, are of considerable size and
                    exceedingly fertile, particularly the countless islets in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Suwo Nada,</hi> commonly known to Europeans under the name of the “Inland Sea,”
                    lying between the main island on the north and the islands of Shikoku and
                    Kiushiu on the south. The whole coast-line, too, is dotted with islands and
                    rocks of all sizes. Oshima, also called Vries Island, at the mouth of the Bay of
                    Yedo, is one of considerable importance. It has many inhabitants, and its
                    volcanic soil is fairly productive. It isthe most northerly of a chain which
                    extends as far south as the 27th degree of north latitude. The Bonin group,
                    termed by the Japanese the Ogasawara Islands, lies far out at sea, to the south
                    of the entrance of Yedo Bay; it consists of two large islands, separated from
                    each other by 50 miles of sea, and a host of islets. The Japanese Government
                    reasserted their sovereignty over the Bonins in 1878. The Kurile Islands are
                    merely a chain of barren rocks, and the few inhabitants are chiefly occupied in
                    the fisheries and in hunting the sea-otter. Due south from the province of
                    Satsuma lie several minor groups, terminating with the Riukiu Islands. The Goto
                    group (lit. “the five islands ”) extends in a westerly direction from the
                    province of Hizen, in Kiushiu, to which it belongs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast-line.—</hi> The bays along the coast are often of
                    considerable size. The Japanese, strange to say, have no names for either their
                    bays or their straits, the appellations found on maps and charts having been
                    given by European navigators. Y edo Bay is perhaps the best known to foreigners,
                    but Sendai Bay (on the east coast) and that running up tO <hi rend="subscript">
                    A</hi> the north of the island of Awaji, and commonly called Ôzaka Bay, are also
                    famous. Owari Bay, in the province of that name, is of considerable size. The
                    Bay of Kagoshima, in the province of Satsuma, is long and narrow; it is well
                    known to foreigners as having been the scene in 1863 of an attack on Kagoshima
                    (the castle-town of the lord of Satsuma) by a British squadron. The entire
                    coast-line teems with smaller bays and harbours, in many of which good anchorage
                    can be found. An English man-of-war, the “Sylvia,” has for several years been
                    employed as a surveying vessel to obtain soundings of the principal inlets and
                    draw up charts of the coast.</p>
                <p>The straits best known to foreigners are the Straits of Tsugaru (often miscalled
                    Saugur in maps), which separate Yezo from the northern portion of the main
                    island; the Straits of Akashi and of Idzumi, near the island of Awaji, at the
                    eastern entrance of the “Inland Sea”; and the Straits of Shimonoséki, at the
                    extreme western end of that sea, separating the main island from Kiushiu. The
                    attack on Shimonoséki in 1864 by an allied squadron of English, French, Dutch,

                    the lord of Chυshiu (in which province Shimonoséki is situated) is a matter of
                    historical note. The current in these straits is so swift that vessels have
                    difficulty in stemming it unless under steam.</p>
                <p>It will suffice to name a few of the almost countless promontories and capes
                    along the coast. On the extreme north of the main island we have Riuhi-zaki and
                    Fujishi-zaki in the Tsugaru Straits. Inuboyé no saki lies on the east coast just
                    below the mouth of the Tonégawa. Su-saki in Awa and Miura no misaki (called by
                    foreigners Cape Sagami) mark the entrance to the Bay of Yedo. Cape Idzu is in
                    the province of that name, and at the southern extremity of the province of
                    Kishiu are Idzumo-zaki and Shiwo no misaki Muroto-zaki and Ashizuri no misaki
                    are the chief promontories on the south coast of the island of Shikoku, both
                    being situated in the province of Tosa. Tsutsui-zaki in Hiuga, and Sata no
                    misaki (better known to Europeans as Cape Chichakoff) in Osumi are the extreme
                    southern points of the island of Kiushiu. In the island of Yezo there are
                    several noticeable promontories.</p>
                <p>The number of harbours and trading-ports called by the natives <hi rend="italic"
                    >o-minato</hi> (“large harbours”) is stated to be fifty-six, but many of these
                    would no doubt be inaccessible to foreign vessels of heavy tonnage. They are,
                    however, admirably adapted for the accommodation of coasting junks and fishing
                    craft, and these vessels have no lack of places of refuge in heavy weather. In
                    many instances the entrances are blocked by one or more small islands or rocks,
                    which render the anchorage within even more secure. In Yezo the port of Matsumae
                    is the one best known. The Bay of Yedo abounds with harbours, some being
                    situated within the mouths of the rivers. In Idzu, Shimoda is one that deserves
                    special mention; the water is there very deep, and it is a common occurrence for
                    vessels beating up towards the entrance of Yedo Bay to seek shelter in it.
                    Shimidzu in Suruga is also a well-known place; a long sandy promontory covered
                    with fir trees defends the port from the sea on the south. In the province of
                    Shima are Toba and Matoya, both magnificent harbours. The “Inland Sea” is, of
                    course, especially rich in this respect, the harbour of Mitarai, between two
                    islands near the province of Aki, being a favourite place of call. In Shikoku,
                    Takamatsu in Sanuki is the best known. Kiushiu is abundantly supplied, Kagoshima
                    in Satsuma being one of the largest and best. The harbours on the north-west
                    coast of the main island are also numerous, and each of the islands Tsushima,
                    Iki, and Sado possesses one. The ports thrown open to foreign trade since the
                    year 1859 are Yokohama, Hiôgo (Kobe), and Niigata on the main island, Nagasaki
                    in Kiushiu, and Hakodaté in Yezo.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> Japan, as might reasonably be expected in a
                    country where volcanoes are so numerous, is very hilly; and in some districts
                    there are many mountains of considerable height. The most extensive plains are
                    those of the Kuantô and Echigo, and the north of Ôshiu. The provinces of Mikawa,
                    Mino, and Owari are also very flat. Half-way between Tokio (Yedo) and Kioto lies
                    the great watershed of the east of Japan, the table-land of Shinano, elevated
                    some 2500 feet above the level of the sea. The ridges around or forming part of
                    it are very lofty, particularly those of the province of Hida. The plain of Yedo
                    lies to the east of this table-land, about 1800 feet below, while to the north
                    the hills gradually slope away to the province of Echigo. Another range of
                    considerable height runs due north from Aidzu to Tsugaru, thus dividing the old
                    provinces of Ôshiu and Déwa. The province of Kai is almost entirely surrounded
                    by mountains, and the hill scenery in Kishiu and near Kioto is exceedingly fine.
                    Shikoku possesses some large ridges, and the south of Kiushiu, especially in the
                    provinces of Higo and Hiuga, is also by no means deficient. Even in the wide
                    rice-plains throughout the country there may often be seen minor elevations or
                    hills, rising abruptly, in some cases to a considerable height. The mountain
                    best known to foreigners is Fujisan,—commonly, but most erroneously, termed
                    Fusiyama or Fusi-no-yama in geographical works. It rises more than 12,000 feet
                    above high-water level, and is in shape like a cone; the crater is 500 feet
                    deep. It stands on the boundary line of the three provinces of Kai, Suruga, and
                    Sagami, and is visible at a considerable distance seaward. It is regarded by the
                    natives as a sacred mountain, and large numbers of pilgrims make the ascent to
                    the summit at the commencement of summer. The apex is shaped somewhat like an
                    eight-petaled lotus flower, and offers from three to five peaks to the view from
                    different directions; it is visible from no less than thirteen different
                    provinces. Though now apparently extinct, it was in former times an active
                    volcano, and Japanese histories mention several very disastrous eruptions. The
                    last of these occurred in 1707, when the whole summit burst forth into flames,
                    the rocks were shattered and split by the heat, and ashes fell even in Yedo
                    (about 60 miles distant in a direct line) to a depth of several inches.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to'Japanese
                    tradition, it was upheaved in a single night from the bottom of the sea, about
                    twenty-one and a half centuries ago, and its history has been carefully
                    recorded. From July to September the wants of the pilgrims are supplied by
                    temporary restaurants distributed along the principal routes of ascent, one of
                    which is from the east by Subashiri, another from the north by Yoshida, and a
                    third from the south by Murayama. The white vestments usually worn by the
                    pilgrims are stamped by the priests at the top with various seals and images.
                    Sir Rutherford Alcock and a party of Englishmen ascended the mountain in 1860,
                    and since then it has frequently been visited by Europeans. The height as then
                    estimated by Lieutenant Robinson was 14,177 feet; but a mean of several
                    subsequent measurements gives only 12,200. In the great crater there are neither
                    sulphuric exhalations nor steam. According to Dr von Dräsche this is a circular
                    bowl about 700 or 800 feet deep. The lavas are mainly dolomitic; those forming
                    the walls of the crater are composed of anamesite, in which here and there
                    grains of felspar are visible. The Japanese poets never weary in celebrating the
                    praises of Fuji-san, and its conical form is one of the most familiar objects in
                    Japanese painting and decorative art. See the notice of Sir R. Alcock’s ascent

                    Mitaké in Shinano, the Nikko range in Shimotsuké, Ôminé in Yamato, Hakusan in
                    Kaga, Tatéyama in Etchiu, Kirish-ima-yama in Hiuga, Asosan in Higo, Tsukuba-san
                    in Hitachi, Onsen-ga-také in Hizen, Asama-yama in Shinano,* Chôkaizan in Ugo,
                    and Iwaki in Michinoku. There are several active volcanoes in the country, that
                    best known to foreigners being Asama-yama. This mountain is 8500 feet in height.
                    The earliest eruption of which records now exist seems to have taken place in
                    1650; after that the volcano was only feebly active for one hundred and
                    thirty-three years, when there occurred a very severe eruption in 1783. Even so
                    lately as 1870 there was a considerable emission of volcanic matter, at which
                    time, also, violent shocks of earthquake were felt at the treaty port of
                    Yokohama. The crater is very deep, with irregular rocky walls of a sulphury
                    character, from apertures in which sulphurous fumes are constantly sent forth.
                    At present very little is known in regard to the heights of the mountains, but
                    the subject is one that has attracted the attention of foreign residents in
                    Japan for several years past. The following is an approximate estimate :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The rivers of Japan, although very numerous, are
                    in no case of any great length. This of course is easily explained by the fact
                    that the islands are narrow and hilly. The longest and widest river is the
                    Tonégawa, which rises in the province of Kôdzuké, and flows due east to the
                    Pacific, throwing off, however, at Sékiyado in Shimôsa, a branch that flows into
                    Yedo Bay near the capital.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Naumann’s excellent paper, “Ueber die Ebene von Yedo,” in Petermann <hi

                    1879.</p></note> The length of the Tonégawa is over 170 miles. At Sékiyado
                    (which is a large and thriving river-port) the water is no less than 40 feet in
                    depth, while a few hundred yards above that town foot-passengers can ford the
                    stream without any great difficulty. The Shinano-gawa and Kiso-gawa, both of
                    which take their rise in the province of Shinano, rank next to the Tonégawa. The
                    former flows first in a north-westerly direction, next due north, and then
                    north-east through Echigo to the sea at Niigata; the Kiso-gawa flows to the
                    westward and then to the south, between the provinces of Mino and Owari, and
                    finally falls into the sea at Kuwana. The Oi-gawa rises in the south-west of
                    Kai, and traverses the province of Tôtômi; it is less remarkable for the length
                    of its course than for the great breadth of its bed, which near the mouth is 2∣
                    miles across, its current being also very swift. The Fuji-kawa, flowing due
                    south from the mountains of Kai through the province of Suruga, is famous as
                    being one of the swiftest streams in all Japan. In the north, the Sakata-gawa
                    flows due west from the range of mountains separating the provinces of Uzen and
                    Rikuzen, and enters the Sea of Japan at the town of Sakata, from which it takes
                    its name. Nearly all the rivers are fed by countless tributary streams, which in
                    many cases form a complete network in the lower portions of the country, and
                    thus greatly facilitate transport from the interior to the coast. On the
                    Tonégawa and a few other streams of greater depth small river steamers ply for
                    several miles; but in general large flat-bottomed boats, drawing as a rule but a
                    few inches of water, are employed. It is by no means uncommon to see boats of
                    this description in process of construction even in remote country villages on
                    the banks of streams in which the depth of water is but from 12 to 18 inches at
                    ordinary times. Floods are of frequent occurrence, especially at the
                    commencement of summer, when the melting of the snows on the mountain ranges
                    causes at times an almost incredible downflow from the higher lands to the
                    plains. These floods invariably occasion great destruction of property, as the
                    bridges spanning the rivers are only built of wood and turf, supported by piles.
                    In some localities, notably in the western portion of the province of Shimôsa,
                    traversed by the southern branch of the Tonégawa, large tracts of rice-land are
                    almost entirely destroyed by the fine sand from the bed of the river, swept over
                    the fields during inundations. In addition to boats, long rafts of timber are
                    constantly to be seen descending the larger rivers; the logs are floated down in
                    a rough state, to be afterwards thinned and sawn up at the seaport towns where
                    the timber trade is carried on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.—</hi> Japan contains a large number of lakes, but only
                    one—the Biwa Lake, in the province of Ômi—is worthy of special notice on account
                    of its size. Its length is about 50 miles, and its greatest breadth about 20
                    miles. At a village called Katada, some 10 miles from its southern extremity, it
                    suddenly contracts to a breadth of only a mile and a half, after which it again
                    slightly expands. This lake derives its name from a fancied resemblance to the
                    <hi rend="italic">biwa</hi> or Japanese lute; the scenery around it is
                    particularly beautiful, and it is a favourite resort for sightseers from Kioto.
                    An ancient Japanese legend asserts that in the year 286 B.C., in the reign of
                    the emperor Kôrei, there occurred a terrible earthquake, when the earth opened
                    and Lake Biwa was formed; at the same time rose the mountain called Fuji-san. In
                    Ômi there is a small hill called Migami, which in shape slightly resembles
                    Fuji-san, and this fact is quoted by the natives in support of the theory
                    connecting the lake <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> with the sacred mountain; and
                    the inhabitants of Ômi were privileged to undertake the ascent of Fuji-san after
                    only seven days’ purification, instead of one hundred days’, the prescribed term
                    for all other persons. After Biwa may be noted the lakes of Chiuzenji, Suwa, and
                    Hakoné, all of which lie far above the level of the sea. That of Chiuzenji is
                    situated at the foot of the mountain called Nantai-zan, in the Nikko range in
                    the province of Shimotsuké. The scenery in its vicinity has given rise to the
                    proverb that he who has not seen Nikkô should not pronounce the word
                    “beautiful.” The lake of Suwa is in the province of Shinano, and can be reached
                    by a road called the Nakasendô, running north-west from Tokio through the heart
                    of the country to Kioto. The Hakoné Lake lies in the range of hills bearing the
                    same name just to the east of Fuji-san; the water is exceedingly cold, and of
                    great depth. A Japanese legend, indeed, asserts that it has never been fathomed.
                    The hill scenery around it is very picturesque, and large numbers of foreign
                    residents from Tôkiô and the neighbouring port of Yokohama visit it during the
                    summer months. The Inawashiro Lake, in the province of Iwashiro, is said to be
                    about 10 miles in length. It is fed by two streams flowing from the east and
                    north-east, while out of it flows the Aka-no-gawa, which falls into the sea near
                    Niigata. It is surrounded by hills of no great elevation; the temperature there
                    is cool, and in w inter the streams are frozen for several weeks. On the
                    boundary line of the provinces of Hitachi and Shimôsa there are also large
                    tracts of water, or lagoons (Japanese <hi rend="italic">numa),</hi> fed by the
                    Tonégawa; these, though not actually lakes, may almost be classed under that
                    heading, as their connexion with the river itself consists in many cases of but
                    one narrow outlet. Those of chief note are the Ushiku-numa in Hitachi, and the
                    Imba-numa, Téganuma, and Naga-numa in Shimôsa. The country in this vicinity is
                    as a rule exceedingly flat, but the Imba-numa is for some distance along its
                    eastern shore bordered by small hills, thickly wooded down to the water’s edge,
                    the whole forming a very pretty landscape. The lagoons are well stocked with
                    fish, the large eels found in the Ushiku-numa being especially prized for
                    excellence of flavour; in the winter months they teem with wild fowl. The
                    inhabitants of the numerous villages along the shores are, in fact, almost
                    entirely maintained by fishing and shooting or trapping.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Japan is particularly rich in minerals, among
                    which may be specially mentioned gold, silver, iron, copper, coal, and stone of
                    various kinds. The gold was first discovered and melted in the year 749 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> during the reign of the emperor Shômu <hi
                    rend="italic">; it</hi> came from the department of Oda in the province of
                    Ôshiu, and in the following year more was found in the province of Suruga.
                    During the long period of Japan’s seclusion from the rest of the world, the gold
                    discovered remained in the country, and the amount augmented year by year; and
                    this no doubt tended in a great degree to convey to the earlier foreign visitors
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0600-0573"/> impression that the supply was far more abundant
                    than was actually the fact. The quantity of bullion exported by the Portuguese
                    during their stay in Japan (1550-1639) may be estimated at the least at
                    fifty-nine and a half millions sterling, or an average of £660,000 yearly. Dr
                    Kaempfer even speaks of some years with an export of two and a half millions of
                    gold. From 1649 to 1671 the Dutch also exported large quantities, together with
                    silver and copper, and the total value of gold and silver alone sent out of
                    Japan during the 16th and 17th centuries may be estimated at nearly one hundred
                    and three millions sterling. At an exhibition held in Kioto in 1875 were shown
                    about twenty samples of gold ore found in different provinces. The ore is
                    generally poor, and many gold-yielding places are now lying unworked, because
                    the increased cost of labour renders it very difficult to work them with profit.
                    Pure auriferous quartz has been found in the provinces of Satsuma and Kai,
                    gravel in Ôsumi, and quartz in Rikuchiu and at the mine of Aikawa in the island
                    of Sado. The mode in which the Japanese work the gold ores nearly resembles
                    Western methods. They understand perfectly the separation of even the smallest
                    quantities of. gold dust from stones and gravel by means of a system of washing
                    and lévigation. They do not, however, possess any good process for the
                    separation of gold from silver, and hence all Japanese gold contains a greater
                    or less proportion of the latter metal. Silver ore was discovered accidentally
                    in the year 667 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in the island of Tsushima; this
                    ore produced the first Japanese silver metal, in the year 674. From 1400 to 1600
                    it was obtained and melted in Japan in far larger quantities than at the present
                    time. It generally occurs in comparatively small quantities as an admixture in
                    several copper and lead ores. The principal mines are in the provinces of
                    Jôshiu, Iwami, and Setsu; but it is also found mixed with lead in Hida,
                    Iwashiro, Echizen, Echigo, Rikuchiu, Suwô, Hiuga, and Higo. Of the numerous iron
                    ores to be found, the principal is magnetic iron ore, which forms the main basis
                    of the Japanese iron industry. Loadstone was discovered in the year 713 in the
                    province of Ômi. The exact date of the first manufacture of iron is unknown; it
                    is certain only that the Japanese have worked their iron ores from the 10th
                    century onward. The principal seats of the industry are in the provinces of
                    Idzumo, Bingo, Ôshiu, Hiuga, Tajima, Wakasa, Bizen, Bitchiu, Shinano, Tôtômi,
                    Kai, Suruga, and Satsuma. The best steel is manufactured in Harima, Hôki,
                    Idzumo, and Iwami. The excellent temper of the Japanese sword-blades is well
                    known. The most noted smiths formerly resided in the provinces of Sagami, Bizen,
                    and Kishiu, and in the neighbourhood of Kioto. Japanese legends assert that the
                    first sword was forged in the reign of the emperor S∏jin (97-30 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> but this statement is of course open to
                    considerable doubt. Copper was, it is said, smelted in Japan for the first time
                    in the year 698 at Inaba in the province of Suwô; and in the year 708 the first
                    Japanese copper coin was cast, in the province of Musashi. Since the 10th
                    century enormous quantities of ore have been smelted, and this metal formed the
                    chief trade of the Dutch and Chinese at Nagasaki from 1609 to 1858,—the amount
                    exported by the former being more than four millions of piculs and by the latter
                    undoubtedly still more.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>picul-=13∙3⅛ lb. avoirdupois.</p></note> It is perhaps the metal most
                    commonly found in Japan, and is used for all kinds of household goods, doors to
                    storehouses, ornaments, temple-furniture, mirrors, bronzes, smoking utensils,
                    and current coinage. It is found and smelted in all parts of the country,
                    particularly in the northern and western provinces, and its export figures
                    considerably in the trade returns of the treaty ports during the past few years.
                    As a rule Japanese copper is exceedingly free from the presence of injurious
                    metals. After the year 1600 many bronze guns were cast in Japan, the workmanship
                    being exceedingly good; these old guns are often to be seen even now, though by
                    far the larger number, together with the temple bells, &amp;c., made from the
                    same materia], have been broken up and exported as old bronze by European
                    merchants. Of other metals Japan also produces lead, quicksilver, and tin. Coal
                    is found in large quantities, particularly in Kiushiu, where the province of
                    Hizen contains the well-known mines of Karatsu, and in the island of Takashima,
                    near the treaty port of Nagasaki. Coal-fields also exist in the large northern
                    island of Yezo. Nearly all the steamers plying between Japan and China coal at
                    Nagasaki, where this trade attracts a good-deal of enterprise. The numerous
                    quarries throughout the empire afford large quantities of stone. Marble and
                    granite are found principally in the provinces of Shinano, Mino, and Kôdzuké;
                    freestone is also procured from Setsu and Idzu. The huge blocks of which the
                    ramparts of the castle at the capital are built were originally brought from the
                    latter province. In the old castle of 0zaka, in Setsu, there is an enormous
                    piece of granite measuring thirteen paces in length and about 9 feet in height.
                    The foundations of all the more ancient temples throughout the country are
                    formed of large blocks, and these, together with the long flights of steps,
                    still remain to prove the durability of the old style of architecture. It is
                    strange, however, that at the present moment stone is but sparingly used for
                    building purposes; even in the great cities the dwelling-houses are almost
                    entirely constructed of timber, stone being used only for bridges and for
                    edifices on a larger scale than ordinary.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Riukiu and Bonin groups, lying close to the tropics, enjoy perpetual summer, the
                    Kurile Islands in the far north of the empire share the arctic temperature of
                    Kamtchatka. The climate is, on the whole, favourable for Europeans, although its
                    frequent changes often prove trying to foreign residents. All the mountain
                    ranges are wrapped deep in snow throughout the winter months; indeed, from many
                    peaks snow never entirely disappears. In the northern provinces it has been
                    known to fall to a depth of no less than 8 feet, and the province of Echigo is
                    specially noted in this respect. At the treaty port of Niigata, in that
                    province, small bamboo sheds are built out from the fronts of the
                    dwelling-houses so as to form a covered way along which pedestrians can pass
                    when the rest of the town is snowed up. At Tôkiô snow falls some three or four
                    times during the winter; it covers the ground to a depth of from 3 to 5 inches
                    on an average, but does not lie long. In January 1876, however, a remarkably
                    severe snowstorm occurred, when the whole city was covered to a depth of 2 feet
                    or more; so un-' usual was this phenomenon deemed that a large number of
                    photographs of the landscape were taken to perpetuate the memory of the event.

                    summer months the heat is far greater. Near Yokohama and Tokio the summer
                    commences in May, but the heat only becomes oppressive in July and August, when
                    the thermometer has been known to register 104° F. At the break-up of the summer
                    there are heavy rains, which render the interior of the houses exceedingly damp
                    and uncomfortable. After the winter there also occurs a short rainy season. The
                    best months for making excursions into the interior are April and October, as
                    the weather is then generally of a mean temperature. Southerly winds blow from
                    the middle of May, and often even from April, until the end of August. On the
                    Sea of Japan south-west winds (known as the south-west monsoon) prevail, while
                    in Yokohama and all parts of the country adjacent to the Pacific Ocean southerly
                    winds predominate. The south-west monsoon sets in in April and prevails until
                    the middle or end of September; but the regularity with which the monsoons set
                    in and blow on the Chinese coasts is unknown in Japan. On calm days land and sea
                    breezes alternate on the Japanese coast in the same manner as elsewhere. Mention
                    should here be made of the violent revolving storms, known as typhoons, which
                    are closely related to the West Indian hurricanes and to the cyclones of the
                    Indian seas. These generally occur in the months of July, August, or September;
                    they invariably occasion great damage, not only to shipping, but also to
                    property on land. Large trees are often snapped asunder like mere twigs, while
                    the roofs and chimneys of foreign-built edifices suffer severely. As a rule, one
                    of these storms is experienced every year.</p>
                <p>Destructive earthquakes have often taken place, while slight shocks are of
                    frequent occurrence, several having been felt lately within the space of a few
                    days. Japanese histories furnish numerous records of these phenomena. The
                    ancient legend of the great earthquake in 286 B.C., when Mount Fuji rose and the
                    Biwa Lake was formed, has already been noticed; but it is not possible to
                    procure reliable information for several centuries later than the date mentioned
                    in that fanciful tale. The earliest authentic instance is perhaps that which is
                    said to have occurred in 416 A.D., when the imperial palace at Kioto was thrown
                    to the ground. Again, in 599, the buildings throughout the province of Yamato
                    were all destroyed, and special prayers were ordered to be offered up to the
                    deity of earthquakes. In 679 a tremendous shock caused many fissures or chasms
                    to open in the provinces of Chikuzen and Chikugo, in Kiushiu; the largest of
                    these fissures was over 4 miles in length and about 20 feet in width. In 829‘the
                    northern province of Déwa was visited in similar manner; the castle of Akita was
                    overthrown, deep rifts were formed in the ground in every direction, and the
                    Akita river was dried up. To descend to more recent instances, in 1702 the lofty
                    walls of the outside and inside moats of the castle of Yedo were destroyed,
                    tidal waves broke along the coa,st in the vicinity, and the road leading through
                    the famous pass of Hakoné (in the hills to the east of Fuji-san) was closed up
                    by the alteration in the surface of the earth. Of late years these disastrous
                    earthquakes have fortunately been of more rare occurrence, and the last really
                    severe shocks were those felt in 1854 and 1855. In the former year the provinces
                    of Suruga, Mikawa, Tôtômi, Isé, Iga, Setsu, and Harima, and also the large
                    island of Shikoku, were severely shaken. It was this earthquake which destroyed
                    the town of Shimoda, in the province of Idzu, which had been opened as a foreign
                    port in Japan, while a Russian frigate, the “Diana,” lying in the harbour at the
                    time was so severely damaged by the waves caused by the shock that she had to be
                    abandoned. The earthquake of 1855 was felt most severely at Yedo, though its
                    destructive power extended for some distance to the west, along the line of the
                    Tôkaidô. It is stated that on this occasion there were in all 14,241
                    dwelling-houses and 1649 fire-proof storehouses overturned in the city, and a
                    destructive fire which raged at the same time further increased the loss of life
                    and property.</p>
                <p>Meteorological observations have for some time back been carefully taken at the
                    college in Tokio, and efforts are now (1881) being made to start a seismological
                    society in the capital. Japan is peculiarly a country where a learned society of
                    this nature could gather most interesting and useful information from actual
                    observation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Aspect of the Country.—</hi> The physical structure of
                    the islands alteruates between mountain ranges, rugged upland regions, wide
                    plains, and lands consisting of an endless succession of dale and down, level
                    fields and small ridges. Yezo has not yet become thoroughly known to foreigners;
                    but it possesses both hills and plains, the latter being in some cases very
                    sandy. The northern portion of the main island of Japan is exceedingly
                    mountainous, though large moors and uncultivated steppes are to be observed on
                    all sides. To the south-east lies the wide plain of Yedo, remarkably fertile,
                    and closed in by lofty ranges. From this away to the west the country is hilly
                    in the centre, with lower ground to the north and south; while in the large
                    islands of Kiushiu and Shikoku the high ground is far in excess of the
                    plain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Products.—</hi> The greater part of the cultivated
                    land consists of rice-fields, commonly termed “paddy-fields.” These are to be
                    seen in every valley or even dell where farming is practicable; they are divided
                    off into plots of square, oblong, or triangular shape by small grass-grown
                    ridges a few inches in height, and on an average a foot in breadth,—the rice
                    being planted in the soft mud thus enclosed. Narrow pathways intersect these
                    rice-valleys at intervals, and rivulets (generally flowing between low banks
                    covered with clumps of bamboo) feed the ditches cut for purposes of irrigation.
                    The fields are generally kept under water to a depth of a few inches while the
                    crops are young, but are drained immediately before harvesting. They are then
                    dug up, and again flooded before the second crop is planted out. The rising
                    grounds which skirt the rice-land are tilled by the hoe, and produce Indian
                    corn, millet, and edible roots of all kinds. The well-wooded slopes supply the
                    peasants with timber and firewood. The rice-fields yield two crops yearly. The
                    seed is sown in small beds, and the seedlings are planted out in the fields
                    after attaining the height of about 4 inches. The finest rice is produced in the
                    fertile plains watered by the Tonégawa in the province of Shimôsa, but the grain
                    of Kaga and of the two central provinces of Setsu and Harima is also very good.
                    Prior to the revolution of 1868-9 the fiefs of the various <hi rend="italic"
                    >daimio</hi> or territorial nobles were assessed at the estimated total yield of
                    rice. Until very recently there existed a Government prohibition against the
                    export of the grain. Rice not only forms the chief food of the natives, but the
                    national beverage, called <hi rend="italic">sake,</hi> is brewed from it. In
                    colour the best <hi rend="italic">sake</hi> resembles very pale sherry; the
                    taste is rather acid. None but the very best grain is used in its manufacture,
                    and the principal breweries are at Itami, Nada, and Hiôgo, all in the province
                    of Setsu. Of <hi rend="italic">sake</hi> there are many varieties, from the best
                    quality down to <hi rend="italic">shiro-zake</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> or “white <hi rend="italic">sake?</hi> and the turbid sort, drunk only in

                <p>The whole country is clothed with most luxuriant vegetation, except in some of
                    the very hilly regions. The principal forests consist of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptomeria</hi> (Japanese cedar) and pine; the ilex, maple, mulberry, and
                    giant camellia also abound. Some of the timber is remarkably fine, and the long
                    avenues following the line of the different high roads <pb break="no"

                    road from Tokio to the celebrated temples at the foot of the Nikko hills is an
                    avenue nearly 50 miles in length, of cedars and pines, some of the trees being
                    fully 50 or 60 feet in height. Unfortunately these noble specimens are fast
                    disappearing, as the wood-cutter’s axe and saw have been ruthlessly plied during
                    the past few years. In Japanese wood-felling a common plan is to kindle a fire
                    at the roots of the tree; this dries up the sap in the trunk, and renders the
                    wood harder and firmer. Two principal varieties of the pine occur, called
                    respectively the red and the black, from the colour of the bark. The former
                    thrives in sandy ground, while the latter grows in softer black soil. It is said
                    that, if one of these varieties be transplanted to the soil bearing the other,
                    it will also in time change in colour till it resembles its new companions. The
                    tints of the maple foliage, bright green in summer and brown-red in autumn,
                    contribute in no slight degree to the beauty of a Japanese landscape. The
                    mulberry tree grows well in the eastern regions, where the silkworm is reared
                    and the silk industry carried on. The bamboo is especially useful and plentiful.
                    Bamboo clumps are seen at frequent intervals in the rice-land; they line the
                    river banks, and flourish equally well on the higher grounds; and it would be
                    impossible to enumerate the multifarious purposes for which the cane is used. Of
                    fruit-trees Japan possesses the orange, apple, walnut, chestnut, plum,
                    persimmon, damson, peach, and vine. The fruit, however, is in most cases of
                    quality far below that of European orchards. The best oranges come from the
                    province of Kishiu; these have a smooth and very thin rind, and no seeds. The
                    larger oranges, with thick and rough rind, grow throughout the country. The
                    so-called apple resembles the large russet, but only in colour and shape; it has
                    absolutely no flavour, and is hard and stringy. The plum, of which there are
                    several varieties, may be said to be the best fruit obtained, next to the orange
                    and persimmon. This latter is exceedingly plentiful and has two varieties, the
                    soft and the hard; it is often dried, and sold packed in boxes like figs. The
                    peaches are not remarkable either for size or flavour. The best grapes are grown
                    in the provinces of Kai and Kawachi; both the black and the white are found, but
                    the fruit is small, and only continues in season for a short time. The tea-plant
                    grows well in Japan, and tea forms one of the chief exports to foreign
                    countries. The best leaf comes from the neighbourhood of Uji, in the province of
                    Yamashiro, to the south-east of Kioto; but it is also largely exported from
                    Yokohama, being produced in the fertile district in the east of the main island.
                    The production of vegetable wax has always formed one of the principal
                    industries of the island of Kiushiu, and the trees bearing the wax berries grow
                    in great number on the hill slopes and round the edges of most of the cultivated
                    fields (excepting rice-land) in the provinces of Hizen, Higo, Chikuzen, and
                    Chikugo; in Satsuma, however, they are not so plentiful. The cotton-plant,
                    introduced from India in 799, also thrives. The camphor tree is found in most
                    parts of the country, particularly in some of the higher regions; on account of
                    its agreeable smell the wood is largely used in the manufacture of small
                    cabinets and boxes. Amongst the minor vegetable products the sweet potato is
                    particularly plentiful; it has several varieties, that known as the Satsuma
                    potato being perhaps the best. Water melons and gourds of various sizes and
                    shapes thrive in the more sandy soil; and onions, carrots, small turnips,
                    tomatoes, and beet-root are also cultivated. The brinjal bears a dark purple
                    fruit shaped like a pear. The long white radish, called by the Japanese <hi
                    rend="italic">daikon</hi> (lit. “great root ”), is exceedingly common, and forms
                    one of the chief articles of food amongst the lower classes, who eat it either
                    raw or dried and pickled; the average size of the root is from 18 inches to 2 J
                    feet in length, and 1∣ inches or so in diameter. Beans and peas can also be
                    grown. The climate of Yezo is said to be very favourable for both wheat and
                    barley, and it is probable that in future years this large island may thus prove
                    a source of considerable gain to the Japanese. In the island of Shikoku the
                    indigo plant is found in abundance, and it also occurs in the eastern portion of
                    the main island. The poppy is grown in Shikoku. In ferns and creepers of various
                    kinds Japan is particularly rich, but her list of flowers is not very lengthy.
                    The rose, peony <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> azalea, camellia, lotus, and iris
                    are, however, to be seen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    a great similarity not only to that of the neighbouring Asiatic continent but
                    also to that of North America, the coincidences being most frequent, however,
                    not with the flora of the eastern but with that of the western
                    coast.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Animals.—</hi> As regards animal life Japan
                    is well provided. The domestic animals comprise the horse, ox, dog, and cat;
                    while the wilder tribes are represented by the bear, deer, antelope, boar, fox,
                    monkey, and badger. In Yezo are found very large bears, so powerful as to be
                    able to pull down a pony; in the central provinces of Shimotsuké and Shinano a
                    small black species exists. The deer, antelope, and monkey are caught in nearly
                    all the hilly regions throughout the whole country. Sheep do not thrive,
                    although the hardier goat does,—the reason assigned for this being that the
                    “bamboo grass,” with its sharp-edged and serrated blade, proves very deleterious
                    as pasture. In the western part of the province of Shimosa a sheepfarm was
                    started a few years ago; but it is not yet possible to judge whether the venture
                    will prove successful in any great degree. In the meantime sheep are usually
                    imported from China. The Japanese horses, or rather ponies, are not very
                    powerful animals; they stand on an average from 13 hands 2 inches to 14 hands 2
                    inches in height. They are thick-necked and rather high-shouldered, but fall off
                    in the hind quarters. Large numbers of ponies are imported from China. At the
                    Shimôsa farm experiments have been made in putting an Arab or Barb to a Japanese
                    mare; the half-bred animal thus obtained compares very favourably with the pure
                    native breed, being of better shape and of far superior speed. The oxen are
                    small but sturdy, and it is probable that, if the vast tracts of moorland at
                    present lying uncultivated in the northern provinces were utilized for breeding
                    cattle, substantial gains would be secured. The ordinary Japanese dog is very
                    like the Eskimo dog, and is generally white, grey, or black in colour. A few,
                    however, are red-brown, and much resemble the fox; these are used by the hunters
                    in the pursuit of game. There are several species of monkeys, and large numbers
                    of these animals, taken in the hills of Kai and Shinano, are brought into the
                    Tôkiô market, where they are sold for food; the flesh is white and very
                    palatable. Wild birds<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>T.
                    Blakiston and H. Pryer, in their “Catalogue of the Birds of Japan” <hi

                    very stringent laws prohibiting the ordinary Japanese from shooting or snaring
                    the crane, goose, or swan. One species of bittern was even deemed worthy of a
                    special rank of nobility, and is to this day known as the <hi rend="italic">go-i

                    the well-known jest of Henry VIII. in knighting the loin of beef. Many varieties
                    of domestic fowls exist, the tiny bantam being one of the most celebrated; there
                    is also a large game-cock said to have been originally imported from Siam.

                    the back from under the wings. The Japanese fisheries are marvellously
                    productive, and afford occupation to the inhabitants of the countless villages
                    along the coasts. Herrings are caught off the island of Yezo, and the bonito,
                    cod, sole, crab, and lobster are found in great plenty on nearly every part of
                    the coast. In some of the rivers in Yezo, and also in the Tonégawa, fair-sized
                    salmon are caught; and there is also a fish very much resembling the trout. The
                    <hi rend="italic">tai,</hi> a large fish of the carp species, is esteemed a
                    special delicacy: of this there are two varieties, —the red <hi rend="italic"
                    >tai,</hi> caught in rivers with sandy beds, and the black <hi rend="italic"
                    >tai,</hi> found at the mouths of streams where the darker soil of the sea bed
                    commences. Eels, small carp, and fish of many other kinds are freely taken in
                    nearly all the minor lakes and streams. The oyster is found in considerable
                    quantities in the shallows at the head of the Bay of Yedo and elsewhere. To any
                    student of zoology a visit to Japan would prove in the highest degree
                    interesting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A. R.

                    treatment of Japan and Formosa. He points out that 40 species of mammals are
                    known to exist in Japan, and that 26 of these are peculiar; whereas of the 165
                    land-birds already registered only 16 species are peculiar. He gives a list of
                    40 species of birds which are common to Great Britain and Japan, and adds that
                    it does not sufficiently indicate the resemblance, as there are many birds
                    which, though distinct species from the British, have the same general
                    appearance. Bleeker, the great Dutch naturalist, has2hjW. <hi rend="italic">tot

                    transport, although not exceptionally good, have yet improved considerably
                    during the past few years. There are but two lines of railway in Japan, both
                    very short. The first (opened to traffic in 1872) runs from Tôkiô to Yokohama,
                    and is but 18 miles in length. Shortly afterwards a line of about the same
                    length was completed between the port of Hiôgo and the city of Ôzaka, and this
                    line was in 1877 extended from the latter place to the city of Kioto, the
                    opening ceremony taking place on the 5th of February in that year. Both these
                    lines were opened by the emperor in person. Surveying operations have been going
                    on for some years, with a view to the construction of other railways, and in
                    some districts the direction of future lines has already been staked out.
                    Mention has been already made of the great facilities for transport afforded by
                    the network of small streams throughout the country. The system of roads, too,
                    is very fair, although in remote districts the work of supervision and repair is
                    not done so carefully as is really necessary. Of the highways the Tôkaidô is
                    that best known to foreigners. This is nearly 307 miles in length, and connects
                    Kioto and Tôkiô. Its course lies along the south-eastern coast of the main
                    island, and it is the only road in the country which is named after the circuit
                    that it traverses. Dr Kaempfer, one of the early residents in the Dutch factory
                    at Nagasaki, gives in his well-known <hi rend="italic">History of Japan</hi> a
                    graphic and entertaining account of his journey from Nagasaki to Yedo in 1691,
                    part of which he made by the Tôkaidô. One of the most remarkable works recently
                    completed by Japanese labour, without aid from foreign engineers, is a tunnel on
                    this road. It is situated about 6 miles to the westward of the large town of
                    Shidzuoka, and about 106 miles west of Tôkiô. The tunnel is cut through a high
                    ridge of hills intersecting the Tôkaidô. The old line of road passed over the
                    summit of the ridge, but this engineering work renders the journey far shorter
                    and easier. A good roadway, some 18 feet in breadth, leads up the ridge on
                    either side, in a zigzag direction, so as to admit of wheeled vehicles passing
                    along it with perfect safety; and the tunnel runs through the centre of the
                    hill, thus connecting the two roadways. The passage is about 200 yards in
                    length; at the eastern end it is faced with stone, then the roof is supported by
                    timber arches for some distance; a small portion is next hewn out of a stratum
                    of solid rock; and finally the timber arches are again continued as far as the
                    western extremity. The breadth throughout is about 12 feet, and the height about
                    10 feet. As the tunnel runs in a curved line, owing to the formation of the
                    hill, and is thus very dark, lamps are placed in it at intervals; while at each
                    end are fixed in the ground several posts, each surmounted by a brightly
                    polished oblong plate of tin, to reflect the rays of the sun into the interior.
                    This important work was commenced in 1873, but was not completed until March
                    1876. Another road between Kioto and Tôkiô is the Nakasendô, also called the
                    Kiso-kaidô; this runs through the heart of the country, to the north of the
                    Tôkaidô, and is a little over 323 miles in length. Some of the hill scenery on
                    the western half of this road is exceptionally grand; the elevation in many
                    parts is so great that in winter the roadway is much obstructed by snow. The
                    longest high road in Japan is the Ôshiu-kaidô, running northward from Tôkiô to
                    Awomori on the Tsugaru Straits. It traverses the provinces of Musashi,
                    Shimotsuké, Iwashiro, Rikuzen, Rikuchiu, and Michinoku, and its length is given
                    at nearly 444 miles. Two roads from Tôkiô to Niigata exist, the longer being
                    about 264 and the shorter about 225 miles in length; the latter is said to be
                    impassable in winter. Neither of these possesses a name, and for a considerable
                    distance each is identical with the Nakasendô. Another road, which, though far
                    shorter than those already mentioned, still possesses great interest for the
                    traveller on <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0604-0577"/> account of the beauty of its mountain scenery, is
                    the Kôshiu-kaidô. It unites Tokio and Kôfu, the chief town in the province of
                    Kai, and is 77 miles in length; from Kôfu a continuation of it joins the
                    Nakasendô at Shimo-no-suwa, in the province of Shinano, some 32 miles further.
                    To the west of Kioto lie many other roads, but they are of less importance
                    because there is little traffic in the Sanindô, while that of the Sanyôdô is
                    conducted in junks which ply on the Inland Sea. In the islands of Shikoku and
                    Kiushiu the roads are stated to be very bad, particularly in the mountainous
                    regions lying in the southern portion of the latter, on the confines of the
                    provinces of Hiuga, Higo, and Satsuma.</p>
                <p>The question of road superintendence is one of which the Japanese Government has
                    fully realized the importance. At a general assembly of the local prefects held
                    at Tôkiô in June 1875 there was brought forward a bill to classify the different
                    roads throughout the empire, and to determine the several sources from which the
                    sums necessary for their due maintenance and repair should be drawn. After
                    several days’ discussion all roads were eventually ranged under one or other of
                    the following heads</p>

                    Village roads, being for the convenience of the local districts alone, are to be
                    maintained at the expense of such districts under the general supervision of the
                    corresponding prefecture. The width of the national roads was determined at 7
                    ken<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ken = 71⅛
                    inches.</p></note> for class 1, 6 ken for class 2, and 5 ken for class 3; the
                    prefecture roads were to be from 4 to 5 ken; and the village roads were
                    optional, according to the necessity of the'case.</p>
                <p>On most of the high roads run small stage waggons of various sizes, but these are
                    as a rule badly made, insecure, and for the conveyance of passengers alone. In
                    the mountainous regions, and especially in the hills immediately behind the
                    foreign settlement (Kobe) at Hiôgo, in the province of Setsu, small bullock cars
                    are to be seen. These are roughly made of untrimmed timber, and are anything but
                    strong; each rests on three wheels of solid wood, and is drawn by one bullock.
                    They are, however, very useful for the conveyance of blocks of stone from the
                    hills, and for rough country work. In the large towns, and also on all fairly
                    level roads, passengers may travel in small two-wheeled carriages called <hi
                    rend="italic">jin-riki-sha</hi>; these are in shape like a miniature gig, and
                    are as a rule drawn by a single coolie, though for rapid travelling two men are
                    usually employed. In the city of Tôkiô alone there exist over 10,000 of these
                    <hi rend="italic">jin-riki-sha,</hi> and various improvements as regards their
                    style, shape, and build have been introduced since 1870, the year in which they
                    first came into use. Many are of sufficient size to carry two persons, and on a
                    good road they travel at the rate of about 6 miles an hour; the rate of hire is
                    about 5d. per Japanese <hi rend="italic">ri,</hi> or about 2d. per mile. For the
                    transport of baggage or heavy goods large two-wheeled carts are in use; these
                    are pushed along by four or six coolies. Until very lately the only vehicle
                    employed in travelling was the palanquin. Of these there were two kinds, viz.,
                    the <hi rend="italic">norimono,</hi> a large litter carried by several bearers,
                    and principally used by persons of the better class, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kago,</hi> still to be seen in hilly districts where carriages cannot pass. The
                    <hi rend="italic">kago</hi> is a mere basket-work conveyance, slung from a pole
                    carried across the shoulders of two coolies; and it is easy to see that the
                    substitution of the wheeled <hi rend="italic">jin-riki-sha</hi> drawn by only
                    one man was a great improvement as regards both economy of labour and facility
                    of locomotion. In country districts, and wherever the roads are stony or narrow,
                    long strings of pack-horses meet the eye. These animals are shod with straw
                    sandals to protect the frog of the hoof, and their burden is attached by ropes
                    to a rough pack-saddle without girths. They go in single file, and move only at
                    a walk. To their necks is attached a string of small metal bells,—a survival of
                    the ancient usage whereby a state courier was provided with bells to give timely
                    warning of his approach at the different barriers along his route, and so to
                    guard against any impediment or delay. The peasants also often employ oxen as
                    beasts of burden in hilly regions; these animals, too, are shod with straw
                    sandals, having a portion raised so as to fit into the cleft in the hoof.
                    Burdens of moderate weight are usually carried by coolies, one package being
                    fastened at each end of a pole borne across the shoulder. In remote districts
                    even the Government mails are thus forwarded by runners. In all the posttowns
                    and in most of the larger villages are established transport offices, generally
                    branches of some head office in the capital, at which travellers can engage <hi
                    rend="italic">jiη-riki-shα, kago,</hi> pack-horses, and coolies, or make
                    arrangements for forwarding baggage, &amp;c. The tariff of hire is fixed by the
                    Government, and this is paid in advance, a stamped receipt being given in
                    return. Most of the inns in the post-towns subscribe to one or another of the
                    so-called travelling guilds, each of which has a head office in Tôkiô, and often
                    in Kioto and Ozaka. Upon application at this office, the traveller can obtain a
                    small book furnishing general information as to the route by which he proposes
                    to proceed,—such as the distances between the halting places, the names of
                    rivers and ferries, and hints as to places of interest along his road. It also
                    contains a full list of the inns, &amp;c., enrolled on the books of that guild,
                    a distinction being made between lodging-houses and places where meals alone are
                    provided. To this list each landlord is obliged, at the traveller’s request, to
                    affix his stamp or seal at the time of presenting his account; and by this
                    system cases of incivility or overcharge can be reported at the head office, or
                    application made there in the event of articles being forgotten and left behind
                    at any inn. The Japanese themselves seldom travel in the interior except under
                    this system, and were foreign visitors only to follow their example they might
                    avoid a good deal of the inconvenience they not unfrequently experience.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> The towns and villages are very numerous along the
                    line oHhe great roads. The three great cities are Tokio (Yedo), Ôzaka, and
                    Kioto. The last-named was the ancient capital, and had been in existence for
                    centuries before Tôkiô. and also for a very considerable time before <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n605/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0605-0578"/> Ôzaka was built. Now, however, these two have
                    rapidly outstripped Kioto both in size and importance, and are in fact the two
                    great centres of trade throughout the whole country. The emperor’s court now
                    resides at Tôkiô, and it is there that the foreign legations are stationed. The
                    city of Ôzaka (often wrongly spelt Osacca) is purely mercantile; it is
                    intersected by numberless canals spanned by bridges that are in some cases of
                    great length, and a very large proportion of the buildings are storehouses for
                    merchandise. The Japanese mint (opened in April 1871) is at Osaka. Next in
                    importance to these three cities may fairly be classed the various ports thrown
                    open, under the treaties with Western powers, to foreign trade. Commencing from
                    the north, we come first to Hakodaté (erroneously spelt Hakodadi) in the south
                    of the island of Yezo. There is here no distinct foreign settlement, the houses
                    of the few Europeans being mingled with those of the natives. The chief exports
                    are dried fish and seaweed. On the main island the most northern port is
                    Niigata, in the province of Echigo, where also no foreign settlement as yet
                    exists. The trade is exceedingly small, owing to the bad anchorage. A bar of
                    sand at the mouth of the river (the Shinano-gawa) prevents the approach of
                    foreign-built vessels, and the roads off the river mouth are so unprotected that
                    when a heavy gale blows the European ships often run across to the island of
                    Sado for shelter. Some little trade, however, is carried on, the neighbourhood
                    being very fertile <hi rend="italic">; rice</hi> and copper are the chief
                    productions. Yokohama, about 18 miles to the south of the capital, and situated
                    on the western shore of the Bay of Yedo, enjoys by far the greater proportion of
                    the whole foreign trade of Japan. The foreign settlement is very large, and
                    numerous bungalows and small villas of the European residents are also built on
                    a hill (known as the “Bluff”) overlooking the “settlement” proper. The chief
                    exports are tea and silk; the former goes principally to the United States and
                    to England, and the latter to the French markets. Large business transactions
                    also take place in silkworm eggs and cocoons, as well as in copper, camphor, and
                    sundry other articles of trade. Proceeding westward, we come to the port of
                    Hiôgo, in the province of Setsu. The foreign settlement, generally called Kôbé,
                    is not so large as that of Yokohama, but the streets are wider and more
                    commodious. A railway connects this place with Ôzaka, where there is also a
                    foreign settlement, though of very small size. The principal exports here are
                    tea, silk, camphor, vegetable wax, &amp;c. Nagasaki, the best known by name of
                    all the open ports, is in the province of Hizen, in the large southwestern
                    island of Kiushiu. The foreign settlement is small, though the native town is of
                    considerable extent. Coal is the staple export. Dr Kaempfer’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Japan</hi> gives a most exhaustive and interesting description of
                    the everyday life of the early Dutch residents at this port, where they were
                    pent up in the tiny peninsula of Deshima (commonly misspelt Decima or Dezima) in
                    the harbour. Throughout the rest of the country the largest towns are as a rule
                    those that were formerly the seats of the territorial nobles (√αm7d), and are
                    even now commonly known as “castle-towns.” It is easy to conceive that in· the
                    olden days, under the feudal system, the resid ence of the lord of the district
                    formed a kind of small metropolis for that particular locality; and the
                    importance thus attaching to the castle-towns has in most cases survived the
                    departure of the nobles to the capital. The castles usually stood some slight
                    distance from the rest of the town, often on a hill or rising ground overlooking
                    it. In the centre rose the keep or citadel, a strong tower of three or five
                    stories, commanding the whole of the fortifications; this was surrounded by high
                    earthen ramparts, faced on the outside with rough-hewn blocks of stone and
                    defended by a moat, which was often of considerable width. The gateways were
                    square, with an outer and an inner entrance, constructed of stone and heavy
                    timbers. The lines of fortification were as a rule three in number. Above the
                    ramparts rose a slight superstructure of wattled stakes, whitewashed on the
                    outside and loopholed for musketry and archers’ shafts. The whole produced a
                    very striking effect when viewed from some slight distance, the grey stone and
                    the brighter whitewash showing distinctly from among the dark foliage of the
                    trees in the pleasure grounds within the enclosure. It was not, however, every
                    castle that was built on the scale just described; many of them were exceedingly
                    small, and were defended only by narrow ditches and weak wooden gates, the
                    buildings within being thatched with straw and hardly superior to the ordinary
                    peasant’s dwelling. Most of these castles have been demolished, but a few yet
                    remain nearly intact to tell the tale of the former pomp and state of the feudal
                    nobility. On the outskirts of the castle dwelt the retainers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">davmtà,</hi> their houses being sometimes situated within the
                    outermost moat, and sometimes, again, completely beyond it. The houses of the
                    townspeople still stand in their original positions. They are constructed almost
                    entirely of wooden posts, beams, and planks, the roofs being generally tiled.
                    The floors are raised to a height of about 18 inches from the level of the
                    ground, and are covered with large straw mats an inch and a half in thickness.
                    These mats are nearly all 6 feet in length by 3 in breadth, are covered with a
                    layer of finely plaited straw, and have the edges bound with some dark cloth.
                    The doors to the rooms are formed of sliding screens of wooden framework covered
                    with paper; these are 6 feet high, and move in grooves in the beams fixed above
                    and below them. In the houses of well-to-do persons, these slides are often
                    covered with coarse silken stuff, or formed of finely planed boards, usually
                    decorated with paintings. At one side of the room is generally seen a recess,
                    with a low dais; on this various ornaments or curiosities are ranged, and a
                    painted scroll is hung at the back of the whole. A few years back, before the
                    wearing of swords was prohibited, a large sword-rack (often of finely lacquered
                    wood) usually occupied the place of honour on the dais. The ceilings are of thin
                    boards, with slender cross-beams laid over them at intervals. Except in the
                    larger towns, there are hardly any buildings of more than two stories, though
                    the inns and lodginghouses sometimes have as many as four. The front of the
                    dwelling is either left entirely open, or, with the better class of
                    tradespeople, is closed by a .kind of wooden grille with slender bars. Those who
                    can afford it usually shut in the frontage altogether by a fence, through which
                    a low gateway opens upon a small garden immediately in front of the entrance to
                    the dwelling. At the back there is generally another tiny garden. All round the
                    house runs a narrow wooden verandah, of the same height as the floor, over which
                    the roof protrudes; this verandah is completely closed at night or in stormy
                    weather by wooden slides known as “rain-doors,” moving in grooves like the
                    slides dividing the rooms in the interior. Next in importance to the
                    castle-towns come the post-towns along the high roads, where travellers can
                    obtain accommodation for the night, or engage conveyances and coolies for the
                    road. The houses are similar to those already described, but are built on a
                    smaller scale, and most of them are thatched instead of being tiled. The inns
                    and tea-houses are the grand feature of these towns; as a rule the accommodation
                    there to be obtained is excellent, though this is of course only on the great
                    highways. In remote country districts the traveller is frequently forced to
                    rough it, and put up with what he can find in the way of shelter. Each post-town
                    possesses an office for the receipt, forwarding<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n606/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0606-0579"/>, and delivery of the postal mails; as a rule the
                    mayor or vice-mayor of the district is charged with this duty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rural Life.—</hi> The agricultural villages are often very poor
                    places, the houses being dilapidated, and the food and clothing of the peasants
                    meagre in the extreme. In many instances the farm-buildings are situated in the
                    midst of the rice-fields or on a hill slope, at some little distance from the
                    road. Even the women and children go out to till the ground from early morn
                    until late in the evening, their labour being sometimes varied by felling trees
                    or cutting brushwood on the hills. In some localities they eke out their means
                    of livelihood by snaring birds, or by fishing in the numerous ponds and
                    rivulets. Those who can afford to do so keep a pack-horse or an ox to be used
                    either as a beast of burden or to draw the plough. The farming implements are in
                    many cases very primitive. The plough is exceedingly small, with but one handle,
                    and is easily pulled through the soft mud of the ricefields by a single pony or
                    a couple of coolies. To separate the ears of grain from the stalks the latter
                    are· pulled by hand through a row of long iron teeth projecting from a small log
                    of timber; the winnowing fans are two in number, one being worked by each hand
                    at the same time. The spades and hoes used are tolerably good implements, but
                    the sickle consists merely of a straight iron blade, some 4 inches in length,
                    pointed, and sharpened on one side, which projects from a short wooden handle
                    about 15 inches long. When the grain is gathered in, the straw is stacked in
                    small sheaves and left in the fields to dry, after which it is used for
                    thatching or as litter for cattle. In the wilder districts the peasantry are
                    wretchedly poor, and cannot indeed afford to eat even of the rice they
                    cultivate; their ordinary food is millet, sometimes mixed with a little coarse
                    barley. The potato and the long radish <hi rend="italic">(daikon)</hi> are
                    almost the only other articles of food within their means. Agrarian riots are
                    not unfrequently occasioned by bad harvests or scarcity from other causes, and
                    the consequences are sometimes very disastrous, the peasants, when once excited,
                    being prone to burn or pillage the residences of the local officials or headmen
                    of the villages. These riots do not, however, arise as in former days from the
                    exactions of the lords of the soil. There is no doubt that prior to the
                    revolution of 1868-69 the peasantry were in too many cases grievously oppressed
                    by their feudal chiefs, especially on those estates owned by the <hi
                    rend="italic">hatamoto</hi> or petty nobility of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shogun’s</hi> court at Yedo. These nobles, with some very rare exceptions,
                    resided continuously in the city, leaving their fiefs under the control and
                    management of stewards or other officers; whenever money was needed to replenish
                    the coffers of the lord, fresh taxes were laid on the peasantry, and, should the
                    first levies prove insufficient, new and merciless exactions were made. Under
                    the present central Government, however, the condition of the Japanese
                    agricultural classes has been greatly ameliorated. A fixed land-tax is levied,
                    so that the exact amount of dues payable is known beforehand. In the event of
                    inundations, poor harvests, or similar calamities, Government grants are
                    constantly made to the sufferers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> Throughout the whole country schools have been
                    established, for the support of which the Government often gives substantial
                    assistance. The cost of tuition in these establishments is generally fixed at a
                    rate within the means of the poorest classes. In most of the remote villages the
                    schoolhouse is now the most imposing building.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Court-houses have been erected in each
                    prefecture, where the laws are administered by Government officials appointed by
                    the department of justice at the capital. These courts are placed under a
                    smaller number of superior courts, to which appeals lie, and these are in turn
                    subordinate to a supreme court of appeal in Tôkiô. By a Government edict issued
                    on the 13th of September 1876 the titles and jurisdiction of the various courts
                    were fixed as follows :—</p>

                <p>Small police stations have been erected in all towns and villages of any
                    importance; along the high roads the system is carefully organized and well
                    carried out, though in distant localities the police force is often wholly
                    inadequate to the numbers of the population. The Japanese lower orders are,
                    however, essentially a quiet and peaceable people, and thus are easily
                    superintended even by a very small body of police. In the capital and the large
                    garrison towns it is a different matter, and collisions frequently occur with
                    the riotous soldiery. The military stations are established in some· of the
                    larger castles throughout the country, the principal garrisons being at Tôkiô,
                    Sakura in Shimôsa, Takasaki in Kôdzuké, Nagoya in Owari, Ôzaka in Setsu,
                    Hiroshima in Aki, and Kumamoto in Higo.</p>
                <p>Since the restoration of the <hi rend="italic">mikαdο</hi> Japan has undergone
                    many changes. Innumerable measures of reform in the internal administration of
                    the country have been introduced. The former territorial nobles surrendered
                    their castles and muster-rolls of retainers to the central Government, and are
                    now, in common with the old court nobles of Kioto, classed under the one name of

                    the capital of the empire. To this class of nobles belongs the former king of
                    the Eiukiu Islands. After the <hi rend="italic">kuazoku</hi> come two other
                    grades, called respectively the <hi rend="italic">shizoku</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">heimin,</hi> or, as they may be termed, the gentry and commoners.
                    The former comprises the old <hi rend="italic">hatamoto,</hi> or petty nobility
                    of the shôgunate, and the <hi rend="italic">samurai,</hi> or military families,
                    from whom the retainers of the <hi rend="italic">daimi6</hi> were recruited. The
                    <hi rend="italic">heimin</hi> include the peasantry, artisans, and traders. Thus
                    the ancient “four classes” of the population have been reduced to three. The <hi
                    rend="italic">han</hi> system has been abolished, and the system of <hi
                    rend="italic">ken,</hi> or prefectures, directly under the control of officers
                    of the central Government, established in its stead. The debts of the <hi
                    rend="italic">han,</hi> consisting chiefly of the redemption of their
                    paper-currency, were also taken over, and this measure certainly involved the
                    present administration in considerable financial difficulties from the very
                    outset, so much so that large issues of Government notes and bonds have become
                    necessary. À grand scheme for the capitalization of incomes was put into
                    operation in August 1876. The <hi rend="italic">daimiô,</hi> on surrendering
                    their muster-rolls to the crown, were relieved from the necessity of paying the

                    computation made iu the year 1870, Kioto had then about 370,000 inhabitants.
                    Next in importance after these two cities comes Ôzaka, with a population of
                    414,000 souls. After Ôzaka may be mentioned Nagoya, the chief town of the
                    province of Owari, followed closely by Hiroshima in Aki, Saga in Hizen,
                    Kagoshima in Satsuma, Kanazawa in Kaga, and Himéji in Harima,—most of which are
                    said to possess over 100,000 inhabitants. Fukui in Echizen and Gifu in Mino rank
                    in the second class. Of the ports open to foreign trade, Ôzaka being excluded,
                    Nagasaki is said to have the largest population, being very slightly in excess
                    of Yokohama; Hakodaté and Niigata have perhaps about 30,000 each. The foreign
                    communities are very small: they may be numbered at a few hundreds at Yokohama,
                    Tôkiô, Kôbé, and Nagasaki, while at Ôzaka, Hakodate, and Niigata the European
                    residents may be reckoned by tens.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">National Wealth.—</hi> Although possessed of considerable mineral
                    wealth, Japan cannot be called a rich country. The early foreign residents, from
                    the time the treaties were made in 1858 and following years, were perhaps
                    over-sanguine in their expectations. Recent commercial returns show that the
                    balance of trade has been against Japan, her exports being considerably in
                    arrear of the imports.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The consular trade reports for the open ports in Japan, published yearly in
                    the blue books, afford minute information on all subjects connected with
                    commerce between Japan and other nations.</p></note> Up to the present time this
                    deficiency has been chiefly supplied by an export of bullion, paper money being
                    issued in large quantities for use in the country itself. The value of the notes
                    now in circulation is very great, and it is hard to say how or when they can be
                    redeemed. The notes issued at the time of the revolution of 1868 bore an
                    endorsement to the effect that they were to be redeemed within thirteen years;
                    but, instead of this, they have been replaced by another issue, without any such
                    endorsement. In 1879-80 the Japanese paper currency fell to a discount of above
                    50 per cent, as compared with the silver Mexican dollar in use amongst the
                    foreign merchants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Works.—</hi> In spite of these financial difficulties,
                    the Japanese have made great advances in public works. In the number of its
                    lighthouses Japan may compare favourably with many a Western nation. Though all
                    have been erected by foreign engineers during the past ten or twelve years,
                    there is hardly a promontory or island lying in the direct track of the shipping
                    but is possessed of a lighthouse. Many of the lights are very powerful; but in
                    localities of less importance, or lying off the track of foreign vessels,
                    smaller junk lights are used. Buoys and beacons of various sizes have been
                    moored in many places. The whole system is under the superintendence of u
                    special Government bureau (the lighthouse department), which despatches steamers
                    at stated periods to make the tour of the coast and convey stores and provisions
                    to the different posts. At the more important lighthouses foreign lightkeepers
                    are employed, but in many instances the service is performed by natives alone.
                    The rocky and dangerous character of the Japanese coasts makes this system one
                    of peculiar utility. As already mentioned, good progress is being made in
                    railway construction. Numerous lines of telegraph have been erected throughout
                    the country, not only between the treaty ports but also in the interior,
                    particularly to the garrison towns and local Government offices. The mint at
                    ôzaka has been working since the year 1871. At Yokosuka, on the western shore of
                    the Bay of Yedo, are a dockyard and arsenal, superintended by French engineers;
                    these <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n608/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0608-0581"/> have proved of great utility. Large numbers of
                    foreign men-of-war and other vessels have there been docked and repaired.
                    Paper-mills have been established in different localities, and manufactories of
                    various descriptions started. The postal system is exceedingly well managed, and
                    extends over the whole empire. Attention is also given to customhouse
                    arrangements at the open ports. In the capital there are numerous colleges and
                    Government schools, notably for military, naval, and scientific instruction,
                    conducted in many instances by foreign teachers. The mail service along the
                    coast deserves special mention. The steamers employed belong chiefly to the
                    Japanese steamship company known as the Mitsubishi Company; these ply along the
                    entire length of the coast and also to Shanghai, passing through the “Inland
                    Sea,” and smaller boats run to New-chwang in China, and to the Riukiu islands.
                    The company is subsidized by the Government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> The religious beliefs of the Japanese people
                    may be divided under two heads, the <hi rend="italic">Shintô</hi> and the

                    the introduction from abroad of Buddhism and the Confucian philosophy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shintô</hi> means literally “the way of the gods.” Though often
                    styled by foreign writers a religion, it really is not one. No concise
                    definition of it appears to exist, but the following are some of its leading
                    points.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See also Dr

                    no moral code, the writer Motoori (a high authority on this subject, born 1730,
                    died 1801) even asserting that in Japan there was no necessity for any system of
                    morals, as every Japanese acted aright if he only consulted his own heart. He
                    also declared that the whole duty of a good Japanese consisted in obeying
                    implicitly and without question the commands of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mikado.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Shinto</hi> Japan is held to be the country
                    of the gods, and the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> to be the direct descendant
                    and actual representative of the Sun goddess. In it there also seems to be mixed
                    up a system of hero worship, many renowned warriors and other personages of
                    ancient days being exalted into what we should term demi-gods; thus it
                    inculcates a reverential feeling toward the dead. By it, too, spiritual agencies
                    are attributed to the elements or natural phenomena. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shinto</hi> shrines throughout the country are built in very simple style,
                    being generally constructed of white wood, unadorned by brilliant colouring as
                    in Buddhist temples, and roofed with thatch. Before each shrine stand one or
                    more <hi rend="italic">torU,</hi> archways formed of two upright posts with a
                    projecting cross bar laid on their summits, beneath which is a smaller
                    horizontal beam, the ends of which do not project. As its name implies, the <hi
                    rend="italic">torvi</hi> was originally a perch for the fowls offered to the
                    gods, not as food, but to give warning of daybreak. This archway gradually
                    assumed the character of a general symbol of <hi rend="italic">Shintô,</hi> and
                    the number which might be erected in honour of a deity became practically
                    unlimited. The special peculiarity distinguishing the pure <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shintô</hi> shrines from the Buddhist temples is the absence of images exposed
                    as objects for the veneration of the worshipper; but at the same time the former
                    nearly always contain some object in which the spirit of the deity therein
                    enshrined is supposed to reside. The principal <hi rend="italic">Shinto</hi>
                    shrines are those in the department of Watarai in the province of Isé, known as
                    <hi rend="italic">Isé</hi><hi rend="italic">Dai-jin-gu</hi> (“the great divine
                    palaces of Isé ”), and maintained by Government.</p>
                <p>The first Buddhist images and Sûtras were brought to Japan from Corea in the year
                    552, if we can believe the <hi rend="italic">Nihongi</hi>; but it was long
                    before the religion obtained much hold on the people. In the beginning of the
                    9th century the priest Kûkai (now better known as Kôbô Daishi) compounded out of
                    Buddhism, Confucianism, and <hi rend="italic">Shinto</hi> a system of doctrine
                    called <hi rend="italic">Riobu Shinto,</hi> the most prominent characteristic of
                    which was the theory that <hi rend="italic">Shintô</hi> deities were nothing
                    more than transmigrations of Buddhist divinities. Buddhism, thus fairly
                    introduced, ere long obtained complete ascendency; it became the religion of the
                    whole nation, and held that position until the Tokugawa dynasty of <hi
                    rend="italic">shôgun,</hi> when it was supplanted in the intellects of the
                    educated class by the philosophy of Choo He. Its teachings were calculated to
                    awaken man to a sense of his own shortcomings and to cause him to long for
                    perfection; it encouraged belief in a succession of lives and transmigration of
                    souls; and the highest reward promised to the true believer was to be absorbed
                    into Buddha and to attain to absolute perfection. Under the Tokugawa family,
                    many grants were made from their treasuries to famous Buddhist temples, notably
                    to that of Zôjôji in the district of Shiba, in Yedo, which was endowed by
                    lyéyasu himself in the concluding years of the 16th century. These grants were,
                    however, withdrawn after the restoration of the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> in
                    1868, and Buddhism has been virtually disestablished since 1st January 1874.

                    been built, and schools opened for the instruction of children. Christianity is
                    no longer prohibited, as of old, by Government edict, and the number of the

                    It is asserted that there first existed seven generations of “heavenly deities,”
                    who were followed by five generations of “earthly deities,” who in turn were

                    succeeded to the throne. The present year (1881) is thus the 2541st year of the
                    Japanese era. The long line of sovereigns comprises one hundred and eleven
                    emperors and eleven reigning empresses. A strong ground for disbelieving the

                    probable that some of the inhabitants of the latter place may also have crossed
                    the narrow seas dividing them from Tsushima and the main island of Japan.
                    Ethnologists are not unanimous in their opinions on these points, but it is
                    generally conceded that there did exist an ancient indigenous race, who were
                    subsequently subjugated and driven towards the north by certain tribes advancing
                    from the southwest. Thtιs, in the early history of Japan we find that Kiôto and
                    the provinces immediately around it were occupied by the conquerors, from whom
                    descended the modern Japanese; while the aboriginal tribes were with difficulty
                    restrained and pent up in the eastern and northern regions.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> himself dwelt at Kiôto, with his court. The
                    nobles composing the court were styled <hi rend="italic">kugé,</hi> and were
                    themselves descended from cadet branches of the imperial family. There was but
                    one sovereign, and to him the whole empire owned allegiance; he lived in
                    extremely simple style both as regards food ana dress, and rode out to' the
                    chase surrounded by his retainers. But the inroads of the savages on the eastern
                    borders necessitated constant and vigilant measures for their repression. In
                    such expeditions, however, no special class of generals was created; everything
                    was ordered in the name of the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> himself, or in some
                    cases an imperial prince acted as his representative, so that in no instance did
                    the power even appear to pass from the hands of the sovereign. In the Middle
                    Ages, however, the Chinese military system was adopted as a model, and generals
                    were appointed; the able-bodied males in each province were formed into distinct
                    military corps, and men were told off according to the muster-rolls to garrison
                    the capital or to guard the frontiers. Expeditions were carefully organized,
                    being placed under a general <hi rend="italic">tfhôgun'),</hi> who was assisted
                    by subordinate officers. All weapons of war and other appliances were kept in
                    the military stores, and issued as occasion required; when warlike operations
                    were suspended, the arms were returned to the stores for safe keeping. As time
                    passed on the powerful family of Fujiwara began to exercise the administrative
                    power hereditarily, in virtue of its relationship to the throne by the female
                    side, and it then became the usage that high descent should be the only
                    qualification for office. The rank and title of general were constantly
                    conferred on the two rival clans of <hi rend="italic">Hei</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gen,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Taira</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Minamoto,</hi> as they are also termed. Upon this there first arose the
                    expression “military class,” and during the period 770-780 the complete
                    severance of the agricultural class and the soldiery took place. From this time
                    onwards the military domination acquired yearly greater strength, while the
                    power of the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> decreased in proportion. The
                    turbulent common people of the provinces of Ôshiu, Déwa, and the Kuantô were
                    always in the possession of armour and horses, and openly styled themselves
                    “warriors.” In the 10th and 11th centuries the clans of Taira and Minamoto
                    increased in warlike power and influence, became deadly rivals, and virtually
                    ruled the whole country, all the inhabitants owning fealty to one or other of
                    the two factions. A terrible civil war ensued, extending from the middle to*-the
                    end of the 12th century, when the Taira clan was annihilated by its rivals, who
                    thereupon seized the supremacy. They in their turn succumbed and were succeeded
                    by others, down to the last dynasty (that of the Tokugawa family), which existed
                    from 1603 till 1868. All this time the <hi rend="italic">mikados</hi> were in
                    reality merely puppets swayed at will by the military faction in power at the
                    time; the ancient state of affairs was overthrown, and the sovereign himself was
                    kept almost a prisoner in his palace at Kiôto. In 1868, however, the revolution
                    shattered the might of the then ruling clan of Tokugawa, the restoration of the
                    <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> was effected, and the present position of the
                    sovereign is at last almost perfectly similar to what it was in the very ancient
                    times.</p>
                <p>The most interesting portion of Japanese history is that of the rise and fall in
                    the Middle Ages of the warlike families which in turn seized the power and
                    overawed the crown. Of these the Taira clan stands pre-eminent, though much of
                    its history is mixed up with that of its rival, the Minamoto elan. The two came
                    first into notice in the 10th century, and quickly increased in influence and
                    strength. It would appear indeed that the court strove to play off the one
                    against the other, being moved by fear that the power of either might become too
                    great. Thus, if one of the Taira rebelled, the Minamoto were authorized by the
                    emperor to subdue him; while, if any members of the latter clan proved unruly,
                    the Taira were only too glad to obtain an imperial commission to proceed against
                    them. This gave rise to incessant intrigue and frequent bloodshed, ending at
                    last, in the middle of the 12th century, in open warfare. Taira no Kiyomori was
                    at that time the head of his clan; he was a man of unscrupulous character and
                    unbounded ambition, and constantly strove to secure offices at court for
                    himself, his family, and his adherents. In 1156-59 severe fighting took place at
                    the capital between the rival clans, each side striving to obtain possession of
                    the person of the sovereign in order to give some colour of right to its
                    actions. In 1159 Kiyomori eventually triumphed, and the sword of the executioner
                    ruthlessly completed the measure of his success in the field. Nearly the whole
                    of the Minamoto chiefs were cut off,—among them being Yoshitomo, the. head of
                    the clan. A boy named Yoritomo, the third son of Yoshitomo, was, however, spared
                    through the intercession of Kiyomori’s step-mother; and Yoshitsuné, also
                    Yoshitomo’s son by a concubine, was, with his mother and two brothers, permitted
                    to live. Yoritomo and his half-brother Yoshitsuné were destined eventually to
                    avenge the death of their kinsmen and completely to overthrow the Taira house,
                    but this did not take place till thirty years later. In the meantime Kiyomori’s
                    power waxed greater and greater; he was himself appointed <hi rend="italic"
                    >daij6-daijin</hi> ( “prime minister"), and he married his daughter to the
                    emperor Takakura, whom, in 1180, he forced to abdicate in favour of the
                    heir-apparent, who was Kiyomori’s own grandson. After raising his family to the
                    highest pinnacle of pride and power, Kiyomori died in 1181, and retribution
                    speedily overtook the surviving members of his clan. The once almost annihilated
                    Minamoto clan, headed by Yoritomo, mustered their forces in the Kuantô and other
                    eastern regions for a final attempt to recover their former influence. Marching
                    westwards under the command of Yoshitsuné, they started on one grand series of
                    triumphs, terminating (1185) in a crowning victory in a sea-fight off Dannoura,
                    near Shimonoséki, in the province of Chôshiu. The overthrow of the Taira family
                    was complete: the greater number perished in the battle, and many were either
                    drowned or delivered over to the executioner. The emperor himself (Antoku, 82d
                    of his line), then only in the seventh year of his age, was drowned, with other
                    members of the imperial house. The Taira supremacy here came to an end, having
                    existed during the reigns of nine emperors.</p>
                <p>The period of the Minamoto supremacy lasted from this time until the year 1219.
                    Yoritomo was the leading spirit, as his sons Yoriiyé and Sanétomo, who succeeded
                    him in turn, did not in any way attain to special fame. Having secured himself
                    against molestation from the Taira, Yoritomo directed his efforts systematically
                    to the consolidation of his power in the east. Commencing from the Kuantô, he
                    soon overawed the whole of the northern provinces, and also extended what was
                    virtually his dominion to the westward in the direction of Kiôto. Kamakura, a
                    town on the sea-shore in the province of Sagami, an old seat of the Minamoto
                    family, was made his metropolis. The site of this town faces the sea, and is
                    completely shut in on the rear by a semicircular ridge of steep hills, through
                    which narrow cuttings or passes lead to the country beyond. Under Yoritomo
                    Kamakura prospered and increased in size and importance; a large palace was
                    built, barracks were erected, and it became the capital of the east of Japan. In
                    the year 1192 the emperor Takahira (also known as Go-Toba no In) issued a decree
                    creating Yoritomo <hi rend="italic">Sei∙i∙tai-sh6gun</hi> (literally,
                    “barbarian-subjugating generalissimo”), and despatched an imperial envoy from
                    Kioto to Kamakura to invest him with the office. He and each <hi rend="italic"
                    >shôgun</hi> who came after him were thus nominated commanders-in-chief, holding
                    the office by order of and investment from the emperor, to preserve peace and
                    tranquillity on the eastern marches of Japan. This has given rise, in numerous
                    works on Japan published by different authors (Dr Kaempfer among them), to the
                    common assertion that Japan possessed <hi rend="italic">two</hi> emperors,—the
                    one “spiritual,” residing at Kiôto, and the other “temporal,” residing at
                    Kamakura and afterwards at Yedo. This idea, though entirely erroneous, is not
                    unnatural; for, although each successive <hi rend="italic">shôgun</hi> owned
                    allegiance to the emperor and was invested by the latter, still his own position
                    as supreme head of the military organization of the country and his influence
                    over the powerful territorial nobles made him <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                    almost the equal of a sovereign in his own right. This condition of affairs
                    continued until the revolution of 1868, when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shôgun</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi> power was shattered, the military
                    domination swept away, and the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> reinstated in his
                    early position of supreme authority. Yoritomo’s two sons Yoriiyé and Sanétomo
                    were in turn invested with the office of <hi rend="italic">shôgun</hi>; they
                    both dwelt at Kamakura. In 1219 Sanétomo was killed by Yoriiyé’s son, in revenge
                    for the supposed murder of Yoriiyé himself, and, as he died without issue, the
                    main line of the Minamoto family thus came to an end.</p>
                <p>Upon this commenced the supremacy of the Hôjô family, who had for years been
                    adherents of the Minamotos. The heirs of the latter having failed, the office of
                    <hi rend="italic">shôgun</hi> was conferred upon different members of the
                    illustrious house of Fujiwara, who all resided at Kamakura. The military
                    administration, however, was invariably in the hands of the Hôjôs, who acted as
                    regents of the <hi rend="italic">shôgun</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> their
                    supremacy lasted from 1225 to 1333, through what are commonly called the “seven
                    generations of the Hôjô family." The event of principal importance during this
                    period was the repulse of the Mongol invasion, which occurred in the year 1281.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0610-0583"/> diplomatic negotiations ensued, by which the
                    matter was settled peaceably, and on February 27, 1876, a treaty was concluded
                    in Corea, by two Japanese high commissioners despatched for that purpose.
                    Japanese officials and traders now reside in Corea on precisely the same terms
                    as those on which foreigners have dwelt at the open ports in Japan since
                    1858.</p>
                <p>It could not, of course, be expected that the numerous reforms and changes
                    introduced by the present Government would all be accepted without murmur by the
                    people. Riots have of late years occurred in different parts of the country
                    among the farming classes; and outbreaks of a yet more serious character have
                    been stirred up among the <hi rend="italic">shizoku.</hi> The latter took place
                    chiefly in the western provinces, but were soon quelled. The only one of real
                    magnitude was the insurrection in Satsuma, which broke out in the spring of
                    1877. Excited by various seditious cries, over 10,000 insurgents collected
                    together and marched in a body northwards from Kagoshima. Their avowed object
                    was to make certain representations to the emperor in person. Delaying in their
                    advance to attack the Government garrison stationed in the castle-town of
                    Kumamoto, in Higo, the rebels allowed time for large bodies of troops to be
                    despatched against them from Tôkiô. The scene of action was thus confined to the
                    island of Kiushiu, and after severe fighting, which lasted for several months,
                    the rebels were annihilated, their leaders either dying on the field or
                    committing suicide. This deplorable attempt was, however, useful inasmuch as it
                    proved the strength of the Government; and in view of its complete failure it
                    would seem unlikely that any effort of a similar nature should be made in
                    future. The restoration of the ancient regime has united and strengthened the
                    empire, instead of letting it remain broken up into numberless petty
                    territories, each unlike its neighbours, as was the case under the old feudal
                    system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Language. ·</hi></p>
                <p>The Japanese language is by some philologists thought to have an affinity with
                    the Aryan family; but, as the points of resemblance are very slight and the
                    differences exceedingly great, it is evident that, if there be any affinity at
                    all, the divergence must have taken place at a period when the common ancestor
                    of the Japanese and Aryan tongues was a language exceedingly rude and
                    undeveloped. Nor has any relationship been clearly established with any other
                    language of Asia. Japanese thus stands, as it were, by itself, and. must be
                    regarded as an almost entirely separate tongue.</p>
                <p>Japanese may be considered under the two distinct heads of the spoken and the
                    written languages; the former is the ordinary colloquial, and the latter the
                    more classical style,—of late years to a great degree mixed up with Chinese.
                    According to native historians, the study of the Chinese classics was introduced
                    in 285 A.D.; but this assertion may certainly be questioned, and it seems
                    probable that the actual date was considerably later. At the present day,
                    however, the Chinese characters occupy by far the most important place in the
                    Japanese style of writing.</p>
                <p>The Japanese <hi rend="italic">kana,</hi> or syllabary, consists of forty-seven
                    syllables, viz., <hi rend="italic">i, ro, ha,</hi><hi rend="italic">ni,</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">I</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are frequently almost
                    inaudible; in such cases they have been written <hi rend="italic">ï,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">u.</hi> A final <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> in particular, is very
                    seldom sounded in full. The distinction between long and short vowels, and
                    single and double consonants, demands careful attention, as the meaning often
                    depends upon it. Long vowels generally represent the contraction of two others;
                    thus <hi rend="italic">au</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> becomes in sound <hi
                    rend="italic">6, ii</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and so on. The
                    consonants are pronounced as in English, with the exception of <hi rend="italic"
                    >r, h, f, n, d, t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which differ somewhat from
                    the corresponding English sounds. The true pronunciation of these letters must
                    be learned from a Japanese. In the ease of double consonants, both must be
                    sounded.</p>
                <p>In writing there is a character for each of the forty-seven syllables given
                    above; and each character may be written in either the <hi rend="italic"
                    >katakana</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">hiragana</hi> style. The former is the
                    “square” hand, consisting in each case of a portion of the particular Chinese
                    character whose sound (to the Japanese ear) is most clearly imitated by the
                    sound of the Japanese syllable in question; the latter is the cursive or
                    “running” hand, adapted from the <hi rend="italic">katakana</hi> characters, and
                    having several varying styles. Except by the lower and uneducated classes, these
                    written syllabaries are seldom used in writing letters, &amp;c., unless as mere
                    terminations to be taken in connexion with a Chinese character immediately
                    preceding, as, for instance, to mark the tense of a verb, &amp;c. As in writing
                    the pure Chinese characters, in the letters of the educated class, the “square”
                    and “running” hands are also used, the syllabic characters attached are also,
                    according to circumstances, usually written in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >katakana</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">hiragana</hi> for the sake of
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>The spoken language may be classified under the heads of noun and particles,
                    pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.
                    There is also a distinct class of numerals.</p>
                <p>The nouns have no inflexions to distinguish gender, number, or case, but they are
                    preceded or followed by particles which serve these and other purposes. Except
                    in the case of a few common words, no distinction is made between the masculine
                    and the feminine; when necessary, however, there may be used the prefix <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> or <hi rend="italic">on</hi> for the former, and <hi
                    rend="italic">me</hi> or <hi rend="italic">men</hi> for the latter. The neuter
                    has no prefix at all. In general there is no mark of the plural, but whenever
                    necessary the plural idea may be expressed by the addition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ra, gata, domo, tachi,</hi> or other particles; a few nouns, again, have a kind
                    of plural formed by a repetition of the noun itself. Compound nouns are formed
                    in various ways, the first letter of the second part of such compounds generally
                    changing in sound by the <hi rend="italic">nigori</hi> already noted.</p>
                <p>The personal pronoun does not demand much attention, except as regards that of
                    the second person. Here the word used is different according to the rank or
                    condition of the person or persons addressed. This idea of “honorific” terms is
                    also to be noted in the use of verbs. As a rale, there are three modes of
                    address,— to superiors, to equals and friends, and to inferiors. The plural of
                    personal pronouns is often formed by the addition of the plural particles
                    noticed under the heading of nouns. The personal pronoun is not to be used too
                    frequently in speaking; as a rule, it is not employed by natives except where
                    its omission might cause ambiguity. Possessive pronouns are virtually personal
                    pronouns, with the addition of the possessive particles <hi rend="italic"
                    >no</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ga.</hi> Demonstrative and interrogative pronouns
                    also exist; by the addition of certain particles to the former, the indefinite
                    pronoun is formed. There are but few reflective pronouns, and the relative
                    pronoun does not exist. To express that idea, however, the verb of the relative
                    clause is put before the word to which the relative pronoun refers.</p>
                <p>The adjective may be declined,—the chief part being what may be termed the root,
                    from which (by the addition of certain syllables) various other forms (including
                    the adverb) are obtained. The Japanese adjective has no degrees of comparison,
                    but an idea of comparison can be expressed by the use of certain particles and
                    by turning the sentence in a peculiar way. Many nouns do duty as adjectives, and
                    are often considered such.</p>
                <p>The verb has no means of expressing the distinctions of number or person. In the
                    spoken language there are two conjugations of verbs, in each of which there are
                    four principal parts, viz., the root, the base for negative and future forms,
                    the present indicative, and the base for conditional forms. To each of the
                    principal parts of the verb a number of particles or terminations are annexed;
                    and in this way there are produced forms somewhat similar to the moods and
                    tenses of European grammars. There are, however, a few irregular verbs, in the
                    conjugation of which slight differences are to be noticed. The conjunctions and
                    the interjections are but few in number, and do not call for any special
                    remark.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The student is

                <p>In a sentence the first place is occupied by the nominative case, the second by
                    the objective or other cases, and the last by the verb. The adjective precedes
                    the noun, and the adverb the verb. Prepositions are placed after the nouns to
                    which they refer. Conjunctions and interrogative particles are placed at the end
                    of the clause or sentence to which they belong.</p>
                <p>The above parts of speech are also to be found in use in the written language.
                    Here, however, there is to be noticed a great difference in the inflexions,
                    which are in most cases totally distinct from those used in the ordinary
                    colloquial. Many old expressions and words that have fallen into disuse in
                    conversation are here still retained, and the written language is by far the
                    more classical of the two.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the writing hand at present in use Chinese characters predominate. In official
                    documents, despatches, &amp;c., the square character is commonly used, generally
                    with <hi rend="italic">katakana</hi> terminations. In ordinary letter-writing
                    the cursive hand, more or less abbreviated, is employed, being supplemented,
                    when required, by the <hi rend="italic">hiragana.</hi> The characters, though
                    identical with those used in China, are arranged in different order, so much so
                    that, though the general meaning and sense of a Japanese document might be
                    intelligible to a Chinese, the latter would scarcely be able to give an exact
                    rendering of it. The sounds of the characters are also in most cases entirely
                    different, the Japanese reading them by what is to them the nearest approach to
                    the true Chinese pronunciation. Thus, a final <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n611/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0611-0584"/> Christianity was finally proscribed, a decree of
                    expulsion was directed against the Jesuit missionaries then in Japan, and
                    persecution raged until 1637. In that year the peasantry of a convert district
                    in the province of Hizen, oppressed past endurance by the cruelties to which
                    they were subjected, assembled to the number of 30,000, and fortifying an old
                    feudal castle at the town of Shimabara, declared open defiance to the
                    Government. Iyemitsu, who was then <hi rend="italic">sh6gτm</hi> (1623-1650),
                    despatched an army against them, and after a brief but desperate struggle the
                    Christians were all massacred. These stern measures repressed the profession of
                    the religion, but many clung to it in secret, and several prohibitory edicts
                    were issued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. So lately, indeed, as 1868
                    these proclamations might still be seen on the public notice-boards in every
                    village throughout the country.</p>
                <p>Although the Tokugawa period was not disturbed by the warlike expeditions or
                    civil conflicts from which Japan had until then suffered, there nevertheless
                    existed considerable cause of uneasiness in the numberless intrigues or petty
                    conspiracies which prevailed among the great <hi rend="italic">han</hi> and in
                    the families of the feudal nobles. The question of succession to the
                    chieftainship of a clan not unfrequently stirred up strife amongst the
                    retainers, and in many cases the most unscrupulous means were adopted in order
                    to obtain the desired result. Towards the close of the dynasty several
                    conspiracies were set on foot, but these were promptly stamped out. Japan was
                    now in seclusion from the rest of the world, the inhabitants having been
                    forbidden to leave its shores without express permission under pain of heavy
                    punishments; but the direction of the internal affairs of the country was a task
                    that fully occupied the ruling house. The jealousy and private feuds of the <hi
                    rend="italic">daimiô</hi> increased to such an extent that on several occasions
                    even the sacred precincts of the <hi rend="italic">sh6gun's</hi> palace became
                    the scene of quarrel and bloodshed. The great nobles gradually rebelled more and
                    more against the rule of enforced attendance in Yedo, and became far less
                    disposed to brook the restrictions imposed upon them by a lord who was virtually
                    but one of theiι ’ own class; while to the peasants the feudal system was in
                    most cases exceedingly distasteful. Reaction against the military domination
                    thus set in, and men’s eyes naturally turned towards the renewal of the ancient
                    régime when the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> was the sole sovereign, before
                    whose authority every subject, whether gentle or simple, bowed in submission.
                    These, among other causes, gradually led to the revolution of 1868, by which the
                    <hi rend="italic">mikado's</hi> power was restored. In the meantime, since 1858,
                    treaties had been made by the <hi rend="italic">shôgun'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> ministers with several of the foreign powers, and the foreign element
                    had thus been introduced into Japanese political affairs. By some writers undue
                    stress has been laid upon this fact, as if the advent of Western nations had
                    been the main cause of the downfall of the Tokugawa supremacy. From an attentive
                    perusal, however, of native works treating of political matters for some time
                    previous, it would appear that such was not the case. The decay of the shôgunate
                    bad gradually been going on for years back; the whole system was tottering to
                    its fall, and it is not improbable that even in the total absence of foreigners
                    the revolution would have occurred exactly as it did. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >shôgun</hi> was declared a usurper, and the groat clans of Satsuma, Chôshiu,
                    and Tosa warmly espoused the cause of the <hi rend="italic">mikado.</hi> The
                    Tokugawa clan did not present any very determined front, and the struggle was
                    exceedingly brief. Some fighting, did, however, take place in the vicinity of
                    Kiôto, and also at various points around Yedo; but the m <hi rend="subscript">
                    z</hi> ost severe conflict was the siege of the castle of Wakamatsu, in Oshiu.
                    This castle was the stronghold of the powerful northern <hi rend="italic"
                    >daimiô</hi> of Aidzu, a partisan of the shôgunate; his troops offered a stout
                    resistance, but the place was eventually taken by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mikado's</hi> army after a siege of some two months’ duration. The <hi
                    rend="italic">shôgun</hi> himself had resigned in 1867, and this virtually
                    settled the question in favour of the emperor’s army, although some desultory
                    fighting occurred both at Yedo and near Hakodaté two years afterwards. In 1869
                    the official name of Yedo was changed to Tôkiô (the “eastern capital”), and the
                    <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> removed thither from Kiôto with his court. The
                    ex-iλdgmn retired to the town of Shidzuoka, in the province of Suruga, where he
                    still lives in retirement, his only title being that of a noble of the empire.
                    The ancient form of government was thus restored, and the feudal system is now a
                    thing of the past.</p>
                <p>Since this revolution Japan has become tolerably well known to Europeans.
                    Although her relations with foreign countries were never of any very great
                    importance, they nevertheless commenced at an early date. Allusion has already
                    been made to early Chinese and Corean arrivals in Japan. Dr Kaempfer asserts
                    that in later times young Chinese of good family constantly came to Nagasaki on
                    pleasure excursions. In 201 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the empress Jingô
                    invaded Corea, and gained several victories over the troops that opposed her;
                    and on her return she introduced into Japan the Corean arrangement of
                    geographical division. The Japanese being a maritime nation, it is not
                    surprising that, prior to the edict forbidding them to leave their country, they
                    should have extended their voyages throughout the whole of the Eastern seas. We
                    read of their visiting China, Siam, and India; indeed at one time there existed
                    a Japanese colony or settlement at Goa. It is also known that vessels sailed
                    from Japan to the westem coast of Mexico. The Mongol invasion in 1281 has been
                    already noticed. In the 16th century Europeans approached the shores of Japan.
                    As early as 1542 Portuguese trailing vessels began to visit the empire, and a
                    system of trade by means of barter was carried on. Seven years later three
                    Portuguese missionaries, Xavier, Torres, and Fernandez, took passage in one of
                    these merchant ships, and landed at Kagoshima in Satsuma. The island of Hirado
                    off the coast of Hizen appears to have been then the rendezvous of trade between
                    the two nations. From that time commercial relations continued until the
                    Portuguese were expelled the country in 1639. A second expedition against Corea
                    was undertaken by the <hi rend="italic">taikô</hi> Hidéyoshi in 1592; the
                    Japanese troops not only withdrawn till 1598, and it is interesting to note that
                    a number of Coreans were then brought over to Japan, where they practised the
                    art of making pottery. Descendants of these Coreans still occupy a village iu
                    the province of Satsuma. Towards the end of the 16th century Spanish vessels
                    visited Japan, and in 1602 an embassy was despatched by lyéyasu to the
                    Philippines; but the relations between the two nations were never very close.
                    The Dutch first arrived in 1610, and from that date down to the close of the
                    Tokugawa dynasty they enjoyed almost a monopoly of the Japanese trade. They at
                    first settled in the island of Hirado, but afterwards removed to Nagasaki, where
                    they were virtually imprisoned in their factory on the small peninsula of
                    Deshima in the harbour, connected by narrow causeways with the town itself. Dr
                    Kaempfer’s <hi rend="italic">History of Japan</hi> gives a full and graphic
                    description of the mode of life of the early Dutch settlers; he himself dwelt in
                    Japan during the rule of Tsunayoshi, the fifth <hi rend="italic">shôgun</hi> of
                    the house of Tokugawa, 1680-1709. The first Englishman who visited the shores of
                    Japan was William Adams, a Kentish man, who came out to the East as pilot to a
                    Dutch vessel. He lived in the city of Yedo for a considerable time in the
                    opening years of the 17th century, during which period he is stated to have
                    frequently been at the court of lyéyasu. He instructed the Japanese in the art
                    of shipbuilding, and the title of <hi rend="italic">hatarnolo</hi> was conferred
                    upon him. In 1613 Captain Saris succeeded in founding an English factory in
                    Hirado, but it did not exist, for any length of time. Finally, in 1854,
                    Commodore Perry’s expedition from America took place, when a <hi rend="italic"
                    >quasi</hi> treaty was made between him and the ministers of the shôgunate at
                    Uraga, on the Bay of Yedo; and later in the same year Admira] Stirling concluded
                    a similar negotiation, at Nagasaki, on behalf of Great Britain. In 1858 these
                    treaties were extended, and others were concluded with the Dutch and French,
                    under which the ports of Nagasaki, Hakodate, and Kanagawa (now known as
                    Yokohama) were thrown open to foreign traders belonging to those nationalities,
                    from the year 1859. Other European powers gradually followed the example, and at
                    the present moment Japan is in treaty with no less than eighteen nations, viz.,
                    Austria-Hungary, Belgium, China, Corea, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain,
                    Hawaii, Holland, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
                    the United States. Prior to the recent revolution the foreign treaties were
                    concluded with the ministers of the <hi rend="italic">shôgun,</hi> at Y edo,
                    under the erroneous impression that he was the emperor of Japan. The title of
                    <hi rend="italic">taikun</hi> (often misspelt <hi rend="italic">tycoon)</hi> was
                    then for the first time Used; it means literally the “great rider,” and was
                    employed for the occasion by the Tokugawa officials to convey the impression
                    that their chief was in reality the lord paramount. It is, however, worthy of
                    note that even in these earlier treaties the title corre-ponding to “His
                    Majesty” was neyer assumed by the <hi rend="italic">shôgun.</hi> The actual
                    position of this official remained unknown to the foreign envoys until 1868,
                    when the British, Dutch, and French ministers proceeded to Kioto, and there
                    obtained from the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> his formal ratification of the
                    treaties already concluded with his powerful subject. Since that time all
                    treaties with Western powers are made out in the name of the emperor of Japan.
                    It was thus that the foreigners came prominently into notice at the time of the
                    revolution, with which, however, beyond this they had really no connexion.</p>
                <p>In 1873-4 Japan sent an expedition against the aboriginal tribes inhabiting the
                    island of Formosa, off the eastern coast of China, to demand satisfaction for
                    the murder, some years before, of certain Japanese subjects who had been
                    shipwrecked on that island. Some skirmishing took place, in which the Japanese
                    gained the advantage. The most important point in the whole matter was the
                    negotiation with China. Formosa is Chinese territory, but the Japanese contended
                    that, if the Chinese Government would not exact reparation from the aboriginal
                    tribes, they would themselves attack the latter. This they did, and, although at
                    one period it appeared highly <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> probable that war
                    would be declared between China and Japan, the matter was eventually settled
                    amicably, China paying a sum as indemnity for the outrages complained of.
                    Towards the end of 1875 a dispute arose with Corea, a Japanese gunboat having
                    been fired on from a shore fort while engaged in surveying operations close by
                    the Corean capital. The gunboat returned the fire, and landed a party of men,
                    who attacked and destroyed the fort and stockades, and seized upon the weapons,
                    &amp;c., found in it. Some <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n612/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0612-0585"/> diplomatic negotiations ensued, by which the
                    matter was settled peaceably, and on February 27, 1876, a treaty was concluded
                    in Corea, by two Japanese high commissioners despatched for that purpose.
                    Japanese officials and traders now reside in Corea on precisely the same terms
                    as those on which foreigners have dwelt at the open ports in Japan since
                    1858.</p>
                <p>It could not, of course, be expected that the numerous reforms and changes
                    introduced by the present Government would all be accepted without murmur by the
                    people. Riots have of ]atc years occurred in different parts of the country
                    among the farming classes; and outbreaks of a yet more serious character have
                    been stirred up among the <hi rend="italic">shizoku.</hi> The latter took place
                    chiefly in the western provinces, but were soon quelled. The only one of real
                    magnitude was the insurrection in Satsuma, which broke out in the spring of
                    1877. Excited by various seditious cries, over 10,000 insurgents collected
                    together and marched in a body northwards from Kagoshima. Their avowed object
                    was to make certain representations to the emperor in person. Delaying in their
                    advance to attack the Government garrison stationed in the castle-town of
                    Kumamoto, in Higo, the rebels allowed time for large bodies of troops to be
                    despatched against them from Tôkiô. The scene of action was thus confined to the
                    island of Kiushiu, and after severe fighting, which lasted for several months,
                    the rebels were annihilated, their leaders either dying on the field or
                    committing suicide. This deplorable attempt was, however, useful inasmuch as it
                    proved the strength of the Government; and in view of its complete failure it
                    would seem unlikely that any effort of a similar nature should be made in
                    future. The restoration of the ancient régime has united and strengthened the
                    empire, instead of letting it remain broken up into numberless petty
                    territories, each unlike its neighbours, as was the case under the old feudal
                    system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Language. ·</hi></p>
                <p>The Japanese language is by some philologists thought to have an affinity with
                    the Aryan family; but, as the points of resemblance are very slight and the
                    differences exceedingly great, it is evident that, if there be any affinity at
                    all, the divergence must have taken place at a period when the common ancestor
                    of the Japanese and Aryan tongues was a language exceedingly rude and
                    undeveloped. Nor has any relationship been clearly established with any other
                    language of Asia. Japanese thus stands, as it were, by itself, and-must be
                    regarded as an almost entirely separate tongue.</p>
                <p>Japanese may be considered under the two distinct heads of the spoken and the
                    written languages; the former is the ordinary colloquial, and the latter the
                    more classical style,—of late years to a great degree mixed up with Chinese.
                    According to native historians, the study of the Chinese classics was introduced
                    in 285 A.D.; but this assertion may certainly be questioned, and it seems
                    probable that the actual date was considerably later. At the present day,
                    however, the Chinese characters occupy by far the most important place in the
                    Japanese style of writing.</p>
                <p>The Japanese <hi rend="italic">kann,</hi> or syllabary, consists of forty-seven
                    syllables, viz., <hi rend="italic">i, ro, ha,</hi><hi rend="italic">ni,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ho, he, to, chi, ri, nu, m, wo, wa, ka, yo,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    final. The following modifications of some of these syllables increase the
                    number to seventy-two :— <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    sometimes become <hi rend="italic">b</hi> or <hi rend="italic">p; t</hi> may be

                <p><hi rend="italic">I</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are frequently almost
                    inaudible; in such cases they have been written <hi rend="italic">ï,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">H.</hi> A final <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> in particular, is very
                    seldom sounded in full. The distinction between long and short vowels, and
                    single and double consonants, demands careful attention, as the meaning often
                    depends upon it. Long vowels generally represent the contraction of two others;
                    thus <hi rend="italic">au</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> becomes in sound <hi
                    rend="italic">6, ii</hi> becomes f, and so on. The consonants are pronounced as
                    in English, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">r, h, f, n, d, t,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which differ somewhat from the corresponding English
                    sounds. The true pronunciation of these letters must be learned from a Japanese.
                    In the ease of double consonants, both must be sounded.</p>
                <p>In writing there is a character for each of the forty-seven syllables given
                    above; and each character may be written in either the <hi rend="italic"
                    >katakana</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">hiragana</hi> style. The former is the
                    “square” hand, consisting in each case of a portion of the particular Chinese
                    character whose sound (to the Japanese ear) is most clearly imitated by the
                    sound of the Japanese syllable in question; the latter is the cursive or
                    “running” hand, adapted from the <hi rend="italic">katakana</hi> characters, and
                    having several varying styles. Except by the lower and uneducated classes, these
                    written syllabaries are seldom used in writing letters, &amp;c., unless as mere
                    terminations to be taken in connexion with a Chinese character immediately
                    preceding, as, for instance, to mark the tense of a verb, &amp;c. As in writing
                    the pure Chinese characters, in the letters of the educated class, the “square”
                    and “running” hands are also used, the syllabic characters attached are also,
                    according to circumstances, usually written in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >katakana</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">hiragana</hi> for the sake of
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>The spoken language may be classified under the heads of noun and particles,
                    pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.
                    There is also a distinct class of numerals.</p>
                <p>The nouns have no inflexions to distinguish gender, number, or case, but they are
                    preceded or followed by particles which serve these and other purposes. Except
                    in the case of a few common words, no distinction is made between the masculine
                    and the feminine; when necessary, however, there may be used the prefix <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> or <hi rend="italic">on</hi> for the former, and <hi
                    rend="italic">me</hi> or <hi rend="italic">men</hi> for the latter. The neuter
                    has no prefix at all. In general there is no mark of the plural, but whenever
                    necessary the plural idea may be expressed by the addition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ra, gata, domo, tachi,</hi> or other particles; a few nouns, again, have a kind
                    of plural formed by a repetition of the noun itself. Compound nouns are formed
                    in various ways, the first letter of the second part of such compounds generally
                    changing in sound by the <hi rend="italic">nigori</hi> already noted.</p>
                <p>The personal pronoun does not demand much attention, except as regards that of
                    the second person. Here the word used is different according to the rank or
                    condition of the person or persons addressed. This idea of “honorific” terms is
                    also to be noted in the use of verbs. As a rule, there are three modes of
                    address,— to superiors, to equals and friends, and to inferiors. The plural of
                    personal pronouns is often formed by the addition of the plural particles
                    noticed under the heading of nouns. The personal pronoun is not to be used too
                    frequently in speaking; as a rule, it is not employed by natives except where
                    its omission might cause ambiguity. Possessive pronouns are virtually personal
                    pronouns, with the addition of the possessive particles <hi rend="italic"
                    >no</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ga.</hi> Demonstrative and interrogative pronouns
                    also exist; by the addition of certain particles to the former, the indefinite
                    pronoun is formed. There are but few reflective pronouns, and the relative
                    pronoun does not exist. To express that idea, however, the verb of the relative
                    clause is put before the word to which the relative pronoun refers.</p>
                <p>The adjective may be declined,—the chief part being what may be termed the root,
                    from which (by the addition of certain syllables) various other forms (including
                    the adverb) are obtained. The Japanese adjective has no degrees of comparison,
                    but an idea of comparison can be expressed by the use of certain particles and
                    by turning the sentence in a peculiar way. Many nouns do duty as adjectives, and
                    are often considered such.</p>
                <p>The verb has no means of expressing the distinctions of number or person. In the
                    spoken language there are two conjugations of verbs, in each of which there are
                    four principal parts, viz., the root, the base for negative and future forms,
                    the present indicative, and the base for conditional forms. To each of the
                    principal parts of the verb a number of particles or terminations are annexed;
                    and in this way there are produced forms somewhat similar to the meods and
                    tenses of European grammars. There are, however, a few irregular verbs, in the
                    conjugation of which slight differences are to be noticed. The conjunctions and
                    the interjections are but few in number, and do not call for any special
                    remark.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The student is

                <p>In a sentence the first place is occupied by the nominative case, the second by
                    the objective or other cases, and the last by the verb. The adjective precedes
                    the noun, and the adverb the verb. Prepositions are placed after the nouns to
                    which they refer. Conjunctions and interrogative particles are placed at the end
                    of the clause or sentence to which they belong.</p>
                <p>The above parts of speech are also to be found in use in the written language.
                    Here, however, there is to be noticed a great difference in the inflexions,
                    which are in most cases totally distinct from those used in the ordinary
                    colloquial. Many old expressions and words that have fallen into disuse in
                    conversation are here still retained, and the written language is by far the
                    more classical of the two.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the writing hand at present in use Chinese characters predominate. In official
                    documents, despatches, &amp;c., the square character is commonly used, generally
                    with <hi rend="italic">katakana</hi> terminations. In ordinary letter-writing
                    the cursive hand, more or less abbreviated, is employed, being supplemented,
                    when required, by the <hi rend="italic">hiragana.</hi> The characters, though
                    identical with those used in China, are arranged in different order, so much so
                    that, though the general meaning and sense of a Japanese document might be
                    intelligible to a Chinese, the latter would scarcely be able to give an exact
                    rendering of it. The sounds of the characters are also in most cases entirely
                    different, the Japanese reading them by what is to them the nearest approach to
                    the true Chinese pronunciation. Thus, a final <pb break="no"

                    Chinese is generally rendered in Japanese reading by a long o, while an initial
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not unfrequently changed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >k.</hi> Of late years, since the restoration, there has come into prominent
                    notice an ever-increasing tendency to introduce into ordinary conversation
                    numerous Chinese words that had in many cases been never heard before that time.
                    This style is, of course, affected chiefly by men of letters and by officials,
                    and several successive editions of small dictionaries containing these newly
                    introduced expressions alone have been published at intervals; the increase in
                    bulk of the last edition as compared with the first is very perceptible. A
                    rather stilted style of address has always found favour with the military and
                    literary class; the personal pronoun of the second person being usually rendered
                    by the word <hi rend="italic">sensei,</hi> “teacher,” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >kimi,</hi> “lord.” Intercourse with foreign countries has of late years
                    naturally created a demand for certain words and phrases hitherto unnecessary
                    and consequently unknown, and these have therefore been freshly coined as it
                    were for the occasion. It is worthy of remark that certain European words have
                    for years back been in such common use as to be now deemed actually Japanese.
                    Among these may be mentioned the following :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pan,</hi> bread, derived from the Latin, through the Spanish or
                    Italian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kasutera,</hi> a kind of sponge-cake, an adaptation from the
                    Spanish (Castile). <hi rend="italic">Tabako,</hi> tobacco.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dontaku,</hi> Sunday, derived from the Dutch.</p>
                <p>The English words “minute,” “second” (of time), “ton,” “electric,” &amp;c., are
                    now freely used, the pronunciation being only slightly at fault. Several Malay
                    expressions have also from time to time crept into use; but these are as a rule
                    heard only among the lower classes at the treaty ports.</p>
                <p>Although differences of dialect are distinctly apparent in various localities,
                    these are not by any means so marked as is the case in China. As a rule, a man
                    speaking the pure Yedo dialect might travel through nearly the whole of Japan
                    without experiencing any considerable difficulty; his words would generally be
                    fully understood, though he might now and again be unable to catch the true
                    meaning of the answers he received. In the capital a slight <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> sound is given before the consonant <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> making it
                    almost <hi rend="italic">ng</hi>; and in the case of an initial <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> a slight sibilant is plainly perceptible, giving almost
                    the sound of <hi rend="italic">sh.</hi> The interjection <hi rend="italic"
                    >né</hi> is often heard in the vulgar Yedo dialect; it has no meaning, is little
                    used by men, and serves merely to draw the attention of the person addressed. In
                    the north this <hi rend="italic">né</hi> is changed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >na,</hi> and in other parts of Japan to <hi rend="italic">no.</hi> In most of
                    the northern provinces, and also in the far west, a series of aspirate sounds
                    take almost an initial <hi rend="italic">f</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >h;</hi> it is thus apparent, for instance, why the name of the large island off
                    the coast of Hizen is so often termed <hi rend="italic">Firando</hi> instead of
                    its true name <hi rend="italic">Hirado.</hi> A nasal intonation is very
                    noticeable in Oshiu and other northern districts, particularly in the
                    neighbourhood of Sendai, and this is also heard in the Ozaka dialect. In Ozaka
                    and its vicinity, too, the Yedo <hi rend="italic">né</hi> is rendered by the
                    exclamation <hi rend="italic">sakai∙,</hi> at Kiôto. as might be expected, many
                    of the older forms of expression prevail. The Satsuma dialect presents, perhaps,
                    the greatest difficulty: the letter <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> particularly at
                    the commencement of a word, is replaced by a very decided <hi rend="italic"
                    >j,</hi> and there is a strong tendency to clip off final vowels in all words.
                    This dialect possesses, too, many words peculiar to its own province, so much so
                    indeed that a conversation carried on between two Satsuma men is often all but
                    unintelligible to a native of Tôkiô, although the latter might be able to make
                    himself understood by either of the others.. In 'many couħtry districts also a
                    <hi rend="italic">patois</hi> is used known only to tne peasants, and presenting
                    great difficulty to any Japanese of the better class who comes from a different
                    locality. Even in cases where the word or expression itself is identical, a
                    peculiar intonation or pronunciation so completely disguises it as to convey the
                    impression that it is totally different.</p>
                <p>Reading and writing are often almost unknown in remote districts, and the
                    abstruse Chinese characters are beyond the knowledge of the ordinary Japanese
                    peasant. Some few of the easier characters are used, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kana</hi> supplies the place of the rest; on most of the Government notice
                    boards, &amp;c., and also in the newspapers published for the express benefit of
                    the lower classes, the reading of any Chinese characters used is generally added
                    at the side in <hi rend="italic">kana.</hi> It is only among the better-educated
                    ranks that the Chinese writing is well understood and in common use. The
                    dictionaries used are arranged after the Chinese style, each character being
                    looked out, according to the number of strokes contained in it, under its proper
                    radical. The list of radicals is the same as in China, and they are always
                    printed in regular index form at the commencement of the dictionary. At the side
                    of each character in the work is placed the Japanese attempt at the rendering of
                    the true Chinese sound, and underneath is given the meaning in Japanese
                    colloquial. There are special dictionaries for the running hand. This style
                    consists of the ordinary cursive hand, which is not as a rule very unlike the
                    square hand, and also of what is termed the “grass” hand, which is very much
                    abbreviated and exceedingly difficult to acquire. Unless the square hand of a
                    particular “grass” character be known, it is often wholly impossible to look it
                    up in a dictionary. The pens and ink used in writing are precisely the same as
                    the Chinese; the lines of writing are perpendicular, and are read downwards,
                    commencing with the column to the extreme right of the reader. The beginning of
                    a Japanese book is thus where our volumes end. The paper used for letters is
                    thin, and in rolls, the written part being torn off when the note is finished;
                    for official despatches large ruled sheets of superior paper are now in fashion.
                    The signature of the writer is always placed at the foot of the page, while the
                    name of the person addressed is written near the top, with some honorific title
                    appended to it. Whenever the title of the sovereign occurs in an official
                    document, it is either placed as the first character in a fresh column, or else
                    a small space, generally of size sufficient to contain one character, is left
                    vacant immediately above it. In a letter numerous honorifics are used, and these
                    serve to distinguish the second person; in speaking of himself the writer omits
                    these, and sometimes also writes the characters in a rather smaller hand and
                    slightly towards the side of the column instead of in the centre. This is of
                    course done in affectation of humility, and is a truly Asiatic idea. The
                    honorific expressions applied only to the <hi rend="italic">mikado</hi> himself
                    would suffice to compose a small glossary; some of these are exceedingly
                    flowery, as, for instance, the “Phoenix Car,” the “Dragon Chariot,” the
                    “Jewelled Throne,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The language of the Aino tribes in the island of Yezo is totally distinct from
                    the pure Japanese tongue. There does not as yet exist any satisfactory
                    dictionary to throw light upon it, and it can now only be regarded as a kind of
                    local <hi rend="italic">patois,</hi> intelligible to the Ainos alone. Whether
                    this be the descendant of the most ancient form of speech amongst the
                    inhabitants of Japan, it is impossible to conjecture. It does not in sound
                    resemble pure Japanese, being guttural, and spoken in a much lower key.</p>
                <p>The natives of the Riukiu group also possess a language of their own, but this
                    does not differ in any great degree from Japanese. Many of the persons of the
                    better classes speak Japanese with perfect correctness, and it is also stated
                    that the higher officials are acquainted with the court dialect of China. The
                    Riukiu tongue may be described as nothing more than a very strongly marked
                    dialect of Japanese, and in it there are still preserved many words long since
                    obsolete in Japan itself. In writing, the Chinese characters are chiefly
                    used.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The scientific

                <p>Literature in Japan has of late years received far more attention and careful
                    study than in ancient times, if we are to judge by the multitude of recently
                    published books as compared with those existing even less than a century ago.
                    The introduction of printing presses with movable type has no doubt been the
                    principal cause of this; wooden blocks were in use far earlier, but it was a
                    work of great labour to prepare them; and, as only a certain number of copies
                    could be struck from them, in the case of any work much sought after the demand
                    very soon exceeded the supply. As many of the old manuscripts have been set up
                    in type and published in the modern style, there is no great difficulty in
                    procuring specimens of the ancient literature.</p>
                <p>In the earliest times Kioto was the principal if not almost the only seat of
                    learning and literature in Japan. Interminable wars and feuds kept the
                    inhabitants of the eastern portion of the empire too fully occupied with
                    military affairs to allow of their being able to engage in more learned and
                    peaceful pursuits, even had they so wished. The court of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mikado</hi> at Kioto enjoyed a far more tranquil existence, and the nobles
                    composing that court devoted themselves with zest to literary pursuits. Poetry
                    was by them held in high honour, and received perhaps the greater share of their
                    attention; but the writing of diaries seems also to have been a favourite
                    occupation, and examples of these, still extant, afford a very interesting
                    insight into the mode of life then prevalent at the court and in the
                    neighbourhood of Kiôto.</p>
                <p>The ancient literature of Japan contains but few works of a popular character.
                    Almost everything then composed that is still extant was written by and for the
                    members of the learned circle around the court, and was thus exclusively adapted
                    to the minds of the Well-read and highly educated class. Later on, in the 10th
                    century, when the learned were devoted chiefly to the study of Chinese, the
                    cultivation of the Japanese language was in a great measure abandoned to the
                    ladies of the court. A very large proportion of the best writings of the best
                    age of Japanese literature was the work of women; and the names of numerous
                    poetesses and authoresses are quoted with admiration even at the present
                    time.</p>

                <p>The earliest of the extant Japanese records is a work entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kojiki,</hi> or “Record of Ancient Matters,” commonly asserted to
                    date from the year 711. Prior to that time, in 620 and again in 681, two other
                    works treating of ancient Japanese history are said to have been compiled, but
                    neither has been preserved. The emperor Temmu (673-686 A.D.), according to the
                    preface to the <hi rend="italic">Kojiki,</hi> resolved to take measures to
                    preserve the true traditions from oblivion, and he therefore had all the records
                    then existing carefully examined, compared, and purged of their faults. Their
                    contents were then committed to memory by a person in the imperial household,
                    named Hiyeda no Are. Before this record could be reduced to writing, the emperor
                    died, and for twenty-five years Are’s memory was the sole depository of what
                    afterwards became the <hi rend="italic">Kojiki.</hi> At the end of this interval
                    the empress Gemmiô (708-715) commanded one of her ministers to write it down
                    from the mouth of Are, and the work was thus completed at the end of the year
                    711. Soon after this, in 720, another work was completed entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nihongi,</hi> or “Japanese Record,” which is said to have so far
                    superseded the <hi rend="italic">Kojiki</hi> that the latter was almost
                    forgotten. The <hi rend="italic">Nihongi,</hi> like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kojiki,</hi> appeared during the reign of an empress (Genshô, 715— 723), and
                    the yet earlier work of the year 620 was commenced under the auspices of the
                    empress Suiko (593- 628); the person called Are is also by some supposed to have
                    been a woman. The <hi rend="italic">Kojiki</hi> is to a very large extent pure
                    Japanese, while in the <hi rend="italic">Nihongi</hi> there are to be found
                    numerous traces of direct Chinese influence: the chief object of the one was to
                    preserve the form and spirit of Japanese antiquity, while the other rather fell
                    in with the growing adoption of Chinese ideas. Both Works may be described as
                    ancient histories, purporting to commence from the “divine age” and the very
                    origin of all things, and replete with allusions to Japanese cosmogony and
                    legends of antiquity; they are held to be the chief exponents of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shintô</hi> faith, or “way of the gods.” They formed a basis for
                    many subsequent works of almost similar style, and were the subject of numerous
                    commentaries. Of these latter writings the one demanding special mention is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kojiki-den,</hi> an edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kojiki</hi> with an elaborate commentary by a renowned scholar named Motoori
                    Norinaga, who lived during the 18th century. It was commenced in 1764, but the
                    first part was not completed until 1786; the second was finished in 1792, and
                    the concluding portion in 1796. The printing of this great work was begun in
                    1789, and concluded in 1822, Motoori himself having died in 1801.<note

                <p>F&lt;rcmost among the later Japanese historical works is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baini-honshi,</hi> or “History of Great Japan,” in two hundred and forty books.
                    This was composed under the direction of one of lyéyasu’s grandsons, the famous
                    second lord of Mito (1622-1700), commonly known as Mito no Kδmon sama. This
                    illustrious noble was a noted patron of literature, and collected a vast library
                    by purchasing old books from various temples or shrines and from the people. At
                    the old castle-town of Mito (in the province of Hitachi) there are still pointed
                    out the rains of this noble’s library buildings, situated for greater safety <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> within the castle moat, hard by the palace. Tradition
                    says that among the numerous scholars who aided the lord of Mito in compiling
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dainihonshi</hi> there were several learned Chinese who
                    had fled to Japan from the tyranny of their Manchu conquerors. This book is the
                    standard history of Japan to the present day, and all subsequent writers on the
                    same subject have taken it as their guide. Of all the succeeding histories the
                    most worthy of note is the <hi rend="italic">Nihon Guaishi,</hi> or “External
                    History of Japan,” by an author named Rai Sanyo (born 1780, died 1832), who also
                    composed several other works, all of them in classical Chinese. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Guaishi</hi> is the most widely read, and forms the chief source
                    from which Japanese men of education derive their knowledge of the history of
                    their own country. It was first published in 1827, and numbers twenty-two
                    volumes; the author was occupied for no less than twenty years in its
                    composition; and ne appends a list of two hundred and fifty-nine Japanese and
                    Chinese works from which he drew his materials. The book treats, in order, of
                    the great families that held supremacy after the commencement of the military
                    domination and the decadence of the <hi rend="italic">mikado’s</hi> authority,
                    and thus introduces the reader to the Taira, Minamoto, Hôjô, Kusunoki, Nitta,
                    Ashikaga, later Hôjô, Takeda, Uyésugi, Môri, Ota, Toyotomi, and Tokugawa houses.
                    Many of these sections are necessarily very short, as they treat of only’ one or
                    perhaps two generations, but the records of the chief clans are of considerable
                    length. The writer invariably identifies himself with the particular family in
                    each case, and thus the transactions of two or more factions who strove together
                    for the supreme power at certain epochs have to be detailed twice or even
                    thrice, each time from a different point of view and with varied colouring. The
                    whole period thus rehearsed extends from the middle of the 12th century to the
                    beginning of the 18th. Many other historical works exist, written in less
                    learned style, and adapted for popular reading and the instraction of young
                    students. The <hi rend="italic">Gempci Seiβuiki, or</hi> “Record of the Rise and
                    Fall of the <hi rend="italic">Gen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">HeH</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> is a noteworthy specimen of its class; it
                    treats only of the two rival clans of Minamoto and Taira, and of the deeds and
                    feats of arms performed by the heroes on both sides. Most of these popular
                    histories are illustrated by woodcuts, in many cases taken from portraits,
                    &amp;c., in ancient scrolls or paintings.</p>
                <p>Poetry having always been a favourite study, it is not surprising that there
                    should exist numerous volumes of verses either written or collected by the old
                    court nobles. Of these the most ancient is the <hi rend="italic">Many6shiu,</hi>
                    or “Collection of a Myriad Leaves,” which dates probably fro∏ι early in the 8th
                    century. But this work, notwithstanding its great antiquity, is perhaps less
                    familiar to the Japanese than the <hi rend="italic">Hiakuninshiu,</hi> or
                    “Collection of One Hundred Persons,” which appeared considerably later, and
                    includes some pieces written by emperors themselves. This was followed by almost
                    numberless minor volumes of the same kind. Verse-making attained to such favour
                    that it was a usual custom for one of the nobles to invito together several of
                    his friends noted for their scholarship, solely for the purpose of passing away
                    the time in this occupation. The collections thus obtained were either kept in
                    the original manuscript or printed for convenience. The verses were in nearly
                    all cases in the style known as <hi rend="italic">uta,</hi> which may be
                    described as the purer Japanese ode as opposed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shi,</hi> or style of Chinese poetry introduced in later years, and much
                    affected by men of learning. The <hi rend="italic">uta</hi> usually consists of
                    thirty-one syllables, the arrangement being in what may be called 5 lines,
                    containing 5, 7, 5, 7, and 7 syllables respectively. The meaning is continuous,
                    though there is often a slight break at the end of the third line, what follows
                    being in antithesis to what has gone before, or a fresh simile with identical
                    meaning but a varied expression. Thus if the position of the two portions of the
                    whole <hi rend="italic">uta</hi> be reversed, the meaning is generally in no way
                    altered. Each <hi rend="italic">uta</hi> is complete in itself, and expresses
                    one single idea. The Japanese do not possess any great epics, or any didactic
                    poems, though some of their lyrics are happy examples of quaint ways of thought
                    and modes of expression. It is, however, a hard task to .translate them into a
                    foreign tongue with any hope of giving an exact rendering of the allusions
                    contained in the original.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See the masterly treatise on this subject, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Classical Poetry of the Japanese,</hi> by B. H. Chamberlain, London,
                    1880.</p></note> The <hi rend="italic">uta</hi> are often inscribed on long
                    strips of variegated paper; and it is even now a common practice, when offering
                    a present, to send with it a verse composed for the occasion by the donor.
                    Again, even down to very recent times, when a man had determined to commit
                    suicide, or was about to hazard his life in some dangerous enterprise, it was by
                    no means uncommon for him to compose and leave behind him a verse descriptive of
                    h’s intention and of the motive urging him to the deed. It is stated in Japanese
                    histories that Sanétomo, the third and last <hi rend="italic">shôgun</hi> of the
                    Minamoto house, was so .extravagantly fond of poetry that any criminal could
                    escape pujιishment by offering him a stanza.</p>
                <p>Probably the largest section of Japanese literature is that treating of the local
                    geography of the country itself. The works on this subject are exceedingly
                    numerous, and include guide-books, itineraries, maps and plans, notes on
                    celebrated localities, &amp;c. In most cases only one particular province or
                    neighbourhood forms ti e subject of the one book, but as very minute details are
                    usually given these works are often of considerable length. Every province in
                    Japan possesses many scenes of historic interest, and can boast of ancient
                    temples, monuments, and other memorials of the past (this is especially the case
                    in those lying immediately around Kiôto or Tôkiô); and it is to preserve and
                    hand down the old traditions relating to them that these guides to celebrated
                    localities have been compiled. They have much resemblance to the county
                    histories in England. Although mainly geographical, they contain no
                    inconsiderable store of historical information, which, as a rule, is printed at
                    the head of each section. The traveller can thus ascertain without difficulty
                    the names of the principal villages, rivers, hills, &amp;c., and can decide what
                    temples, shrines, or monuments along his route are worthy of a visit. Inns,
                    ferries, lodging-houses, &amp;c., receive particular attention. The Japanese
                    maps are not, as a whole, very correct; the greater part are struck from wooden
                    blocks, copperplate engraving having been but lately introduced. Many of the
                    sheets are coloured. The roads are laid down with some degree of care, and
                    distinctive marks are allotted to the former castle-towns, the post-towns, and
                    the minor villages; the distance from one town to its nearest neighbour is
                    usually added in small characters along the line indicating the road. Very few
                    maps include the whole of the country; most of them show only a few provinces,
                    and some consist of a series of engravings, each plate being devoted to a single
                    province. Plans of all the cities and of the larger towns are easily procured,
                    and these are drawn for the most part very correctly; there are also road-books
                    of the chief highways showing simply the towns, rivers, &amp;c., along the route
                    in question, much used by travellers in the interior.</p>
                <p>There are not many works on art, though there have been pub lished several
                    collections of engravings from drawings by famous Japanese painters. Of late
                    years, however, some slight impetus has been given to this branch of literature,
                    and many of the older <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0615-0588"/> editions have been reprinted. Some works on
                    ancient pottery and other antiquities have also appeared.</p>
                <p>The drama does not hold in Japan the position it enjoys in European countries. No
                    classic author such as Shakespeare was ever known, and the pieces represented on
                    the stage are as a rule of a popular character. The style of these plays is
                    often rather stilted, a large number of ancient and almost obsolete words and
                    expressions being used; but the ordinary farces and light. pieces are in the
                    everyday colloquial. Theatre-going is a favourite amusement, especially among
                    the lower classes in the larger towns.</p>
                <p>The growth of the newspaper press during the past few years deserves special
                    attention. At the period of the recent revolution there existed but one
                    publication that could be properly classed under this head,—the so-called
                    “Government Gazette,” which was read only by the official class, for whom alone
                    its contents possessed any interest. But since then so many newspapers have come
                    into existence that the list for the whole country now comprises several
                    hundreds. In the chief cities they are issued daily, in country districts every
                    two or three days or only once a week. The Tôkiô papers have the widest
                    circulation, and are forwarded even to the most remote post-towns. Among these
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nichi-nichi Shimbun</hi> ( ‘ ‘ Daily News ”), the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ch6ya Shimbun</hi> ( ‘ ’ Court and Country News”), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">H6chi Shimbun</hi> (“Information News”) are perhaps the best
                    known; the first-named is a semi-official organ. These journals appear on every
                    day except holidays. They are all similar in style: the first page contains
                    Government notifications and a leading article, the second miscellaneous items
                    of information, and the third contributed articles, sometimes of a political but
                    offener of a popular or satirical character, while the fourth page is devoted to
                    advertisements. The papers are chiefly printed from movable metal type. The
                    style of composition is principally Chinese, interspersed with <hi rend="italic"
                    >kana</hi> at intervals; but the papers published for the express benefit of the
                    very low classes are almost entirely in <hi rend="italic">kana,</hi> and are in
                    many cases illustrated by rough woodcuts. Freedom of the press is as yet
                    unknown, and many an editor has been fined or imprisoned for publishing what was
                    deemed by the officials an infraction of the press laws recently notified. These
                    laws are in some respects very stringent, and the newspaper press is in no
                    slight degree trammelled by them. Before a paper is started, a petition
                    requesting the permission of Government must be sent in, and a promise made that
                    if such permission be granted the press laws shall be strictly obeyed. The
                    paper, once it is started, is under the supervision of the local officials, and
                    whatever they may deem to be a contravention of the laws in question is punished
                    by fine, imprisonment, or suspension or total abolition of the offending
                    journal. It is needless to point out that under this system anything like free
                    and open criticism of the proceedings of Government is well nigh impossible,
                    although ingenious plans have been contrived, whereby, though keeping within the
                    actual letter of the law, the editor can proclaim his true views on the subject
                    under discussion. A very common method is to draw a satirical picture of Japan
                    under the name of some other country. The bonds imposed by the Government are
                    felt to be galling, and perfect freedom of the press would be hailed with
                    delight by the exceedingly large and influential class interested in the
                    maintenance and publication of this kind of literature.</p>
                <p>Another large section consists of romances or novels, some of considerable
                    length. In many instances the fiction is woven in with a certain degree of
                    historical fact, as, for instance, in following the supposed adventures of some
                    noble’s retainer, during one of the campaigns of the mediaeval civil wars. In
                    these, as in European works of the same description, the reader is generally
                    introduced to a hero and heroine, whose thrilling adventures are described in
                    graphic terms. Pretty little fairy-tales also abound, and short story-books with
                    small woodcuts fill every bookstall in the streets. Many of these are entirely
                    written in <hi rend="italic">kana,</hi> and, the prices being very moderate,
                    they are within the reach of even the lowest classes. Unfortunately, hardly any
                    of these popular works would bear translation into a foreign language.
                    Children’s toy books, illustrated with large and gaudy pictures in colours, and
                    representing chiefly the warlike heroes of ancient days or the noted actors of
                    modern times, complete the final section of the very interesting literature of
                    Japan. (T. M‘C.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi></p>
                <p>The range of Japanese art, its origin, and its progress, in connexion with some
                    of its most characteristic features, cannot fail to interest all true lovers of
                    art, especially as applied to industries and manufactures. In this latter
                    category should be placed all those applications of art “in the vast and
                    diversified region of human life and action,” to quote Mr Gladstone’s words,
                    “where a distinct purpose of utility is pursued, and where the instrument
                    employed aspires to an outward form of beauty,”—in which consists “the great
                    mass and substance of the <hi rend="italic">Kunst-Leben,</hi> the art-life of a
                    people.” As it is within these limits that art has taken its chief development
                    in Japan it is in this respect more especially that some account will be given
                    here of its leading characters and principles.</p>
                <p>If art in its application to purposes of utility may be taken as the first stage
                    in all countries towards the higher art more especially appealing to tire
                    imaginative and intellectual faculties, the degree of perfection attained by any
                    nation in this first <hi rend="italic">Kunst-Leben</hi> must be taken into
                    account in judging of their artistic power and capabilities. Viewed in this
                    light, it is not too much to say that no nation in ancient or modern times has
                    been richer in <hi rend="italic">Art-motifs</hi> and original types than the
                    Japanese. They undoubtedly have the merit of having created one of the few
                    original schools of decorative art handed down to us from past ages,—a school
                    uninfluenced by any foreign admixture, if we except the first rudiments of all
                    their arts and industries, derived in remote periods from their more advanced
                    neighbours the Chinese, but from that time left to native influences and powers
                    of development. A strangely constituted race, unlike even the Chinese, from whom
                    in fact they may have descended, voluntarily maintaining an isolated state for a
                    long succession of centuries, the Japanese nation has grown up under the
                    circumstances best adapted to produce originality, and the “insular pride” so
                    natural in their isolated position among a group of islands in the Pacific
                    Ocean. Thus left to themselves, the genius of the race has led them rather to
                    direct their efforts to confer beauty on objects of common utility and materials
                    of the lowest value than to create masterpieces of art to be immured in palaces
                    or only exhibited in museums. The faculty of making common and familiar things
                    tell pleasurably upon the ordinary mind, by little artistic surprises and fresh
                    interpretations of the common aspects of natural objects and scenes, is
                    specially their gift, and a gift as valuable as it is rare. It is from this
                    standpoint that the art of Japan should be viewed for a right appreciation of
                    its claims to admiration, and for the proper application of the lesson it
                    conveys to art-workmen and manufacturers of objects of utility.</p>
                <p>Previous to the London International Exhibition of 1862 Japan had in fact been a
                    sealed book to the Western world, save in so far as a small collection of
                    industrial and natural products of the country to be seen at the Hague' could
                    afford information. The Portuguese <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Macao, and later
                    the Dutch traders allowed to occupy a factory at Nagasaki in Japan in the 17th
                    and 18th centuries, were in the habit of shipping a few articles for Europe, of
                    utilitarian rather than ornamental character. These consisted chiefly of dinner
                    services of porcelain made to order after European models—known as “Old
                    Japan”—with heavy gilding and staring colours, as unlike any native work as can
                    well be imagined. Lacquered cabinets and large coffers or chests of rough
                    workmanship also found their way to Europe, and some of these are still
                    occasionally to be met with in old country houses or curiosity shops, both in
                    England and on the continent. When the London exhibition, therefore, made its
                    display in the ‘ ‘ Japanese court,” followed, as this was, by a great exhibition
                    in Paris in 1867 and in Vienna in 1875, the Japanese contributions to which were
                    carefully selected on a large scale by the Japanese Government itself, the rich
                    treasures of art-work came upon Europe as a new revelation in decorative and
                    industrial arts, and have continued since to exercise a strong and abiding
                    influence on all industrial art-work. In London, as in every Continental
                    capital, specimens of Japanese manufacture in great variety speedily followed in
                    the shop windows; and large importations, taking place almost monthly at depôts
                    in London, are speedily bought up to be distributed over the country, and sold
                    in retail. In the International Exhibition of Paris in 1878, the “Japanese
                    court” again presented a matchless collection of perfect workmanship and design
                    in every variety of material In textile fabrics, such as silks, gauzes, crapes,
                    and embroidery; in bronzes, cloisonnes, champlevé, repoussé, inlaid and
                    damascened work; in art-pottery, faience, and porcelain; and in lacquer and
                    carved wood and ivory,—there was a bewildering variety; but only one opinion
                    prevailed as to the palm of superiority due to them. The inferiority of most of
                    the articles of the same class exhibited in the adjoining “Chinese court,” which
                    from its close proximity provoked while it afforded every facility for a close
                    comparison, was very marked. If other test of excellence were needed, it is
                    amply supplied by the flattery of imitation; though the mischief of merely
                    copying Japanese art work, without any knowledge of the history, religion,
                    popular legends, or the artistic tastes which inspire the workman in Japan, is
                    obvious in the vulgarized reproductions and the incongruous combinations now so
                    common. They may be <hi rend="italic">Japanesque,</hi> but they are certainly
                    not Japanese in spirit, feeling, or execution. Defects are exaggerated, and
                    excellences are lost sight of altogether.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding with a general survey of the most characteristic features of
                    Japanese art, it may be useful for purposes of reference to give a list of
                    English works that have appeared in recent years on this subject. Mr John
                    Leighton in the spring of 1863 was the first to draw public attention to the
                    collection of Japanese objects in the exhibition of 1862 and their artistic
                    merit, by a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, which was afterwards
                    printed. Dr C. Dresser, in his <hi rend="italic">Art of Decorative Design,</hi>
                    published his opinion that Japan could “supply the world with the most beautiful
                    domestic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0616-0589"/> articles that we can anywhere procure”; and both
                    in that work and in another entitled <hi rend="italic">Unity in Variety, as
                    deduced from the Vegetable Kingdom,</hi> he makes particular reference to
                    Japanese decorative work. A series of articles on “Art and Art Industries in
                    Japan,” which appeared in <hi rend="italic">the Art Journal</hi> in 1875-76,
                    were published, with considerable additions, in a single volume in 1878. About
                    the same time two works appeared on the same subject, J. J. Jarves’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Glimpse at the Art of Japan</hi> (1876) and Messrs Audsley &amp;
                    Bowes’s <hi rend="italic">Keramic Art of Japan</hi> (1875-80). A fourth work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Fugaku Hiyaku-Kei, or a Hundred Views of
                    Fusiyama,</hi> by Hokusai, with introductory and explanatory prefaces from the
                    Japanese, and descriptions of the plates by J. V. Dickins of the Middle Temple,
                    reproduces facsimile plates of the original collection of this celebrated native
                    artist, and even to the paper and form of the thin volumes is a perfect
                    counterpart of the original work as published in Japan. Lastly, there has
                    appeared a valuable contribution to our materials for an intelligent judgment,
                    in Thomas Cutler’s <hi rend="italic">Grammar of Japanese Ornament and
                    Design</hi> (1881). The plates, exceeding sixty in number, are preceded by a
                    carefully written introductory essay, giving a discriminative survey of the
                    chief art-industries and the principles of Japanese ornamentation.</p>
                <p>Art in Japan, it has been well observed, “is not, as in Europe, the grafting of
                    one style upon another, and the accumulated knowledge of all the various schools
                    from the remotest antiquity.” It has been a growth unaffected by any extraneous
                    influences, self-contained and strictly national, and hence the astonishment and
                    delight created when the art of Japan was first revealed to the outside world.
                    It is in comparing the decorative art of Japan with that of China that we see
                    how far the former has distanced its early Chinese masters, and how thoroughly
                    it has produced a school peculiarly its own. Commenting on its application to
                    ceramic ware, lacquer, bronzes, textile fabrics, &amp;c., Mr Cutler has well
                    remarked, “if we study the decorative art of the Japanese, we find the essential
                    elements of beauty in design, fitness for the purpose which the object is
                    intended to fulfil, good workmanship, and constructive soundness, which give a
                    value to the commonest article, and some touch of ornament by a skilful hand,
                    together creating a true work of art.”</p>
                <p>The school of art due to the native genius of the Japanese as a race is
                    essentially decorative, and, in its application, to a great degree purely
                    industrial. Pictorial art as understood in Europe can hardly be said to have any
                    existence in Japan. Most of their decorative designs consist of natural objects
                    treated in a conventional way. This conventionalism is, however, so perfect and
                    free in its allurements that nature seems to suggest both the motive and the
                    treatment. Though neither botanically nor ornithologically correct, their
                    flowers and their birds show a truth to nature, and a habit of minute
                    observation in the artist, which cannot be too much admired. Every blade of
                    grass, each leaf and feather, has been the object of loving and patient study.
                    It has been rashly assumed by some of the writers on Japanese art that the
                    Japanese do not study from nature. All their work is an emphatic protest against
                    so erroneous a supposition. It is impossible to examine even the inferior kind
                    of work without seeing evidences of minute and faithful study. It can in fact be
                    shown conclusively that the Japanese have derived all their fundamental ideas of
                    symmetry, so different from ours, from a close study of nature and her processes
                    in the attainment of endless variety.</p>
                <p>It is a special feature in their art that, while often closely and minutely
                    imitating natural objects, such as birds, flowers, and fishes, the especial
                    objects of their predilection and study, they frequently combine the facts of
                    external nature with a conventional mode of treatment better suited to their
                    purpose. During the long apprenticeship the Japanese serve to acquire the power
                    of writing with the brush the thousand complicated characters borrowed from the
                    Chinese, they unconsciously cultivate the habit of minute observation and the
                    power of accurate imitation, and with these a delicacy of touch and freedom of
                    hand which only long practice could give. A hair’s breadth deviation of a line,
                    or the slight inclination of a dot or an angle, is fatal to good caligraphy,
                    both among the Chinese and the Japanese. When they come to use the pencil
                    therefore in drawing, they are possessed of the finest instruments in accuracy
                    of eye and free command of the brush. Whether a Japanese art worker sets himself
                    to copy what he sees before him or to give play to his fancy in combining what
                    he has seen with some ideal in his mind, the result equally shows a perfect
                    facility of execution and easy grace in all the lines.</p>
                <p>In their methods of ornamentation the Japanese treat every object flatly, as do
                    their Chinese masters to this day, and this to a certain extent has tended to
                    check any progress in pictorial art, though they have obtained other and very
                    admirable decorative effects. Without being, as Mr Cutler, in common with some
                    other writers, assumes, ignorant of chiaroscuro, or the play of light and
                    shadow, it is true that they usually, though not invariably, paint in flat tones
                    as on a vase, and so dispense with both. It is not a picture so much as a
                    decoration that they produce, but it is a decoration full of beauty in its
                    harmonized tints and graceful freedom of design. The delicacy of touch is
                    everywhere seen, whether bird or leaf or flower or all combined be chosen as the
                    subject. The Japanese artist especially excels in conveying an idea of motion in
                    the swift flight of birds and gliding movements of fishes, one of the most
                    difficult triumphs of art.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the golden age of Japanese art is over and gone, and that
                    the conditions no longer exist, and can never be renewed, under which it has
                    developed its most characteristic excellences. A feudal state, in which the
                    artist and the workman were generally one and the same person, or at least in
                    the same feudal relation to a chief who was bound to support them working or
                    idle, and took pride in counting among his subjects or serfs those who could
                    most excel in producing objects of great beauty and artistic value, is a
                    condition as little likely to return in Japan as the former isolation and
                    freedom from all foreign influences of the people. Under these altered
                    circumstances it is to be feared that Japanese art has culminated, and shown the
                    best of which it is capable. But if the hour of decadence has arrived, and a
                    deterioration of taste inevitably set in, by an intermixture of foreign and
                    debasing influences overlaying original thought and <hi rend="italic"
                    >motifs,</hi> and leading to imitations of European vulgarities, we have the
                    more reason to be grateful to those who, like Messrs Bowes &amp; Audsley and Mr
                    Cutler, have undertaken to preserve by costly and faithful examples works
                    produced in the most brilliant period in the life of a singularly gifted people.
                    One of the characteristic features of all Japanese art is individuality of
                    character in the treatment, by which the absence of all uniformity and monotony
                    or sameness is secured. Repetition without any variation is abhorrent to every
                    Japanese. He will not tolerate the stagnation and tedium of a dull uniformity by
                    mechanical reproduction. His temperament will not let him endure the labour of
                    always producing the same pattern. Hence the repetition of two articles the
                    exact copy of each other, and, generally, the diametrical division of any space
                    into equal parts, are instinctively avoided,—as nature avoids the production of
                    any two plants, or even any two leaves of the same tree, which in all points
                    shall be exactly alike. The application of this principle in the same free
                    spirit is the secret of much of the originality and the excellence of the art of
                    Japan. Its artists and artisans alike aim at symmetry, not by an equal division
                    of parts as we do, but rather by a certain balance of corresponding parts, each
                    different from the other, and not numerically even, with an effect of variety
                    and freedom from formality. They seek it in fact, as nature attains the same
                    end. If we take for instance the skins of animals that are striped or spotted,
                    we have the best possible illustration of nature’s methods in this direction.
                    Examining the tiger or the leopard, in all the beauty of their symmetrical
                    adornment, we do not see in any one example an exact repetition of the same
                    lines or spots on each side of the mesial line of the spine. They seem to be
                    alike, and yet are all different. The line of division along the spine, it will
                    be observed, is not perfectly continuous or defined, but in part suggested; and
                    each radiating stripe on either side is full of variety— in size, direction, and
                    to some extent in colour and depth of shade. Thus nature works, and so following
                    in her footsteps works the Japanese artist. The same law prevailing in all
                    nature’s creation, in the plumage of birds, the painting of butterflies’ wings,
                    the marking of shells, and in all the infinite variety and beauty of the floral
                    kingdom, the lesson is constantly renewed to the observant eye.</p>
                <p>Among flowers the whole family of orchids, with all their fantastic extravagance
                    and mimic imitations of birds and insects, is especially prolific in examples of
                    symmetrical effects without any repetition of similar parts or divisions into
                    even numbers. We may take any one of this class almost at random for a perfect
                    illustration. The <hi rend="italic">Oncidium leucochilum</hi> is by no means the
                    most eccentric or <hi rend="italic">baroque</hi> member of the family of
                    orchids. But in its uneven number of similar parts, and the variety in form and
                    colour by which a symmetrical whole is produced, there is nothing left to be
                    desired. The sepals are nearly alike, but not quite, either in size, shape, or
                    colour-marking. These are balanced, not by three, but by two petals, which match
                    each other, but are broader and more ovate in shape than the sepals, and,
                    instead of being barred and spotted like the sepals, they are broadly painted to
                    about half their length with a deep chestnut colour; and, while the lip rising
                    from the centre is pure white and wholly different in form, texture, and colour,
                    the crest rising from the base with tubercles is yellowish, with patches of
                    reddish-brown.</p>
                <p>This assemblage of parts, so diverse in form, number, and colour, nevertheless
                    forms a single flower of exceeding beauty and symmetry, affording the strongest
                    contrasts and the greatest variety imaginable, such as delight the Japanese
                    artist’s mind. The orchids may be taken as offering fair types of his ideal in
                    all art work. And thus, close student of nature’s processes, methods, and effect
                    s as the Japanese art workman is, he ever seeks to produce humble replicas from
                    his only art master. Thus may we understand how he proceeds in all his
                    decorative work, avoiding studiously the exact repetition of any lines and
                    spaces, and all diametrical divisions, cr, if these be forced upon him by the
                    shape of the object, exercising the utmost ingenuity to disguise the fact, and
                    train away the eye from observing the weak point, as nature does in like
                    circumstances.</p>

                <p>Thus if a lacquer box in the form of a parallelogram is the object, the artists
                    will not divide it in two equal parts by a perpendicular line, but by a
                    diagonal, as offering a more pleasing line and division. If the box be round
                    they will seek to lead the eye away from the naked regularity of the circle by a
                    pattern distractmg attention, as, for example, by a zigzag breaking the circular
                    outline, and supported by other ornaments.</p>
                <p>A similar feeling is shown by them as colourists, and, though sometimes eccentric
                    and daring in their contrasts, they very seldom produce discords in their
                    chromatic scale. They have undoubtedly a fine sense of colour in common with
                    other Eastern races, and a similarly delicate and subtle feeling for harmonious
                    blending of brilliant and sober hues. As a rule they seem to prefer a quiet and
                    refined style, using full but low-toned colours. They know the value of bright
                    colours, however, and how best to utilize them cleverly, both supporting and
                    contrasting them with their secondaries ami comple-mentaries, as Mr Leighton
                    remarks.</p>
                <p>Having thus taken a very rapid glance at some of the leading features of Japanese
                    decorative art as a whole, and traced the principles that underlie and in great
                    degree determine the processes by which the workman seeks to realize his ideal
                    while taking nature’s methods for his guide, we must now pass in review the
                    several art-industries in which they have most excelled. The following account
                    of these, though by no means supplying an exhaustive list, may be considered to
                    include the principal industries. Such, however, is die delicacy of touch and
                    skill in manipulation exhibited by Jap nese workmen of all kinds that, apart
                    from the general principles applied in all decorative processes, the simplest
                    toy box of wood or papier-mache is apt to be made a work of art, and as a piece
                    of constructive workmanship is not easily rivalled, or in danger of being
                    mistaken for the work of any other than Japanese hands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pottery and Porcelain.—</hi> There has been much discussion as
                    to the source whence the Japanese derived their skill in pottery and porcelain.
                    The general conclusion that, at a remote era, some Corean priests introduced the
                    manufactory of porcelain from China, the country most advanced in civilization
                    in the eastern half of Asia, may be accepted as sufficiently attested. There is
                    evidence that both Chinese and Japanese have since that time borrowed largely
                    from each other, while inventing new forms and processes by their own ingenuity,
                    taste, and skill. Thus differences in treatment and working traditions would
                    become the inheritance of each, giving rise to the very characteristic
                    distinction which may bo observed in the present day between Chinese and
                    Japanese porcelain and pottery of all kinds, notwithstanding a certain generic
                    likeness. The discovery of the art of making hard porcelain, the <hi
                    rend="italic">pâte</hi><hi rend="italic">du/re</hi> of the French in
                    contradistinction to the <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre,</hi> cost European
                    workmen much time and labour, after the first importations of Chinese and
                    Japanese porcelain excited the admiration and envy of Europe; and the secret was
                    never revealed by either Chinese or Japanese to any European.</p>
                <p>There are to this day many secrets of these crafts as jealously guarded as ever.
                    The mystery of crackled china, of lace-work translucent porcelain covered with
                    glaze, and of the marvellous eggshell cups, and the process whereby these are
                    enamelled and covered by a fine woven case of bamboo, as well as the composition
                    and sources of their colours, are still so many secrets to the European
                    manufacturers, although something has been divined or discovered quite lately as
                    to crackle and lace-work porcelain.</p>
                <p>The Japanese of late have been much given to lacquering’ their porcelain, but
                    very often this is not burnt in, and washes off—nor even in the beginning has it
                    much beauty to recommend it. Their enamel painting on this porcelain is in many
                    cases very delicate and beautiful both in design and colour,—but perhaps not as
                    a rule equal to the fine specimens of China of the Ming dynasty, or even of the
                    reign of Kanghi, who was a great patron of the arts early in the 18th century.
                    Of the art-pottery and stoneware of Satsuma and Hizen, and indeed of many other
                    provinces in Japan,, it may be said that nothing better in the material has ever
                    been produced. The Japanese have no pretension to rank with the classic designs
                    on the Etruscan and Greek vases, because they have never learned to draw the
                    human figure correctly. But in flowers, birds, fishes, and insects the Greeks
                    themselves never approached the perfection of Japanese art, where such objects
                    give a beauty and value often to the very commonest piece of pottery, made with
                    the finger and thumb for the chief tools, and retaining the impress of the skin
                    on the surface.</p>
                <p>The great variety of pottery and ceramic ware produced in Japan may most
                    conveniently be arranged under the three heads adopted by Mr Franks in his
                    useful <hi rend="italic">Art Handbook for the Collection in the South Kensington
                    Museum</hi>:—(1) common pottery and stoneware; (2) a cream-coloured faience,
                    with a glaze often crackled and delicately painted in colours; (3) hard
                    porcelain. The best account perhaps of the very varied substances used by the
                    Japanese in making these wares and forming their porcelain clay is to be found
                    in the report published under the authority of the Japanese commission, <hi
                    rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Japon à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >^Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">Universelle de</hi> 1878.</p>
                <p>Porcelain painted or enamelled with flowers and other designs is largely produced
                    in the province of Hizen in the island of Kiushiu, of which Nagasaki, where
                    there are large manufactories, is a port; but it is also manufactured in a great
                    number of other provinces and districts. The decoration, whether in enamel
                    colours or metals, is laid on after the final burning of the clay or <hi
                    rend="italic">p)dte,</hi> and above the glaze. But the artists often live apart
                    from the factories and independent of them, working at their own homes, and
                    owning, separately or jointly according to circumstances, small ovens, where at
                    a comparatively low temperature they can fix their easily fused enamels. Thus
                    much cf the finer egg-shell porcelain used to be sent in the white state to
                    Tôkiô, Hizen, and other places, there to be decorated by artists of local
                    celebrity. But from the Hizen factories also comes a great quantity of low-class
                    porcelain for shipment at Nagasaki, to suit the demand of the European markets.
                    That for the most part is vulgar in taste, made on European models for domestic
                    use, and consists of toilet sets, tea services, jars, trays, &amp;e., coarsely
                    even if elaborately painted, akin to the ware so long received from Canton under
                    similar conditions of deterioration. The colours are bad, with no refined tones.
                    Light greens, red, and blue, all poor in quality, are most common, and have a
                    vulgar and disagreeable effect. This is the result of a demand for cheap
                    articles by tradesmen who have no taste themselves. But Arita, Kioto, Kaga,
                    Satsuma, and Owari are all centres whence the most characteristic and admired
                    ceramic wares of Japan are obtained. Several varieties of enamelled and painted
                    faience are produced in all, and from Satsuma and Owari, especially the former,
                    the faience is very rich. The delicate tints of the paste, and the better ground
                    which the <hi rend="italic">pâte tendre</hi> furnishes for the reception of
                    enamel colours compared with the <hi rend="italic">pâte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dure</hi> of the polished porcelain, give a special beauty to all this ware,
                    while the soft creamy-looking crackled glaze adds an additional charm.</p>
                <p>There is a kind of terra cotta and pottery or earthenware industry in Japan of
                    which the produce has been largely exported of late years in the form of jars
                    and censers or flower-pots. The objects selected for the decorative part are
                    usually in very high relief and roughly modelled, consisting of flowers,
                    foliage, or animals, but their artistic merit is not great, though as specimens
                    of technical skill and mastery of all the difficulties offered by subject and
                    material they are very remarkable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lacquer IVarc.—</hi> China has given its name to all porcelain
                    in the Western world, as the country whence it was first imported. So has Japan
                    given its name to all lacquer ware, first introduced to the knowledge and
                    admiration of Europe in the 17th century after the discovery of that country.
                    The beauty and excellence of Japanese lacquer ware have never been matched in
                    Europe. Not even in China, where the varnish tree is also indigenous, and the
                    industry may date quite as far back, has equality been ever established. Japan
                    reigns supreme, now as at first, in this, the most beautiful and perfect product
                    of all her skilled labour and artistic power.</p>
                <p>The unmatched and apparently unmatchable beauty of Japanese lacquer may be due to
                    many causes. The varnish tree is of several kinds, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urushi</hi> tree growing in Japan (the fruit of which yields the vegetable
                    wax), from which is derived the lacquer varnish, supplies, it is said, a finer
                    gum than any other of the same species. It is extracted from the tree at
                    particular seasons only, by incisions in the bark, and from first to last is
                    subjected to many manipulations and refining processes, conducted with a patient
                    attention and a delicacy such as could with difficulty be secured in any other
                    country,— perhaps not in Europe at any cost. It admits in these processes of
                    various admixtures of colouring matter, and from the first gathering to the last
                    use of it in highly finished work, increasing care as to the dryness or moisture
                    of the atmosphere, the exclusion of every })article of dust, and other
                    conditions is essential. The articles to be acquered, whether cabinets or boxes
                    of infinite variety in size and form, are generally made of light fine-grained
                    pine wood, very carefully seasoned, and smoothed so that not the slightest
                    inequality of surface or roughness of edge remains. Layer after layer of the
                    lacquer is laid on at stated intervals of days or weeks, and after each step the
                    same smoothing process is repeated, generally with a 1 ump of fine charcoal and
                    the fingers, as the finest and most perfect of polishing instruments. These
                    layers vary in number, according to the intended effect and perfection of the
                    article, and also in relation to the design. Very frequently this is either in
                    basso or alto rilievo, in which ivory and agates, coral, or precious stones are
                    inserted, as well as gold and silver in rich profusion. Some of the older and
                    finer pieces of lacquer, which even in the early days of treaty relations in
                    1859 were rarely in the market, and now are exceedingly scarce in Japan itself,
                    represent the labour of months and even years of the most skilled workmen, who
                    must be artists as well as masters of the manual craft. On these articles they
                    lavish all their art, and enrich them by every kind of decoration.</p>
                <p>Fret patterns are in constant use in all Japanese art, sometimes in the form of
                    borders, and more frequently in diapers, which they use with excellent effect on
                    surfaces in filling up and varying the spaces, in combination with floral and
                    other designs. Their love of variety leads them to adopt several different
                    diapers in covering any surface<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0618-0591"/>, often enclosing them hi irregular-shaped
                    compartments, fitting into each other or detached according to the fancy of the
                    artist and the shape of the object ornamented. The same kind of ornamentation
                    and decorative art is carried out in their woodwork, as may constantly be seen
                    in their cabinets of rnarquetrie and inlaid boxes. Their predilection for
                    geometrical forms is best to be seen in their great variety of diapers.</p>
                <p>Nor must their floral diapers be overlooked, consisting as they do of an almost
                    infinite variety for covering whole surfaces, in which flowers and foliage form
                    the material. In the spaces of decoration as in all else, the Japanese artist
                    studiously avoids uniformity or repetition of exact spacing. He repeats, but
                    with the greatest irregularity possible, to disguise as it were the repetition
                    of what is in effect the same design or pattern. In close connexion with the
                    diaper system of ornamentation is that known as powdering, familiar enough in
                    European art; but in Japan, following the principle of irregularity, the
                    decorator avoids any regular distribution of the design adopted. Lastly, there
                    is a style of ornamentation peculiarly Japanese which consists in the use of
                    medallions grouped or scattered over a surface—of various colours and forms—and
                    filled in with different diapers, the whole producing an effect as pleasing as
                    it was novel when first introduced to European eyes. And in this treatment of
                    medallion powdering may best be seen the triumph of this system for the
                    avoidance of uniformity and diametrical division. The medallions being of
                    definite forms, and usually geometrical in outline, the ingenuity displayed in
                    overcoming the difficulty such forms present is very instructive. They are
                    placed either singly or in groups—in the latter case partially, overlapping, and
                    of different outlines—in different colours, and filled in with various diapers,
                    the whole being irregularly distributed over the surface in such a way as to
                    avoid diametrical division or uniformity of any kind.</p>
                <p>This applies to the finer specimens of the work, where all the principles of
                    surface ornamentation and design adopted by the Japanese may be seen in their
                    greatest perfection. But lacquer is the common ware for domestic use, almost as
                    common as pottery and earthenware are in Europe. Cups and saucers, trays and
                    saké bottles, medicine boxes and dishes, are in the poorest houses; and so
                    excellent is the varnish that neither boiling water nor oil will affect the
                    surface. In the finer and older specimens this hardness increases with age, so
                    that some of them can with difficulty be scratched with pin or needle. The value
                    of such specimens, first introduced into England at the London exhibition of
                    1862, has now been fully recognized, and the cost of the best and oldest
                    lacquer, always high, has greatly increased of late years. Dr Dresser mentioned
                    in a recent lecture a box of about six inches square, for which he was asked in
                    Japan £100, and he was told that in Yedo (now Tôkiô) fine specimens were
                    “bringing their weight in gold.” In the Paris exhibition of 1878 there was a
                    large lacquer screen of great beauty valued at 65,000 francs. It, however, was
                    modern, and, with all its beauty, was over-priced. The Japanese also, besides
                    applying lacquer with colours on porcelain, possess in rare perfection the art
                    of lacquering on tortoiseshell and ivory. On these they present minute figures
                    and landscapes with a mixture of gilding and rich colours, sometimes in relief,
                    at other times engraved and sunk, and in this manner they ornament miniature
                    cabinets, jewel boxes, and other quaintly formed miniature boxes, medicine
                    cases, &amp;c., in a way to defy competition in their marvellous beauty and
                    delicacy of execution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metals and Bronzes.—</hi> In all manipulations of metals and
                    amalgams the Japanese are great masters. They not only <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> ‘ are in possession of secret processes unknown to workmen in Europe,” by
                    which they produce effects beyond the reach of the latter, but show a mastery of
                    their material in the moulding and designing of their productions which imparts
                    a peculiar freedom and grace to their best work. A lotus leaf and flower and
                    seed-pod they will produce with inimitable fidelity in the subtle curves and
                    undulating lines and surfaces, and in the most minute markings of leaf and
                    flower. So birds and fishes and insects cast in bronze seem instinct with life,
                    so true are they to nature, while at other times the same objects are adopted
                    for a purely conventional mode of treatment. Their inlaying and overlaying of
                    metals, bronze, silver, and steel, more than rival the best productions of the
                    ateliers of Paris or Berlin, and constitute a special art-industry, with some
                    features of finish and excellence not yet attained in Europe.</p>
                <p>Of the metallurgic triumphs of art which the Japanese may justly claim over all
                    competitors, Chinese, Indian, or European, perhaps the greatest is the
                    perfection to which they have brought the designs in “shakudô,” an amalgam of
                    which are usually made the brooches or buttons used to fasten their tobacco
                    pouches and pocket-books, or to ornament the handles of their swords. Shakudô is
                    chiefly of iron, relieved by partial overlaying of gold, silver, and bronze. One
                    of the jurors (the late Mr Hunt) of the London exhibition of 1862, an employer
                    of the highest artistic and mechanical skill in the working of the precious
                    metals, was convinced, as he stated in his report to the commissioners, that
                    “the Japanese were in possession of some means not known in Europe of forming
                    amalgams, and of overlaying one metal on another, and in the most minute and
                    delicate details introducing into the same subject, not covering an inch,
                    silver, gold, bronze, &amp;c., so as to make a variegated picture of divers
                    colours.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cloisonné, Champlevé,</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Repoussé</hi><hi rend="italic">Work.—</hi> In the varied
                    applications of the art of enamelling, tire Japanese have run their great rivals
                    in cloisonne work very close, although upon the whole the Chinese have the
                    superiority, their colouring being more brilliant and finely toned in harmony,
                    and their work more solid and satisfactory both to the eye and the touch. A dull
                    and sombre tone is generally adopted in Japanese cloisonné work, which much
                    impairs the beauty of their good workmanship in its general effect.</p>
                <p>The mode of producing cloisonné work has often been described. It derives this
                    name from the process of building up the design in cells formed by raised septa
                    varying from ⅛ to ⅛ of an inch in depth; these labyrinthine cells forming
                    elaborate patterns of flowers, diapers, frets, &amp;c., are soldered on the
                    surface of the vases selected, made generally of copper; and into these cells
                    the enamel of the consistence of oil paints and of the various colours required
                    by the pattern is carefully pressed by a wooden spatula. When complete the piece
                    is placed in a primitive kind of oven or “muffle,” where it is fired with a
                    regulated heat until the paste is fused and converted into a vitreous substance,
                    when it is allowed very gradually to cool. This is a process which,
                    however-primitively conducted, as most things are both in China and Japan, and
                    with very simple tools and rude contrivances, is nevertheless one which requires
                    to be watched with the greatest care and judgment. Too much heat would injure
                    the colours, and might fuse the septa or the copper foundation, in which case
                    the whole vessel would become misshapen, or clouded in colour and otherwise
                    marred and rendered worthless. Apart from the risky nature of the process, the
                    enamel colours are very valuable, and the artistic labour required in the
                    pattern and manipulation is too great to allow cloisonné articles to become
                    otherwise than costly even in China or Japan. And as to their reproduction in
                    Europe, or any rivalry there, Μ. Christophile of Paris is understood to have
                    devoted much time and money for the attainment of this object, and succeeded in
                    producing some very beautiful specimens which were exhibited at one of the
                    international exhibitions in London; but the production proved too costly to pay
                    as a matter of business. A good deal has been manufactured in China of late
                    years, it is true, to meet a somewhat indiscriminating demand for articles in
                    such great request. That these modern productions should be inferior to the
                    older work, produced in a much more leisurely way, and for temples or palaces
                    rather than for sale in open market, will be readily understood.</p>
                <p>The arts of champlevé and repoussé are not unknown to the Japanese, but both are
                    less practised than the other kinds of metal work above described. Of the latter
                    Mr Mounsey, late secretary of legation in Japan, succeeded in finding and
                    bringing away many very fine specimens in silver.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carving.—</hi> A nation showing such artistic power in metals,
                    and in more fictile material, such as clay, could not fail to excel in wood and
                    ivory carving. Perhaps in no department are they better known, owing to the
                    large number of “nitsuké,” as the little ivory groups of figures are called,
                    replete with life and humour, that are to be seen in a hundred shops in every
                    capital. These in the days now rapidly passing away used to be employed as
                    buttons, and were as much matters of costly fancy as seals and rings or brooches
                    with us. Whether they take wood or ivory for their material, the result is
                    equally admirable. There are nitsuké and nitsuké, however, as there are artists
                    and artists. Many of the nitsuké that have been imported into Europe in vast
                    quantities of late years are but poor specimens of the Japanese carver’s skill,
                    fancy, and invention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wall Papers.—</hi> There is a great field for the display of
                    their originality and love of variety in the wall papers, which are much used to
                    ornament their walls and screens. What has already been said of their decorative
                    system and methods of surface ornamentation applies to their wall papers; and
                    the system itself is nowhere so severely tried, because something of mechanical
                    reproduction is unavoidable. Whether stencilled or printed, the design of a
                    single square must of necessity be the same in each. By what force of
                    imagination and ingenuity they disguise the effect of exact repetition, and lead
                    the eye away from noticing the uniformity, can only be realized by inspection of
                    the papers covering the walls of an apartment, and no description could supply a
                    substitute. Suflice it to say that their art-principles triumph, even under this
                    severe trial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Textile Fabrics and Embroidery.—</hi> Of textile fabrics and
                    embroidery, in both of which they have developed an industry peculiarly their
                    own, something of the same kind may be said as of their wall papers. These
                    fabrics have, however, been so familiarized in England by the eager adoption of
                    the best and most novel in female costumes that their chief characteristics must
                    be very generally known. It was the custom in former times for each daimio to
                    have his private looms, for weaving the brocades which he himself and his wife
                    and family required, and also the fabrics of less costly materials for his
                    retainers. The robes manufactured for the court at Kiôto and Yedo were in like
                    manner only to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n619/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0619-0592"/> lud from the imperial looms; some of these, a
                    gift from the shδgun on a minister taking leave of his court, were to be seen in
                    the London exhibition of 1862.</p>
                <p>But in many of the more common textile fabrics the best evidence perhaps may be
                    found of the artistic feeling of the nation, and the universality of art work.
                    Towels and dusters of the least expensive material often display very choice
                    designs—as do also the Turkish and Syrian fabrics of the same quality. A piece
                    of bamboo, a broken branch of blossoms, or a flight of birds in counter-changed
                    colours, suffices in their hands to produce the most charming effect, in the
                    most perfect taste. Their embroidery has never been excelled in beauty of
                    design, assortment of colours, and perfection of needlework.</p>
                <p>This summary of the leading characteristics of Japanese art, and the industries
                    to which it has been applied with such unequalled success, is much too brief to
                    be otherwise than imperfect. The art works and the art thought of a people so
                    truly artistic as the Japanese have proved themselves to be form a subject of
                    wide scope and great complexity. The reports issued by the Japanese
                    commissioners at the great exhibitions held successively in Paris in 1867 and
                    1878, in Vienna in 1875, and in Philadelphia in 1876; and the report written by
                    direction of the Japanese Government for the South Kensington Museum, and now
                    embodied in the valuable <hi rend="italic">Art Handbook on Japanese
                    Pottery,</hi> by Mr A. W. Franks, its editor, afford the best evidence of the
                    extent and variety of art work for which as a nation they have now a world-wide
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>It is true, and strange astrue, that the Japanese have apparently never sought to
                    overstep the limits of a purely decorative art, and have thus stopped short of
                    the art development of other nations. Whether this limitationmay befrom some
                    organic defect,or is merely a result of their neglect to study the human figure
                    and. master the difficulties of rendering the fine harmony of line and
                    proportion seen in greatest perfection there, it is difficult to determine.
                    Certain it is, they have never advanced so far. They have always been content to
                    treat the human figure in a conventional style, not much in advance of the
                    Egyptian rendering, and quite incompatible with good drawing. (R. AL.) <hi
