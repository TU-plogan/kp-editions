                <p><label type="entry">DELUGE</label>, a submersion of the world, related by various
                    nations as having taken place in a primitive age, and in which all, or nearly
                    all, living beings are said to have perished. By this definition we exclude all
                    partial floods, and also the theory which would account for deluge-stories as
                    exaggerations of traditions of local inundations. Upon a low level of culture,
                    as Von Hahn has shown, the memory of the most striking events is hardly
                    preserved even for a few generations. It is best therefore to regard the story
                    of the deluge as a subdivision of the primitive man’s cosmogony. The problem
                    with which he had to deal was a complicated one,—given the eternity of matter to
                    account for the origin of the world. The best solution which presented itself
                    (and that only to the shrewder races) was to represent creation as having taken
                    place repeatedly, and the world as having passed through a series of demolitions
                    and reconstructions. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cosmogony).</hi> This explains
                    the confusion between the creation and the deluge noticed by various travellers,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> among the Iroquois and the Santals—a confusion,
                    however, which is only apparent, for the deluge is, when thoroughly realized,
                    practically a second creation. Thus Manui the hero of the Indian flood-story,
                    was, by permission of Brahma, the creator of the present human race. Noah is
                    called by Arabic writers “the second Adam,” and Maui might with as good a right
                    be called the Noah as the Adam of New Zealand. We, in the adult age of the
                    world, have renounced those mythical forms of expression, but we still retain
                    much of the feeling which prompted them. The wonder of creation is even to us
                    constantly renewed in spring; to primitive man it was renewed in a special sense
                    in each of the great world-cycles of mythology. We may lay it down, then, as a
                    canon at the outset, that the various deluge-stories must be viewed in
                    combination, and explained on a common principle. At the same time we must be
                    careful not to confound different “deposits” of tradition, and must regard
                    primarily the earliest and most original forms of myths. As in the case of the
                    cosmogonies, a few typical specimens will be all that can here be described.</p>
                <p>I. Among the Semitic races the seniority belongs to the Babylonians. Till lately,
                    the only version of their story known to us was that of Berosus (Müller, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragmenta,</hi> ii. 501), who relates that the god Kronos appeared
                    to Xisuthrus, tenth king of Babylon ∖ <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Noah, tenth
                    patriarch] in a dream, and warned him of the coming deluge. The details remind
                    us a good deal of the biblical narrative, except that Xisuthrus is also
                    accompanied by a steersman and by his near friends. Even the thrice repeated
                    letting-out <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0066-0055"/> of the birds is mentioned. At last the ship (as
                    it is called) grounded “on a certain mountain,” where Xisuthrus erected an altar
                    and sacrificed; after which both he and his companions disappeared <hi
                    rend="italic">[çf</hi> the “translation” of Enoch]. The duration of the deluge
                    is not stated, and its cause is left to be inferred from the special
                    commendation of Xisuthrus for his piety. Berosus has evidently drawn from
                    cuneiform sources, but those sources have not yet been discovered. Our most
                    valuable authority for the Babylonian deluge-story is the portion of the 11th
                    lay of the great mythological epic, discovered by Mr George Smith. It came from
                    the library of King Assurbanipal, and dates from about 660 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> but the Accadian original from which it was translated may well
                    (says the cautious Assyriologue, Dr Schrader) have been composed between 1000and
                    2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> while the myths themselves will of course
                    be much older. The hero of the deluge bears the name of Tam-zi (“the sun of
                    life,” c∕. Tammuz), for so, with Mr Sayce, the signs should most probably be
                    read. He is called the son of Ubara-tutu, an Accadian name meaning “the
                    splendour of sunset” (Lenormant, Sayce). This version of the story differs in
                    several respects from that of Berosus. The deity who warns Tamzi is Hea (god of
                    knowledge and of the waters), who orders him to build a ship, and to put into it
                    his household and his wealth and the beasts of the field. AU this is related by
                    Tamzi to the (solar) hero “Izdubar.” He tells how he coated the ship within and
                    without with bitumen <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Gen. vi. 14), how he intrusted
                    all to a “seaman, <hi rend="superscript"> ,j</hi> how Samas, the sun-god, and
                    other gods (Hea is not now mentioned) sent rain, and. how the rain-flood
                    “destroyed all life from the face of the earth.” (Why the deluge was sent is a
                    little uncertain, owing to the mutilated condition of the tablets.) On the
                    seventh day there was a calm, and the ship stranded on the mountain Nizir.
                    Another seven days, and Tamzi let out “a dove” (I), then a swallow, both of
                    which returned, and a raven which did not return. Then he left the ship and made
                    a libation; Mr Smith’s “altar” is uncertain. Finally, Hea intercedes with Bel
                    that there be no second deluge, after which “Tamzi and his wife, and the people,
                    were carried away to be like the gods.” Such are the leading authentic features
                    of the Babylonian narrative, or rather narratives, for its inconsistencies and
                    repetitions are such as to force upon us the hypothesis that two documents
                    originally existed, which have bean welded together by an editor.</p>
                <p>II. The Jewish narrative, like the Babylonian, has been thought to consist of two
                    documents, an Elohistic and a Yahvistic, which have been connected by an editor.
                    They appear to differ in various details,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the
                    duration of the flood (the Elohist extends it to a whole solar year), and in the
                    description of the introduction of the animals into the ark (the Elohist alludes
                    to the legal distinction between clean and unclean). But they have certainly the
                    same origin, for they entirely coincide in the main outlines <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> in ascribing the flood to the depravity of mankind, in the mode of
                    Noah’s rescue, and in the promise that the catastrophe should not recur), and
                    even in not a few expressions, among which are the names for the flood and the
                    ark. They agree, furtheo, in this important point, that some expressions point
                    to a universal deluge, others to one which only affected a level inland region
                    like that of Mesopotamia. We naturally ask, therefore, are the former
                    involuntary exaggerations I or “survivals” of a primeval myth 1 Both views are
                    held by respectable critics; but the latter is more favoured by analogy and by
                    the remarkable parallelism between both the biblical narratives (especially the
                    Yahvistic) and the Babylonian.</p>
                <p>These two—the Babylonian and the Jewish—are the only fully developed
                    deluge-stories told by any of the Semitic nations. In. what relation, then, do
                    they stand to each other 1 Was the Babylonian borrowed from the Jewish (or from
                    some earlier form of the story, of which the Jewish is an abridgment), or <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa ì</hi> On the ono hand, the Babylonian story as a whole
                    perhaps produces an impression of greater originality than the Jewish; for (not
                    to mention other points) in the former the order in which the birds are sent out
                    is much more natural. On the other, the “ark,” or rather “chest,” of the Jewish
                    narrative sounds more archaic than the “ship” of the Babylonian. The word for
                    “deluge” in Genesis is also evidently archaic, as appears from the facts that it
                    only occurs once again (Psalm xxix. 3), and that the editor in Genesis needed to
                    explain it by the word “water” (Gen. vi. 17, “the flood, viz., water”). It is
                    possible, therefore, to hold that the Jewish story is a distinct offshoot of a
                    common Semitic tradition. Bolder critics will .maintain that the account in
                    Genesis must be taken in connection with the other narratives which can be
                    explained by, and are therefore possibly dependent upon, parallel Babylonian
                    narratives. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Babylonia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cosmogony).</hi> They will urge that “chest” may have been substituted for
                    “ship” to avoid an anachronism, mankind in Noah’s time not having perhaps
                    reached the sea; and that the archaic word for “deluge” does not prove the
                    antiquity of a developed deluge-story; also that there are traces in Genesis
                    (see iv. 17-24, vi. 1-3) of another and presumably native Hebrew view, according
                    to which the moral degeneration of man was explained without a deluge. The
                    question is a large one, but may perhaps be reduced to this—Can the Yahvistic
                    narrative in Genesis be safely broken up into several <hi rend="italic">ì</hi>
                    There is some evidence, both internal and (see the prophetic references to
                    Genesis) external to show that it can, but it would be premature in this place
                    to pronounce whether the evidence is sufficient. It will hardly be possible,
                    however, to derive the Yahvistic flood-story from Babylonia, and not the
                    Elohistic, as has been suggested ∙ for though the former is nearest to the
                    Babylonian story <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> it ascribes the flood entirely to
                    a rain-storm, whereas the latter introduces also the waters below the
                    firmament), the latter agrees with it in all essential points, and even in the
                    minor point of the bitumen. Let it be remarked in passing that, even if the
                    material of the biblical narratives be taken from the Babylonian, the former
                    have received a peculiar and original stamp, both by their monotheism and by the
                    moral significance so emphatically given to the catastrophe, just as by the
                    addition of the lovely story of the rainbow the Elohist has produced a
                    conclusion far superior, artistically speaking, to that of his Babylonian
                    predecessor.</p>
                <p>III. Another of the great countries by which the Israelites might have been
                    influenced was Egypt; but in this, even more than in a former, case a direct
                    Egyptian influence is out of the question. The delugestory was entirely unknown
                    in the Nile-valley. It is commonly said, but erroneously, that this was owing to
                    the absence of <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> catastrophes of the nature of an
                    inundation. But if the terrestrial deluge is really (see below) only a
                    transformation of the celestial, there is no reason why the story should not
                    have grown up in Egypt, if the imagination of its inhabitants had invited such a
                    development; for the germs of the deluge-story certainly existed in Egypt. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Boole of the Dead</hi> constantly refers to the sun-god, R,a,
                    as voyaging in a boat on the celestial ocean; and a story in an inscription of
                    the archaic period (Seti I.) embodies a conception altogether analogous to that
                    of the narrative in Genesis. According to this myth—which is described by Μ.
                    Naville—Ba, the creator, being disgusted with the insolence of mankind, resolves
                    to exterminate them. The massacre causes human blood to flow to Heliopolis, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n67/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0067-0056"/> upon which Ra repents, and swears with uplifted
                    hand not to destroy mankind again.</p>
                <p>IV. The deluge-story exists in several forms in Indian literature. It does not,
                    however, appear to be a genuine Aryan myth, for there is no clear reference to
                    it in the <hi rend="italic">Rig Veda.</hi> The ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satapatha</hi><hi rend="italic">Brahmana,</hi> where it first occurs, was
                    written (Weber) not long before the Christian era. Another version, in which the
                    lacuuae of the earlier one are filled up, is given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâbhârata,</hi> but this poem, though it existed in part before the Christian
                    era, did not assume its present form till long afterwards. A third version,
                    still more decidedly Indian in character, is given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhâgavata Purâna,</hi> but the earliest possible date of this work is the 12th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> which deprives its account of the deluge
                    of all claim to originality. It is worth noticing, however, that it agrees with
                    the biblical narrative in two subordinate points—the introduction of animals
                    into the ark or box, and the interval of seven days between the warning and its
                    fulfilment. The principal feature of the oldest flood-story is the part assigned
                    to the fish, which warns Manu of the deluge, and ultimately saves him by drawing
                    his ship to a northern mountain. The selection of the fish (which is clearly
                    divine) is so out of character with the most genuine portions of Aryan mythology
                    that it proves the foreign origin of the Indian narrative, perhaps we may even
                    say, the Semitic origin. Not that the fish-god is peculiar to the Semitic world,
                    but that he is un-Indian, and can so easily have reached India from a Semitic
                    source. If the Indians sent apes, sandalwood, and purple (both names and things)
                    to Assyria, why should not the flood-story have been sent in exchange with other
                    products of Mesopotamia? True, the fish does not appear in the present form of
                    the Mesopotamian story, but it probably did appear in the original myth, for
                    among the titles of the god who warned Tamzi (see above) are “fish of the
                    abyss,” “beneficent, saviour fish.” We admit the strong local colouring of the
                    Indian story, which deceived even Weber (but not Burnouf), but this is exactly
                    paralleled by the Hottentot colouring (Bleek) of several South African stories
                    of Christian origin. Whether the early Iranians had a flood-story is perhaps
                    uncertain, since the <hi rend="italic">Aυesta</hi> gives but little information
                    respecting mythology, and it has not come down to us complete. But none was
                    known to the Persians about 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (al-Biruní).</p>
                <p>V. In Greece there appear to have been several floating flood-stories, which in
                    time became localized and attached to the names of heroes. They all represent
                    the flood as destroying all but a few men, and even in their least original
                    forms they still contain many peculiar features which can only have arisen from
                    an independent exercise of the mythopaeic faculty. The most famous of them is
                    that of Deucalion, and of this the earliest and simplest form is in Pindar <hi
                    rend="italic">(Olymp,</hi> ix. 64), who identifies the mountain where Deucalion
                    and Pyrrha landed, and where without marriage they “gat themselves a race from
                    stones” (not a late Greek etymological fancy, for it recurs among American
                    tribes), with Mount Parnassus. Apollodorus (about 100 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) has infused fresh life into this story, perhaps from a Semitic
                    source; he extends the range of the flood to “most parts of Greece,” and states
                    that Deucalion (like Noah and Xisuthrus) offered sacrifice after the flood.
                    Lucian (160 A.D.), laughing in his sleeve, gives a still more conspicuously
                    Semitic account <hi rend="italic">(De dea Syria, c.</hi> 12, 13), in which we
                    hear for the first time of a “great box,” and of “children and wives,” “swine
                    and horses, and the kinds of lions and serpents, &lt;fcc., all by pairs,” as
                    entering the ark. It was a confusion of this kind which led to the charge of
                    Celsus, that the <hi rend="italic">authors</hi> of the books of Moses had “put a
                    new stamp on the story of Deucalion; ”—reason sufficient for confining ourselves
                    as much as possible to primitive versions of mythic narratives.</p>
                <p>VI. America, which abounds in cosmogonies, is naturally not deficient in
                    deluge-stories. Mr Catlin says, that “amongst 120 different tribes that he has
                    visited in North and South and Central America, not a tribe exists that has not
                    related to him distinct or vague traditions of such a calamity, in which one, or
                    three, or eight persons were saved above the waters on the top of a high
                    mountain” <hi rend="italic">(Okeepa,</hi> p. 2). It is extremely difficult to
                    tell how far Christian influences may have determined the form of these stories.
                    When, for instance, we find such a peculiar point as the sending out of the
                    birds to see whether the flood had abated, we are disinclined to build any
                    argument on the circumstance. We do find, it is true, strange points of
                    agreement between the Greek and the Polynesian myths, yet considering the vast
                    extent of Christian missionary activity in America, we are bound to special
                    caution.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, the American deluge-stories convey an impression that they
                    have lost much of their original accuracy. The Polynesian myths, on the
                    contrary, are still almost as transparent as ever. But we shall have occasion to
                    speak of these presently.</p>
                <p>Instead of proceeding further with a detailed examination of myths, let us
                    briefly touch on three general questions arising out of the subject. (1.) Is the
                    deluge-story found among all nations? The Egyptians and (probably) the Persians
                    had none; and it is doubtful whether it exists in non-Mahometan Africa.
                    Probably, too, large deductions should be made from the myths of savage tribes,
                    on the ground of Christian influences, even when related by well-informed
                    travellers. (2.) Was the deluge-story propagated from a single centre? An
                    affirmative answer has often been returned, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by Hugh
                    Miller, <hi rend="italic">Testimony of the Rocks,</hi> p. 282. It is impossible,
                    however, to justify this from the mere fact of the superficial resemblance of
                    the different narratives. These may be accounted for (on the ordinary historical
                    theory of the flood-story) from the similarity of the circumstances of partial
                    floods everywhere; or (if we regard it as based on a nature-myth) from the fact
                    that, by a fundamental law of psychology, the universal wonders of nature
                    everywhere receive (within certain limits) a similar mythic expression.
                    Granting, therefore, in its fullest extent the non-originality of many
                    deluge-stories, we maintain that the evidence points on the whole to the
                    existence of several independent centres from which these stories were
                    propagated. (3.) Restricting ourselves to the consideration of the non-biblical
                    forms of the narrative, we now inquire, what was their original significance? A
                    provisional answer, it is true, has already been given, but one which does not
                    account for the peculiar details of the most original deluge-stories. The only
                    explanation of these which has yet been offered is derived from comparative
                    mythology. It is agreed by mythologists that the exclusive subjects of really
                    primitive traditional stories are frequently recurring natural phenomena.
                    Consequently the elementary mythic descriptions or pictures of these phenomena
                    were the most available material when, at a later period of mental growth, the
                    attempt was made to construct a rude cosmogonical theory. Those “demolitions and
                    reconstructions” of the world of which we spoke at the outset could only be
                    narrated on the basis of these earliest, simplest, most primitive myths. What
                    then was the natural phenomenon which, in a mythic dress, formed the substratum
                    of the deluge-stories? Not merely an annually recurring river-flood, such as
                    those of the Euphrates, for the phenomenal basis of myths must be something
                    strikingly wonderful as well as frequently recurring. This the inundations of a
                    river are not, neither could they be regarded as calamities. But the phenomena
                    of the sky and especially <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0068-0057"/> of the sun are, to the primitive man, daily
                    miracles. Hence the theory (Schirren and Gerland) that the deluge of the stories
                    we are considering has been transferred from the sky to the earth, that it is in
                    a word an ether-myth. This mode of explanation is not set aside by referring to
                    quasi-historical details in the deluge-stories. For as soon as the mythic stage
                    begins to be outgrown, rationalism appears. In this transitional period
                    (commonly of long duration) the old nature-myths are modified. Some mythic
                    elements remain, others are turned into prose. The attempt to explain the
                    existence of the world on the. basis of an ether-myth was an early symptom of
                    the denaturalization of which we have spoken. At a still more advanced stage of
                    the process, the flood often ceased to be universal, and was restricted to the
                    home of those who related the story, or to the region from which they supposed
                    themselves to have migrated. At last the shrewder intellects <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> among the Tahitians and some of the American Indians) even clutched
                    at phenomena like those of fossil-shells found on hills to prove the literal
                    truth of their deluge.</p>
                <p>The most plausible arguments for the celestial delugetheory are derived from the
                    Polynesian mythology. In the flood-story of Raiatea, given by Ellis <hi
                    rend="italic">(Polynesian Researches,</hi> ii. 58-9), the flood rose “as the sun
                    approached the horizon;” and the island where the fisherman found refuge is
                    called Toa-marama, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> moon-tree (tree reaching up into
                    the moon), which reminds us of the Teutonic worldash-tree, Yggdrasil, and the
                    mythic mountain of the Babylonians (see below) and other nations. At Hawaii the
                    flood was even called “flood of the moon,” and at New Zealand “flood of day’s
                    eye” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the sun). Schirren explains all these myths
                    as pictures of sunset, just as he derives the cosmogonies from myths of sunrise.
                    But most of them are more easily explained, with Gerland, as ether-myths. The
                    sun and moon were imagined as peaks emerging out of a flood—sometimes as canoes,
                    sometimes as a man and his wife—the sole survivors (except perhaps the stars,
                    their children) from the inundation. There was, however, no fixity of meaning.
                    The stars were sometimes regarded as ships; but so too were the clouds,
                    “Tangaloa’s ships.” The Babylonian story, as represented in the 11th Izdubar
                    lay, suggests a similar theory. The names of the hero and. his father mean “the
                    (morning) sun” and “the evening-glow.” The flood is a rain-flood, and the
                    “father of the rain” <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Job xxxviii. 28) is the
                    celestial ocean, which in the original myth must have been itself the deluge;
                    and the “ship” is like that in which the Egyptian sun-god voyages in the sea of
                    ether. The mountain on which the survivors come to land was originally (as in
                    Polynesia) the great mythic mountain (c∕. the Accadian <hi rend="italic">kharsak
                    kurra,</hi> “mountain of the east ”), which joins the sky to the earth, and
                    serves as an axis to the celestial vault. Traces of an ether-myth have also been
                    discovered in the Indian deluge-story, as indeed is only natural if it be based
                    on the Babylonian. In the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,</hi> the divine fish
                    has a horn issuing from his head, which reminds us of other horned deities,
                    whose solar origin is admitted, such as Baal and the Berosian Oannes. (See also
                    Schirren, <hi rend="italic">Wanderungen der Neuseeländer,</hi> p. 193, who is,
                    however, too fanciful to be a safe guide).</p>
                <p>Two points should be mentioned in conclusion. (1.) Though a moral significance is
                    by no means always attributed to the deluge, it is more common than might have
                    been expected. In the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata</hi> (line 12,774) it takes
                    the form not of retribution but of purification, which agrees with Plato’s view
                    <hi rend="italic">(Timaeus,</hi> p. 22). We find it in America among the
                    Quichés, but this may perhaps be a later addition, as is certainly the case in
                    one of the forms of the Tahitian myth (Waitz, vi. 271). And (2.) the deluge is
                    not always the last of those periodical destructions alluded to at the beginning
                    of this article. A few races suppose the last link in the series to be a great
                    fire which swept every living thing from the earth, except (as some American
                    Indians say) a few who took refuge in a deep cave. This last feature, however,
                    has a slightly suspicious resemblance to Gen. xix. 29, and, to say the least,
                    the conflagration is not a myth of such proved antiquity and spontaneity as the
                    deluge. It is too suggestive of artificial systems like that of the Stoics.</p>
