                <p><label type="entry">DUNDONALD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Cochrane, Tenth Earl
                    of</hi></label> (1775-1860), known during his brilliant naval career as Lord
                    Cochrane, was born at Annsfield, in Lanarkshire, on the 14th December 1775. His
                    father, the ninth earl, had great scientific attainments, especially in
                    chemistιy, and possessed a genius for invention which ruined his fortune without
                    much benefiting any one. He was so poor that the education of Thomas, his eldest
                    son and heir, was left very much to such volunteer instructors as the parish
                    minister. At the age of seventeen Lord Cochrane joined the navy on. board the
                    “Hind,” of which his uncle, afterwards Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, was at
                    the time captain. His father had previously procured for him a commission in the
                    79th regiment, but his own preference for the other branch of the service was so
                    decided that it was found necessary to gratify it. In 1795 he was transferred
                    with his uncle to the frigate “Thetis,” which proceeded to the North American
                    station. Soon afterwards he received his lieutenant’s commission; andin 1798 he
                    was sent to the Mediterranean to serve in the fleet under the command of Lord
                    Keith. He had already begun to show that rare combination of daring and prudence
                    which probably no British naval officer, save Nelson, ever possessed to a
                    greater degree. As commander of the sloop “Speedy,” to which he was appointed in
                    1800, he performed a series of exploits in capturing vessels of immensely larger
                    size than his own which are almost without parallel in the annals of naval
                    warfare. The little “Speedy,” with its miserably weak armament of four-pounders,
                    became the terror of the Spanish coasts, and more than once she was honoured by
                    a frigate being especially detached to capture her. One of the attacks she
                    ingeniously evaded; another she boldly met (28th February 1801), and actually
                    succeeded in capturing her opponent, the “El Gamo,” a Spanish frigate of 32
                    guns. Her cruise of thirteen months, during which she took upwards of fifty
                    vessels with 122 guns and 534 prisoners, ended in her own capture by three
                    French line of battle ships, after making so gallant a resistance that the
                    French captain, to whom Cochrane delivered up his sword, at once returned it.
                    After a brief imprisonment, Lord Cochrane was exchanged. The promotion to
                    postrank, to which he was fully entitled, came somewhat tardily in August 1801;
                    and the persistence with which his claims had to be urged laid the foundation of
                    the bad understanding with the authorities at the Admiralty that caused him to
                    be lost to the British service a few years later, while he was still in his
                    prime. Its immediate result being that ho was refused further employment, he
                    spent the period of enforced leisure (1802) at the university of Edinburgh,
                    where he wisely endeavoured to repair the defects of his early education. The
                    renewal of hostilities in 1803 brought him the opportunity of such distinction
                    as was likely to be gained in the command of the “Arab,” an utterly unseaworthy
                    old collier purchased into the navy, in which he was sent to take part in the
                    blockade of Boulogne. The animus against him in official circles was clearly
                    shown when, on his complaining that his vessel was unfit for service, he was
                    sent to the North Sea to protect nonexistent fisheries! In 1804, on the advent
                    of Lord Melville to the head of the Admiralty, tardy justice was done by his
                    appointment to the command of the new frigate “Pallas” (32), in which, after
                    making several valuable prizes within ten days, he entered Plymouth harbour in
                    charge of them with three golden candlesticks, each five feet high, at the
                    mastheads as a sample of the spoils. Before the “Pallas” was again sent to sea
                    her fortunate captain was returned to Parliament as member for Honiton, partly
                    through the influence of his fame, but still more through the influence of his
                    prize-money. In her second cruise the “Pallas,” after convoying a merchant fleet
                    to Quebec, returned to the coast of France, where she cut out and captured
                    several of the enemy’s corvettes, and destroyed many of the signals. In August
                    1806 Lord Cochrane was transfen ed to the command of the “Impérieuse” (44), in
                    which during the succeeding two years he did immense damage to the enemy’s fleet
                    in the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean. One of his most gallant exploits
                    during this period was his defence of Fort Trinidad, near Rosas, which he held
                    for twelve days (November 1808) against overwhelming odds. When he found further
                    resistance impossible he blew up the magazines and returned to his ship.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, though his services were so distinguished, his relations with the
                    Admiralty had not become more friendly. At the general election in May 1807 he
                    had been returned <pb break="no"

                    interest, along with Sir Francis Burdett: and during a brief interval spent at
                    home, while he was in command of the “Impérieuse,” he had rendered himself still
                    further obnoxious as a critic in Parliament of naval abuses. In 1809, however,
                    the authorities had occasion for a daring service which he alone was found
                    competent and willing to undertake. It had been suggested to them that the
                    French fleet blockaded in Basque Roads might be destroyed by means of fire
                    ships, and the hazardous duty was intrusted to Cochrane. On the night of the
                    11th April he personally piloted the vessels loaded with explosives to the
                    entrance of the harbour, where they spread such terror that seven French
                    frigates slipped their cables and ran on shore, five of them being afterwards
                    destroyed. Unfortunately this first success was not followed up as it ought to
                    have been. Lord Gambier, the commander of the blockading fleet, ignoring the
                    repeated and urgent requests of Cochrane, refused to order a general attack, and
                    thus the opportunity of destroying the whole of the enemy’s ships was lost. Lord
                    Cochrane was bitterly disappointed, and made no attempt to conceal his opinion
                    of the incompetency of his superior, who found himself compelled to demand a
                    court martial. The trial was worse than a mockery; the court was packed,
                    witnesses were manipulated, and charts fabricated,—with the scandalous result
                    that Gambier was acquitted and Cochrane by implication disgraced. There was, of
                    course, no further professional employment for one who had been stigmatized as a
                    false accuser. For four critical years Lord Cochrane held no command, and his
                    country lost the services of one of the few naval heroes she has had worthy to
                    be named along with Nelson. In his place in Parliament he did what he could to
                    secure a reform of the many abuses connected with the administration of the
                    navy, and his unsparing criticisms greatly embittered his already unfriendly
                    relations with the Admiralty and the Government. In 1814 an unfortunate
                    concurrence of circumstances, suspicious in themselves though capable of a
                    satisfactory explanation, led to his being accused, along with several others,
                    of a conspiracy to defraud the Stock Exchange, by circulating a false report of
                    the success of the Allies and the death of Napoleon. He had only a week or two
                    before so far overcome the disfavour with which he was regarded by the Admiralty
                    as to secure his appointment to the command of the “Tonnant,” the flag-ship of
                    his uncle Sir Alexander Cochrane, but he had to resign the position in order to
                    meet the prosecution which the Government were not slow to institute. The trial
                    was conducted before Lord Ellenborough, a noted partisan, who, if he did not, as
                    Cochrane’s friends have insinuated, exceed the limits of his office in order to
                    secure a conviction, certainly showed no favour to the accused, who were all
                    found guilty. Lord Cochrane was sentenced to a fine of £1000, twelve months’
                    imprisonment, and an hour in the pillory. His ruin and disgrace were completed
                    by his being expelled from the House of Commons, and deprived with the usual
                    humiliating ceremony of the knighthood of the Bath, which had been bestowed on
                    him after his heroic service at Basque Roads. Popular sympathy, however, was
                    strongly with him. An influential minority of forty-four voted against his
                    expulsion from the House of Commons, and when a new writ was issued for
                    Westminster he was unanimously returned, no one having ventured to stand against
                    him. A public subscription was raised by his constituents for the payment of his
                    fine. His colleague, Sir Francis Burdett, pledged himself to stand along with
                    him in the pillory if that part of the sentence was carried out, and the
                    Government judged it prudent to remit it. Lord Cochrane’s conduct was throughout
                    that of an innocent, if somewhat imprudent, man. At his trial he voluntered a
                    full explanation of the suspicious circumstances that were urged against him,
                    and after his conviction he took every opportunity of protesting against the
                    injustice that had been done him, and was urgent in his demand for a new
                    inquiry. During the currency of his sentence he contrived to make his escape
                    from prison, and took his seat in the House of Commons, from which he was
                    forcibly removed by the warden and officers of the King’s Bench.</p>
                <p>At the close of his imprisonment Lord Cochrane soon found that there was little
                    hope of his being again actively engaged in the service of his native country.
                    The peace that followed Waterloo promised to be enduring, and, even had it been
                    otherwise, he could not expect employment, as his name had been struck off the
                    navy list. When, therefore, the command of the fleet of the republic of Chili
                    was offered to him in 1818, he at once accepted it, finding a congenial task in
                    the endeavour to aid a weak state in its struggle for freedom. He arrived at
                    Valparaiso in November 1818; and in a short time afterwards he was ready for
                    action, though the fleet under his command was in every respect miserably weak
                    when compared with that of Spain, to which it was opposed. It seemed almost the
                    characteristic feature of his genius, however, that the greater the odds against
                    him the more brilliant the success he achieved, and this was signally
                    exemplified during his career in South America. It is impossible to detail all
                    his marvellous exploits. Two, however, must be specially mentioned as among the
                    most extraordinary achievements in the annals of naval warfare. On the 2d
                    February 1820 he captured Valdivia, a very strongly fortified town and harbour
                    in the possession of the Spaniards, the forces under his command consisting of
                    his own single frigate and 250 land troops in three small vessels. The place
                    yielded to the mere terror of Lis name, the handful of troops that obtained
                    possession of it being insufficient to man its guns or even to keep its civil
                    population in order. In the autumn of the same year he blockaded the harbour of
                    Callao, one of the strongest in the world. Within it, fixed to chain moorings,
                    protected by twenty-seven gunboats, and covered by the fire of no less than 300
                    guns in the batteries, lay the Spanish frigate “Esmeralda.” The ambition of Lord
                    Cochrane was fired by the apparent impossibility of the task to attempt his
                    favourite exploit of cutting out. The attempt was made on the night of the 5th
                    November, and, in spite of the apparent impossibility, it was completely
                    successful after a sharp engagement of a quarter of an hour’s duration, in the
                    course of which Lord Cochrane was severely wounded. The moral effect of this
                    achievement upon the Spaniards was all that Cochrane had anticipated; they were
                    completely paralyzed, and left their daring opponent undisputed master of the
                    coast Unfortunately, just at the time when he was rendering her these signal
                    services, the jealousies and intrigues of various members of the Chilian
                    Government were making Lord Cochrane’s position uncomfortable, if not untenable.
                    The withholding of prize-money, and even of pay, had nearly caused a mutiny in
                    the fleet, when Lord Cochrane, by taking strong measures to obtain part of what
                    was due to his men, brought on an open rupture between himself and the
                    Government. An invitation from the regent of Brazil to undertake the command of
                    his fleet against the Portuguese was, therefore, accepted as a welcome
                    deliverance. Lord Cochrane entered on his new duties at Rio de Janeiro in March
                    1822. His services to Brazil were quite as important, though scarcely marked by
                    so many brilliant episodes, as those to Chili, and they were in the end equally
                    ill-requited. His daring capture of Maranham with a single frigate, in July
                    1823, added a province to the newly-formed empire; and the value of the
                    accession was acknowledged by the title of marquis of Maranham being conferred
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n560/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0560-0541"/> upon the captor, along with an estate, of which,
                    however, Lord Cochrane never obtained possession. In fact, both by Chili and
                    Brazil he was unjustly defrauded of all substantial rewards, and his connection
                    with the new empire which he had done so much to aid in establishing was
                    ignominously terminated by his dismissal from her service in 1825. He had given
                    some provocation to this by his obstinacy in refusing to appear at a
                    court-martial, and account for his conduct in taking the frigate under his
                    command to England without orders. The Brazilian Government itself, however,
                    practically admitted the gross injustice with which it had treated him by
                    awarding him twenty years afterwards the pension that had been agreed upon in
                    the first engagement made with him.</p>
                <p>On his return to England Lord Cochrane found himself the object of a popularity
                    that had grown rather than abated during his absence. His great achievements had
                    been spoken of in the warmest terms in the House of Commons by Sir James
                    Mackintosh, who urged the Government to restore him to his place in the service
                    of his native land. But the time for the redress of his wrongs was not yet; and,
                    finding inaction impossible, he gladly gave his services to the cause of Greek
                    independence. Appointed by the National Assembly admiral of the Greek fleet, he
                    found himself for the first and only time in his career in a position where
                    success was impossible even for him.. The want of union and discipline among the
                    Greek troops frustrated all his plans, and an attempt to relieve the Acropolis
                    at Athens in 1827 ended from this cause in a disastrous failure, Lord Cochrane
                    only escaping by jumping into the sea. In 1828, after the Great Powers had
                    secured the recognition of the independence of Greece, he returned to
                    England.</p>
                <p>With the accession of King William and the formation of a Liberal ministry there
                    came at last a tardy and imperfect reparation to Lord Cochrane for the injustice
                    he had suffered. He was restored to his rank in the navy, but with this he had
                    to remain content. It was with bitter and indignant feelings that he found
                    himself compelled to accept a pardon under the Great Seal instead of the new
                    trial he had long and vehemently demanded. And the restoration to his rank was
                    robbed of much of its grace by the facts that the honour of the knighthood of
                    the Bath, of which he had also been deprived, was not restored at the same time,
                    and that the arrears of his pay were withheld. In 1831 he succeeded his father
                    in the earldom of Dundonald. On the 23d November 1841 he became vice-admiral of
                    the blue. Another instalment of the lingering atonement that was due to him was
                    paid in 1847, when the honour of knighthood of the Bath was restored, though, by
                    that strange fatality which seemed to have decreed that no reparation made to
                    him should be complete, his banner was not replaced in the chapel of the order
                    until the day before his burial. In 1848 he was appointed to the command of the
                    North American and West Indian station, which he filled until 1851. Immediately
                    after his return he published <hi rend="italic">Notes on the Mineralogy,
                    Government, and Condition of the British West India Islands.</hi> When unfitted
                    by advancing age for active service, he busied himself with scientific
                    inventions for the navy, such as improved poop and signal lights, improved
                    projectiles, &amp;c. During the Russian war he revived secret plans which he had
                    detailed to the prince regent nearly fifty years before for the total
                    destruction of an enemy’s fleet, and he offered to conduct in person an attack
                    upon Sebastopol and to destroy it in a few hours &lt;∙without loss to the
                    attacking force. That his intellect remained clear and vigorous to the close of
                    his life was shown by the publication in his eighty-fourth year of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Narrative of Services in the Liberation of Chili, Peru, and
                    Brazil</hi> (1858), and of his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> in two
                    volumes, the second of which appeared just before his death. The literary style
                    of both works is admirably appropriate to the subject, simple, lucid, and
                    dashing; and the story they tell is one of heroism and adventure that has
                    scarcely its parallel even in romance. The author’s burning sense of his wrongs,
                    and his passionate desire for ’ a thorough vindication, reveal themselves at
                    every turn. If he is not unnaturally blind to the fact that his own imprudence
                    and want of selfcommand contributed in some small degree to his misfortunes, no
                    one will now deny that this “heroic soul branded with felon’s doom” suffered
                    more cruel and undeserved wrongs than ever fell to the lot of any warrior of his
                    genius and achievements.</p>
