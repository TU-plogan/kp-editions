                    (1766-1848), was born at Enfield in May 1766. He belonged to a Jewish family
                    which, having been driven by the Inquisition from Spain, towards the end of the
                    15 th century, settled as merchants at Venice, and assumed the name which has
                    become famous. In 1748 his father, then only about eighteen years of age,
                    removed to England, where, before passing the prime of life, he amassed a
                    competent fortune, and retired from business. Both he and his wife gradually
                    dropped connection with their co-religionists, with whom their son never appears
                    to have associated himself.</p>
                <p>The strongly marked characteristics which determined D’Israeli’s, career were
                    displayed to a singular degree even in his boyhood. He spent his time over
                    books, and in long day-dreams, and evinced the strongest distaste for business
                    and all the more bustling pursuits of life. These idiosyncracies met with no
                    sympathy from either of his parents, whose ambitious plans for his future career
                    they threatened to disappoint. At length, when he was about fourteen, in the
                    hope of changing the bent of his mind, his father sent him to school at
                    Amsterdam, where he remained four or five years. Here in the principal’s
                    library, and under the principal’s influence, he studied Bayle and Voltaire, and
                    became an ardent disciple of Rousseau. Here also he wrote a long poem against
                    commerce, which he produced as an exposition of his opinions when, on his return
                    to England, his father divulged his intention of placing him in a commercial
                    house at Bordeaux. Against such a destiny his mind strongly revolted; and, in
                    this extremity, it was natural that he should eagerly seek the sympathy and
                    counsel of a literary friend. He carried his poem, with a letter earnestly
                    appealing for advice and assistance, to Samuel Johnson; but when, full of eager
                    hope, he called again a week after to receive an answer, the packet was returned
                    unopened—the grand old censor was on his deathbed. He also addressed a letter to
                    Dr Vicesimus Knox, in a tone of the loftiest sentiment, displaying all his
                    literary aspirations, his earnestness and simplicity of heart, and his utter
                    lack of all the qualities of “that despicable thing” (as he called him) “a mere
                    man of the world,” and begging to be received into the scholar’s family, that he
                    might enjoy the benefit of his learning and experience. How this application was
                    answered we do not know. The evident firmness of his resolve, however, was not
                    .without effect. His parents gave up their purpose for a time. He was sent to
                    travel in France, and allowed to occupy himself as he wished; and he had the
                    happiness of spending some months in Paris, in the society of literary <pb

                    which he delighted.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1788 he returned home, being then a few months past his
                    majority, to lay the first stone of his literary fame by an attack on Peter
                    Pindar, under the form of a poem in the manner of Pope <hi rend="italic">On the
                        Abuse of Satire.</hi> Published, as it was, at a most appropriate moment, it
                    at once attained popularity. Its authorship became the great subject of debate
                    in literary circles, and it was attributed by some to Hayley, upon whom it was
                    actually revenged, with characteristic savageness, by its victim. It is greatly
                    to Wolcott’s credit that, sensitive though he was to attacks upon himself, he at
                    once, on learning his mistake, sought the acquaintance of his young opponent,
                    towards whom he seems to have borne no malice, and whose friend he remained to
                    the end of his life. But of all the fortunate issues of this success not the
                    least fortunate was that it brought D’Israeli what he had so long earnestly
                    desired— the friendship of a refined man of letters. Through it he made the
                    acquaintance of Henry James Pye, who helped to persuade his father that it would
                    be a mistake to force him into a business career, and who introduced him into
                    literary circles. Henceforth his life was passed in the way he best liked—in
                    quiet and almost uninterrupted study. His health was for the most part
                    sufficiently robust, though he was for some years the victim of a nervous
                    depression and weakness, which came upon him when he was about twenty-eight
                    years of age, and which doubtless was chiefly caused by his sedentary habits. He
                    was able to maintain his strenuous and extraordinary devotion to study till he
                    reached the advanced age of seventy-two, when, though still in the enjoyment of
                    unimpaired health, and in the very midst of what would have been his greatest
                    undertaking, he was forced, by paralysis of the optic nerve, to give up work
                    almost entirely. He lived ten years longer, and his death, which took placeat
                    his seat at Bradenham House on the 19th January 1848, was due not to old age but
                    to an epidemic which carried him off after a few hours’ illness.</p>
                <p>Isaac D’Israeli is most celebrated as the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Curiosities of Literature,</hi> by far the best and most popular of all the
                    many works of the kind which have appeared in England. It is a miscellany of
                    literary and historical anecdotes, of original critical remarks, and of
                    interesting and curious information of all kinds, animated by genuine literary
                    feeling, taste, and enthusiasm. The first volume was published anonymously in
                    1791; and it immediately attained the popularity it deserved. Two years later it
                    was followed by a second volume; it was not, however, till the lapse of
                    twenty-four years that the third made its appearance. Three other volumes were
                    subsequently added, and in the later editions the first two volumes were much
                    improved. With the <hi rend="italic">Curiosities of Literature</hi> may be
                    appropriately classed D’Israeli’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies, or Literary
                        Recreations</hi> (1796), the <hi rend="italic">Calamities of Authors</hi>
                    (1812), and the <hi rend="italic">Quarrels of Authors</hi> (1814). Towards the
                    close of his life DTsraeli formed the project of embodying his wide knowledge of
                    English literature in a continuous history; loss of sight, however, prevented
                    him from publishing more than three volumes, which appeared in 1841 under the
                    title of the <hi rend="italic">Amenities of Literature.</hi> But of all his
                    literary works the most interesting and delightful is his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Essay on the Literary Character</hi> (1795), which, like most of his
                    writings, abounds in illustrative ancedotes. His contribution to the famous
                    “Pope controversy”—in which Bowles and Hazlitt so vigorously attacked, and Byron
                    and Campbell so vigorously asserted, the poetical merit and personal worth of
                    the great poet of the 18th century,—a defence of Pope contained in a criticism
                    of Spence’s <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi> contributed to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> (July 1820)—is of interest, both as
                    indicating the nature of his critical views, and as founded upon elaborate study
                    of the life and era of the poet. He also published a slight sketch of Jewish
                    history, and especially of the growth of the Talmud, entitled the <hi
                        rend="italic">Genius of Judaism,</hi> as well as a few poems in imitation of
                    Pope, and several novels.</p>
                <p>He was, besides, the author of two historical works—a brief defence of the
                    literary merit and personal and political character of James I. (1816), and a
                    work, of considerable research and magnitude entitled a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentary on the Life and Reign of King Charles I.</hi> (1828-31). The
                    latter work was recognized by the University of Oxford, which conferred upon the
                    author the honorary degree of D.C.L. As an historian D’Israeli is distinguished
                    by two characteristics. In the first place, he had small interest in politics,
                    and no sympathy with the’passionate fervour, or adequate appreciation of the
                    importance, of political struggles. And, secondly, with a laborious zeal then
                    less common than now among historians, he sought to bring to light fresh
                    historical material by patient search for letters, diaries, and other
                    manuscripts of value which had escaped the notice of previous students. Indeed,
                    the honour has been claimed for him of being one of the founders of the modern
                    school of historical research, whose patient labours have thrown so much light
                    upon important’ events and characters.</p>
                <p>Of the amiable personal character and the placid life of Isaac D’Israeli a
                    charming picture is to be found in the brief memoir prefixed to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Curiosities of Literature,</hi> by his son the earl of
                    Beaconsfield, from which the following may be quoted :—Isaac D’Israeli “was a
                    complete literary character, a man who really passed his life in his library He
                    disliked business, and he never required relaxation ;. he was absorbed in his
                    pursuits. In London his only amusement was to ramble among booksellers; if he
                    entered a club, it was only to go into the library. In the country he scarcely
                    ever left his room but to saunter in abstraction upon a terrace, muse over a
                    chapter, or coin a sentence He had by nature a singular volatility which never
                    deserted him. His feelings, though always amiable, were not painfully deep, and
                    amid joy or sorrow, the philosophic vein was ever evident. He more resembled
                    Goldsmith than any man I can compare him to; in his conversation, his apparent
                    confusion of ideas ending with some felicitous phrase of genius, his <hi
                        rend="italic">naivete,</hi> his simplicity not untouched with a dash of
                    sarcasm affecting innocence—one was often reminded of the gifted and interesting
                    friend of Burke and Johnson. There was, however, one trait in which my father
                    did not resemble Goldsmith; he had no vanity. Indeed one of his few infirmities
                    was rather a deficiency in self-esteem.”</p>
