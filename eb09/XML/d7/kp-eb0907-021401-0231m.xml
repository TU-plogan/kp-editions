                    in the French campaign. Next year he returned to his books, and this short taste
                    of military service was the only break in a long and uneventful life of·
                    literary labours. By his parents’ desire he applied himself for a short time to
                    law, but a visit to Goethe in 1818 gave a new direction to his studies, and
                    determined his future career. Goethe had been reading Raynouard’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Selections from the Romance Poets,</hi> and advised the young
                    scholar to explore the rich mine of Provençal literature which the French savant
                    had opened up. This advice was eagerly followed, and henceforth Diez devoted
                    himself to Romance literature. After supporting himself for some years by
                    private teaching, he removed in 1822 to Bonn, where he held the position of
                    ρrivat-docent, which is the lowest grade of the German professoriate. In 1823 he
                    published his first work, <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to Romance
                    Poetry;</hi> in the following year appeared <hi rend="italic">The Poetry of the
                    Troubadours,</hi> and in 1829 <hi rend="italic">The Lives and Works of the
                    Troubadours.</hi> In 1830 he was called to the chair of modern literature. The
                    rest of his life was mainly occupied with the composition of the two great works
                    on which his fame rests, the <hi rend="italic">Grammar of the Romance
                    Languages,</hi> 1836-1844, and the <hi rend="italic">Lexicon of the Romance
                    Languages—Italian, Spanish, and French,</hi> 1853.</p>
                <p>In these two works Diez has done for the Romance group of languages what Jacob
                    Grimm has for the Teutonic family. In both cases much remains to be
                    accomplished, many words and forms are not yet accounted for, some errors have
                    already been pointed out, but all future philologists must build on the
                    foundations which these two men have laid. “Nothing,” says Max Müller, “can be a
                    better preparation for the study of the comparative grammar of the ancient Aryan
                    language than a careful perusal of the comparative grammar of the six Romance
                    languages by Professor Diez.”</p>
                <p>In order to appreciate the importance of Diez’s work it is necessary to take a
                    rapid glance at the history of philology in France. The earliest philologists,
                    such as Perion and Henri Estienne, sought to discover the origin of French in
                    Greek and even in Hebrew. For more than a century Ménage’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Etymological Dictionary</hi> held the field without a rival. Considering the
                    time at which it was written (1650), it was a meritorious work, but philology
                    was then in the empirical stage, and many of Ménage’s derivations (such as that
                    of “rat” from the Latin “mus,” or of “haricot” from “faba ”) have since become
                    by-words among philologists. A great advance was made by Raynouard, who by his
                    critical editions of the works of the Troubadours, published in the first years
                    of the present century, laid the foundations on which Diez afterwards built. The
                    difference between Diez’s method and that of his predecessors is well stated by
                    him in the preface to his dictionary. In sum it is the difference between
                    science and guess-work. The scientific method is to follow implicitly the
                    discovered principles and rules of phonology, and not to swerve a foot’s breadth
                    from them unless plain, actual exceptions shall justify it; to follow the genius
                    of the language, and by cross-questioning to elicit its secrets; to guage each
                    letter and estimate the value which attaches to it in each position; and lastly
                    to possess the true philosophic spirit which is prepared to welcome any new
                    fact, though it may modify or upset the most cherished theory.</p>
                <p>Such is the historical method which Diez pursues in his grammar and dictionary.
                    To collect and arrange facts is, as he tells us, the sole secret of his success,
                    and he adds in other words the famous apophthegm of Newton, “hypotheses non
                    fingo.”</p>
                <p>The introduction to the grammar consists of two parts: —the first discusses the
                    Latin, Greek, and Teutonic elements common to the Romance languages; the second
                    treats of the six dialecte separately, their origin, and the elements peculiar
                    to each. The grammar itself is divided into four books, on phonology, on
                    flexion, on the formation of words by composition and. derivation, and on
                    syntax.</p>
                <p>His dictionary is divided into two parts. The first contains words common to two
                    at least of the three principal groups of Romance,- -Italian, Spanish and
                    Portuguese, and Provençal and French The Italian, as nearest the original, is
                    placed at the head of each article. The second part treats of words peculiar to
                    one group. There is no separate glossary of Wallachian.</p>
                <p>Of the introduction to the grammar there is an excellent translation into French
                    by Gaston Paris, a pupil of Diez, and an English translation by C. B. Cayler.
                    The dictionary has been published in a remodelled form for English readers by T.
                    C. Donkin. A second edition, enlarged and corrected, appeared in 1861, and a
                    third edition was begun in 1869.</p>
