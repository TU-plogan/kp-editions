                    with a local lesion in the form of inflammation and ulceration of the lower
                    portion of the bowels.</p>
                <p>Although at one time a common disease in Great Britain, dysentery is now very
                    rarely met with there, and is for the most part confined to ∙warm countries,
                    where it is the cause of a large amount of mortality.</p>
                <p>Dysentery in a sporadic form may occur anywhere, but this variety of the disease
                    is believed to depend on a different cause from that to which it is due where it
                    prevails endemically or spreads as an epidemic; for, while isolated cases appear
                    capable of being excited by irritating causes which act locally on the
                    alimentary canal, and may thus be developed out of an ordinary intestinal
                    catarrh, the dysentery of tropical climates is generally regarded as owing its
                    origin to a specific poison of the nature of a miasm or germ, somewhat analogous
                    to that which is believed to be the cause of malignant cholera. How, and under
                    what circumstances, the dysentery poison is generated is still a matter of
                    uncertainty. The frequent association of dysentery with intermittent fever has
                    long been remarked, and has led to the belief on the part of many in a malarial
                    origin for this disease. It is, however, doubtful whether any necessary
                    relationship can be established between them (although a malarial form of
                    dysentery is a well marked variety of the disease), since dysentery may be found
                    prevailing where no evidence of malaria can be detected. At the same time <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0606-0585"/> certain characters of climate and soil are known
                    to favour the increase and propagation of dysentery. Long continued high
                    temperature of the air and ground, such as exists in the tropics, together with
                    a soil of swampy character, are the conditions generally present where dysentery
                    prevails endemically, and where it ⅛ propagated as an epidemic these factors are
                    seldom absent. Among other causes well recognized as favouring the spread of
                    epidemic dysentery are impure air and water, improper and insufficient food,
                    unripe fruit, excessive indulgence in alcoholic liquors, and exposure to chills
                    in warm weather, all or many of which have been often found connected with the
                    propagation of dysentery among large bodies of people, as in the case of armies,
                    where also the disease has been frequently associated with outbreaks of
                    scurvy.</p>
                <p>The contagiousness of epidemic dysentery is generally admitted, and it is
                    probable that in this disease as in cholera the vehicle of its transmission is
                    contained in the matter discharged from the bowels of those affected.</p>
                <p>Dysentery manifests itself with varying degrees of intensity, but in well-marked
                    cases the following are the chief symptoms. The attack is commonly preceded by
                    certain premonitory indications in the form of general illness, loss of
                    appetite, and some amount of diarrhoea, which gradually increases in severity,
                    and is accompanied with griping pains in the abdomen (tormina). The discharges
                    from the bowels succeed each other with great frequency, and the painful feeling
                    of pressure downwards (tenesmus) becomes so intense that the patient is
                    constantly desiring to defecate. The matters passed from the towels, which at
                    first resemble those of ordinary diarrhoea, soon change their character,
                    becoming scanty, mucous or slimy, and subsequently mixed with, or consisting
                    wholly of, blood, along with shreds of exudation thrown off from the mucous
                    membrane of the intestine. The evacuations possess a peculiarly offensive odour
                    characteristic of the disease. Although the constitutional disturbance is at
                    first comparatively slight, it increases with the advance of the disease, and
                    febrile symptoms come on attended with urgent thirst and scanty and painful flow
                    of urine. Along with this the nervous depression is very marked, and the state
                    of prostration to which the patient is reduced can scarcely be exceeded. Should
                    no improvement occur death may take place in from one to three weeks, either
                    from repeated losses of blood, or from gradual exhaustion consequent on the
                    continuance of the symptoms, in which case the discharges from the bowels become
                    more offensive and are passed involuntarily.</p>
                <p>When, on the other hand, the disease is checked, the signs of improvement are
                    shown in the cessation of the pain, in the evacuations being less frequent and
                    more natural, and in relief from the state of extreme depression. Convalescence
                    is, however, generally slow, and recovery may be imperfect—the disease
                    continuing in a chronic form, which may exist for a variable length of time,
                    giving rise to much suffering, and not unfrequently leading to an ultimately
                    fatal result.</p>
                <p>Several varieties of dysentery are described in which the symptoms are modified
                    by the association of the disease with other morbid conditions. Thus the form
                    known as Malarial Dysentery is complicated with febrile attacks of an
                    intermittent character, and is frequently attended with hepatic, splenic, and
                    renal affections; while it is most successfully treated by remedies which are of
                    value in malarial diseases, such as quinine. Again, in Scorbutic Dysentery the
                    attack is accompanied with the great prostration characteristic of scorbutus,
                    and also with dangerous hemorrhage. Malignant Dysentery is the term applied to
                    those cases where all the symptoms are present in great intensity, and progress
                    rapidly to a fatal termination. Such cases are often attended with gangrene and
                    sloughing of the mucous membrane of the affected portion of the bowel.</p>
                <p>The dysentery poison appears to exert its effects upon the glandular structures
                    of the large intestine, particularly in its lower part. In the milder forms of
                    the disease there is simply a congested or inflamed condition of the mucous
                    membrane, with perhaps some inflammatory exudation on its surface, which is
                    passed off by the discharges from the bowels. But in the more severe forms
                    ulceration of the mucous membrane takes place. Commencing in and around the
                    solitary glands of the large intestine in the form of exudations, these ulcers,
                    small at first, enlarge and run into each other, till a large portion of the
                    bowel may be implicated in the ulcerative process. Should the disease be
                    arrested these ulcers may heal entirely, but occasionally they remain, causing
                    more or less disorganization of the coats of the intestines, as is often found
                    in chronic dysentery. Sometimes, though rarely, the ulcers perforate the
                    intestines, causing rapidly fatal inflammation of the peritoneum, or they may
                    erode a blood vessel and produce violent hemorrhage. Even where they undergo
                    healing they may cause such a stricture of the calibre of the intestinal canal
                    as to give rise to the symptoms of obstruction which ultimately prove fatal.</p>
                <p>The occurrence of abscess of the liver in connection with, attacks of dysentery
                    is frequently observed. It has been ascribed to the passage of morbid material
                    from the diseased intestine into the liver, but by many high authorities is
                    regarded more as a coincidence, depending upon the same climatic causes as those
                    which predispose to the dysentery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> Where the disease is endemic or is prevailing
                    epidemically, it is of great importance to use all preventive measures, and for
                    this purpose the avoidance of all causes likely to precipitate an attack is to
                    be enjoined. Exposure to cold after heat, the use of unripe fruit, and
                    intemperance in eating and drinking should be forbidden; and the utmost care
                    taken as to the quality of the food and drinking water. In houses or hospitals
                    where cases of the disease are under treatment, disinfectants should be freely
                    employed, and the evacuations of the patients removed as speedily as possible.
                    In the milder varieties of this complaint, such as those occurring sporadically,
                    and where the symptoms are probably due to matters in the bowels setting up the
                    dysenteric irritation, the employment of diaphoretic medicines is to be
                    recommended, and the administration of such a laxative as castor-oil, to which a
                    small quantity of laudanum has been added, will often, by removing the source of
                    the mischief, arrest the attack. In the severer forms of the disease, those,
                    namely, occurring in warm climates, the remedy most to be relied on is
                    ipecacuanha. This drug, which has long been known as possessing special efficacy
                    in dysentery (and was originally introduced into this country from Peru as the
                    <hi rend="italic">radix anHdysenterica),</hi> has proved of signal value in the
                    treatment of the disease in India, and, as shown by Dr Maclean, has diminished
                    the mortality to a remarkable extent. It is administered in full doses of 25-30
                    grains of the powder, which are repeated in from six to ten hours, gradually
                    lessening the quantity; the effect observable is a diminution in the pain, and
                    in the frequency and offensive character of the stools, along with the accession
                    of profuse perspiration and quiet sleep. Hot opiate fomentations applied to the
                    abdomen are of use in relieving the tenesmus. Ice may be freely taken to allay
                    thirst. The diet should be light, consisting of soups and farinaceous food. In
                    malarial dysentery quinine is the most successful remedy, ipecacuanha being
                    generally found to be Unsuitable; while in scorbutic dysentery the treatment
                    must bear reference to the depraved condition of the general health
                    characteristic of scorbutus. In this form <pb break="no"

                    India. In chronic dysentery the administration of astringents such as Dover’s
                    powder may be of service, but the chief points to be attended to are the
                    nourishing of the patient and the observance of judicious hygienic measures,
                    such as the due clothing of the body, the use of tonics, baths, &amp;c. A change
                    to a cooler climate often proves of great value. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi>
