                    >Duycker</hi> (Germ. <hi rend="italic">Tauch-ente—</hi> and in Bavaria <hi
                    rend="italic">Duck-antl),</hi> the general English name for a large number of
                    birds forming the greater part of the Family <hi rend="italic">Anatidae</hi> of
                    modem ornithologists. Technically the term Duck is restricted to the female, the
                    male being called Drake, and in one species Mallard (Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malart').</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anatidae</hi> may be at once divided into six more or less
                    well marked Subfamilies—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Cygninae</hi> or Swans, (2)
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anservnae</hi> or Geese—which are each very distinct, (3)
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anatinae</hi> or Freshwater-Ducks, (4) those commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">Fuligulinae</hi> or Sea-Ducks, (5) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Erismaturiuae</hi> or Spiny-tailed Ducks, and (6) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Merginae</hi> or Mergansers. Of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatinae,</hi> which may be considered the typical group, we propose to treat
                    here only, and especially of the <hi rend="italic">Anas boschas</hi> of
                    Linnaeus, the common Wild Duck, which from every point of view is by far the
                    most important species, as it is the most plentiful, the most widely
                    distributed, and the best known—being indeed the origin of all our domestic
                    breeds. It inhabits the greater part of the northern hemisphere, reaching in
                    winter so far as the Isthmus of Panama in the New World, and in the Old being
                    abundant at the same season in Egypt and India, while in summer it ranges
                    throughout the Fur-Countries, Greenland, Iceland, Lapland, and Siberia. Most of
                    those which fill our markets are no doubt bred in more northern climes, but a
                    considerable proportion of them are yet produced in the British Islands, though
                    not in anything like the numbers that used to be supplied before the draining of
                    the great Fen-country and other marshy places. The Wild Duck pairs very early in
                    the year—the period being somewhat delayed by hard weather, and the ceremonies
                    of courtship, which require some little time. Soon after these are performed,
                    the respective couples separate in search of suitable nesting-places, which are
                    generally found, by those that remain with us, about the middle of March. The
                    spot chosen is sometimes near <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0525-0506"/> a river or pond, but often very far removed from
                    water, and it may be under a furze-bush, on a dry heath, at the l&gt;ottom of a
                    thick hedge-row, or even in any convenient hole in a tree. A little dry grass is
                    generally collected, and on it the eggs, from 9 to 11 in number, are laid. So
                    soon as incubation commences the mother begins to divest herself of the down
                    which grows thickly beneath her breastfeathers, and adds it to the
                    nest-furniture, so that the eggs are deeply imbedded in this heat-retaining
                    substance—a portion of which she is always careful to pull, as a coverlet, over
                    her treasures when she quits them for food. She is seldom absent from the nest,
                    however, but once, or at most twice, a day, and then she dares not leave it
                    until her mate after several circling flights of observation has assured her she
                    may do so unobserved. Joining him the pair betake themselves to some quiet spot
                    where she may bathe and otherwise refresh herself. Then they return to the nest,
                    and after cautiously reconnoitring the neighbourhood, she loses no time in
                    reseating herself on her eggs, while he, when she is settled, repairs again to
                    the waters, and passes his day listlessly in the company of his brethren, who
                    have the same duties, hopes, and cares. Short and infrequent as are the absences
                    of the Duck when incubation begins, they become shorter and more infrequent
                    towards its close, and for the last day or two of the 28 necessary to develop
                    the young it is probable that she will not stir from the nest at all. When all
                    the fertile eggs are hatched her next care is to get the brood safely to the
                    water. This, when the distance is great, necessarily demands great caution, and
                    so cunningly is it done that but few persons have encountered the mother and
                    offspring as they make the dangerous journey.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When Ducks breed in trees, the precise way in
                    which the young get to the ground is still a matter of uncertainty. The mother
                    is supposed to convey them in her bill, and most likely does so, but further
                    observation on this point is required.</p></note> If disturbed the young
                    instantly hide as they best can, while the mother quacks loudly, feigns
                    lameness, and flutters off to divert the attention of the intruder from her
                    brood, who lie motionless at her warning notes. Once arrived at the water they
                    are comparatively free from harm, though other perils present themselves from
                    its inmates in the form of Pike and other voracious fishes, which seize the
                    Ducklings as they disport in quest of insects on the surface or dive beneath it.
                    Throughout the summer the Duck continues her care unremittingly, until the young
                    are full grown and feathered; but it is no part of the Mallard’s duty to look
                    after his offspring, and indeed he speedily becomes incapable of helping them,
                    for towards the end of May he begins to undergo that extraordinary additional
                    moult which has already been mentioned <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol.
                    iii. p. 776), loses the power of flight, and does not regain his full plumage
                    till autumn. About harvest-time the young are well able to shift for themselves,
                    and then resort to the corn-fields at evening, where they fatten on the
                    scattered grain. Towards the end of September or beginning of October both old
                    and young unite in large flocks and betake themselves to the larger waters, many
                    of which are fitted with the ingenious appliances for catching them known as
                    Decoys. These are worked on all favourable occasions during the winter, but the
                    numbers taken vary greatly—success depending so much on the state of the
                    weather. If long-continued frost prevail, most of the Ducks resort to the
                    estuaries and tidal rivers, or even leave these islands almost entirely. Soon
                    after Christmas the return-flight commences, and then begins anew the course of
                    life already described.</p>
                <p>The domestication of the Duck is doubtless very ancient, but evidence on this
                    head is exceedingly imperfect. Several distinct breeds have been established, of
                    which the most esteemed from an economical point of view are those known as the
                    Rouen and Aylesbury: but perhaps the most remarkable deviation, from the normal
                    form is the so-called Penguin-Duck, in which the bird assumes an upright
                    attitude and its wings are much diminished in size. A remarkable breed also is
                    that often named (though quite fancifully) the “Buenos-Ayres” Duck, wherein the
                    whole plumage is of a deep black, beautifully glossed or bronzed. But this
                    saturation, so to speak, of colour only lasts in the individual for a few years,
                    and as the birds grow older they become mottled with white, though as long as
                    their reproductive power lasts they “breed true.” The amount of variation in
                    domestic Ducks, however, is not comparable to that found among Pigeons, no doubt
                    from the absence of the competition which Pigeon-fanciers have so long
                    exercised. One of the most curious effects of domestication in the Duck,
                    however, is, that whereas the wild Mallard is not only strictly monogamous, but,
                    as Waterton believed, a most faithful husband—remaining paired for life, the
                    civilized Drake is notoriously polygamous.</p>
                <p>Very nearly allied to the common Wild Duck are a considerable number of species
                    found in various parts of the world in which there is little difference of
                    plumage between the sexes—both being of a dusky hue—such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anas obscura</hi> of North America, <hi rend="italic">A. superciliosa</hi> of
                    Australia, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">poecilorhyncha</hi> of
                    India, <hi rend="italic">A. melleri</hi> of Madagascar, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    xanthorhyncha</hi> of South Africa, and some others.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible here to enter upon the other genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatinae.</hi> We must content ourselves by saying that both in Europe and in
                    North America there are the groups represented by the Shoveller, Garganey,
                    Gadwall, Teal, Pintail, and Widgeon—each of which, according to some
                    systematists, is the type of a distinct genus. Then there is the group <hi
                    rend="italic">Aix</hi> with its beautiful representatives the Wood-Duck <hi
                    rend="italic">(A. sponsa)</hi> in America and the Mandarin-Duck (A. <hi
                    rend="italic">galericulatcC)</hi> in Eastern Asia. Besides there are the
                    Sheldrakes <hi rend="italic">(Tadornaf</hi> confined to the Old World and
                    remarkably developed in the Australian Region; the Musk-Duck (Cαmnα) of South
                    America, which is often domesticated and in that condition will produce fertile
                    hybrids with the common Duck; and finally the Tree-Ducks <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Den-drocygna),</hi> which are almost limited to the Tropics, <hi
