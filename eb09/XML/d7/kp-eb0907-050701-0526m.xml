                    (1704-1772), a French author, was born at Dinant, in Brittany, in 1704. At an

                    began to cultivate the society of the wits of the time, and became a member of
                    that club or association of young men who published their joint efforts in light

                    rend="italic">Jean, Oeufs de Pâques,</hi> &lt;fcc. His romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Acajou and Zirphile,</hi> which was composed after a series of
                    plates which had been engraved for another work, was one of the fruits of this
                    association, and was produced in consequence of a sort of wager amongst its
                    members. Duclos had previously written two other romances, which were more
                    favourably received— <hi rend="italic">The Baroness de Luz,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions of the Count de ***.</hi> His first serious
                    publication was the <hi rend="italic">History of Louis XI.</hi>, which is dry
                    and epigrammatical in style, but displays considerable powers of research and
                    impartiality. The reputation of Duclos as an author was confirmed by the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Considerations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur
                    les Moeurs,</hi> a work which is much and justly praised by Laharpe, as
                    containing a great deal of sound and ingenious reflection. It was translated
                    into English and German. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pour servir</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">I’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">du dix-huitième Siècle,</hi> which
                    were intended by the author as a sort of sequel to the preceding work, are
                    nevertheless much inferior in respect of both style and matter, and are, in
                    reality, little better than a kind of romance. In consequence of his <hi
                    rend="italic">History oj Louis XI.,</hi> he was appointed historiographer of
                    France, when that place became vacant on Voltaire’s retirement to Prussia. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Secret Memoirs of the reigns of Louis XIV and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Louis</hi><hi rend="italic">XV.,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Considerations on Italy,</hi> were not published until after the Revolution.
                    The former work is highly spoken of by Chamfort. Duclos became a member of the
                    Academy of Inscriptions in 1739, and of the French Academy in 1747. Of the
                    latter he was appointed perpetual secretary in 1755. Both academies were
                    indebted to him not only for many valuable contributions, but also for several
                    useful regulations and improvements. As a member of the Academy of Inscriptions,
                    he composed several memoirs on the Druids, on the origin and revolutions of the
                    Celtic and French languages, on trial by battle and proof by ordeal, and on
                    scenic representations and the ancient drama. As a member of the French Academy,
                    he assisted in compiling the new edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary,</hi> which was published in 1762; and he made some just and
                    philosophical remarks on the <hi rend="italic">Port Royal Grammar.</hi> On
                    several occasions he distinguished himself by vindicating the honour and
                    prerogatives of the societies to which he belonged, and the dignity of the
                    literary character in general. He used to say of himself, “I shall leave behind
                    me a name dear to literary men.” The citizens of Dinant, whose interests he
                    always supported with zeal, appointed him mayor of their town in 1744, though he
                    was resident at Paris. He was afterwards elected deputy from the commons to the
                    assembly of the states of Brittany; and upon the requisition of this body the
                    king granted him letters of nobility. In 1766 he was advised to retire from
                    France for some time, having rendered himself obnoxious to the Government by the
                    opinions he had expressed on the dispute between the Duc d’Aiguillon and M. de
                    la Chalotais, the friend and countryman of Duclos. Accordingly he set out for
                    Italy; and on his return he wrote an account of his travels, which is also
                    praised by Chamfort. He died at Paris, March 26, 1772, in the sixty-ninth year
                    of his age. The character of Duclos was singular in its union of impulsiveness
                    and prudence. Rousseau described him very laconically as a man <hi rend="italic"
                    >droit et adroit.</hi> In his manners he displayed a sort of bluntness in
                    society, which frequently rendered him disagreeable; and his caustic wit on many
                    occasions created enemies. To those who knew him, however, he was a pleasant
                    companion. A considerable number of his <hi rend="italic">bon mots</hi> have
                    been preserved by his biographers. A complete edition of the works of Duclos,
                    including an unfinished autobiography, was published by Desessarts, at Paris, in
                    10 vols. 8vo, 1806.</p>
