                    “Shoreham” frigate, and in 1749 he became a midshipman in the “Centurion.” In
                    1755 he was appointed second lieutenant of the “Norwich,” a fourth-rate; but on
                    the arrival of that ship in America, whither, with the rest of Keppel’s
                    squadron, it had convoyed General Braddock’s forces, he was transferred to the
                    “Centurion.” Once again in England, he was promoted to be second lieutenant of
                    the “Torbay,” 7 4, and after three years on the home station he assisted in the
                    attack on the French settlement of Goree, on the African coast, in which he was
                    slightly wounded. He returned to England as first lieutenant of the “Torbay;”
                    and in 1759 was made a commander, and in 1761 a post-captain. His vessel,
                    the</p>
                <p>“Valiant,” was Commodore Keppel’s flag-ship in the expedition against Belleisle
                    in that year, and also in 1762, when it took an important part in the capture of
                    Havana. In 1778, on the recommencement of war with France, Captain Duncan was
                    appointed to the “Suffolk,” whence before the close of the year he removed to
                    the “Monarch,” one of the Channel Fleet. On January 16,1780, in an action off
                    Cape St Vincent, between a Spanish squadron under Don Juan de Langara and the
                    British fleet under Sir George Rodney, Captain Duncan in the “Monarch” was the
                    first to engage the enemy; and in 1782, as captain of the “Blenheim,”he took
                    part in Lord Howe’s relief of Gibralta;·. From the rank of rear-admiral of the
                    blue, received in 1789, he was gradually promoted until, in 1799, he became
                    admiral of the white. In February 1795 he hoisted his flag as commander-in-chief
                    of the North-Sea fleet, appointed to harass the Batavian navy. Towards the end
                    of May 1797, though, in consequence of the wide-spread mutiny in the British
                    fleet, he had been left with only the “Adamant,” 50, besides his own ship the
                    “Venerable,” 74, Admiral Duncan proceeded to his usual station off the Texel,
                    where lay at anchor the Dutch squadron of fifteen sail of the line, under the
                    command of Vice-Admiral De Winter. From time to time he caused signals to be
                    made, as if to the main body of a fleet in the offing, a stratagem which
                    probably was the cause of his freedom from molestation until, in the middle of
                    June, reinforcements arrived from England. On October 3 the admiral put into
                    Yarmouth Roads to refit and victual his ships, but, receiving information early
                    on the 9th that the enemy was at sea, he immediately hoisted the signal for
                    giving him chase. On the morning of the 11th De Winter’s fleet, consisting of
                    four seventy-fours, seven sixty-fours, four fifty-gun ships, two forty-four-gun
                    frigates, and two of thirty-two guns, besides smaller vessels, was sighted lying
                    about nine miles from shore, between the villages of Egmont and Camperdown. The
                    British fleet numbered seven seventy-fours, seven sixty-fours, two fifties, two
                    frigates, with a sloop and several cutters, and was slightly superior in force
                    to that of the Dutch. Shortly after mid-day the British ships, without waiting
                    to form in order, broke through the Dutch line, and an engagement commenced
                    which, after heavy loss on both sides, resulted in the taking by the British of
                    eleven of the enemy’s vessels. When the action ceased the ships were in nine
                    fathoms water, within five miles of a lee shore, and there was every sign of an
                    approaching gale. So battered were the prizes that it was found impossible to
                    fit them for future service, and one of them, the “Delft,” sank on her way to
                    England. In recognition of this victory, Admiral Duncan was, on October 21,
                    created Lord Viscount Duncan of Camperdown, and baron of Lundie, with an annual
                    pension of £3000 to himself and the two next heirs to his title. In 1800 Lord
                    Duncan withdrew from naval service. He died August 4, 1804.</p>
