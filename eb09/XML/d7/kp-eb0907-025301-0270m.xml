                <p><label type="entry">DIPLOMATICS</label>, the science derived from the study of
                    ancient diplomas, so called from being written on two leaves, or on double
                    tablets. The Romans used the term more specially for the letters of licence to
                    use the public conveyances provided at the different stations, and generally for
                    public grants. Subsequently it attained a more extended signification, and in
                    more modern times has been used as a general term for ancient imperial and
                    ecclesiastical acts and grants, public treaties, deeds of conveyance, letters,
                    wills, and similar instruments, drawn up in forms and marked with peculiarities
                    varying with their dates and countries. With the revival of literature, the
                    importance of such documents in verifying facts and establishing public and
                    private rights led to their being brought together from the historical works and
                    the monastic registers in which they had been copied, or, in rarer instances,
                    from public and ecclesiastical archives where the originals were still
                    preserved. Then arose questions of authenticity, and doubts of the so-called
                    originals; disputants defended or condemned them; and, in order to establish
                    principles for distinguishing the genuine from the forged, treatises were
                    written on the whole subject of these diplomas. With a view to establish the
                    credit of those preserved in the original, the Benedictine, Dorn Mabillon, in
                    the year 1681 produced his masterly work <hi rend="italic">De re
                    diplomatica,—</hi> Papebroch, the Jesuit, having already, in the year 1675,
                    written his <hi rend="italic">Propilaeum</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the following century appeared the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de Diplomatique,</hi> by Dorn
                    Toustain (who, however, died before the completion of the work) and Dorn Tassin,
                    Benedictines of the congregation of St Maur, 6 vols. 4to, 1750-1765, treating of
                    the whole subject of diplomas, and accordingly entering at length into a minute
                    investigation of the peculiarities and characteristics of writing proper to
                    different ages and countries. Thus treatises on the subject of diplomas gave the
                    name of diplomatics to the study of ancient writing, now more properly termed
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Palaeography,</hi> under which it will be separately
                    treated.</p>
                <p>Imperial decrees and privileges, public acts and treaties, and, no doubt,
                    contracts between private persons, were in remote times inscribed on marble and
                    stone, on wood and on metal. The wonderfully preserved monuments of ancient
                    Nineveh show the prevalent use of sun-burnt brick. Tn Egypt papyrus was used
                    from the remotest times. The Greeks and Romans recorded public documents on
                    wooden tablets, on stone, bronze, lead, and ivory, as well as on papyrus,
                    parchment, and other substances. Tablets of wax served for letters and writings
                    of various kinds, but must have been unsuitable for public acts. Pliny speaks of
                    the use of rolls of lead and of linen. There are many Greek documents preserved
                    in the British Museum, the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, and elsewhere, such
                    as royal letters, petitions, contracts, and wills, of the time of the Ptolemies,
                    written on papyrus. See <hi rend="italic">Notices</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Extraits des Manuscrits,</hi> tome xviii., with plates. The Byzantine emperors
                    often used golden and coloured inks from the 8th to the 12th century.</p>
                <p>We know that archives were provided by the Romans for the preservation of their
                    public acts; but fire and war have been the great destroyers of these documents
                    so precious to the historian. Suetonius relates that Vespasian undertook to
                    restore from copies 3000 brazen tablets, containing most ancient records, dating
                    almost from the beginning of the republic, which had been consumed when the
                    Capitol was burnt. Original documents of the nature of diplomas, written in
                    Latin, are now not forthcoming of an earlier period than the 5th century. The
                    acts emanating from royal authority anterior to the 13 th century are almost
                    exclusively derived from ecclesiastical archives, and consist of foundations of
                    monasteries, and grants of property, privileges, and immunities. In England,
                    from the 13th century they are systematically registered in the royal chancery;
                    the series of rolls in which they are written, under different classes, is very
                    complete from the reign of King John. History is greatly indebted to the care
                    with which religious houses registered their title deeds. From an early time it
                    was their practise to copy them into volumes, arranging them generally under the
                    name of the property. Chartularies of this character of the lθth century are
                    still extant. The chartulary of Winchester Abbey, compiled early in the 12 th
                    century, and containing numerous documents of the time before the Conquest, is
                    in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Imperial acts affecting the state at large were proclaimed through the governors
                    of provinces; as in later times, in England royal writs and ordinances were
                    addressed to the sheriffs of the several counties. In England, it would seem,
                    when the object was to appeal to the people, the document was publicly
                    exhibited. When Edward III. landed, as Prince of Walès, on the Yorkshire coast,
                    with the design of overthrowing his father’s government, he drew up a manifesto
                    of his purposes, addressed to the citizens of London, who exhibited it on the
                    cross in the Cheap, placing copies in their windows <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chron.</hi><hi rend="italic">Monasterii</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Melsaſt</hi></p>
                <p>At all times diplomas have been drawn very much in set forms. The Romans employed
                    official clerks, <hi rend="italic">{scribcfi),</hi> assigning them to the
                    different magistrates. Under the empire they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tabelliones,</hi> and act as public notaries. After the breaking up of the
                    Roman empire, there was a period when the chanceries of the new states were
                    imperfectly served. The notarial science was partially Jost, and, in the general
                    neglect of learning, the composing a public act or private document was a task
                    of difficulty. In the 7th century the monk Marculfus composed a formulary for
                    guidance in drawing up documents of various kinds. It was first published by
                    Bignon in 1613. In Migne’s edition, <hi rend="italic">Patrologioe Cursus,</hi>
                    vol. xxxvii., it is accompanied with several anonymous compilations of the same
                    character. In the 12th and 13th centuries we meet with works of the same kind
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">de arte dictaminum.</hi> A very interesting
                    collection of precedents of royal warrants, state letters, papal bulls, and
                    other documents, arranged under many heads of subjects, was compiled by the
                    English poet Occleve, while he was a clerk in the council office at the
                    beginning of the 15th century, and is now in the British Museum. We are best
                    able to understand the nature of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0271-0254"/> early diplomas by examining the originals, still
                    extant, on papyrus or parchment, which go back in date to the 5th oentury. The
                    oldest come chiefly from Ravenna. They have been commented on by Maffei in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Istoria diplomatica,</hi> 1727, and printed in full with
                    facsimiles in the <hi rend="italic">Papiri diplomatid</hi> of the Abbate
                    Marino-Marini, 1805. A considerable number of the original diplomas of the
                    Merovingian and succeeding sovereigns of France have also been preserved, and
                    have been published in facsimile (Letronne, <hi rend="italic">Diplomata</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Charta),</hi> and in letterpress. England also can boast of a
                    series of very beautifully written royal charters from the 7th century. The
                    larger number of them are in the British Museum, and are in course of
                    publication in facsimile <hi rend="italic">{Facsimiles of Ancient Charters,</hi>
                    parts i. ü. iii,). Many original papal bulls, too, of an early date, are still
                    extant, in different repositories.</p>
                <p>There is a general uniformity in the diplomas of the earlier times. Taking the
                    French series as examples, we find a regularity of formulas in the following
                    order :—</p>
                <p>1. An invocation, as <hi rend="italic">In nomine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >domini</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi><hi rend="italic">Salvatoris
                    nostri</hi><hi rend="italic">Jesu</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">2.</hi> The name and style of the sovereign, and the narµe and
                    title of the person addressed. In the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries, the style of
                    the French kings was in general <hi rend="italic">N. Francorum rex, vir
                    inluster;</hi> Pepin added <hi rend="italic">Dei Gratia.</hi> From the time of
                    Louis le Débonnaire the form was <hi rend="italic">Divina ordinante</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">propitiante, annuente,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">favente)
                    providentia (clementia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">misericordia).</hi> Popes
                    called themselves simply bishop until the end of the 11th century, when, or only
                    rarely before, they used the title <hi rend="italic">Papa.</hi> Gregory the
                    Great (590-604) introduced the form <hi rend="italic">servus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">servorum Dei.</hi> They placed their name before or after that of
                    the person addressed indifferently, before the 10th century, when the custom
                    prevailed to give it precedence.</p>
                <p>3. A preamble, consisting of a moral or religions reflexion, or a recital of the
                    motives to the grant. In the earlier times the moral sentiment is expressed
                    briefly, as <hi rend="italic">Memor</hi><hi rend="italic">finis mei,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Paenas</hi><hi rend="italic">inferni cupiens effuger»</hi>; but
                    later on it is often of great length and in inflated language, with admixture of
                    barbarized Greek words.</p>
                <p>4. The substance of the act or donation.</p>
                <p>5. A protecting clause, in the nature of an imprecation on such as should
                    infringe the privilege granted, or thwart the object of the act. It is first met
                    with in papal bulls of the 6th century, and appears in an exaggerated form in a
                    later time, the bitterest curses being heaped on the hypothetical offender
                    without measure. The papal type is closely followed in French and English
                    diplomas. In the 12th century it took a milder form, as in papal bulls, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nulli</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo</hi><hi rend="italic">hominum
                    liceat,</hi> &amp;c. In the 10th and 11th centuries the commin-atory clause was
                    often placed after the date, having sometimes been previously introduced into
                    the text.</p>
                <p>6. The Merovingian sovereigns authenticated their diplomas by the addition of
                    their signature. Those who were unable to write signed with their monogram. The
                    Carlovingians signed with a monogram, and the same form prevailed from the 9th
                    century in Germany and Italy. It ceased to be used in France in the 14th
                    century.· The clergy adopted the use of the monogram in the 11th and 12th
                    centuries. It is not found in the charters of English sovereigns. In the earlier
                    times the monogram was formed of letters of tall cursive character; capitals and
                    uncials were afterwards riιore commonly used. Sometimes the word <hi
                    rend="italic">rex</hi> was added. It is possible that the monogram was in some
                    instances entered by the hand of the sovereign, for so much is indicated by the
                    words in which it is introduced, but it was usually added by the chancellor or
                    scribe. It was not used for some kinds of documents, as judgments, decrees, and
                    mandates. In acts of the later Roman emperors, the form of subscription is
                    simply the word <hi rend="italic">Legi,</hi> with a cross prefixed, as in a
                    diploma of Valentinian, printed by Marini, p. 94. The name of the referendary or
                    chancellor, with the expression <hi rend="italic">optulit,</hi> was in France,
                    in the earliest time, inserted before, subsequently after, the subscription of
                    the monarch. A paraph of the word <hi rend="italic">subscripsi,</hi> and often
                    tironian notes, accompanied the subscriptions. Sometimes in royal diplomas, and
                    commonly in private charters, the names of several witnesses were subscribed,
                    each preceded by the word <hi rend="italic">signum,</hi> with a cross, or
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">subscripsi.</hi> The popes, in their bulls,
                    originally used the form of <hi rend="italic">Bene valète,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Deus te</hi><hi rend="italic">incolumem servet,</hi> in place of
                    subscription of their name, which they applied only to synodal and other public
                    acts. At the beginning of the 9th century they used their monogram. In the 14th
                    century they signed with their own hand. In the 9th century also began the
                    practice of adding the subscriptions of cardinals, but it was not commonly
                    followed until the middle of the 12th Oentury. Sentences from the Scriptures
                    were used by popes for a signature, instead of their names, in consistorial
                    bulls in the 11th cehtury. English kings, before the Conquest, neither signed
                    their name nor used a monogram. They affixed the sign of the cross— the scribe
                    adding <hi rend="italic">Signum</hi><hi rend="italic">manus N. regis,</hi> or
                    valuations of the form.</p>
                <p>7. Dating clause. In France, this followed the subscription and attestation. The
                    manner of dating varied at different times, and in different countries. In
                    diplomas of the emperors, the year is not expressed. For example, an act of
                    Valentinian of about 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> has simply the words,
                    <hi rend="italic">Dot. sexto idus</hi><hi rend="italic">Januarii,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ravennae.</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">Legi.</hi>
                    The Merovingian kings and their successors dated by their regnal years, adding
                    the day of the month, the place, and generally the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >feliciter.</hi> Some dated from epochs in their reign, as Louis le Débonnaire
                    from Easter 781, the day of his coronation at Rome; from September 813, when he
                    was associated in the imperial power; and from the 28th of January 814, the day
                    of his accession after the death of Charlemagne.</p>
                <p>The year of the incarnation was seldom used by the French kings before the end of
                    the 9th century. In England it was generally added to royal charters in the
                    times preceding the Conquest, but, subsequently to the death of William the
                    Conqueror, was very rarely used in public or private deeds until the 13th
                    century. The English charters of the early period often added also the regnal
                    year and papal indiction. In papal bulls the date was given by the names of
                    consuls from 385 to 546; by years of the Greek emperors from 550 to 772; by
                    years of emperors of the west from 802 to 1047, and in 1111; and by years of the
                    pontificate as early as the year 781, but often still by the year of the
                    emperor, or by both together, eventually by the year of the pontificate alone.
                    The year of the incarnation is found in bulls as early as the 7th century, and
                    came into ordinary use in 968. Up to 1088, in the papal dominions, the year was
                    calculated from the 25th of December; subsequently the Florentine and Pisan
                    years were used, the former beginning three months after the nativity, the other
                    nine months before it. The indiction was also added :—from 584 to 1087, that of
                    Constantinople, beginning on the 1st of September; afterwards the Constantinian,
                    or Caesarean, beginning on the 25th of September, and the Papal, beginning on
                    the 1st of January. These dates were accumulated principally in the bulls; in
                    the briefs the year is rarely designated from 1086 to 1124, and is always
                    wanting from 1124 to 1187. (See Jaffé, <hi rend="italic">Regesta Pontificum
                    Romanorum.)</hi></p>
                <p>An additional security was given to diplomas by the seal, —the antiquity (going
                    back to remotest ages), the form, colour, substance, and use of which are
                    treated of at great length in works on diplomatics (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Seals).</hi> It was in use by the popes from the earliest time, and under the
                    Merovingian kings and their successors; but by the great feudatories only from
                    the 10th century. In England it is not found during the Saxon period, saving in
                    a few instances in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The use of it came in with
                    the Conquest and became general. The popes’ seals were of lead, or in rare
                    instances of gold, and suspended to the document. The precious material was
                    introduced by Charlemagne, and was freely employed by the emperors of
                    Constantinople, who with their principal officers used metal seals. In France,
                    under the Merovingians, and elsewhere at the same period, the seal was of white
                    wax, fixed “en placard,” or to the surface of the document. From the 10th
                    century, it was suspended, first by a parchment label, afterwards by cords of
                    silk or other substances. The colour of the cords by which papal <hi
                    rend="italic">bullae</hi> were attached varies under different pontiffs. White
                    wax, but of various qualities, was in use to the 13th century, in which and
                    subsequently it was coloured chiefly yellow, red, or green. The quality of the
                    wax, the shape, the legend or inscription, the character of the charge or
                    device—which was sometimes the impression of an antique gem—all these change
                    with the progress of time and become evidence of age.</p>

                <p>English charters of the Saxon period have forms in many respects different from
                    those of foreign diplomas. Variations have been already noticed, as, that the
                    king signed neither with his name nor with his monogram, but only with a cross,
                    and that they were dated from the incarnation. It would appear, indeed, that the
                    charters were not drawn up by an officer of the chancery, as in France, but were
                    composed and written by ecclesiastics, whose services were employed for the
                    occasion. In the grant of the monastery of Reculver to Christ Church,
                    Canterbury, by King Eadred, in the year 949, to which Dunstan, then abbot of
                    Glastonbury, and one of the king’s principal ministers is a witness, he states
                    that he both drew up the form and wrote the document with his own hand. It is on
                    this account that we find in English charters before the Conquest a variety of
                    styles of writing, even in those of the same date; whereas on the Continent the
                    writing is uniform in the several states. In the absence of a strictly official
                    character, the grant was attested by numerous witnesses, varying from four or
                    five, the more ordinary number in the earlier times, to from 30 to 100
                    subsequently. For it was always an object with the religious houses in whose
                    favour a grant was made to fortify its authority and secure its recognition by
                    impressive solemnities. They made the benefaction a religious act by inviting
                    the grantor to offer the charter to God on the altar of their church; and they
                    obtained the approval and attestations of the members of the court, or of the
                    council over which the king might be at the time presiding. The names which are
                    subscribed to the English charters add greatly to their historical value. A
                    difference in another respect from the foreign type is attended with advantage
                    to the study of both the language and manners of the time. The property conveyed
                    was defined by a minute description of its boundaries, written in English; and,
                    as the documents are dated and can generally be referred to special localities,
                    dialectic differences and the formation of names, with other incidental lights
                    on subjects of antiquity, are preserved. In English charters of as early a date
                    as the 9th century, and from that time onwards, is sometimes found, at the top
                    or the bottom, the upper or lower half of an inscription. It is often the word
                    <hi rend="italic">chirographum,</hi> but sometimes other words, or merely
                    letters. It was used when it was an object that two parties to a contract should
                    each have a copy of the deed, which accordingly was written in duplicate on one
                    skin; the inscription was written in large letters between the copies, and the
                    skin was then divided. The line of division was at a later period generally
                    indented, and the document was called an indenture. The custom was not
                    introduced into France until the middle of the 11th century.</p>
                <p>The practise of forging and falsifying diplomas, ecclesiastical constitutions,
                    and documents of all kinds is traced back to very early times. The laws of the
                    Visigoths of the 7th century enact severe punishments on offenders of this
                    class, as do the <hi rend="italic">Capitularia</hi> of Charlemagne. The English
                    chronicler ïïoveden, under the year 1196, gives an account of wholesale
                    forgeries of papal bulls and briefs by an agent of the archbishop of York. A
                    decretal of Innocent III. (1195-1216) gives rules for detecting fabricated bulls
                    <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> i. 201, ed. Baluz.). It. was so easy to impose
                    upon the ignorance of people, and the temptations to falsify were so great, that
                    we cannot doulot it was done extensively. The science of diplomatics professes
                    to give the power to detect these forgeries. The two concluding books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveau</hi><hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Diplomatique</hi> treat of the subject at great length, but the rules given for
                    distinguishing the true from the false document can only be applied by one who
                    is practically versed in the study. In passing judgment on a professed original,
                    not only the foimulas, historical facts, and date have to ba tested, but the
                    external features have to be regarded—the material, the ink, the forms of
                    abbreviation and character of writing, and the seal; and the properties and
                    characteristics of these cannot well be learnt from written instruction. They
                    are treated of in works on the general subject of palaeography.</p>
