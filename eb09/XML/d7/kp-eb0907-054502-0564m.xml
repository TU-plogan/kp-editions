                    the foremost of the schoolmen, was born in the latter half of the 13 th century.
                    The year and place of his birth are both uncertain. For the date 1265 and 1275
                    have been assigned, without any decisive evidence in favour of either. The form
                    of the surname seems to support the claim of Dunse, in Berwickshire, as the
                    place, though the same ground has been pled, with less plausibility it must be
                    admitted, for Downpatrick (Dunum) in Ireland, and for the village of Dunstane in
                    Northumberland. In favour of Dunstane a statement at the close of a manuscript
                    copy of the work of Duns Scotus, contained in the library of Merton College,
                    Oxford, has been quoted; but this, though it states expressly that the author
                    was born at Dunstane, is inconclusive. The rival claims of England, Scotland,
                    and Ireland have been naturally enough advocated by natives of the three
                    countries respectively, Leland, Dempster, and Wadding, and have been the subject
                    of considerable controversy, into which it would be a waste of time to enter. It
                    is noteworthy, however, as a curiosity of literature, that Dempster published a
                    quarto volume, the main object oξ which was to prove by twelve distinct
                    arguments that Duns Scotus was a Scotchman. It is said that when he was a boy
                    his extraordinary ability was observed by two Franciscan friars, who took him to
                    their convent at Newcastle. Whether this be so or not it seems certain that he
                    joined the Franciscan order in early life, and that he studied at Merton
                    College, Oxford, of which he was made a fellow. According to Wadding, he became
                    remarkably proficient in all branches of learning, but especially in
                    mathematics. When his master, William Varron, removed to Paris in 1301, Duns
                    Scotus was appointed to succeed him as professor of philosophy. His lectures
                    attracted an immense number of students, though the story that in his day the
                    university was attended by no less than 30,000 is probably a gross exaggeration.
                    He was removed to Paris, probably in 1304, though the precise date is uncertain.
                    In 1307 he received his doctor’s degree from the university of Paris, and in the
                    same year he was appointed regent of the theological school. His connection with
                    the university was made memorable by his defence of the doctrine of the
                    Immaculate Conception, in which he displayed such dialectical ingenuity as to
                    win for himself the title <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Subtilis.</hi> According to the account that is usually given he refuted one by
                    one no less than two hundred objections urged against the doctrine by the
                    Dominicans, and established his own position by “a cloud” of arguments. The
                    doctrine continued long to be one of the main subjects in dispute between the
                    Scotists and the Thomists, or, what is almost the same thing, between the
                    Franciscans and the Dominicans. To judge from its subsequent acts, the
                    university of Paris seems to have been deeply and lastingly impressed by the
                    arguments of Duns Scotu3. In 1387 it formally condemned the Thomist doctrine,
                    and a century afterwards it required all who received the doctor’s degree to
                    bind themselves by an oath to defend the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.
                    In 1308 Duns Scotus was sent by the general of his order to Cologne with the
                    twofold object of engaging in a controversy with the Beghards and of assisting
                    in the foundation of a university. He was received with great ceremony by the
                    magistrates and nobles of the city. After a very short residence, however, he
                    died of apoplexy on the 8th November 1308. The story told by Paulus Jovius, that
                    on his grave being opened some time after his death his body was found to have
                    turned in the coffin, from which it was inferred that he had been buried alive,
                    is generally regarded as fabulous.</p>
                <p>Duns Scotus was one of the great leaders of scholastic thought, and, as a full
                    account of his philosophical system must therefore necessarily be given in the
                    general article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Scholasticism,</hi> a brief indication
                    of its leading points will suffice here. It may be noted at the outset that the
                    philosophical position of Duns Scotus was determined, or at least very greatly
                    influenced, by the antagonism that existed between the Dominicans and the
                    Franciscans. Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican, Duns Scotus was a Franciscan; and
                    hence arose the schism between the Thomists and the Scotists. Aquinas ranks in
                    philosophy with the realists as well as Duns Scotus, but his view in regard to
                    the great philosophical controversy of the Middle Ages was a modified or
                    eclectic one in comparison <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> with that of Duns
                    Scotus, who is the true representative and apostle of scholastic realism.
                    Theologically, the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was the great subject
                    in dispute between the two parties. There were, however, differences of a wider
                    and deeper kind. In opposition to Aquinas, who maintained that reason and
                    revelation were two independent sources of knowledge, Duns Scotus held that
                    there was no true knowledge of anything knowable apart from theology as based
                    upon revelation. In conformity with this principle he denied that the existence
                    of God was capable of being proved, or that the nature of God was capable of
                    being comprehended. He therefore rejected as worthless the ontological proof
                    offered by Aquinas <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Another chief point of
                    difference with Aquinas was in regard to the freedom of the will, which Dims
                    Scotus maintained absolutely. He held also in an unqualified form the doctrine
                    of predestination, and he reconciled free-will and necessity by representing the
                    divine decree not as temporally antecedent, but as immediately related to the
                    action of the created will. He maintained, in opposition to Aquinas, that the
                    will was independent of the understanding, that only will could affect wilL From
                    this difference as to the nature of free-will followed by necessary consequence
                    a difference with the Thomists as to the operation of divine grace. In ethics
                    the distinction he drew between natural and theological virtues is common to him
                    with the rest of the schoolmen, among others with his great opponent. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Aquinas,</hi> vol. ii. p. 232-3.) Duns Scotus strongly upheld
                    the authority of the church, making it the ultimate authority on which that of
                    Scripture depends.</p>

                <p>The works of Duns Scotus were very numerous, though in the collection edited by
                    Luke Wadding, a Franciscan (12 vols, fol., Lyons, 1639), several are ascribed to
                    him without sufficient ground. This edition contains a life full of legends,
                    which was reprinted separately (Mons, 1644). The most important of the works of
                    Duns Scotus consisted of questions and commentaries on the writings of
                    Aristotle, and on the <hi rend="italic">Sentences</hi> of Lombard.</p>
