                <p><label type="entry">DEFOE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel</hi></label> (1661-1731),
                    was born in London in the year 1661, in the parish of St Giles, Cripplegate.
                    Neither the exact date nor place of his birth is known, nor is his baptism
                    recorded, probably because he was of a nonconformist family. Hardly anything is
                    known of his ancestors; his grandfather, Daniel Foe, is said to have been a
                    squire or wealthy yeoman at Elton, in Huntingdonshire (not Northamptonshire, as
                    more generally stated), and to have kept a pack of hounds; but the authority for
                    the former statement seems to be mainly traditional, and for the latter we have
                    merely an anecdote in one of Defoe’s newspaper articles, which is at least as
                    likely to have been fiction as fact. Attempts have been made, but merely
                    fancifully, to trace the name to Vaux, Fawkes, or even Devereux. As to the
                    variation Defoe or Foe it is to be noticed that its owner signed either
                    indifferently till a late period of his life, and that his initials where they
                    occur are sometimes D. F. and sometimes D. D. F. Mr Lee’s conjecture, that the
                    later form originated in his being called Mr D. Foe to distinguish him from his
                    father, seems not unlikely. It may be added that three autograph letters of his
                    are extant, all addressed in 1705 to the same person, and signed respectively D.
                    Foe, de Foe, and Daniel Defoe.</p>
                <p>James Foe, the father of the author of <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe,</hi>
                    was a butcher and a citizen of London. Of his mother nothing is known. Daniel
                    was chiefly educated at a famous dissenting academy, Mr Morton’s of Stoke
                    Newington, where many of the celebrated nonconformists of the time were brought
                    up. It is noteworthy that one of his schoolfellows suggested the unusual name of
                    Crusoe. In after life Defoe frequently asserted the sufficiency of his education
                    and the excellence of the methods observed by his teacher. Judging from his
                    writings his stock of general information must have been far larger than that of
                    most regularly educated men of his day; but it is probable that his attainments
                    were in no particular line very exquisite or profound. With very few exceptions
                    all the known events of Defoe’s life are connected with authorship. In the older
                    catalogues of his works two pamphlets, <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Crapegownorum</hi> (a satire on the clergy) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Treatise against the Turks,</hi> are attributed to him before the accession
                    of James IL, but there seems to be no publication of his which is certainly
                    genuine before <hi rend="italic">The Character of Dr Annesley,</hi> the family
                    minister, published in 1697. He had, however, before this (if we may trust
                    tradition) played an active part in public affairs. He had taken up arms in
                    Monmouth’s expedition, and is supposed to have owed his lucky escape from the
                    clutches of the king’s troopsand the law, into which not a few of his
                    school-fellows fell, to the fact of his being a Londoner, and therefore a
                    stranger in the west country. On January 26,1688, he was admitted a liveryman of
                    the city of London, having claimed his freedom by birth. Since his western
                    escapade he had taken to the business of wholesale hosiery. At the entry of
                    William and Mary into London he is said to have served as a volunteer trooper
                    “gallantly mounted and richly accoutred.” In these days he lived at Tooting, and
                    was instrumental in forming a dissenting congregation at that place. His
                    business operations at this period appear to have been extensive and various. He
                    would seem both now and later to have been a sort of commission merchant,
                    especially in Spanish and Portuguese goods, and at some time or other he visited
                    Spain on business. Later we hear him spoken of as “a civet-cat merchant,” but as
                    he can hardly have kept a menagerie of these animals it is odd that no one has
                    supposed that the civet-cat was the sign of his place of business (it was a very
                    usual one) rather than the staple of his trade. In 1692 his mercantile
                    operations came to a disastrous close, and he failed for £17,000. By his own
                    account the disaster would seem to have arisen from relying too much on credit.
                    His misfortunes made him write both feelingly and forcibly on the bankruptcy
                    laws; and although his creditors accepted a composition, he afterwards
                    honourably paid them in full, a fact attested by independent and not very
                    friendly witnesses. Subsequently, he undertook first the secretaryship and then
                    the managership and chief ownership of some tileworks at Tilbury, but here also
                    he was unfortunate, and his imprisonment (of which more hereafter) in 1703
                    brought the works to a stand-still, and thereby lost him £3000 From this time
                    forward we hear of no settled business in which he engaged. He evidently,
                    however, continued to undertake commissions, and made his political visits to
                    Scotland an occasion for opening connections of this kind with that country. In
                    the last thirty years of his life business played but a subordinate part, though
                    he seems to have derived more profit from it than from his earlier ventures. It
                    was probably at the time of his troubles in 1692 that he had occasion to visit
                    Bristol, where—according to a local tradition—he lay <hi rend="italic"
                    >perdu</hi> for fear of bailiffs all the week, but emerged in gorgeous raiment
                    on Sunday, whence he was known by the nickname of “the Sunday gentleman.”</p>
                <p>It was not as a business man that Defoe was to make his mark, though his business
                    experiences coloured to some extent the literary productions to which he owes
                    his fame. The course of his life was determined about the middle of the reign of
                    William III. by his introduction (we know not how) to William himself and to
                    other influential persons. He frequently boasts of his personal intimacy with
                    the “glorious and immortal” king (epithets, by the way, to the invention of
                    which he has considerable claim), and in 1695 he was appointed accountant to the
                    commissioners of the glass duty, which office he held for four years. During
                    this time he produced (January 1698) his <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Projects,</hi> one of the first and not the least noteworthy of his works. This
                    essay contains suggestions on banks, road-management, friendly and insurance
                    societies of various kinds, idiot asylums, bankruptcy, academies (in the French
                    sense), <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0036-0027"/> military colleges, high schools for women,
                    &amp;c. It displays Defoe’s lively and lucid style in full vigour, and abounds
                    with ingenious thoughts and apt illustrations, though it illustrates also the
                    unsystematic character of his mind. In the same year Defoe wrote the first of a
                    long series of pamphlets on the then burning question of occasional conformity.
                    In this, for the first time, he showed the unlucky independence which, in so
                    many other instances, united all parties against him. On the one hand he pointed
                    out to the dissenters the scandalous inconsistency of their playing fast and
                    loose with sacred things, and on the other he denounced the impropriety of
                    requiring tests at all. In direct support of the Government he published,
                    towards the close of the reign, a <hi rend="italic">Defence of Standing
                    Armies,</hi> against Trenchard, and a set of pamphlets on the Partition Treaty
                    Thus in political matters he had the same fate as in ecclesiastical; for the
                    Whigs were no more prepared than the Tories to support William through thick and
                    thin. He also dealt with the questions of stock-jobbing and of electioneering
                    corruption. But his most remarkable publication at this time—the publication,
                    indeed, as the author of which he became famous—was <hi rend="italic">The
                    True-Born Englishman,</hi> a satire in rough but extremely vigorous verse on the
                    national objection to William as a foreigner, and on the claim of purity of
                    blood for a nation which Defoe chooses to represent as crossed and dashed with
                    all the strains and races in Europe. He also took a prominent part in the
                    proceedings which followed the famous Kentish petition, and was the author, and
                    some say the presenter, of the equally famous <hi rend="italic">Legion
                    Memorial,</hi> which asserted in the strongest terms the supremacy of the
                    electors over the elected, and of which even an irate House of Commons did not
                    dare to take any great notice. The theory of the indefeasible supremacy of the
                    freeholders of England, whose delegates merely (according to this theory) the
                    Commons were, was one of Defoe’s favourite political tenets, and he returned to
                    it in a most powerfully written tract entitled <hi rend="italic">The Original
                    Power of the Collective Body of the People of England examined and
                    asserted.</hi> At the same time he was occupied in a controversy on the
                    conformity question with the well-known John How (usually spelt Howe at
                    present), and wrote several minor political tracts.</p>
                <p>The death of William was a great misfortune to Defoe, and he soon felt the power
                    of his adversaries. After publishing <hi rend="italic">The Mock Mourners,</hi>
                    intended to satirize and rebuke the outbreak of Jacobite joy at the king’s
                    death, he turned his attention once more to ecclesiastical subjects, and, in an
                    evil hour for himself, wrote the famous <hi rend="italic">Shortest Way with the
                    Dissenters.</hi> The traditional criticism of this remarkable pamphlet is a most
                    curious example of the way in which thoroughly inappropriate descriptions of
                    books pass from mouth to mouth. Every commentator (with the single exception of
                    Mr Chadwick) has dilated upon its “exquisite irony.” Now, the fact of the matter
                    is, that in <hi rend="italic">The Shortest Way</hi> there is no irony at all,
                    and, as Defoe’s adversaries acutely remarked, irony would never, have been
                    pleaded had not the author got into trouble, when of course it suited him <hi
                    rend="italic">faire flèche de</hi><hi rend="italic">tout</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bois.</hi> The pamphlet is simply an exposition in the plainest and most
                    forcible terms of the extreme “high-flying” position, and every line of it might
                    have been endorsed, and was endorsed, by consistent high-churchmen. The author’s
                    object clearly was by this naked presentation to awaken the dissenters to a
                    sense of their danger, and to startle moderate churchmen by showing them to what
                    end their favourite doctrines necessarily led. For neither of these purposes was
                    irony necessary, and irony, we repeat, there is none. If any lingering doubt
                    from the consensus of authority on the other side remain, let the student read
                    <hi rend="italic">The Shortest Way</hi> and then turn to Swift’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Modest Proposal</hi> or his <hi rend="italic">Reasons against
                    Abolishing the Church of England.</hi> He will soon see the difference. Ironical
                    or not, however, it was unlikely that the high-churchmen and their leader
                    Nottingham (the Don Disιrial of Swift) would let such a performance pass
                    unnoticed. The author was soon discovered; and, as he absconded, an
                    advertisement was issued offering a reward for his apprehension, and giving us
                    the only personal description we possess of him, as “a middle-sized spare man
                    about forty years old, of a brown complexion and dark brown-coloured hair, but
                    wears a wig; a hooked nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his
                    mouth.” In this conjuncture Defoe had really no friends, for the dissenters were
                    as much alarmed at his book as the high-flyers were irritated. He surrendered,
                    and his defence appears to have been injudiciously conducted; at any rate he was
                    fined 200 marks, and condemned to be pilloried three times, to be imprisoned
                    indefinitely, and to find sureties for his good behaviour during seven years.
                    His sojourn in the pillory, however, was rather a triumph than a punishment, for
                    the populace took his side; and his <hi rend="italic">Hymn to the Pillory,</hi>
                    which he soon after published, is one of the best of his poetical works.
                    Unluckily for him his condemnation had the indirect effect of destroying his
                    business. He remained in prison until August 1704, and then owed his release to
                    the intercession of Harley, who represented his case to the queen, and obtained
                    for him not only liberty but pecuniary relief and employment, which, of one kind
                    or another, lasted until the termination of Anne’s reign. Defoe was uniformly
                    grateful to the minister, and his language respecting him is in curious variance
                    with that generally used. There can be little doubt that, independently of
                    gratitude, Harley’s moderation in a time of the extremes! party-insanity was no
                    little recommendation to Defoe. During his imprisonment the latter was by no
                    means idle. A spurious edition of his works having been issued, he himself
                    produced a collection of twenty-two treatises, to which some time afterwards he
                    added a second group of eighteen more. He also wrote in prison manÿ short
                    pamphlets, chiefly controversial, published a curious work on the famous storm
                    of November 26,1703, and started perhaps the most remarkable of all his
                    projects, <hi rend="italic">The Review.</hi> This was a paper which was issued
                    during the greater part of its life three times a week. It was entirely written
                    by Defoe, and extends to eight complete volumes and some few score numbers of a
                    second issue. He did not confine himself to news, but threw his writing into the
                    form of something very like finished essays on questions of policy, trade, and
                    domestic concerns; while he also introduced a so-called “Scandal Club,” in which
                    minor questions of manners and morals were treated in a way which undoubtedly
                    suggested the <hi rend="italic">Tatlers</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectators</hi> which followed. It is probable that if the five points of bulk,
                    rapidity of production, variety of matter, originality of design, and excellence
                    of style are taken together, hardly any author can show a work of equal
                    magnitude. It is unlucky that only one complete copy of the work is known to
                    exist, and that is in a private library. After his release he went to Bury St
                    Edmunds for change of air, though he did not interrupt either his <hi
                    rend="italic">Review</hi> or his occasional pamphlets. One of these, <hi
                    rend="italic">Giving Alms no Charity, and Employing the Poor a Grievance to the
                    Nation,</hi> is for the time an extraordinarily far-sighted performance. It
                    denounces on the one hand indiscriminate alms-giving, and on the other the folly
                    of national work shops, the institution of which on a parochial system had been
                    proposed by Sir Humphrey Mackworth.</p>
                <p>In 1705 appeared <hi rend="italic">The Consolidator, or Memoirs of Sundry
                    Transactions from the World in the Moon,</hi> a political satire which is
                    supposed to have given some hints for <hi rend="italic">Gulliver;</hi> and at
                    the end of the year Defoe performed a secret mission (the first of several of
                    the kind) for Harley.</p>

                <p>Whſle on one of these in the west of England he was molested, though with no
                    serious result, by the zealous country justices. In 1705 also appeared the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Mrs Veal.</hi> As is well known, this admirable fiction
                    is said to have been composed for a bookseller, to help off an unsaleable
                    translation of <hi rend="italic">Drdincourt on Death.</hi> Mr Lee, however, has
                    thrown some doubts on this story. Defoe’s next considerable work was <hi
                    rend="italic">Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Divino,</hi> a poetical argument in
                    some 10,000 terribly bad verses; and soon afterwards (1706) he began to be
                    largely employed in promoting the union with Scotland. Not only did he write
                    pamphlets as usual on the project, and vigorously recommend it in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Review,</hi> but in October 1706 he was sent on a political
                    mission to Scotland by Godolphin, to whom Harley had recommended him. He resided
                    in Edinburgh for nearly sixteen months, and his services to the Government were
                    rewarded by a regular salary. He seems to have devoted himself to commercial and
                    literary as well as to political matters, and prepared at this time his
                    elaborate <hi rend="italic">History of the Union,</hi> which appeared in 1709.
                    In this latter year occurred the famous Sacheverel sermon, and Defoe wrote
                    several tracts on the occasion. In 1710 Harley returned to power, and Defoe was
                    placed in a somewhat awkward position. To Harley himself he was bound by
                    gratitude and by a substantial agreement in principle, but with the rest of the
                    Tory ministry he had no sympathy. He seems, in fact, to have agreed with the
                    foreign policy of the Tories and with the home policy of the Whigs, and
                    naturally incurred the reproach of time-serving and the hearty abuse of both
                    parties. At the end of 1710 he again visited Scotland. In the negotiations
                    concerning the Peace of Utrecht, Defoe strongly supported the ministerial side,
                    to the intense wrath of the Whigs, and this wrath was displayed in an attempted
                    prosecution against some pamphlets of his on the all-important question of the
                    succession, but the influence of Harley saved him. He continued, however, to
                    take the side of the dissenters in the questions affecting religious liberty,
                    which played such a prominent part towards the close of Anne’s reign. He
                    naturally shared Harley’s downfall; and, though the loss of his salary might
                    seem a poor reward for his constant support of the Hanoverian claim, it was
                    little more than his ambiguous, not to say trimming, position must have led him
                    to expect. He was violently attacked on all sides, and at last published in 1715
                    an apologia entitled <hi rend="italic">An Appeal to Honour and Justice,</hi> in
                    which he defends his political conduct, and which furnishes us with the main
                    authority for the details of his life. With this publication his political work
                    was formerly supposed to have ended; but in 1864 six letters were discovered in
                    the Record Office from Defoe to a Government official, Mr Delafaye, which
                    established the fact that in 1718 at least Defoe was doing not only political
                    work, but political w ork of a somewhat equivocal kind— that he was, in fact,
                    sub-editing the Jacobite <hi rend="italic">Mist's Journal,</hi> under a secret
                    agreement with the Government that he should tone down the sentiments and omit
                    objectionable items. He seems to have performed the same not very honourable
                    office in the case of two other journals— <hi rend="italic">Dormer’s Letter</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Politicus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and,
                    if we may trust Mr Lee, he wrote in these and other papers till nearly the end
                    of his life.</p>
                <p>However this may be, the interest of Defoe’s life from this time forward is very
                    far from political. He was now a man of fifty-five years of age; he had, up to
                    this period, written nothing but what may be called occasional literature, and,
                    except the <hi rend="italic">History of the Union</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Divino,</hi> nothing of any great length. In 1715
                    appeared the first volume of <hi rend="italic">The Family Instructor,</hi> which
                    was subsequently continued, and which was very popular during the last century.
                    Three years afterwards came forth the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Robinson
                    Crusoe.</hi> The first edition of this was published on the 25th of April 1719.
                    It ran through four editions in as many months, and then in August appeared the
                    second part Twelve months afterwards the third part, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serious Reflections,</hi> appeared. This last part is now hardly ever
                    reprinted. Its connection, indeed, with the two former is little more than
                    nominal, Crusoe being simply made the mouth-piece of Defoe’s sentiments on
                    various points of morals and religion. Meanwhile the first two parts were
                    reprinted as a <hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heathcote's Intelligencer,</hi> perhaps the earlieδt instance of the appearance
                    of such a work in such a form. <hi rend="italic">Crusoe</hi> was immediately
                    popular, and various wild stories were set afloat of its having been written by
                    Lord Oxford in the Tower, and of its being simply a piratical utilization of
                    Alexander Selkirk’s papers. It is sufficient to say that all such stories are
                    not only intrinsically of the wildest improbability, but also possess not a
                    tittle of evidence in their favour. A curious idea, recently revived by the late
                    Mr H. Kingsley, is that the adventures of Robinson are allegorical and relate to
                    Defoe’s own life. This idea was certainly entertained to some extent at the
                    time, and derives some colour of justification from words of Defoe’s, but there
                    seems to be no serious foundation for it. The book was almost immediately
                    imitated; of such imitations <hi rend="italic">Philip Quarll</hi> is the only
                    one now known even by name. Contemporaneously with the later parts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Crusoe</hi> appeared <hi rend="italic">The Dumb Philosopher, or
                    Dickory Cronke.</hi> It is a short and rather duÛ book, of something the same
                    type as the <hi rend="italic">Serious Reflections.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1720 came forth <hi rend="italic">The Life and A dventures of Mr Duncan
                    Campbell.</hi> This, unlike the two former, was not entirely a work of
                    imagination, inasmuch as its hero, the fortune-teller, was a real person. There
                    are amusing passages in the story, but it is too desultory to rank with Defoe’s
                    best. In the same prolific year appeared two wholly or partially fictitious
                    histories, each of which might have made a reputation for any man. The first was
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of a Cavalier,</hi> which, as has been
                    often repeated, Lord Chatham believed to be true history, and which Mr Lee
                    believes to be the embodiment at least of authentic private memoirs. It is more
                    probable, however, that Defoe, with his extensive acquaintance with recent
                    English history, and his astonishing power of working up details, was fully
                    equal to the task of its unassisted composition. As a model of historical work
                    of a certain kind it is hardly surpassable, and many separate passages—accounts
                    of battles and skirmishes—have never been equalled except by Mr Carlyle. <hi
                    rend="italic">Captain Singleton,</hi> the last work of the year, has been
                    unjustly depreciated by most of the commentators. The record of the journey
                    across Africa, with its surprising anticipations of recent discoveries
                    (anticipations which were commented on by Dr Birdwood in a paper read before the
                    Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1863, and which are probably due
                    to Defoe’s intercourse with Portugal) yields in interest to no work of the kind
                    known to us; and the semi-piratical Quaker who accompanies Singleton in his
                    buccaneering expeditions is a character thoroughly deserving of life. It may be
                    mentioned that there is also a Quaker who plays a very creditable part in <hi
                    rend="italic">Roxana,</hi> and that Defoe seems to have been well affected to
                    the Friends. In estimating this wonderful productiveness on the part of a man
                    sixty years old, it should be remembered that it was a habit of Defoe’s to keep
                    his works in manuscript sometimes for long periods.</p>
                <p>In 1721 nothing of importance was produced, but in the next twelvemonth three
                    capital works appeared. These were <hi rend="italic">The Fortunes and
                    Misfortunes of Moll Flanders, The Journal of the Plague Year,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The History of Colonel Jack. Moll Flanders</hi> (as a whole) may
                    be placed next to <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> in order of merit, or
                    bracketted for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0038-0029"/> that position with the somewhat similar <hi
                    rend="italic">Roxana.</hi> Both are triumphs of novel-writing. Both have
                    subjects of a rather more than questionable character, but both display the
                    remarkable art with which Defoe handles such subjects. It is not true, as is
                    sometimes said, that the difference of the two is the difference between gross
                    and polished vice. The real difference is much more one of morals than of
                    manners. Moll is by no means of the lowest class. Notwithstanding the greater
                    degradation into which she falls, and her originally dependent position, she has
                    been well educated, and has consorted with persons of gentle birth. She displays
                    throughout much greater real refinement of feeling than the more high-flying
                    Roxana, and is at any rate flesh and blood, if the flesh be somewhat frail and
                    the blood somewhat hot. Neither of the two heroines has any but the rudiments of
                    a moral sense; but Roxana, both in her original transgression and in her
                    subsequent conduct, is actuated merely by avarice and selfishness—vices which
                    are peculiarly offensive in connection with her other failing, and which make
                    her thoroughly repulsive. The art of both stories is great, and as regards the
                    episode in <hi rend="italic">Roxana</hi> of the daughter Susannah is consummate;
                    but the transitions of the later plot are less natural than those in <hi
                    rend="italic">Moll Flanders.</hi> It is only fair to notice that while the
                    latter, according to Defoe’s more usual practice, is allowed to repent and end
                    happily, Roxana is brought to complete misery; Defoe’s morality, therefore,
                    required more repulsiveness in one case than in the other. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Journal of the Plague Year,</hi> more usually called, from the title of the
                    second edition, <hi rend="italic">A History of the Plague,</hi> has perhaps
                    lacked less .of its due meed of admiration than any of its author’s minor works.
                    Here also the accuracy and apparent veracity of the details is so great that
                    many persons have taken it for an authentic record, while others have contended
                    for the existence of such a record as its basis. But it appears that here too
                    the genius of Mrs Veal’s creator must, in the absence of all evidence to the
                    contrary, be allowed sufficient for the task. <hi rend="italic">The History of
                    Colonel Jack</hi> is an unequal book. There is hardly in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robinson Crusoe</hi> a scene equal, and there is consequently not in English
                    literature a scene superior, to that praised by Lamb, and extracted in Knight’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Half Hours with the Best Authors,—</hi> the scene where the
                    youthful pickpocket first exercises his trade, and then for a time loses his
                    ill-gotten (though for his part he knows not the meaning of the word ill-gotten)
                    gains. But great part of the book, and especially the latter portion, is dull;
                    and in fact it may be generally remarked of Defoe that the conclusions of his
                    tales are not equal to the beginning, perhaps from the restless indefatigability
                    with which he undertook one work almost before finishing another. <hi
                    rend="italic">Roxana, or the Fortunate Mistress,</hi> already commented on,
                    appeared in 1724; and in the same year came forth the first volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">A Tour through the whole Island of Great Britain,</hi> which was
                    completed in the two following years. Much of the information in this was
                    derived from personal experience, for Defoe claims to have made many more tours
                    and visits about England than those of which we have rècord; but the major part
                    must necessarily have been dexterous compilation. In 1725 appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">A New Voyage round the World,</hi> apparently entirely due to the
                    author’s own fertile imagination and extensive reading. It is full of his
                    peculiar verisimilitude, and has all the interest of Anson’s or Dampier’s
                    voyages, together with a charm of style superior even to that of the latter, and
                    far beyond anything which the <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi> chaplain of the
                    “Centurion” could attain to. The journey by land across South America is of
                    especial interest, and forms an admirable pendant to the African travels in <hi
                    rend="italic">Singleton.</hi> In the same year Defoe wrote a curious little
                    pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Everybody's Business is</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nobody’s Business, or Private Abuses Public Grievances,
                    exemplified in the Pride, Insolence, and Exorbitant Wages of our Women-Servants,
                    Footmen,</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;kc.</hi> This subject was a very favourite
                    one with Defoe, and in the pamphlet he showed the immaturity of his political
                    views by advocating legislative interference in these matters. Like all his work
                    of this sort, however, it is extremely amusing reading. Towards the end of this
                    same year <hi rend="italic">The Complete English Tradesman,</hi> which may be
                    supposed to sum up the experience of his business life, appeared, and its second
                    volume followed two years afterwards. This book has been variously judged. It is
                    generally and traditionally praised, but those who have read it will be more
                    disposed to agree with Charles Lamb, who considers it “of a vile and debasing
                    tendency,” and thinks it “almost impossible to suppose the author in earnest.”
                    It is certainly clear to those who know it what our foreign critics mean by the
                    reproach of “shop-keeping;” and the intolerable meanness advocated for the sake
                    of the paltriest gains, the entire ignoring of any pursuit in life except
                    money-getting, and the representation of the whole duty of man as consisting
                    first in the attainment of a competent fortune, and next, when that fortune has
                    been attained, in spending not more than half of it, are certainly repulsive
                    enough. But there are no reasons for thinking the performance ironical or
                    insincere, and it cannot be doubted that Defoe would have been honestly unable
                    even to understand Lamb’s indignation. In 1706 came forth <hi rend="italic">The
                    Political History of the Devil.</hi> This is a curious book, partly explanatory
                    of Defoe’s ideas on morality, and partly belonging to a series of demonological
                    works which he wrote, and of which the chief others are <hi rend="italic">A
                    System of Magic,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the History of
                    Apparitions.</hi> In all these works his treatment is on the whole rational and
                    sensible; but in <hi rend="italic">The History of the Devil</hi> he is somewhat
                    hampered by an insufficiently worked-out theory as to the nature and personal
                    existence of his hero, and the manner in which he handles the subject is an odd
                    and not altogether satisfactory mixture of irony and earnest-; ness. There are
                    many very amusing things in the book, but to speak of its “extraordinary
                    brilliancy and wit” (as Mr H. Kingsley has done) is certainly inappropriate. The
                    works which have just been mentioned, together with <hi rend="italic">A Plan of
                    English Commerce,</hi> containing very enlightened views on export trade,
                    appeared in 1727-8. During the whole of the years from 1715 to 1728 Defoe had
                    issued pamphlets and minor works far too numerous to mention. The only one of
                    them perhaps which requires special notice is <hi rend="italic">Religious
                    Courtship</hi> (1722), a curious series of dialogues displaying Defoe’s
                    unaffected religiosity, and at the same time the rather meddling intrusiveness
                    with which he applied his religious notions. * This latter point was more
                    flagrantly illustrated in one of his latest works, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Treatise concerning the Use and Abuse of the Marriage Bed</hi> (1727). This,
                    which was originally issued with a much more offen sive name, has been called
                    “an excellent book with an improper title.” It might more properly be called an
                    ill-judged work, with a title which gives fair warning of its contents. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Memoirs of Captain Carleton</hi> (1728) have been long
                    attributed to Defoe. There is, however, a well-known anecdote of Johnson which
                    makes this extremely unlikely; it is now known that gn actual officer of the
                    name did exist and serve; and the internal evidence is, we think, strongly
                    against Defoe’s authorship. These <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> have been also
                    attributed to Swift, with greater probability as far as style is concerned. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Life of Mother Ross,</hi> reprinted in Bohn’s edition of
                    Defoe, has no claim whatever to be considered his.</p>
                <p>There is little to be said of Defoe’s private life during this period. He must in
                    some way or other have obtained a considerable income. In 1724 he had built

                    ten years ago), which had stables and grounds of considerable size. From the
                    negotiations for the marriage of his daughter Sophia it appears that he had
                    landed property in more than one place, and he had obtained on lease in 1722 a
                    considerable estate from the corporation of Colchester. It was formerly thought
                    that he soon got rid of this lease, but from documents in Mr Lee’s possession it
                    seems that he only effected a mortgage upon it (afterwards paid off), and that
                    it was settled on his unmarried daughter at his death. Other property was
                    similarly allotted to his widow and remaining children, though some difficulty
                    seems to have arisen from the misconduct of his son, to whom, for seme purpose,
                    the property was assigned during his father’s lifetime, and who refused to pay
                    what was due. There is a good deal of mystery about the end of Defoe’s life; it
                    used to be said thathe diedinsolvent, and thathehad been in jail shortly before
                    his death. As a matter of fact, after great suffering from gout and stone, he
                    died of a lethargy in Ropemaker's Alley, Moorfields, on Monday the 6th of April
                    1731, and was buried in the well-known ground of Bunhill Fields. He left no
                    will, all his property having been previously assigned, and letters of
                    administration were taken out by a creditor. How his affairs fell into this
                    condition, why he did not die in his own house, and why in the previous summer
                    he had been in hiding, as we know he was from a letter still extant, are points
                    apparently not to be cleared up.</p>
                <p>Defoe was twice married, and his second wife Susannah outlived him a few months.
                    He had seven children, one of whom, Martha, died in 1707—the others survived
                    him. The eldest, Daniel, emigrated to Carolina. The second, Bernard or Benjamin
                    Norton, has, like his father, a scandalous niche in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dundad.</hi> Three of the daughters, Maria, Henrietta, and Sophia, married
                    well—the husband of the last-named being a Mr Henry Baker, of some repute in
                    natural science. In April 1877 public attention was called to the existence, in
                    some distress, of three maiden ladies, directly descended from Defoe, and
                    bearing his name; and a crown pension of £75 a year was bestowed on each of
                    them. There are several portraits of Defoe, the principal one being engraved by
                    Vandergucht.</p>
                <p>We have said that in his life-time Defoe, as not belonging to either of the great
                    parties at a time of the bitterest party strife, was subjected to obloquy on
                    both sides. The great Whig writers leave him unnoticed. Swift and Gay speak
                    slightingly of him,—the former, it is true, at a time when he was only known as
                    a party pamphleteer. Pope, with less excuse, put him <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Dundad</hi> towards the end of his life, but he
                    confessed to Spence in private that Defoe had written many things and none bad.
                    At a later period he was unjustly described as “a scurrilous party writer,”
                    which he certainly was not; but, on the other hand, Johnson spoke of his writing
                    “so variously and so well,” and put <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> among
                    the only three books that readers wish longer. From Scott downwards the tendency
                    to judge literary work on its own merits has to a great extent restored Defoe to
                    his proper place, or, to speak more correctly, has set him there for the first
                    time. Lord Macaulay’s description of <hi rend="italic">Roxana, Moll
                    Flanders,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Colonel Jack</hi> as “utterly nauseous and
                    wretched” must be set aside as a freak of criticism.</p>
                <p>The grounds upon which the last-mentioned writer bases his depreciation of others
                    of Defoe’s minor works are curious. “He had undoubtedly a knack of making
                    fiction look like truth, but is such a knack much to be desired 1 Is it not of
                    the same sort as the knack of a painter who takes in the birds with his fruit ?”
                    And De Quincey regards the literary skill of writers of this class as
                    comparatively inferior because of the close resemblance of their writings to the
                    current speech and manner of their day. But nothing is really a greater triumph
                    of art than this similarity, and Macaulay has certainly made a mistake in
                    confounding the requirements of painting and of writing. Scott justly observed
                    that Defoe’s style “is the last which should be attempted by a writer of
                    inferior genius; for though it be possible to disguise mediocrity by fine
                    writing, it appears in all its naked inanity when it assumes the garb of
                    simplicity.” The methods by which Defoe attains his result are not difficult to
                    disengage. They are the presentment of all his ideas and scenes in the plainest
                    and most direct language, the frequent employment of colloquial forms of speech,
                    the constant insertion of little material details and illustrations, often of a
                    more or less digressive form, and, in his historico-fictitious works, as well as
                    in his novels, the most rigid attention to vivacity and consistency of
                    character. Plot he disregards, and he is fond of throwing his dialogues into
                    regular dramatic form, with bye-play prescribed and stage directions
                    interspersed. A particular trick of his is also to divide his arguments after
                    the manner of the preachers of his day into heads and subheads, with actual
                    numerical signs affixed to them. These mannerisms undoubtedly help and emphasize
                    the extraordinary faithfulness to nature of his fictions, but it would be a
                    great mistake to suppose that they fully explain their charm. Defoe possessed
                    genius, and his secret is at the last as impalpable as the secret of genius
                    always is.</p>
                <p>The character of Defoe, both mental and moral, is very clearly indicated in his
                    works. He, the satirist of the true-born Englishman, was himself a model, with
                    some notable variations and improvements, of the Englishman of his period. He
                    saw a great many things, and what he did see he saw clearly. But there were also
                    a great many things which he did not see, and there was often no logical
                    connection whatever between his vision and his blindness. The most curious
                    example of this inconsistency, or rather of this indifference to general
                    principle, occurs in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Projects.</hi> He there
                    speaks very briefly and slightingly of life-insurance, probably because if was
                    then regarded as impious by religionists of his complexion. But on either side
                    of this refusal are to be .found elaborate projects of friendly societies and
                    widows’ funds, which practically coyer, in a clumsy and roundabout manner, the
                    whole ground of life-insurance. In morals it is evident that he was, according
                    to his lights, a strictly honest and honourable man. But sentiment of any
                    high-flying description (to use the cant word of his time) was quite
                    incomprehensible to him, or rather never presented itself as a thing to be
                    comprehended. He tells us with honest and simple pride that when his patron
                    Harley fell out, and Godolphin came in, he for three years held no communication
                    with the former, and seejns quite incapable of comprehending the delicacy which
                    would have obliged him to follow Harley’s fallen fortunes. His very anomalous
                    position in regard to Mist is also indicative of a rather blunt moral
                    perception. One of the most affecting things in his novels is the heroic
                    constancy and fidelity of the maid Amy to her exemplary mistress Roxana. But
                    Amy, scarcely by her own fault, is drawn into certain breaches of certain
                    definite moral laws which Defoe did understand, and she is therefore condemned,
                    with hardly a word of pity, to a miserable end. Nothing heroic or romantic was
                    within Defoe’s view; he could not understand passionate love, ideal loyalty,
                    aesthetic admiration, or anything of the kind; and it is probable that many of
                    the little sordid touches which delight us by their apparent satire were, as
                    designed, not satire at all, but merely a faithful representation of the
                    feelings and ideas .of the classes of which he himself was a unit. We have
                    noticed Charles Lamb’s difficulty as to <hi rend="italic">The Complete
                    Tradesman,</hi> and we think that the explanation we have preferred will extend
                    to a great deal more of his work.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0040-0031"/>
                <p>Some peculiarities of that work follow as a natural corollary from those
                    considerations. His political and economical pamphlets are almost unmatched as
                    clear presentations of the views of their writer. For driving the nail home no
                    one but Swift excels him, and Swift perhaps only in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The</hi><hi rend="italic">Drapier·’</hi><hi rend="italic">s Letters.</hi> There
                    is often a great deal to be said against the view presented in those pamphlets,
                    but Defoe sees nothing of it. He was perfectly fair but perfectly one-sided,
                    being generally happily ignorant of everything which told against his own
                    view.</p>
                <p>The same characteristics are curiously illustrated in his moral works. The
                    morality of these is almost amusing in its downright positive character. With
                    all the Puritan eagerness to push a clear, uncompromising, Scripture-based
                    distinction of right and wrong into the affairs of every-day life, he has a
                    thoroughly English horror of casuistry, and his clumsy canons consequently make
                    wild work with the infinite intricacies of human nature. We have noticed, in
                    remarking on <hi rend="italic">The Use and Abuse,</hi> the worst instance of
                    this blundering morality. Another, though very different instance, is his
                    amusingly feminine indignation at the increased wages and embellished dress of
                    servants. He is, in fact, an incarnate instance of the tendency, which has so
                    often been remarked by other nations in the English, to drag in moral
                    distinctions at every turn, and to confound everything which is novel to the
                    experience, unpleasant to the taste, and incomprehensible to the understanding,
                    under the general epithets of wrong, wicked, and shocking. His works of this
                    class therefore are now the least valuable, though not the least curious, of his
                    books. His periodical publications necessarily fall to some extent under the two
                    foregoing heads, and only deserve separate notice because of the novelty and
                    importance of their conception. His poetry, as poetry, is altogether beneath
                    criticism. It is sometimes vigorous, but its vigour is merely that of prose. Of
                    his novels we have already spoken in detail, excepting, as universally known,
                    <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The earliest regular life and estimate of Defoe is that of Dr Towers in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biographia Britannica.</hi> Chalmers’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life,</hi> however (1786), added very considerable information. In 1838 Mr
                    Walter Wilson wrote the book which is the standard on the subject. It is
                    coloured by political prejudice; it does not display any critical power of a
                    high order; and it is in many parts rather a history of England with some
                    relation to Defoe than a life of the.latter; but it is a model of painstaking
                    care, and by its abundant citations from works both of Defoe and of others,
                    which are practically inaccessible to the general reader, is invaluable. In 1859
                    appeared a life of Defoe by Mr William Chadwick, an extraordinary rhapsody in a
                    style which is half Cobbett and half Carlyle, but amusing, and by no means
                    devoid of acuteness. In 1864 the discovery of the six letters stirred up Mr
                    William Lee to a new investigation, and the results of this were published
                    (London, 1869) in three large volumes. The first of these (well illustrated)
                    contains a new life and particulars of the author’s discoveries. The second and
                    third contain fugitive writings assigned by Mr Lee to Defoe for the first time.
                    For most of these, however, we have no authority but Mr Lee’s own impressions of
                    style, &amp;c.; and consequently, though qualified judges will in most cases
                    agree tha¾ Defoe may have written them, it cannot positively be stated that he
                    did. Mr Lee is equally chary of his reasons for attributing and denying many
                    larger works to his author. His work, though full of research and in many ways
                    useful in correcting and enlarging previous accounts of Defoe, has therefore to
                    be used with some caution. Besides these publications devoted exclusively to
                    Defoe, there are others of the essay kind which may be consulted respecting him.
                    Such articles have been written by Scott, Hazlitt, Forster, a writer in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Retrospective Review,</hi> Mr Leslie Stephen, and others. No
                    criticisms can, however, compare with three short pieces by Charles Lamb, two of
                    which were written for Wilson’s book, and the third for <hi rend="italic">The
                    Reflector.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been a frequent and well-grounded complaint that no complete edition of
                    Defoe’s works has ever been published. There is, as may be gathered from what
                    has already been said, considerable uncertainty about many of them; and even if
                    all contested works be excluded, the number is still enormous. Besides the list
                    in Bohn’s <hi rend="italic">Lowndes,</hi> which is somewhat of an <hi
                    rend="italic">omnium gatherum,</hi> three lists drawn with more or less care
                    have been compiled in the last half century. Wilson’s contains 210 distinct
                    works, three or four only of which are marked as doubtful; Hazlitt’s enumerates
                    183 “genuine” and 52 “attributed” pieces, with notes on most of them; Mr Lee’s
                    extends to 254, of which 64 claim to be new additions. Of these large numbers
                    many are in the original editions, extremely scarce, if not unique. Only one
                    perfect copy of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> is known to exist, and this,
                    as well as the partially printed but never published <hi rend="italic">Complete
                    Gentleman,</hi> is in the hands of Mr James Crossley of Manchester, whose Defoe
                    collection is nearest to completeness. Of reprints only one has ever aspired to
                    be exhaustive. This was edited for the “Pulteney Library” by Hazlitt in 1840-43.
                    It contains a good and full life mainly derived from Wilson, the whole of the
                    novels (including the <hi rend="italic">Serious Reflections</hi> now hardly ever
                    .published with <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe), Jure</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Divino,</hi><hi rend="italic">The Use and Abuse of Marriage,</hi> and many of
                    the more important tracts and smaller works. The introductions are not written
                    on a very uniform principle, but it is otherwise an excellent edition, and had
                    it been continued (it stopped abruptly after the third volume had been completed
                    and a few parts of a fourth issued) would have been satisfactory enough. It is
                    still far the best, but is unfortunately scarce and expensive. There is also an
                    edition, often called Scott’s, but really edited by Sir G. C. Lewis, in twenty
                    volumes (London, 1841). This contains the <hi rend="italic">Complete Tradesman,
                    Religious Courtship, The Consolidator,</hi> and other works not comprised in
                    Hazlitt’s, but is correspondingly deficient. It also is somewhat expensive in a
                    complete state, and the editions chosen for reprinting are not always the best.
                    Scott had previously in 1809 edited for Ballantyne some of the novels, in 12
                    vols. Bohn’s libraries contain an edition which through want of support was
                    stopped at the seventh volume. It includes the novels (except the third part of
                    <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe), The History of the Devil, The Storm,</hi>
                    and a few political pamphlets, also the undoubtedly spurious <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mother Ross.</hi> In 1870 Mr Nimmo of Edinburgh published in one volume an
                    admirable selection from Defoe. It contains Chalmers’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life,</hi> annotated and completed from Wilson and Lee, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robinson Crusoe,</hi> pts. i. and ii., <hi rend="italic">Colonel Jack, The

                    Hymn to the Pillory,</hi> and very copious extracts from <hi rend="italic">The

                    >Robinson Crusoe,</hi> which in one form or another every one possesses, been
                    devoted to a further selection from the minor works, this book would have gone
                    far to supply a very fair idea of Defoe to all but professed students of
                    literature. If we turn to separate works, the bibliography of Defoe is
                    practically confined (except as far as original editions are concerned) to <hi
                    rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe. Mrs Veal</hi> has been to some extent popularized
                    by the work which it helped to sell; <hi rend="italic">Religious Courtship</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Family Instructor</hi> had a vogue among the middle
                    class until well into this century, and <hi rend="italic">The History of the
                    Union</hi> was republished in 1786. But the reprints and. editions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Crusoe</hi> have been innumerable; it has been often translated;
                    and the eulogy pronounced on it by Rousseau gave it special currency in France,
                    where imitations (or rather adaptations) have also been common. " (G. SA.)</p>
