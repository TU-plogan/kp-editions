                    the eastern and western seas. In the time of the Britons it was part of the
                    district which constituted the kingdom of the Coritani. While under the Roman
                    sway it formed a part of Britannia Prima; and under the Heptarchy it belonged to
                    the kingdom of Mercia. It is bounded on the E. by Nottinghamshire and a part of
                    Leicestershire, on the W. by Staffordshire and Cheshire (from which it is
                    separated by the rivers Trent, Dove, Etherow, and Goyt), on the N. by Yorkshire
                    and a part of Cheshire, and on the S. by Leicestershire. Its greatest length
                    from S.E. to N.W. is 56 miles, its greatest width from N.E. toS.W. is 33 miles.
                    It contains an area of 656,243 statute acres, equal to about 1025¾ square miles.
                    Its population in 1851 amounted to 296,084 persons, in 1861 to 339,327, and in
                    1871 to 379,394, of whom 190,657 were males, and 188,737 females. From the
                    beginning of the century down to 1871, 13 per cent, was the mean rate of
                    increase in each intermediate period of ten years; while from 1861 to 1871 the
                    total increase was 40,067, or at the rate of nearly 12 per cent. For practical
                    purposes the population may be taken at 400,000, giving an average of 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 60 persons per acre, or 1 ’ 64 acres per person. The
                    rental of the county, as given in the Owners of Land Return, 1873, was
                    £1,658,995.</p>
                <p>Derbyshire is divided into the hundreds of High Peak, Scarsdale, Appletree,
                    Repton and Gresley, Morleston and Litchurch, and the wapentake of Wirksworth. It
                    consists of 331 parishes, townships, and parts of parishes. It has a court of
                    quarter sessions, and is included as an archdeaconry in the diocese of
                    Lichfield. For electoral purposes the county has been formed into the 3
                    divisions of east, north, and south, each returning 2 members to Parliament, and
                    thus, with the 2 members from the borough of Derby, is represented by a total of
                    8 members.</p>
                <p>The geographical or physical aspect of Derbyshire is very diversified. The
                    southern part presents little that is picturesque, or in any way striking, being
                    for the most part a level surface, with occasional slight undulations. In its
                    northern portions, however, particularly in the bold and mountainous regions of
                    the High Peak, there are imposing combinations of those features which go to
                    constitute impressive and romantic scenery. In the more hilly districts, some of
                    the valleys and dales are very beautiful, notably the valleys of Castleton and
                    Glossop, Dovedale, Millersdale, and the dale of Matlock. Derbyshire is on the
                    whole a well-wooded county, and in the spacious parks surrounding the numerous
                    mansions of noblemen and others which it contains, may be seen many fine oaks of
                    noble appearance, those at Kedleston, the seat of Lord Scarsdale, three miles
                    from Derby, being considered among the largest and oldest in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The climate, as might be expected from the diversified configuration of the land,
                    varies very considerably in different parts. From the elevation which it attains
                    in its northern division the county is colder and is more frequently visited
                    with rain than other midland counties. In summer cold and thick fogs are often
                    seen hanging over the rivers, and clinging to the lower parts of the hills, and
                    hoar-frosts are by no means unknown even in June and July. Owing to the great
                    elevation some kinds of grain will not grow at all in many of the northern
                    parts, while that which is sown in the more sheltered spots is exceptionally
                    late in coming to maturity. The winters there are generally severe, and the
                    rainfall heavy. At Belper, in 1876, there were 36O1 inches of rain during the
                    year, while the average for the five years was 32 O9 inches per annum.</p>
                <p>The elevation of the land proceeds gradually from south to north, the greatest
                    altitudes being attained in the north division of the county, which is of a
                    distinctly mountainous character. The mountains (or the plateau) of North
                    Derbyshire may be said to form the central watershed of England, containing the
                    source of many large rivers—as the Don, the Trent, and the Mersey. The highest
                    altitudes are Kinder Scout (1981 feet), the Peak (1880), and, on the borders of
                    Cheshire and Staffordshire, Axe Edge (1751).</p>
                <p>From Axe Edge the streams of the county radiate. Those of the north-west belong
                    to the Mersey, and those of the north-east to the Don, but all the others to the
                    Trent, which, like the Don, falls into the Humber. The principal river is the
                    Trent, which, rising in the Staffordshire moorlands, does not intersect this
                    county, but forms its southwest boundary for some distance, separating
                    Derbyshire from Staffordshire on the south. After the Trent the most important
                    river is the Derwent, one of its tributaries, which, taking its rise in the
                    lofty ridges of High Peak, flows southward through a succession of striking and
                    beautiful scenery, receiving a number of minor streams in its course. The other
                    principal rivers are the following. The Dane rises at the junction of the three
                    counties, Yorkshire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire. The Goyt has its source a very
                    little further north, at the base of the same hill, and, taking a N.N.E.
                    direction, divides Derbyshire and Cheshire, and falls into the Mersey. The Dove
                    rises on the southern slope, and flows on as the boundary stream between
                    Derbyshire and Staffordshire for about 45 miles. It receives several feeders,
                    and falls into the Trent at Repton. The Erewash is the boundary between Notts
                    and Derbyshire. The Rother rises about Baslow, and flows north-east into
                    Yorkshire. A little more to the west are the Sheaf, Wallin, Poulter, and Ry ton,
                    which flow into the Don at Sheffield.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Canals.—</hi> There are numerous canals intersecting this
                    county in various directions. The Trent and Mersey or Grand Trunk canal,
                    communicating between Liverpool and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n122/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0122-0107"/> London, and also with Bristol and Hull, was begun
                    in 1776 by the celebrated Brindley, a native of the county, and completed under
                    Smeaton and Rennie. It passes through Derbyshire from Burton, following the
                    course of the Trent The Chesterfield canal was begun in 1771 by Brindley, and
                    completed by his brother-in-law, Mr Henshall, in 1776. It enters the county at
                    Killaιuarsh, and terminates at Chesterfield. There are also the Langley Bridge
                    or Erewash canal, the Peak Forest canal, the Ashton-under line, the Cromford,
                    the Ashby-de-la-Zouch, the Derby, and the Nutbrook canals.</p>
                <p>Nowhere have railways received a more complete development than in this county,
                    and nowhere are their beneficial effects more apparent. For this the system of
                    the Midland Company must claim the chief credit. The roads in Derbyshire are
                    numerous, and generally in good condition. The great road from London to
                    Manchester crosses the Trent near Shardlow, and passes through Derby and
                    Ashbourne into Staffordshire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology, Minerals, dcc.—</hi> With the exception of drift
                    gravel, and some alluvial deposits, the rocks of this county belong to the
                    Palaeozoic and Mesozoic periods. The mountain limestone underlies all the other
                    rocks, and in the Peak district rises to a great elevation. It is in this
                    formation that the well-known caves of Derbyshire occur. The calcareous rocks
                    are confined to the western side of the county,—Tissington being the southern,
                    Castleton the northern, Axe Edge the western, and Matlock the eastern
                    extremities. There is also an outcrop at Crich. The intrusive beds of toadstone
                    (some of which attain a thickness of 200 feet) and volcanic mud mark great
                    submarine eruptions when this ancient lava was spread over the sea-bottom. It is
                    estimated that upwards of half a million tons are worked yearly. The marbles are
                    numerous and valuable for ornamental purposes. Derbyshire also contains several
                    metallic ores—viz., galena, barytes, zinc, calamine, fluor spar, and elaterite.
                    Galena (sulphide of lead) is obtained rather extensively, some mines near
                    Castleton having been worked by the Romans. In 1874 the quantity raised was 4301
                    tons, from which were extracted 800 ounces of silver. In connection with galena
                    zinc is found, of which 4050 tons were raised in 1876; of calamine (carbonate of
                    zinc) 30 tons. Barytes is used as an inferior white paint, and also for
                    ornamental purposes. The total output for 1876 was 2700 tons. Blue john is a
                    somewhat rare fluor spar, impregnated with oxide of manganese, It is one of the
                    most ornamental minerals of the county, and is much used in the manufacture of
                    tazzas, brooches, &lt;fcc. In one or two places a thin seam of coal is found in
                    the mountain limestone. Copper was once worked in this formation at Eυton, on
                    the border of the county, but it has never been abundant. Traces of gold have
                    also been found in toadstone Chert is got near Bakewell, and is used for the
                    manufacture of porcelain. The most remarkable and rare mineral is elaterite, or
                    elastic bitumen, found at Windy Knoll, near Castleton. It is found only at two
                    other places—at Montrelaix in France, and in Connecticut, United States. The
                    fauna of this formation may be briefly tabulated as follows, from Etheridge’s
                    list— Coelenterata, 54 species; Echinodermata, 27; Crustacea, 15; Brachiopoda,
                    96; Lamellibranchiata-Monomyriata, 29; Gasteropoda, 55; Cephalopida, 31; Pisces,
                    12. The surface soils of the mountain limestone are very unproductive, and, as a
                    rule, can only be used for grazing. The Yoredale rocks make a narrow margin
                    round the above formation, forming also the range of hills between Hope and
                    Edale valleys, and extends to the north of the Peak, attaining a thickness of
                    500 feet. As is usual with this rock, frequent landslips take place, notably at
                    Alport Tower, Dove Holes, and at the southern flank of Mam-Tor, the latter
                    having carried with it part of the old Roman camp, &amp;c. The Millstone Grit is
                    part of a large formation stretching into adjacent counties. It is a long,
                    narrow outcrop, running from north to south on the whole western side of the
                    Coal Measures from Stanedge Pole to Little Eaton. There is also an outcrop, 200
                    feet thick, south of the Trent The high table-land of the Peak is of this
                    formation. It is a valuable building-stone, and as such it is extensively used,
                    as well as for millstones, from which it derives its name. The Coal Measures are
                    the southern continuation of the great Yorkshire coal-field. They occupy the
                    larger portion of the eastern side of the county from a few miles south of
                    Sheffield to near Balborough Hall, where they disappear under the Permian. The
                    coal-field (which extends into Notts) covers an area of about 700 square miles,
                    230 of which are in this county. At Shireoaks the top hard coal is worked, at a
                    depth of 510 yards, the overlying Permian rock being only 200 feet thick. The
                    principal coals worked are the deep soft and deep hard, both important. Still
                    more so is the clod, or black shale; but the best of all is the Kilbourne, near
                    Belper, which is equal to the best Newcastle. Upwards of 10,000 people are
                    employed in the Derbyshire coal-fields, which produce annually more than
                    7,000,000 tons. The ironstones associated with this coal-field are very
                    valuable, yielding upwards of 130,000 tons annually. The Permian is represented
                    in the northeast by a narrow strip of Magnesian Limestone, which is said to be
                    one of the best building stones in the kingdom. The surface soils of this
                    formation are probably the most fertile in the county, its barley or malt having
                    become famous. A narrow strip of the Bunter stretches just on the edge of the
                    Yoredale, from Ashbourne to Quarndon, and patches occur to the north of
                    Breadsal, at Sandiacre, and in the neighbourhood of Repton. The Keuper Red Marl
                    and Sandstone occupy the larger part of South Derbyshire, the most northerly
                    point being near Ashbourne. The sandstones are extensively used for building
                    purposes. An important bed of gypsum is worked at Chellastυn, which is burnt and
                    pulverized for making plaster of Paris,— the white variety being made into
                    chimney ornaments, statuettes, &amp;c. The Drift Gravel is confined almost to
                    the south and east of the county. Near Derby it is very abundant. Much light has
                    been thrown upon the fauna of the Pleistocene period by the researches of Mr
                    Pennington at Castleton, and Messrs Mills and Heath at Cresswell. The more rare
                    and important “finds” are the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, Irish elk, reindeer,
                    cave bear, wolf, British lion, hyaena, glutton, Arctic fox, machairodus (?),
                    &lt;tc., and a large collection of palaeolithic implements. Peat bogs are spread
                    over all the moorland districts of the Yoredale and Millstone Grit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> In the valley of the Trent a large surface
                    is laid down in permanent grass, being devoted to cattlefeeding and dairy
                    purposes, while heavy crops of wheat, turnips, &lt;fcc., are grown in other
                    parts of the district. Dairy farms are numerous; and Derbyshire cheese, which
                    holds a high reputation, is annually sent to the metropolis, or to the seaports
                    for exportation. Cheese fairs or markets are held in various parts of the
                    county, as at Derby, Burton-on-Trent, Ashbourne, Uttoxeter, and Loughborough.
                    Barley is much cultivated, especially about Repton and Gresley, and also in the
                    east of the county, the inducement being great from the proximity of Burton, the
                    great seat of the brewing industry. In the upland districts, where the soil is
                    poor and the climate harsh and unfriendly, agricultural industry is much less
                    important and profitable. It is chiefly devoted to the feeding of sheep. The
                    following figures, taken from the Agricultural Returns for 1873 and 1876, shows
                    the distribution of the agricultural acreage of the county, and the numbers of
                    live stock, in those years :—</p>

                <p>In respect of the ownership of the land, Derbyshire in 1873 Was divided among
                    19,866 separate proprietors, whose gross estimated rental amounted to
                    £1,764,689. The average size of each property in that year was 31 acres, while
                    that of all England was 34 acres; and the average value per acre was £2, 16s.
                    10d., that of all England being £3, Os. 2d. There were 12,874 owners holding
                    less than one acre of land, equal to 65 per cent, of the total number of
                    proprietors, or about 6 per cent, fewer than the average of small owners in all
                    England. Eight proprietors held more than 6000 acres each, viz.—duke of
                    Devonshire (Chatsworth), 83,829 acres; duke of Rutland (Haddon Hall), 26,973;
                    Sir J. H. Crewe, Bart. (Calke Abbey), 12,923; Lord Scarsdale (Kedleston), 9166;
                    Lord Howard (Glossop Hall), 9108; duke of Portland, 7740; T. W. Evans
                    (Allestree), 6799; Lord Vernon (Sudbury Hall) 6154.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> These are both numerous and important,
                    embracing silks, cotton hosiery, iron, woollen manufacures, lace, elastic web,
                    and brewing, for which see <hi rend="smallcaps">Burton.</hi> For many of these
                    this county has long been famous, especially silk, which is carried on to a
                    large extent in Derby, as well as in Belper and Duffield, where the first silk
                    mill in England was set up by a mechanic, John Lombe, who introduced it from
                    Italy. Cotton was also at one time an important industry, but has in great
                    measure passed into the county of Lancashire. It was introduced here by the
                    celebrated Sir Richard Arkwright in 1771. Hosiery also was much in vogue, and
                    obtained great celebrity from the invention of Mr Strutt, by which “ribbed”
                    stockings could be made—the Derby “rib” having been long the familiar
                    designation of the article produced by Strutt’s invention. There are numerous
                    iron foundries, machine and iron-bridge works, &amp;c., in Derbyshire, those in
                    the county town alone employing a great many hands. Silk-throwing is a principal
                    industry of Derby, which in ordinary times gives employment to 3000 or 4000
                    persons, chiefly females. Elastic web weaving by power looms is carried on to a
                    great extent, and the manufacture of lace and net curtains, gimp trimmings,
                    braids, and cords. In the county town and neighbourhood are several important
                    chemical and colour-works; and in various parts of the county, as at Belper,
                    Cromford, Matlock, Tutbury, &amp;c., are extensive cotton-spinning mills, as
                    well as hosiery and tape manufactories.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Buildings.—</hi> Derbyshire is distinguished for
                    numerous old and interesting churches. The prevailing style of the churches is
                    the Norman, and next to that the Early English, the style which immediately
                    succeeded it. Steetly Chapelry, near Whitwell, on the east side of the county,
                    is Norman; and of this church Mr C. Cox, in his work on Derbyshire churches,
                    says that it is “the most complete and beautiful specimen of Norman work, on a
                    small scale, that can be met with anywhere in this country or in Normandy.” It
                    was probably built during the reign of Stephen, 1135-54.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">antiquities</hi> of Derbyshire are of considerable
                    interest. One of the more noteworthy is a causeway, or Roman paved road, called
                    Bathgate, running seven miles from Buxton to a small village called Brough,
                    which road from its name seems to indicate that the Buxton waters were known to
                    the ancients. Rocking-stones exist near Rowter and at other places; Druidical
                    remains, in the form of a Druidical temple, on Stanton moor, with a large number
                    of associated objects which seem to justify the assumption that it has been
                    inhabited by Druids. On Hartle moor, at Arbelow, is another Druidical temple,
                    with its barrows and tumuli; there are others on the moor near Eyam, and near
                    Edale. Barrows are found at Arbelow, Brassington, on the moor near Eyam, and at
                    Tissington. At Taddington is one of the most perfect examples now existing.
                    Roman stations are to be found near Buxton, at Little Chester (which is the old
                    Roman town <hi rend="italic">Derventid),</hi> and at Mam-Tor, near Castleton,
                    where there is also an encampment. At Repton, in 660, “there was a noble
                    monastery of religious, of both sexes, under an abbess, after the old Saxon
                    fashion, wherein several of the royal line were buried.” This was afterwards
                    destroyed by the Danes, when Maud, widow of Ranulph, second earl of Chester,
                    built a priory for Black Canons in 1172. Here the Mercian kings who resided at
                    Tamworth were buried. At Melbourne is a castle which was a royal demesne at the
                    Conquest, and where John, duke of Bourbon, taken at the battle of Agincourt, was
                    kept nine years in the custody of Nicholas Montgomery the younger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Derby,</hi> the county town of Derbyshire, is a corporate
                    and borough town, sending two representatives to Parliament, and consisting of
                    five parishes. It is situated chiefly on the western bank of the river Derwent,
                    upon ground of varying heights, and is surrounded with gentle eminences, from
                    which flow the Markeaton and other brooks. It occupies a position almost in the
                    centre of England, 127 miles N.W. of London.</p>
                <p>Derby possesses several large public buildings, including the town hall, a
                    spacious range of buildings recently erected for the postal and telegraph
                    departments and the inland revenue offices, the county gaol, a new masonic hall,
                    All Saints Church, the tower of which (174 feet high) is considered one of the
                    finest in the midland counties, and a Roman Catholic church (cne of the best
                    examples of Pugin). The Derby grammar school, an ancient foundation which
                    occupies St Helen’s House (once the town residence of the Strutt family), has
                    lately had class-rooms added to it, erected by public subscription as a memorial
                    of the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. There are flourishing schools
                    of art and science, a large and commodious infirmary for town and county, an
                    arboretum of 17 acres, given to the town in 1840 by the late Joseph Strutt,
                    Esq., a market square, a market hall, and water-works erected at a cost of
                    £40,000, and since greatly extended. A recreation ground, free public swimming
                    baths, a free library, and museum buildings have all been presented to the town
                    by Mr Μ. T. Bass. Since about 1850 Derby has been greatly improved and extended,
                    owing chiefly to the impulse given by the establishment of the head offices and
                    principal workshops of the Midland Railway Company, and will be still further
                    improved by the construction now in process of a branch of the Great Northern
                    Railway, which passes through the town over a long series of arches.</p>

                <p>Derby has been long celebrated for its porcelain, which rivalled that of Saxony
                    and France. This manufacture was introduced in the year 1750, and although for a
                    time partially abandoned, it has been so far revived, and is still continued.
                    There are also spar works where the fluor spar, or blue john, is wrought into a
                    variety of useful and ornamental articles. The manufacture of silk, hosiery,
                    lace, and cotton formerly employed a large portion of the population, and there
                    are still numerous silk mills and elastic web works, &amp;c. The iron
                    manufacture is also of great importance; among the larger establishments may be
                    mentioned the Britannia Works, which furnished the roof of the great
                    Agricultural Hall, London.</p>
                <p>The sanitary condition of the town is much improved since the formation of a
                    local board, and the rate of mor tality is low. Among benevolent institutions
                    may be mentioned a ragged school, and a nurses’ “home.” The population of the
                    municipal borough, which occupies an area of 1796 acres, numbered 40,609 persons
                    in 1851, 43,091 in 1861, and 49,810 in 1871. The parliamentary borough, which in
                    1867 was extended so as to include the townships of Litchurch and Little
                    Chester, and covers an area of 2999 acres, had a population in 1871 of 61 381—
                    29,882 males, and 31,499 females.</p>
                <p>Derby is a town of great antiquity, but its origin is unknown. During the
                    Heptarchy it was called Northworthig, and its present name Derby, or Deoraby, is
                    due to the Danes. Constituted in the ninth century the chief town of the county
                    by King Segurd, Derby was incorporated by Henry I. Its charter was surrendered
                    to Charles II. in 1680, and a new one was granted in 1683, by which the
                    government of the borough was vested in a mayor, 9 aidermen, 14 brethren, and 14
                    capital burgesses. In 1835 the town council was re-organized under the Municipal
                    Corporations Act, and now consists of a mayor, 12 aldermen, and 36 councillors.
                    Derby was the furthest place reached by the Pretender in his march towards
                    London in 1745; he lodged in Exeter House, Full Street, and held there a council
                    of war, which resulted in the abandonment of his project.</p>
