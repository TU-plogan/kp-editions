                    Casimir</hi></label> (1793-1843), French poet and dramatist, was born April 4,
                    1793, at Havre, whence his father sent him at an early age to Paris, there to be
                    educated at the Lycée Napoléon. During the first years of his attendance at this
                    school he was little else than a dullard, but on reaching the age of fourteen he
                    seems to have undergone a complete change—sluggishness gave place to unusual
                    facility in the acquisition of knowledge; a decided taste for literary studies,
                    especially poetry, was evinced; and he quickly became a distinguished student.
                    He read with avidity all the poets, great and small, to whose works access was
                    obtainable, and was known to spend many an hour snatched from school duties in
                    the elaboration of his own juvenile pieces. Constitutionally of an ardent and
                    sympathetic temperament, with a mind the natural intelligence of which was
                    quickened by extensive miscellaneous reading, and by contact with a world then
                    in a state of revolutionary ferment, it will, be seen that Delavigne had much in
                    his favour when he first sought popular applause. An opportunity for display
                    soon presented itself. On the 20th of March 1811 the Empress Marie Louise gave
                    birth to a son, christened in his very cradle king of Rome. This long-desired
                    event was hailed with the utmost satisfaction; congratulations reached Napoleon
                    from every quarter of Europe, and fifty millions of human beings did homage to
                    their future sovereign. But the poets were dumb. Our young aspirant to fame,
                    therefore, seeing the field unoccupied, composed a festal hymn. It was
                    completely successful <hi rend="italic">; even</hi> the critics were pleased. On
                    being shown the verses, Andrieux, albeit a man little disposed to flatter,
                    exclaimed, “Bring him to me! He shall make nothing but verses, and these, I
                    hope, good ones.” Encouragement such as this augured well for ihe future; but
                    Delavigne’s purse was scantily furnished, and his friends were poor and unable
                    to render any assistance. At this point he was fortunate in securing as a patron
                    Count Français of Nantes, who attached him to the revenue office, but with the
                    single proviso, that he should not trouble himself to appear at his post oftener
                    than once a month.</p>
                <p>About this time he competed twice for an academy prize, but without success. A
                    victory, however, was at hand. Amid the throes in which society laboured at the
                    period of Napoleon’s downfall, Delavigne, catching inspiration from the mingled
                    hopes and fears which agitated his fellow-countrymen, burst upon the world with
                    two impassioned poems, the first entitled <hi rend="italic">Waterloo,</hi> the
                    second, <hi rend="italic">Devastation</hi><hi rend="italic">du Musée,</hi> both
                    written in the heat of patriotic enthusiasm, and teeming with popular political
                    allusions. A third, but of inferior merit, <hi rend="italic">Sur le besoin de
                    s’unir après le départ des étrangers,</hi> was afterwards added. These stirring
                    pieces, termed by him <hi rend="italic">Messêniennes,</hi> sounded a key-note
                    which found au echo in the hearts of all. Twenty-five thousand copies were sold;
                    Delavigne was famous. Nor was his reputation made solely with the populace; his
                    verses were the subject of much discussion in court circles; and in spite of
                    their political tone it was thought necessary to bestow upon him some mark of
                    attention. He was therefore appointed to an honorary librarianship, with no
                    duties to discharge. Thus was he fortunately rendered independent by the offer
                    of one sinecure just as he was deprived of another, for his intercourse with
                    Français had now ceased.</p>
                <p>Having achieved so signal a triumph in one department of literature, Delavigne
                    was desirous of attaining distinction in another, and accordingly brought out
                    upon the stage a play well-known under the title of <hi rend="italic">Les Vêpres
                    Siciliennes.</hi> The manuscript having been refused at the Théâtre-Français,
                    the critic of which, a supercilious poetaster, told him that <hi rend="italic"
                    >“some day</hi> he might write comedy very fairly,” the mortified author, like
                    Voltaire on a similar occasion, cast the sheets into the flames, from which they
                    were rescued by his brother Gennain. A better fate than burning awaited the
                    piece, and in 1819 it was performed at the Odéon, then just rebuilt. On the
                    night of the first representation, which was warmly received, Picard, the
                    manager, threw himself into the arms of his elated friend, exclaiming, “You have
                    saved us! You are the founder of the second French Theatre.” This was followed
                    up by the production of the <hi rend="italic">Comédiens</hi> (1820), a poor
                    play, with little plot, and the <hi rend="italic">Paria</hi> (1821), with still
                    less, but containing some well-written choruses. The latter piece obtained a
                    longer lease of life than its intrinsic literary merits warranted, on account of
                    the popularity of the political opinions freely expressed in it—so freely
                    expressed, indeed, that the displeasure of the king was incurred, and Delavigne
                    lost his post. But the duke of Orleans, willing to gain the people’s good wishes
                    by complimenting their favourite, wrote to him as follows,— “The thunder has
                    descended on your house <hi rend="italic">; I</hi> offer you an apartment in
                    mine.” Accordingly he became librarian at the Palais-Royal, a position retained
                    during the remainder of his life. It was here that he wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">École</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vieillards,</hi> which gained his election to the Academy in 1825. Tocthis
                    period also belong <hi rend="italic">La Princess</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aurélie</hi> (1828), and <hi rend="italic">Marino Faliero</hi> (1829), a drama
                    in the romantic style.</p>
                <p>For his success as a writer Delavigne was in no small measure indebted to the
                    stirring nature of the times in which he lived. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Messéniennes,</hi> which first introduced him to universal notice, had their
                    origin in the excitement consequent on the occupation of France by the allies in
                    1815. Another crisis in his life and in the history of his country, the
                    revolution of 1830, stimulated him to the production of a second masterpiece,
                    <hi rend="italic">La Parisienne.</hi> This song, set to music by Auber, was on
                    the lips of every Frenchman, and rivalled in popularity the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Marseillaise.</hi> A companion piece, <hi rend="italic">La
                    Varsovienne,</hi> was written for the Poles, by whom it was sung on the march to
                    battle.</p>
                <p>Other works of Delavigne followed each other in rapid succession;— <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Juan</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Autriche</hi> (1835), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Une Famille au temps du Luther</hi> (1836), <hi rend="italic">La
                    Popularité</hi> (1838), <hi rend="italic">La Fille du Cid</hi> (1839), <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Conseiller rapporteur</hi> (1841), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charles VI.</hi> (1843), an opera partly written by his brother.</p>
                <p>But the poet had reached the acme of his reputation, and was now on the decline.
                    In 1843 he quitted Paris to seek in Italy the health his labours had cost him.
                    At Lyons his strength altogether gave way, and on the 11th of December, while
                    listening to his wife, who read aloud one of Scott’s novels, he gently expired,
                    murmuring some verses.</p>
                <p>By many of his own time Delavigne was looked upon as unsurpassed and
                    unsurpassable. Every one bought his works; nay more, every one read them. If a
                    new play of his was announced at the theatre, it was the affair of a month to
                    secure a seat. Talma and Mademoiselle Mars felt honoured in receiving from him a
                    'part; theatrical managers lay in wait for the fruits of his pen. But the
                    applause of the moment was gained at the sacrifice of lasting fame. Delavigne
                    wrote but for the hour; he was too little the retired, contemplative poet, and
                    too much the busy man of the world. In the region of politics alone does he
                    shine; when he quits this sphere it is to descend to the level of utter
                    common-place.</p>
                <p>But as a writer Delavigne had many excellencies. He is never at a loss for
                    language, yet expresses himself in a terse and vigorous style. The poet of
                    reason rather than of imagination, he recognizes his own province, and is rarely
                    tempted to flights of fancy beyond his powers. He wrote always as he would have
                    spoken, from sincere convie-tion<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0053-0044"/>. In private life he was in every way estimable,—
                    upright, amiable, devoid of all jealousy, and generous to a fault. The best
                    edition of his works is that of Furne, in 8 volumes. <hi rend="smallcaps"
