                    on his own account. He had already gained a reputation in his narrow circle as a
                    keen debater and a jovial companion. He was first aroused to serious thought by
                    the preaching of Adam Clarke; and the impression thus produced was deepened by
                    the death of his elder brother. He now joined the Methodists, was soon employed
                    as a class leader and local preacher, and continued to preach till a few months
                    before his death. His opportunities of gaining knowledge were very scanty, but
                    he strenuously set himself to make the most of them. It is stated that an
                    accidental introduction to Locke’s great essay determined the ultimate direction
                    of his studies. In 1798 the first part of Paine’s <hi rend="italic">Age of
                    Reason</hi> was put into his hands; and in the following year he made his first
                    appearance as an author by publishing his <hi rend="italic">Remarks</hi> on that
                    work. The book was favourably received, and was republished in 1820. Drew had
                    begun to meditate a greater attempt before he wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Remarks on Paine;</hi> and the fruits of his laborious investigation were given
                    to the world in the <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Immateriality and Immortality
                    of the Soul,</hi> in 180'2. This work made him widely known, and for some time
                    it held a high place in the judgment of the religious world as a powerful and
                    conclusive argument on its subject. A fifth edition appeared in 1831. Drew
                    continued to work at his trade till 1805, when he entered into an engagement
                    which enabled him to devote himself entirely to literature. In 1809 he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Identity and General Resurrection of the
                    Human Body,</hi> perhaps the most original of his works, which reached a second
                    edition in 1822. In 1819 Drew removed to Liverpool, on being appointed editor of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Imperial Magazine,</hi> then newly established, and in
                    1821 to London, the business being then transferred to the capital. Here he
                    filled the post of editor till his death, and had also the supervision of all
                    works issued from the Caxton press. He was an unsuccessful competitor for a
                    prize offered in 1811 for an essay on the existence and attributes of God. The
                    work which he then wrote, and which in his own judgment was his best, was
                    published in 1820, under the title of <hi rend="italic">An Attempt to
                    demonstrate from Reason and Revelation the Necessary Existence, Essential
                    Perfections, and Superintending Providence of an Eternal Being, who is the
                    Creator, the Supporter, and the Governor of all Things</hi> (2 vols. 8vo). This
                    procured him the degree of M. A. from the university of Aberdeen. Among Drew’s
                    lesser writings are a <hi rend="italic">Life of Dr Thomas Coke</hi> (1817), a
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Cornwall</hi> (1824), and a work on the divinity of
                    Christ (1813). He died at Helston, in Cornwall, March 29, 1833. A memoir of his
                    life by his eldest son appeared in 1834.</p>
