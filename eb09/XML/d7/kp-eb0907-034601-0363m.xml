                    inches, and whence the body tapers towards both extremities. The forehead

                    number from 40 to 50 on each side of either jaw, and those above locking exactly
                    with the teeth below. The aperture of the ear in dolphins is exceedingly minute;
                    the eyes are of moderate size and the blow-hole is crescent-shaped. The colour
                    of the upper surface is black, becoming lighter on the flanks, and perfectly
                    white on the parts beneath. Like many other cetaceans, the dolphin is
                    gregarious, and large herds are often seen following ships in full sail, and
                    disporting themselves on the surface of the water as if delighted at the near
                    proximity of man. In such exercises they exhibit the most remarkable agility,
                    individuals having been known to leap to such a height out of the water as to
                    fall upon the deck. Their aquatic gambols and apparent relish for human society
                    have attracted the attention of mariners in all ages, and have probably given
                    rise to the many fabulous stories told of dolphins by ancient historians. Their
                    appearance at sea was formerly regarded as a good omen by sailors, for although
                    it presaged a tempest, yet by thus giving warning of its approach, it enabled
                    them, in those days when the mariner’s compass was unknown, and navigators had
                    consequently to keep within sight of the coast, to steer for a place of safety.
                    The dolphin is exceedingly voracious, feeding on fish, cuttlefishes, and
                    crustaceans. On the south coast of England it is said to live chiefly on
                    pilchard and mackerel, and when in pursuit of these it is often taken in the
                    fishermen’s nets. The female brings forth a single young one, which she nurses
                    with the greatest care. Her milk is both abundant and rich, and during the
                    operation of suckling the mother floats in a slightly sidelong position, so as
                    to allow of the necessary respiration in herself and her young. The dolphin was
                    formerly supposed to be a fish, and as such was allowed to be eaten by Roman
                    Catholics on those occasions when the use of flesh was prohibited, and it seems
                    to have been esteemed as a great delicacy by the French. It is said to show
                    great fondness for music, and according to the ancient fable, Arion was said to
                    have escaped on the back of a dolphin which he had first charmed by his music.
                    It is an inhabitant of the temperate regions of the North Atlantic and the
                    Mediterranean Sea, and has been observed as far north as the coast of Greenland.
                    It is much more common in English than in Scottish waters. Among the seafaring
                    population of Britain the name “dolphin” is most usually given to the
                    beautifully coloured fish <hi rend="italic">Coryphaena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hippuris</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the dorado of the Portuguese, and it is
                    to the latter the poet is alluding when he speaks of “the dying dolphin’s
                    changing hues ’’—while the true dolphin is usually spoken of as the “bottlenose”
                    or “bottlehead.” This species occurs as a fossil in the sandy downs of the
                    French coast.</p>
