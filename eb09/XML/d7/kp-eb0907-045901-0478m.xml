                    greater or less depths, for the purpose of determining their structure and
                    zoological relations, and ascertaining their geographical distribution. The
                    instrument usually employed in this and other northern countries for dredging
                    oysters and clams is a light frame of iron about 5 feet long by a foot or so in
                    width, with a scraper like a narrow hoe on one side, and a suspending apparatus
                    of thin iron bars which meet in an iron ring for the attachment of the
                    dredge-rope on the other. From the frame is suspended a bag about 2 feet in
                    depth of iron chain netting, or of wide-meshed hempen-cord netting, or of a
                    mixture of both. Naturalist dredgers at first used the oyster dredge, but it is
                    scarcely suitable for scientific purposes. Having a scraper on one side only, it
                    is liable in a current, in deep water, or in unskilled hands, to fall on its
                    back and consequently to come up empty, the scraper not having come into play.
                    Oyster dredgers are not allowed to take oysters below a certain size, and the
                    commercial dredge is so contrived as to allow all small bodies to fall through,
                    and, as many of these are of the highest interest to the naturalist, his object
                    is thus in a great measure defeated.</p>
                <p>The remedy for these defects is to have a scraper on each side, with the arms
                    attached in such a way that one or other of the scrapers must reach the ground
                    in whatever position the dredge may fall; and to have the dredge-bag deeper in
                    proportion to the size of the frame, and of a material which is only
                    sufficiently open to allow the water to pass freely through, with the openings
                    so distributed as to leave a part of the bag close enough to bring up the finest
                    mud.</p>
                <p>The late Dr Robert Ball of Dublin devised the modification which has since been
                    used almost universally by naturalists in this country and abroad under the name
                    of “Ball’s Dredge” (fig. 1). The dredges on this pattern, used in Britain for
                    ten years after their first introduction, about the year 1838, were usually
                    small and rather heavy—not more than 12 to 15 inches in length, by 4 or 4∣
                    inches in width at the mouth. Two scrapers, the length of the dredge-frame, and
                    1∣ to 2 inches wide, were set at an angle of about 110° to the plane of the
                    dredge’s mouth, so that when the dredge was gently hauled along it took hold of
                    the ground and secured anything loose on its surface,</p>
                <p>Latterly Ball’s dredges of considerably larger size have been used. Perhaps the
                    most convenient form for dredging from a row boat or a yawl is that represented
                    in the figure. The frame is 18 inches long, and its width is 5 inches. The
                    scrapers are 3 inches wide, and these are so set that the distance across
                    between their scraping edges is 7⅜ inches. The ends of the frame connecting the
                    scrapers are round bars of iron five-eighths of an inch in diameter, and from
                    these bars two curved arms of round iron of the same thickness, dividing beneath
                    into two branches, which are attached to the ends of the cross-bars by eyes
                    allowing the arms to fold down over the dredge-mouth, meet in two heavy eyes at
                    a point 18 inches above the centre of the frame. The total weight of the dredge
                    frame and arms is 20 lb; it ought to be of the best Lowmoor or Swedish wrought
                    iron.</p>
                <p>The thick inner edges of the scrapers are perforated by round holes at distances
                    of about an inch, and through these strong iron rings about an inch in diameter
                    are passed, and two or three similar rings run on the short rods which form the
                    ends of the dredge-frame. A light iron rod, bent to the form of the dredge
                    opening, usually runs through these rings, and to this rod and to the rings the
                    mouth of the dredge-bag is securely attached by stout cord or strong copper
                    wire. The dredge-bag for a dredge of this size should be about 2 feet deep; and
                    probably the most suitable material is hand-made netting of very strong twine,
                    the meshes half an inch to the side, the inter-spaces contracting to a third of
                    an inch across when the twine is thoroughly soaked. So open a network would let
                    many of the smaller things through, and to avoid this, and at the same time to
                    give free egress to the water, the bottom of the bag, to the height of about 6
                    inches, is lined with “bread-bag,” a light open kind of canvas. It may be said
                    that in such a dredge many valuable small objects may be washed through the
                    meshes of the upper part of the dredge along with the mud and thus lost; but, on
                    the other hand, if the bag be very close it is apt to get filled up with mud at
                    once, and to collect nothing more.</p>
                <p>For work round the coasts of Europe, at depths attainable from a row-boat or
                    yawl, probably the best kind of line is bolt-rope of the best Russian hemp, not
                    less than 1⅜ inches in circumference, containing eighteen to twenty yarns in
                    three strands. Each yarn should bear nearly a hundred weight, so that the
                    breaking strain of such a rope ought to be about a ton. Of course it is never
                    voluntarily exposed to such a strain, but in shallow water the dredge is often
                    caught among rocks or coral, and the rope should be strong enough in such a case
                    to bring up the boat, even if there were some little way on. It is always well,
                    when dredging, to ascertain the approximate depth with the lead before casting
                    the dredge; and the lead ought always to be accompanied by a registering
                    thermometer, for the subsequent haul of the dredge will gain greatly in value as
                    an observation in geographical distribution, if it be accompanied by an accurate
                    note of the bottom-temperature. For depths under 100 fathoms the amount of rope
                    paid out should be at least double the depth; under 30 fathoms, where one
                    usually works more rapidly, it should be more nearly three times; this gives a
                    good deal of slack before the dredge if the boat be moving very slowly, and
                    keeps the lip of the dredge well down. When there is anything of a current, from
                    whatever cause, it is usually convenient to attach a weight, varying from 14 lb
                    to half a hundred weight, to the rope 3 or 4 fathoms in front of the dredge.
                    This prevents in some degree the lifting of the mouth of the dredge; if the
                    weight be attached nearer the dredge it is apt to injure delicate objects
                    passing in.</p>
                <p>In dredging in sand or mud, the dredge-rope may simply be passed through the
                    double eye formed by the ends of the two arms of the dredge-frame; but in rocky
                    or unknown ground it is better to fasten the rope to the eye of one of the arms
                    only, and to tie the two eyes together with three or four turns of rope-yarn.
                    This stop breaks much more readily than the dredge-rope, so that if the dredge
                    get caught it is the first thing to give way under the strain, and in doing so
                    it often alters the position of the dredge so as to allow of its
                    extrication.</p>
                <p>The dredge is slipped gently over the side, either from the bow or from the
                    stern—in a small boat more usually the latter—while there is a little way on,
                    and the direction which the rope takes indicates roughly whether the dredge is
                    going down properly. When it reaches the ground and begins to scrape, an
                    experienced hand upon the rope can usually detect at once a tremor given to the
                    dredge by the scraper passing over the irregularities of the bottom. The due
                    amount of rope is then paid out, and the rope hitched to a bench or rollock-pin.
                    The boat should move very slowly, probably not faster than a mile an hour. In
                    still <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0480-0461"/> water or with a very slight current the dredge of
                    course anchors the boat, and oars or sails are necessary; but if the boat be
                    moving at all it is all that is required. It is perhaps most pleasant to dredge
                    with a close-reefed sail before a light wind, with weights, against a very
                    slight tide or current; but these are conditions which cannot be commanded. The
                    dredge may remain down from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, by which
                    time, if things go well, it ought to be fairly filled. In dredging from a small
                    boat the simplest plan is for two or three men to haul in, hand over hand, and
                    coil in the bottom of the boat. For a large yaul or yacht, and for depths over
                    50 fathoms, a winch is a great assistance. The rope takes a couple of turns
                    round the winch, which is worked by two men, while a third hand takes it from
                    the winch and coils it down.</p>
                <p>The dredge comes up variously freighted according to the locality, and the next
                    step is to examine its contents and to store the objects of search for future
                    use. In a regularly organized dredging expedition a frame or platform is often
                    erected with a ledge round it to receive the contents of the dredge, but it does
                    well enough to capsize it on an old piece of tarpauling. There are two ways of
                    emptying the dredge; <hi rend="italic">we may</hi> either turn it up and pour
                    out its contents by the mouth, or we may have a contrivance by which the bottom
                    of the bag is made to unlace. The first plan is the simpler and the one more
                    usually adopted; the second has the advantage of letting the mass slide out more
                    smoothly and easily, but the lacing introduces rather a damaging complication,
                    as it is apt to loosen or give way. Any objects visible on the surface of the
                    heap are now carefully removed, and placed for identification in jars or tubs of
                    sea-water, of which there should be a number secured in some form of bottle
                    basket, standing ready. The heap should not be much disturbed, for the delicate
                    objects contained in it have already been unavoidably subjected to a good deal
                    of rough usage, and the less friction among the stones the better.</p>
                <p>Close to the place where the dredge is emptied there ought to be a tub about 2
                    feet in diameter and 20 inches deep, provided with a set of sieves so arranged
                    that the lowest sieve fits freely within the bottom of the tub, and the three
                    remaining sieves fit freely within one another, (fig. 2.) Each sieve has a pair
                    of iron handles through which the hand can pass easily, and the handles of the
                    largest sieve are made long, so that the whole nest can be lifted without
                    stooping or putting the arms into the water. The upper smallest sieve is usually
                    deeper than the others; it is made of a strong open net of brass wire, the
                    meshes half an inch to a side. The second sieve is finer, the meshes a quarter
                    of an inch to a side; the third is finer still; and the fourth is so close as
                    only to allow the passage of mud or fine sand. The sieves are put into the tub,
                    and the tub filled up to the middle of the top sieve with seawater. The top
                    sieve is then filled with the contents of the dredge, and the set of sieves are
                    gently moved up and down by the handles of the bottom sieve in the water. It is
                    of great importance not to give a rotatory motion to the sieves in this part of
                    the process, for this is very ruinous to fragile organisms; the sieves should be
                    gently churned up aud down, whether singly or together. The result is that the
                    rougher stones and gravel and the larger organisms lire washed and retained in
                    the upper sieve; the fine mud or sand passes through the whole of the sieves and
                    subsides to the bottom of the tub; while the three lower sieves contain, in
                    graduated series, the objects of intermediate size. The sieves are examined
                    carefully in succession, and the organisms which they contain are gently removed
                    with a pair of brass or bone forceps into the jars of sea-water, where their
                    movement and their natural colours may be observed, or placed at once in bottles
                    of strong or weak spirit of wine or dried, according to the object for which
                    they have been collected.</p>
                <p>The scientific value of à dredging depends mainly upon two things,—the care with
                    which the objects procured are preserved and labelled for future identification
                    and reference, and the accuracy with which all the circumstances of the
                    dredging—the position, the depth, the nature of the ground, the date, the
                    bottom-temperature, &amp;c. —are recorded. Every specimen, whether dry or in
                    spirit, should be labelled at once with the number under which this particular
                    dredging is entered in the dredger’s note book.</p>
                <p>Up to the middle of last century the little that was known of the inhabitants of
                    the sea beyond low-water mark seems to have been gathered almost entirely from
                    the objects found thrown on the beach after storms, and from chance captures on
                    lead-lines, or by fishermen on their long lines, aud in trawls and oyster and
                    clam dredges. The naturalist’s dredge does not appear to have been used for
                    investigating systematically the fauna of the bottom of the sea until it was
                    employed by Otho Frederick Müller in the researches which afforded material for
                    the publication, in 1779, of his admirable <hi rend="italic">Descriptions and
                    History of the rarer and less known Animals of Denmark, and Norwdy.</hi> In the
                    preface to the first volume Müller gives a quaint description and figure of a
                    dredge (fig. 3) not very unlike that used by Hall and Forbes, only the mouth of
                    the dredge was square, a form which, unless used with great caution, gives fatal
                    facilities for “washing out” in the process of hauling in.</p>
                <p>At the Birmingham meeting of the British Association in 1839 an important
                    committee was appointed “for researches with the dredge with a view to the
                    .investigation of the marine zoology of Great Britain, the illustration of the
                    geographical distribution of marine animals, and the more accurate determination
                    of the fossils of the Pliocene period.” Of this committee Edward Forbes was the
                    ruling spirit, and under the genial influence of his contagious enthusiasm great
                    progress was made during the next decade in the knowledge of the fauna of the
                    British seas, and many wonderfully pleasant days were spent by the original
                    committee and by many others who from year to year were “added to their number.”
                    Every annual report of the British Association contains communications from the
                    English, the Scottish, or the Irish branches of the committee; and in 1850
                    Edward Forbes submitted its first general report on British marine zoology. This
                    report, as might have been anticipated from the eminent qualifications of the
                    reporter, was of the highest value; and, taken along with his remarkable memoirs
                    previously published, “On the Distribution of the Mollusca and Radiata of Aegean
                    Sea,” and “On the Zoological Relations of the existing Fauna and Flora of the
                    British Isles,” may be said to mark an era in the progress of human thought.</p>
                <p>The dredging operations of the British Association committee were carried on
                    generally under the idea that at the 100-fathom line, by which amateur work in
                    small boats was practically limited, the zero of animal life was approached—a
                    notion which was destined to be gradually undermined, and finally overthrown.
                    From time to time, however, there were not wanting men of great skill and
                    experience<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0481-0462"/> to maintain, with Sir James Clark Ross, that
                    “from however great a depth we may be enabled to bring up mud and stones of the
                    bed of the ocean we shall find them teeming with animal life.” Samples of the
                    seabottom, procured with great difficulty and in small quantity from the first
                    deep soundings in the Atlantic, chiefly by the use of Brooke’s sounding machine,
                    an instrument which by a neat contrivance disengaged its weights when it reached
                    the bottom, and thus allowed a tube, so arranged as to get filled with a sample
                    of the bottom, to be recovered by the sounding line, were eagerly examined by
                    miscroscopists; and the singular fact was established that these samples
                    consisted over a large part of the bed of the Atlantic of the entire or broken
                    shells of certain Foraminifera. Dr Wallich, the naturalist to the “Bulldog”
                    sounding expedition under Sir Leopold M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clintock,
                    reported that star-fishes, with their stomachs full of the deep-sea
                    Foraminifera, had come up from a depth of 1200 fathoms on a sounding line; and
                    doubts began tobe entertained whether the bottom of the sea was in truth a
                    desert, or whether it might not present a new zoological region open to
                    investigation and discovery, and peopled by a peculiar fauna suited to its
                    special conditions.</p>
                <p>In the year 1868, while the question was still undecided, two testing
                    investigations were undertaken independently. In America Count L. F. Fourtales,
                    one of the officers employed in the United States Coast Survey under Professor
                    Pierce, commenced a series of deep dredgings across the Gulf Stream off the
                    coast of Florida, which were continued in the following year, and were
                    productive of most valuable results; and in Great Britain the Admiralty, on the
                    representation of the Royal Society, placed the “Lightning,” a small gun vessel,
                    at the disposal of a small committee to sound and dredge in the North Atlantic
                    between Shetland and the Faroe Islands.</p>
                <p>In the “Lightning,” with the help of a “donkeyengine” for winding in, dredging
                    was carried on with comparative ease at a depth of 600 fathoms, and at that
                    depth animal life was found to be still abundant. The results of the
                    “Lightning’s” dredgings were regarded of so great importance to science that the
                    Royal Society pressed upon the Admiralty the advantage of continuing the
                    researches, and accordingly, during the years 1869 and 1870, the gun-boat
                    “Porcupine” was put under the orders of a committee consisting of Dr Carpenter,
                    F.R.S., Dr Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S., and Professor Wyville Thomson, F.R.S., one or
                    other of whom superintended the scientific work of a series of dredging trips in
                    the North Atlantic to the north and west of the British Islands, which occupied
                    two summers.</p>
                <p>In the “Porcupine,” in the summer of 1869, dredging was carried down successfully
                    to a depth of 2435 fathoms, upwards of two miles and a half, in the Bay of
                    Biscay, and the dredge brought up well-developed representatives of all the
                    classes of marine invertebrates. During the cruises of the “Porcupine” the fauna
                    of the deep water off the western coasts of Great Britain and of Spain and
                    Portugal was tolerably well ascertained, and it was found to differ greatly from
                    the fauna of shallow water in the same region, to possess very special
                    characters, and to show a very marked relation to the faunae of the earlier
                    Tertiary and the later Cretaceous periods.</p>
                <p>In the winter of 1872, as a sequel to the preliminary cruises of the “Lightning”
                    and “Porcupine,” by far the most considerable expedition in which systematic
                    dredging had ever been made a special object left Great Britain. H.M.S.
                    “Challenger,” a corvette of 2306 tons, with auxiliary steam working to 1234
                    horse-power, was despatched to investigate the physical and biological
                    conditions of the great ocean basins.</p>
                <p>The “Challenger” was provided with a most complete and liberal organization for
                    the purpose; she had powerful deck engines for hauling in the dredge, workrooms,
                    laboratories, and libraries for investigating the results on the spot, and a
                    staff of competent naturalists to undertake such investigations and to
                    superintend the packing and preservation of the specimens reserved for future
                    study.</p>
                <p>In these deep-sea dredgings it was frequently found that, while few objects of
                    interest were brought up within the dredge, many echinoderms, corals, and
                    sponges came to the surface sticking to the outside of the dredge, and even to
                    the first few fathoms of the dredge-line. This suggested many expedients, and
                    finally a long transverse iron bar was attached to the bottom of the dredge-bag,
                    and large bunches of teazed-out hemp were fastened to the free ends of the bar
                    (fig. 4). The “hempen-tangles” are now regarded as an essential part of the
                    dredge, nearly as important as the dredgebag, and often much more conspicuous in
                    its results. This addition to Ball’s dredge is not, however, generally available
                    in dredging from a boat or in shallow water; the tangles are apt to catch on
                    rocks or coral, and a turn of the drum of the donkey-engine is required to free
                    them.</p>
                <p>Ball’s dredge was still employed, with some slight modifications, the result of
                    further experience. Fig. 4 represents the form of dredge which was found most
                    suitable for great depths. The dredgeframe of hammered iron is 4 feet 6 inches
                    long and 1 foot 3 inches broad; the scrapers are 3 inches wide, and are
                    connected at the ends by bars of 1∣ inches round iron. The arms are of inch
                    round iron, and slightly curved; they are bolted together to a stout iron bar
                    which ends above in a swivel and ring. Two bars of square iron of some strength
                    are attached by eyes to the round cross-bars at the ends of the dredge-frame,
                    and have the other ends lashed to the iron bar which bears the tangles. These
                    rods keep the dredge-bag at its full length, and prevent it or the tangles from
                    folding over the mouth of the dredge. The dredge-bag is 4 feet 6 inches in
                    length; the lower half is of twine netting so close as to retain everything
                    except the finest mud, which indeed only partially washes through, and the upper
                    half is of twine netting with the meshes an inch to the side. The bag is guarded
                    by three bops of bolt-rope attached to the frame of the dredge, to the bottom of
                    the bag, and finally to the tangle-bar. The canvas pads represented in the
                    figure on the dredge-frame are only to protect the seizings of the loops. The
                    dredge is suspended by an iron chain, which forms the first few fathoms of the
                    dredge-line. The chain is not, however, directly fastened to the ring at the end
                    of the arms, but is made fast to one of the end bars of the dredge-frame, and it
                    is stopped to the ring by a single strand of bolt-rope. If the dredge get caught
                    the stop carries away, the direction of the strain on the dredge is altered, and
                    it probably relieves itself and comes up end upwards. In deep water a 28 R&gt;
                    deep-sea lead is usually hung from the centre of the tangle-bar with four
                    tangles on each side.</p>
                <p>Dredging was carried on in the “Challenger” from the main yard-arm. A strong
                    pendant was attached by a hook to the cap of the main-mast, and by a tackle to
                    the yardarm a compound arrangement of 55 to 70 of Hodge’s patent accumulators
                    was hung to the pendant, and beneath <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0482-0463"/> it a block through which the dredge-rope passed.
                    The donkey-engines for hauling in the dredging and sounding gear were placed at
                    the foot of the main-mast on the port side. They consisted of a pair of
                    direct-acting, high-pressure, horizontal engines, in combination of 18
                    horsepower nominal. Instead of a connecting rod to each, a guide was fixed to
                    the end of the piston-rod with a brass block working up and down the slot of the
                    guide. The crank-axles ran through the centre of the blocks, and the movable
                    block, obtaining a backward and forward motion from the piston-rod, acted on the
                    crank as a connecting-rod would do. This style of engine is commonly used for
                    pumping, the pump-rods being attached to the guide on the opposite side from the
                    piston-rod. At one end of the crank a small toothed wheel was attached, which
                    drove one thrice the multiple on a horizontal shaft extending nearly across the
                    deck, and about 3 feet 6 inches above it. At each end of this shaft a large and
                    a small drum were fixed, the larger having three sheaves cast upon it of
                    different sizee, the lesser being a common barrel only. To these dιums the line
                    was led, two or three turns being taken round the drum selected. In hauling in,
                    the dredge-rope was taken to a gin-block secured to a spar on the forecastle,
                    then aft to the drum of the donkey-engines on the port side, then to a
                    leading-block on the port side of the quarter-deck, and across the deck to a
                    leading-block on the starboard side corresponding in diameter with the drum used
                    on the port side, and from this it was finally taken by the hands and coiled.
                    The strain is of course greatest at the yard-arm and the first leading-block,
                    and by this arrangement it is gradually diminished as the line passes round the
                    series of blocks and sheaves.</p>
                <p>A change made latterly in the handling of the dredge had certain advantages.
                    Instead of attaching the weights directly to the dredge-rope, and sending them
                    down with the dredge, a “toggle,” a small spindle-shaped piece of hard wood, was
                    attached transversely to the rope at the required distance, 200 to 300 fathoms
                    in advance of the dredge. A “messenger,” consisting of a figure of eight of
                    rope, with two large thimbles in the loops, had one of the thimbles slipped over
                    the chain before the dredge was hung, and the other thimble made fast to a
                    lizard. When the dredge was well down and had taken its direction from the drift
                    of the ship, the weights, usually six 28-K&gt; deep-sea leads in three canvas
                    covers, were attached to the other thimble of the traveller, which was then cut
                    adrift from the lizard and allowed to spin down the line until it was brought up
                    by the toggle. By this plan the dredge took a somewhat longer time to go down;
                    but after it was adopted not a single case occurred of the fouling of the dredge
                    in the dredge-rope, a misadventure which had occurred more than once before, and
                    which was attributed to the weights getting ahead of the dredge in going down,
                    and pulling it down upon them entangled in the double part of the line.</p>
                <p>The great risk in dredging in very deep water is that of the dredge running down
                    nearly vertically and sinking at once into the soft mud, and remaining imbedded
                    until hauling in commences. Duringthe earlier part of the voyage of the
                    “Challenger” this accident seemed too often to defeat, at all events partially,
                    the object of the operation · and, after various suggestions for modifying the
                    dredge, it was proposed to try some form of the trawl in order to insure, so far
                    as possible, the capture of any of the larger marine animals which might be
                    present, and thus to gain a better general idea of the nature of the fauna. A
                    15-feet beam-trawl was sent down off Cape St Vincent to a depth of 600 fathoms;
                    the experiment looked hazardous, but the trawl came up in due time all right,
                    and contained, along with many of the larger Invertebrata, several fishes, The
                    trawl seemed to answer so well that it was tried again a little farther south in
                    1090 fathoms, and again it was perfectly successful, and during the remainder of
                    the voyage it was employed almost as frequently, and in nearly as deep water, as
                    Ball’s dredge. The deepest successful haul of the trawl was in the Pacific in
                    3125 fathoms, and the deepest haul of Ball’s dredge was in the Atlantic at 3150
                    fathoms.</p>
                <p>During the voyage of the “Challenger” a course of about 70,000 nautical miles was
                    traversed in three years and a half, and 362 observing stations were established
                    at intervals as nearly uniform as circumstances would permit; and at the greater
                    number of these dredging or some modification of the process was successfully
                    performed—52 times at depths greater than 2000 fathoms, and thrice at depths
                    beyond 3000 fathoms. So fully convinced were the “Challenger” officers that they
                    could dredge at any depths, that it was only want of time and daylight which
                    prevented their doing so at their deepest sounding, 4575 fathoms. The Atlantic
                    was crossed five times, and an erratic route through the Pacific gave a good
                    idea of the conditions of the abysses of that ocean, while in the South Indian
                    Ocean dredging and trawling were carried down close to the Antarctic
                    ice-barrier.</p>
                <p>The expedition was successful, and the results were of the most interesting
                    nature. Animal life was found to exist at all depths, although probably in
                    diminishing abundance as the depth becomes extreme; and in all parts of the
                    world at depths beyond 400 or 500 fathoms the fauna had much the same general
                    character. The species usually differed in widely separated areas, but the great
                    majority of forms, if not identical, were so nearly allied that they might be
                    regarded as representative and genetically related. Although all marine
                    invertebrate classes were represented, echinoderms in their different orders,
                    sponges, and Crustacea preponderated, while corals and Mollusca were
                    comparatively scarce. In the first two groups named many forms occurred allied
                    to families which had been previously regarded as extinct or nearly so: thus
                    among the echinoderms, stalked crinoids were by no means rare, and many species
                    of regular Echinidea related to the Chalk genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hchinothuria,</hi> and many irregular species allied to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ananchytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dysaster</hi> occurred. The sponges were
                    mainly represented by the <hi rend="italic">Hexactinellidoe,</hi> the beautiful
                    order to which the glass-rope sponge of Japan and the marvellous “Venus’s Flower
                    Basket” of the Philippines belong, the order to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ventriculites</hi> of the Chalk must also be referred,</p>
                <p>Dredging at these great depths is a difficult and critical operation, and,
                    although by its means some idea of the nature and distribution of the abyssal
                    fauna of the ocean has already been attained, it will be long before the blanks
                    are filled up; for of the area of 140,000,000 square miles forming the “abyssal
                    province” the actual amount hitherto traversed by the naturalist’s dredge may
                    still be readily reckoned by the square yard. (c. w. τ.)</p>
