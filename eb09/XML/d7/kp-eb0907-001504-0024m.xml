                    wor&lt;⅛(Deut. iv. 13,x. 4; Exod. xxxiv. 28), written on the two tables of
                    stone, the so-called <hi rend="italic">tables of the revelation</hi> (E. V.,
                    tables of testimony—Ex. xxxiv. 29, comp. ch. xxv. 21), or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tables of the covenant</hi> (Deut. ix. 9). In Deuteronomy the inscription on
                    these tables, which is briefly called <hi rend="italic">the covenant</hi> (iv.
                    13), is expressly identified with the words spoken by Jehovah out of the midst
                    of the fire at Mount Sinai in the ears of the whole people on the “day of the
                    assembly,” and rehearsed in ch. V. 6—21. In the narrative of Exodus the relation
                    of the “ten words ’’ of ch. xxxiv. to the words spoken from Sinai, ch. XX. 2-17,
                    is not so clearly indicated—a circumstance which has given rise to speculations
                    as to the possible existence of a second decalogue. Before entering on this
                    question, however, we must examine the decalogue as usually understood and
                    embodied in the parallel passages in Exod. XX. and Deut. v.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The variations in the parallel texts,</hi> so far as they
                    are important for the criticism of the decalogue, are mainly two. (a) The reason
                    assigned for the institution of the Sabbath in Exodus is drawn from the
                    creation/and agrees with Gen. ii. 3. In Deuteronomy the command is based on the
                    duty of humanity to servants and the memory of Egyptian bondage. (&amp;) In the
                    tenth commandment, as given in Exodus, “house” means house and household,
                    including all the particulars which are enumerated in ver. 17. In Deuteronomy,
                    “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s <hi rend="italic">wife”</hi> comes first,
                    and “house” following in association with field is to be taken in the literal
                    restricted sense.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The construction of the Hebrew text</hi> of the second
                    commandment is disputed, but the most natural sense seems to be, “Thou shalt not
                    make unto thee a graven image; [and] to no visible shape in heaven, &lt;fcc.,
                    shalt thou bow down, &lt;fcc.” The third commandment might be better rendered,
                    “Thou shalt not utter the name of the Lord thy God vainly.”</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Divisions of the Decalogue.—</hi> The division current in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n25/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0025-0016"/> England and Scotland, and generally among the
                    Reformed (Calvinistic) churches and in the Greek Church, is known as the
                    Philonic division (Philo <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Decalogo,</hi> § 12). It is sometimes called by the name of Origen, who adopts
                    it in his <hi rend="italic">Homilies on Exodus.</hi> On this scheme the preface,
                    Exod. XX. 2, has been usually taken as part of the first commandment. The Church
                    of Rome and the Lutherans adopt the Augustinian division (Aug., <hi
                    rend="italic">Quaest. super</hi><hi rend="italic">Exod.,</hi> lxxi.), combining
                    into one the first and second commandments of Philo, and splitting his tenth
                    commandment into two. To gain a clear distinction between the ninth and tenth
                    commandments on this scheme it has usually been felt to be necessary to follow
                    the Deuteronomic text, and make the ninth commandment, Thou shalt not covet they
                    neighbour’s wife.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> So,
                    for example, Augustine, <hi rend="italic">I. c.</hi> Thomas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">(Prima</hi><hi rend="italic">Secundae,</hi> qu. c.
                    art. 4), and recently Sonntag and Kurtz. Purely arbitrary is the idea of
                    Lutheran writers (Gerhard, <hi rend="italic">Loc.</hi> xiii. § 46) that the
                    ninth commandment forbids <hi rend="italic">concupiscentia actualis,</hi> the
                    tenth cone, <hi rend="italic">originalis.</hi></p></note> As scarcely any
                    scholar will now claim priority for the text of Deuteronomy, this division may
                    be viewed as exploded. But there is a third scheme (the Talmudic) still current
                    among the Jews, and not unknown to early Christian writers, which is still a
                    rival of the Philonic view. The preface, ExocL xx. 2, is taken as the first
                    word, and the second embraces verses 3-6. Among recent Christian writers who
                    have adopted this view are Knobel (in his <hi rend="italic">Com. on Exodus)</hi>
                    and Kuenen <hi rend="italic">(Godsdienst van Israel,</hi> i. 278 ∕.). The
                    decision between Philo and the Talmud must turn on two questions. Can we take
                    the preface as a separate word? And can we regard the prohibition of polytheism
                    and the prohibition of idolatry as one commandment <hi rend="italic">ì Now,</hi>
                    though the Hebrew certainly speaks of ten “words,” not of ten “precepts,” it is
                    most unlikely that the first word can be different in character from those that
                    follow. But the statement <hi rend="italic">“I</hi> am the Lord thy God,” is
                    either no precept at all, or only enjoins by implication what is expressly
                    commanded in the words “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Thus to take
                    the preface as a distinct word is not reasonable unless there are cogent grounds
                    for uniting the commandments against polytheism and idolatry. But that is far
                    from being the case. The first precept of the Philonic scheme enjoins monolatry,
                    the second expresses God’s spiritual and transcendental nature. Accordingly
                    Kuenen does not deny that the prohibition of images contains an element
                    additional to the precept of monolatry, but, following De Goeje, regards the
                    words from “thou shalt not make unto thyself” down to “the waters under the
                    earth” as a later insertion in the original decalogue. Unless this can be made
                    out—of which below —the Philonic scheme is clearly best, and as such it is now
                    accepted by most scholars.</p>
                <p>How were the ten words disposed on the two tables <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> The
                    natural arrangement (which is assumed by Philo and Josephus) would be five and
                    five. And this, as Philo recognized, is a division appropriate to the sense of
                    the precepts; for antiquity did not look on piety towards parents as a mere
                    precept of probity, part of one’s duty towards one’s neighbour. The authority of
                    parents and rulers is viewed in the Old Testament as a delegated divine
                    authority, and the violation of it is akin to blasphemy (comp. Ex. xxi. 17, Lev.
                    xx. 9, with Lev. xxiv. 15, 16, and note the formula of treason, 1 Kings xxi.
                    13).</p>
                <p>We have thus five precepts of piety on the first table, and five of probity on
                    the second, an arrangement which is accepted by the best recent writers. But the
                    current view of the Western Church since Augustine has been that the precept to
                    honour parents heads the second table. The only argument of weight in favour of
                    this view is that it makes the amount of writing on the two tables less unequal,
                    while we know that the second table as well as the first was written on both
                    sides (Ex. xxxii. 15). But we shall presently see that there may be another way
                    out of this difficulty.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Critical questions.—</hi> That the decalogue not only
                    contains Mosaic ideas, but is as old as Moses in its form as a system of “ten
                    words,” is admitted by critics of almost every school.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Exceptions to this consensus are Vatke <hi
                    rend="italic">(Biblische Theologie,</hi> p. 202) and Nöldeke (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Untersuchungen,</hi> p. 51).</p></note> But it is much disputed what the
                    original compass of the decalogue was. Did the whole text of Exod. xx. 2-17
                    stand on the tables of stone 1 The answer to this question must start from the
                    reason annexed to the fourth commandment, which is different in Deuteronomy. But
                    the express words “and he added no more,” in Deut. v. 22, show that there is no
                    conscious omission by the Deuteronomic speaker of part of the original
                    decalogue, which cannot therefore have included the reason annexed in Exodus. On
                    the other hand the reason annexed in Deuteronomy is rather a parenetic addition
                    than an original element dropped in Exodus. Thus the original fourth commandment
                    was simply “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> It is generally assumed that the addition in
                    Exodus is from the hand that wrote Gen i.-ü. 4.</p></note> When this is granted
                    it must appear not improbable that the elucidations of other commandments may
                    not have stood on the tables. Thus in the second commandment, “Thou shalt not
                    bow down to any visible form,” &lt;kc., is a sort of explanatory addition to the
                    precept “Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image.” And so the promise
                    attached to the fifth commandment was probably not on the tables, and the tenth
                    commandment may have simply been,“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house,”
                    which includes all that is expressed in the following clauses. Such a view gets
                    over the difficulty arising from the unequal length of the two halves of the
                    decalogue. The elucidations (unless in the case of the fourth commandment) may
                    very well be as old as Moses (comp. Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte,</hi>
                    ii. 229). It is quite another question whether there is any idea in the
                    decalogue which cannot be as old as Moses. It is urged by many critics that
                    Moses cannot have prohibited the worship of Jehovah by images; for the
                    subsequent history shows us a descendant of Moses as priest in the idolatrous
                    sanctuary of Dan. There were teraphim in David’s house, and the worship of
                    Jehovah under the image of a calf was the state religion of the kingdom of
                    Ephraim. It is argued from these facts that image worship went on Unchallenged,
                    and that this would not have been possible had Moses forbidden it. This argument
                    does not appear to have all the force that Kuenen and others attach to it, for
                    it must be remembered how large a section of Christendom, in times much more
                    advanced than those of the Old Testament, has accepted the decalogue and yet has
                    worshipped images. And on the other side we have the much more cogent arguments
                    that the number of ten words, which no one doubts to be primitive, cannot be
                    naturally made out if the law against images is dropped, and that the existence
                    of this law is necessary to explain the fact that the unquestionably Mosaic
                    sanctuary of the ark, which is just the sanctuary of the revelation of the ten
                    words, embodies the principle of the worship of Jehovah without images in a
                    distinct and practical form. It may be added that the prohibition of images of
                    hewn stone, which is the primitive sense of the word “graven-image,” can hardly
                    be less ancient than the conception that the stones of an altar were defiled by
                    the touch of the chisel (Exod. xx. 24). And this is a conception which cannot be
                    viewed as a later refinement on Mosaic ideas.</p>

                    simply read of “the revelation” inscribed on the tables, and it seems to be
                    assumed that the contents of this revelation must be already known to the
                    reader. The expression “ten words” first occurs in xxxiv. 28, in a passage which
                    relates the restoration of the tables after they had been broken. But these “ten
                    words” are called “the words of the covenant,” and so can hardly be different
                    from the words mentioned in the preceding verse as those in accordance wherewith
                    the covenant was made with Israel. And again, the words of verse 27 are
                    necessarily the commandments which immediately precede in verses 12-26.
                    Accordingly many recent critics, following Hitzig,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ostern und Pfingsten im
                    zweiten Dekalog,</hi> Heidelberg, 1838.</p></note> who seems to have formed his
                    view without reference to a previous suggestion of Goethe’s, have sought to show
                    that Exod. xxxiv. 12-26 contains just ten precepts forming a second decalogue.
                    In point of detail it is disputed whether the narrator of Exod. xxxiv. regards
                    this decalogue as precisely identical with that which stood on the first tables
                    (which seems to follow from xxxiv. 1) or as a modification of the original words
                    (so Ewald). It does not seem possible to deny the connection of verses 27, 28
                    with one another and with the previous context as the text now stands.
                    Hengstenberg <hi rend="italic">(Beiträge,</hi> ii. 387 <hi rend="italic"
                    >fsh)</hi> and Bertheau <hi rend="italic">(Sieben</hi><hi rend="italic">Gruppen
                    Mosaischer Gesetze,</hi> p. 97) seek to distinguish the words of verse 28, as
                    written by God himself, from those which, in verse 27, Moses is commanded to
                    write. But no such distinction lies in the text, and it is not probable that the
                    narrator felt any contradiction between God’s promise to write the words in
                    verse 1 and the use of human instrumentality as implied in verse 28. On the
                    other hand, the hypothesis of a second decalogue has serious if not insuperable
                    difficulties. The number of ten precepts in Exod. xxxiv. is by no means clearly
                    made out, and the individual precepts are variously assigned by different
                    critics; while the most recent supporter of the theory admits that the original
                    number of ten is now concealed by additions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wellhansen in <hi rend="italic">Jahrbb.f. D, Theol,,</hi>
                    1876, p. 554.</p></note> This supposed decalogue contains no precepts of social
                    morality, but forms a sort of unsystematic abstract of the oldest laws about
                    points of religious observance. If such a system of precepts was ever viewed as
                    the basis of the covenant with Israel, it must belong to a far earlier stage of
                    religious development than that of Exod. xx. This is recognized by Wellhausen,
                    who says that our decalogue stands to that of Exod. xxxiv. as Amos stood to his
                    contemporaries, whose whole religion lay in the observance of sacred feasts. But
                    the idea that the ethical teaching of the prophets had no basis in the original
                    document of the Mosaic covenant is so revolutionary that few will venture to
                    accept “Goethe’s decalogue” with such inferences. The difficulty is presumably
                    due to the interweaving of several distinct narratives, which perplexes the
                    sequence of many parts of Exodus. It is more probable that xxxiv. 10-27— a
                    summary of the religious precepts of the Mosaic convenant—originally stood in a
                    different connection than that there ever were two opinions as to what stood on
                    the tables.</p>

                    all the pre cepts of the decalogue as moral precepts <hi rend="italic">de lege
                    naturae,</hi> though the law of the Sabbath is not of the law of nature, in so
                    far as it prescribes a determinate day of rest (Thomas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa,</hi> I <hi rend="superscript"> ma</hi> II <hi rend="superscript">
                    dae</hi>, qu. c. art. 3; Duns, <hi rend="italic">Super</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sententias,</hi> lib. iii. dist. 37). The most important mediaeval exposition
                    of the decalogue is that of Nicolaus de Lyra; and the 15th century, in which the
                    decalogue acquired special importance in the confessional, was prolific in
                    treatises on the subject (Antoninus of Florence, Gerson, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>Important theological controversies on the decalogue begin with the Reformation.
                    The question between the Lutheran (Augustinian) and Reformed (Philonic) division
                    of the ten commandments was mixed up with controversy as to the legitimacy of
                    sacred images not designed to be worshipped. The Reformed theologians took the
                    stricter view. The identity of the decalogue with the eternal law of nature was
                    maintained in both churches, but it was an open question whether the decalogue,
                    as such (that is, as a law given by Moses to the Israelites), is of perpetual
                    obligation. The Socinians, on the other hand, regarded the decalogue as
                    abrogated by the more perfect law of Christ; and this view, especially in the
                    shape that the decalogue is a civil and not amoral law (J. D. Michaelis), was
                    the current one in the period of rationalism in last century. The distinction of
                    a permanent and a transitory element in the law of the Sabbath is found, not
                    only in Luther and Melanchthon, but in Calvin and other theologians of the
                    Reformed church. The main controversy which arose on the basis of this
                    distinction was whether the prescription of one day in seven is of permanent
                    obligation. It was admitted that such obligation must be not natural but
                    positive; but it was argued by the stricter Calvinistic divines that the
                    proportion of one in seven is agreeable to nature, based on the order of
                    creation in six days, and in no way specially connected with anything Jewish.
                    Hence it was regarded as a <hi rend="italic">universal positive</hi> law of God.
                    But those who maintained the opposite view were not excluded from the number of
                    the orthodox. The laxer conception found a place in the Cocceian school.</p>
