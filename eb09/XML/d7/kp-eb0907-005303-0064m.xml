                    the 15th century. His father, François Deluc, was the author of some
                    publications in refutation of Mandeville and other rationalistic writers, which
                    are best known through Rousseau’s humorous account of his ennui in reading them;
                    and he gave his son an excellent education, chiefly in mathematics and natural
                    science. On completing it he engaged in commerce, which principally occupied the
                    first forty-six years of his life, without any other interruption than that
                    which was occasioned by some journeys of business into the neighbouring
                    countries, and a few scientific excursions among the Alps. During these,
                    however, he collected by degrees, in conjunction with his brother Guillaume
                    Antoine, a splendid museum of mineralogy and of natural history in general,
                    which was afterwards increased by his nephew André Deluc. He at the same time
                    took a prominent part in politics. In 1768 he was sent to Paris on an embassy to
                    the Due de Choiseul, whose friendship he succeeded in gaining. In 1770 he was
                    nominated one of the Council of Two Hundred. Three years later unexpected
                    reverses' in business made it advisable for him to quit hi's native town, which
                    he only revisited once for a few days. The change was welcome in so far as it
                    set him entirely free for scientific pursuits, and it was with little regret
                    that he removed to England in 1773. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in
                    the same year, and received the appointment of reader to Queen Charlotte, which
                    he continued to hold for forty-four years, and which afforded him both leisure
                    and a competent income. In the latter part of his life he obtained leave to make
                    several tours in Switzerland, France, Holland, and Germany. In Germany he passed
                    the six years from 1798 to 1804; and after his return he undertook a geological
                    tour through England. When he was at Göttingen, in the beginning of his German
                    tour, he received the compliment of being appointed honorary professor of
                    geology in that university; but he never entered upon the active duties of a
                    professorship. He was also a correspondent of the Academy of Sciences at Paris,
                    and a member of several other scientific associations.</p>
                <p>His favourite studies were geology and meteorology. The situation of his native
                    country had naturally led him to contemplate the peculiarities of the earth’s
                    structure, and the properties of the atmosphere, as particularly displayed in
                    mountainous countries, and as subservient to the measurement of heights. He
                    inherited from his father a sincere veneration for the doctrines of
                    Christianity, and a disposition to defend the Mosaic account of the creation
                    against the criticism whose principal weapons were furnished by his favourite
                    science. His royal patroness was most anxious to encourage and promote his
                    labours in this field; and he was generally supposed to have had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n65/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0065-0054"/> great success in removing the objections which
                    had been advanced by his antagonists against the comparatively recent formation
                    of the present continents. According to Cuvier, he ranked among the first
                    geologists of his age. His principal geological work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">physiques</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">morales</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">histoire de la terre</hi> (6 vols. 8vo, The Hague, 1778), was
                    dedicated to Queen Charlotte. It dealt with the appearance of mountains and the
                    antiquity of the human race, explained the six days of the Mosaic creation as so
                    many epochs preceding the actual state of the globe, and attributes the deluge
                    to the filling up o.f cavities supposed to have been left void in the interior
                    of the earth. This attempt to reconcile religion and science, so often since
                    repeated, was ingenious and for a time successful with most minds. The theory of
                    the Mosaic days was maintained in one form or other by several later geologists
                    of high repute, though it is scarcely now thought worth discussion by any to
                    whom that title can justly be applied.</p>
                <p>Deluc’s original experiments relating to meteorology are more valuable to the
                    natural philosopher than most of his geological work; and he discovered many
                    facts of considerable importance relating to heat and moisture. He noticed the
                    disappearance of heat in the thawing of ice about the same time that Black
                    founded on it his ingenious hypothesis of latent heat. He ascertained that water
                    was more dense about 40° Fahr, than at the temperature of freezing, expanding
                    equally on each side of the maximum; and he was the originator of the theory
                    afterward re-advanced by Dalton, that the quantity of aqueous vapour contained
                    in any space is independent of the presence or density of the air, or of any
                    other elastic fluid; though it appears difficult to reconcile this opinion with
                    some of the experiments of Deluc’s great rival, Saussure, a philosopher who, as
                    he very candidly allows, made in many respects more rapid progress in hygrometry
                    than himself. Deluc’s comparative experiments on his own hygrometer and on
                    Saussure’s show only that both are imperfect; but it may be inferred from them
                    that a mean between the two would in general approach much nearer to the natural
                    scale than either taken separately. It appears also probable that Saussure’s is
                    rather less injured by time than Deluc’s, which has been found to indicate an
                    increasing amount of mean moisture every year.</p>
                <p>Deluc was a man of warm feelings, and of gentle and obliging manners, and his
                    literary and scientific merits, as well as his unremitting attention to the
                    service of the queen, insured her respect and kindness. He saw her daily for
                    many years, and in his last illness, which was long and painful, she showed him
                    repeated marks of benevolent regard. He died at Windsor on the 7th of November
                    1817.</p>
                <p>A brief notice of his more important works, in addition to that mentioned above,
                    will give a clear idea of the nature and range of his scientific activity. His

                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Atmosphère</hi>
                    (2 vols. 4to, Geneva, 1772; 4 vols. 8vo, Par. 1784), contains many accurate and
                    ingenious experiments upon moisture, evaporation, and the indications of
                    hygrometers and thermometers, applied to the barometer employed in determining
                    heights. In the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1773, appeared his account
                    of a new hygrometer, which resembled a mercurial thermometer, with an ivory
                    bulb, which expanded by moisture, and caused the mercury to descend. The first
                    correct rules ever published for measuring heights by the barometer were those
                    he gave in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1771, p. 158. His <hi

                    addressed to Professor Blumenbach. The substance had already appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi> for 1790, 1791, and 1798. The volume
                    contains an essay written for a prize at Haarlem in 1791, but without success,
                    on the existence of a General Principle of Morality. It also gives an
                    interesting account of some conversations of the author with Voltaire ana
                    Rousseau. Deluc was an ardent admirer of Bacon, on whose writings he published
                    two works,— <hi rend="italic">Bacon</hi><hi rend="italic">tel qu’il est</hi>
                    (8vo, Berlin, 1800), shewing the bad faith of the French translator, who had
                    omitted many passages favourable to revealed religion, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Précis de la Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Bacon</hi> (2 vols. 8vo,
                    Paris, 1802), giving an in teresting view of the progress of natural science.
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur</hi><hi rend="italic">It</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Christianisme</hi> (Berlin and Hanover, 1801, 1803) was a controversial
                    correspondence with Dr Teller of Berlin in regard to the Mosaic cosmogony. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Traité élémentaire de Géologie</hi> (8vo, Paris, 1809, also in
                    English, by Delafite, the same year), was principally intended as a refutation
                    of the Vulcanian system of Hutton and Playfair, who deduced the changes of the
                    earth’s structure from the operation of fire, and attributed a higher antiquity
                    to the present state of the continents than is required in the Neptunian system
                    adopted by Deluc after Dolomieu. He sent to the Royal Society, in 1809, a long
                    paper on separating the chemical from the electrical effect of the pile, with a
                    description of the electric column and aerial electroscope, in which he advanced
                    opinions so little in unison with the latest discoveries of the day, that the
                    council deemed it inexpedient to admit them into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions.</hi> He had, indeed, on other occasions shown somewhat too much
                    scepticism in the rejection of new facts; and he had never been convinced even
                    of Cavendish’s all-important discovery of the composition of water. The paper
                    was afterwards published in Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (xxvi.),
                    and the dry column described in it was constructed by various experimental
                    philosophers. Many other of his papers on subjects kindred to those already
                    mentioned are to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine.</hi> See <hi rend="italic"
