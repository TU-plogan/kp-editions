                    (1675-1715), an eminent mathematician, was born at Salisbury, May 29, 1675. In
                    compliance with the wishes of his father rather than by his own inclination he
                    entered on the study of theology, and was for some years a dissenting minister
                    at Tunbridge, where he married. On the death of his father, however, he was
                    induced to relinquish the clerical profession; and at the persuasion of Whiston
                    and Dr Harris he devoted himself to the more congenial study of mathematics.
                    Through the influence of Sir Isaac Newton, he was elected mathematical master in
                    Christ’s Hosnital, where he continued till his death in 1715.</p>
                <p>Ditton was the author of the following treatises :— <hi rend="italic">Of the
                        Tangents of Curves,</hi> &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> vol.

                    the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> for 1705, from which it was copied and
                    reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum,</hi>
                    1707, and also in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris; <hi
                        rend="italic">General Laws of Nature and Motion,</hi> 8vo, 1705, a work
                    which is commended by Wolfius as illustrating and rendering easy the writings of

                    motion,—a subject much agitated about that time. There was also added an
                    advertisement from him and "Whiston concerning a method for discovering the
                    longitude, which it seems they had published about half a year before. Although
                    the method had been approved by Sir Isaac Newton before being presented to the
                    Board of Longitude, and successfully practised in finding the longitude between
                    Paris and Vienna, the board determined against it. This disappointment,
                    aggravated as it was by certain unquotable lines written by Dean Swift, affected
