                <p><label type="entry">DUNEDIN</label>, a city in New Zealand, in 45° 52' 12" S.
                    lat. and 170° 32' 37" E. long., at the head of Otago harbour, an arm of the sea
                    on the east coast of the South Island. It is the capital of the late province
                    and present provincial district of Otago, and was founded as the chief town of
                    the Otago settlement by settlers sent out under the auspices of the Lay
                    Association of the Free Church of Scotland in 1848. The discovery of large
                    quantities of gold in Otago in 1861 and the following years, and the great
                    increase in the production of wool, have made Dunedin a very flourishing place.
                    The city is beautifully situated in an amphitheatre of hills. The streets,
                    nearly all paved and kerbed, have been made at considerable expense and
                    trouble,—some being carried through swamps and others through cuttings and along
                    embankments. The cost of permanent improvements during the last fifteen years
                    has been about £300,000. The town is supplied with pure water, and (since 1862)
                    with gas from works belonging to the corporation. Dunedin is the seat of a judge
                    of the supreme court, and of a resident minister, who is a member of the
                    Colonial Executive; and it also has a Waste Lands Board, a body constituted for
                    the purpose of administering the public estate of the provincial district. The
                    city contains some fine buildings, especially two handsome Presbyterian
                    churches, constructed of white stone from Oamaru. The so-called university of
                    Otago, now affiliated with the university of New Zealand, which alone has the
                    power to grant degrees, possesses chairs of classics, mathematics, mental and
                    moral philosophy, as well as lectureships on botany, mineralogy, law, and modern
                    languages. A museum (well built of concrete) contains an excellent collection of
                    New Zealand flora and fauna, including some fine skeletons of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dinornis.</hi> There is also a scientific body called the Otago
                    Institute, affiliated with the New Zealand Institute. There are three good
                    libraries—one at the supreme court, a second at the university, and a larger one
                    at the Athenaeum—six banks, and several large mercantile houses. The people are
                    mostly of Scotch origin, with a considerable intermixture of immigrants from
                    England, Ireland, the British colonies, and Germany. All classes are prosperous:
                    except among the extremely limited criminal class, poverty rarely occurs, and
                    absolute pauperism is quite unknown.</p>
                <p>Otago harbour, by which the city is approached from the sea, is an inlet about 18
                    miles long. There is about 22 feet of water on the bar at low tide. Half way up
                    to Dunedin is Port Chalmers, a fine anchorage for the largest vessels, where,
                    owing to the presence of precipitous hills, the land was found too limited in
                    area for a large city. From this point the water grows shallower as it
                    approaches Dunedin. Until lately no vessels drawing more than 10 feet could pass
                    up; but by two years dredging the channel has been made available for steamers
                    drawing 13 or 14 feet, and this depth is gradually being increased. The Harbour
                    Board has authority to raise £250,000 by bonds, of which £129,400 has been
                    raised, but £66,000 is still unexpended. The revenue of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n561/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0561-0542"/> board is £14,500, which is rapidly increasing, as
                    it arises from a munificent landed endowment. A large part of this money is
                    available for works. The harbour was until lately the terminus of a line of
                    large mail steamers running monthly to San Francisco <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Auckland and Honolulu, but it is now found more convenient to use smaller
                    steamers for the coastal section. It is, however, still the terminus of a line
                    of fine vessels running at intervals of about ten days to Melbourne, and
                    carrying the monthly mail for Suez and England. There is also direct steam
                    communication with Sydney and Hobart Town, and communication <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Auckland with Fiji. All the coasting steamers and many sailing vessels
                    are owned in Dunedin. In 187S, besides the San Francisco boats, 69 vessels,
                    varying from 250 to 1800 tons, entered the port from places beyond the seas
                    other than Australasia. The greater number of these arrive in the early part of
                    the summer, and load with wool for London. The customs revenue collected in 1876
                    amounted to £362,335. The municipal debt amounts to £328,000, and the revenue
                    (raised by rates, rents, water and gas works, &lt;fcc.) to £47,500. The
                    population of the city in the beginning of 1877 was about 22,500, and that of
                    the suburbs about 9000, while other towns within a circuit of a few miles bring
                    it up to 35,000.</p>
