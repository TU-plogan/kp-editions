                    and principal passages are touched with red ink, and some have strokes of red
                    ink run across them, as if scratched out. This volume contains the description
                    of the following counties :—Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Southampton, Berks, Wilts,
                    Dorset, Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Middlesex, Hereford, Bucks, Oxford,
                    Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford, Northampton,
                    Leicester, Warwick, Stafford, Salop, Cheshire, Derby, Notts, York, and Lincoln,
                    together with the anomalous districts of Rutland and the land “inter Ripan et
                    Mersham.” The second volume is in quarto, written upon 450 double pages of
                    vellum, but in a single column, and in a large but very fair character. It
                    contains the counties of Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk. This second volume,
                    together with the Exon Domesday, which contains the fuller reports of the
                    western counties, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, Devonshire, and Cornwall, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Inquisitio</hi><hi rend="italic">Eliensis,</hi> which relates
                    to the lands of the abbey of Ely, seems to be the original record of the survey
                    itself, which appear^ in the first volume of the Exchequer Domesday in an
                    abridged form. “In both volumes of the Exchequer Domesday,” writes Mr Freeman in
                    his <hi rend="italic">History of the Norman Conquest,</hi> “each shire is
                    commonly headed with a list of the chief landowners in it. The king comes first,
                    then the great ecclesiastical, and then the great temporal proprietors, followed
                    in many cases by the smaller proprietors lumped in classes ‘ servientes regis,’
                    ‘ taini regis,’ ‘ eleemosynarii regis, ’ and the like, the list being numbered,
                    and forming an index to the survey itself, which follows. Lastly, in several
                    shires come the ‘Clamores,’ the records of lands which were said to be held
                    unjustly, and to which other men laid claim.” Then follows the survey itself.
                    The lands of the king or other landowner are arranged under the hundreds in
                    which they were placed, and the necessary particulars of which the survey was to
                    be a record are put down under each manor or other holding.</p>
                <p>The northern shires are not described in the survey.. Nor <pb break="no"

                    are conspicuous by their absence. Lancashire does not appear under its proper
                    name; but Furness and the northern part of the county, as well as the south of
                    Westmoreland, with a part of Cumberland, are included within the West Riding of
                    Yorkshire. That part of Lancashire which lies between the rivers Ribble and
                    Mersey is subjoined to Cheshire; and part of Rutland is described in the
                    counties of Northampton and Lincoln. The reasons which led to the omission of
                    these northern counties from Domesday are not difficult to be understood. Durham
                    and Northumberland had been laid waste by the merciless hand of conquest. The
                    devastations of the Conqueror himself in the winter of 1069-1070, the various
                    inroads of Malcolm, and the vengeance taken by Odo after the murder of Bishop
                    Walcher in 1080, must have left very little in those districts worth the
                    surveying. Lancashire did not then exist as a separate county. Cumberland and
                    Westmoreland had no being as English shires,—their southern portions then formed
                    part of Yorkshire, and they are surveyed in Domesday as such; whilst their
                    northern portions did not become part of the kingdom of England till the reign
                    of William Rufus, having been held by the Scottish kings as a fief ever since
                    the grant by Edmund the Magnificent, on the final overthrow of the old kingdom
                    of Strathclyde. The notion that the northern portions of Cumberland and
                    Westmoreland were conquered in 1072 by William I. is derived from a careless
                    blunder in the work of Matthew of Westminster, who has confounded William Rufus
                    with his father.</p>
                <p>The exact time of the commencement of this survey is variously stated. The Red
                    Book of the Exchequer has been quoted as fixing the date at 1080; whereas the
                    Red Boek merely states that the survey was undertaken at a time subsequent to
                    the total reduction of the island to the authority of the Conqueror. From the
                    memorandum of the completion of the survey at the end of the second volume, it
                    is evident, however, that Domesday was finished in 1086. Matthew Paris, Robert
                    of Gloucester, the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Wavert ey,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle of Bermondsey</hi> give 1083 as the date of the record;
                    Henry of Huntingdon places it in 1084; the <hi rend="italic">Saxon
                    Chronicle</hi> in 1085; Simeon of Durham, Florence of Worcester, Roger Hoveden,
                    and Hemingford in 1086; whilst the <hi rend="italic">Ypodigma Neustriae</hi> and
                    Diceto state 1087 as the year.</p>
                <p>The reason given for taking this survey, as assigned by several ancient records
                    and historians, was that every man should be satisfied with his own right, and
                    not usurp with impunity what belonged to another. But besides this, it is stated
                    by others that all those who possessed landed estates now became vassals to the
                    king, and paid him so much money by way of fee or homage, in proportion to the
                    lands they held. According to the false Ingulphus, the survey was made in
                    imitation of the policy of Alfred, who, at the time he divided the kingdom into
                    counties, hundreds, and tithings, had an inquisition taken and digested into a
                    register, which was called, from the place in which it was deposited, the Roll
                    of Winchester. But the compilation of such a survey in the time of Alfred may be
                    more than doubted; for, with the exception of the statement of Ingulphus, no
                    chronicler alludes to the existence of this register, nor is any mention of it
                    to be found in the records of the time or in those of a subsequent period. Had
                    it been extant in the century immediately preceding the Norman Conquest, it
                    would have prevented the necessity of giving those minute descriptions of land
                    so common among the later of the Saxon charters. Again, the separation of
                    counties is known to have been a division long anterior to the time of Alfred.
                    The confusion in all probability has arisen from a similarity in the title of
                    the two works. The survey of the Conqueror was called Domesday</p>
                <p>Book; the register of Alfred had the name of Dome-boc; but the Dome-boc, instead
                    of being a territorial analysis as is Domesday Book, was in reality the code of
                    Saxon laws.</p>
                <p>For the execution of the survey recorded in Domesday Book, certain commissioners,
                    called the king’s justiciaries, were sent into every county and shire, and
                    juries summoned in each hundred, out of all orders of freemen, from barons down
                    to the lowest farmers. These commissioners were to be informed by the
                    inhabitants, upon oath, of the name of each manor and that of its owner, also by
                    whom it was held in the time of Edward the Confessor; the number of hides; the
                    quantity of wood, of pasture, and of meadow land; how many ploughs were in the
                    demesne, and how many in the tenanted part of it; how many mills and how many
                    fish-ponds or fisheries belonged to it; the value of the whole in the time of
                    King Edward, as well as when granted by King William, and at the time of this
                    survey; and also whether it was capable of improvement or of being advanced in
                    value. They were likewise directed to return the tenants of every degree, the
                    quantity of lands then and formerly held by each of them, what was the number of
                    villains or slaves, and also the number and kinds of their cattle and live
                    stock. These inquisitions, being first methodized in the, county, were
                    afterwards sent up to the king’s Exchequer. So minute was the survey, that the
                    writer of the contemporary portion of the <hi rend="italic">Saxon Chronicle</hi>
                    records—“So very narrowly he caused it to be traced out that there was not a
                    single hide or yardland, not an ox, cow,'or hog that was not set down.”</p>
                <p>By the completion of this survey the king acquired an exact knowledge of the
                    possessions of the Crown. It afforded him the names of the land-holders; it
                    furnished him with the means of ascertaining the military strength of the
                    country; and it pointed out the possibility of increasing the revenue in some
                    cases and of lessening the demand of the tax-collectors in others. It was,
                    moreover, a register of appeal for those whose titles to their property might be
                    disputed.</p>
                <p>So accurate has Domesday Book been considered that its authority was never
                    permitted to be called in question; and when it has been necessary to
                    distinguish whether lands were held in ancient demesne or in any other manner,
                    recourse was always had to Domesday, and to it only, in order to determine the
                    doubt. From this definitive authority, from which, as from the sentence
                    pronounced at Domesday, or the Day of Judgment, there could be no appeal, the
                    name of the book is said to have been derived. Stowe indeed assigns another
                    reason for this appellation, namely, that Domesday Book is a corruption of “<hi
                    rend="italic">domus</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi> book,” a title given it
                    because heretofore it was deposited in the king’s treasury in a part of the
                    church of Westminster or Winchester called <hi rend="italic">domus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dei;</hi> the name, however, is plainly English. From the great
                    care formerly taken to preserve this survey, we may learn the estimation in
                    which it was held. In the <hi rend="italic">Dialogus</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Scaccario</hi> it is said, <hi rend="italic">Liber ille</hi> (meaning Domesday)
                    <hi rend="italic">sigilli regis</hi><hi rend="italic">comes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est individuus</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >thesauro.</hi> It was formerly kept at Westminster with the king’s seal by the
                    side of the Tally Court in the Exchequer, under three locks and keys, in the
                    charge of the auditor, the chamberlains, and deputy-chamberlains of the
                    Exchequer, till in 1696 it was deposited among other valuable records in the
                    chapterhouse. It is now carefully preserved beneath a strong glass case in the
                    Public Record Office, and can be consulted without payment of any fee.</p>
                <p>Various local Domesdays exist, as those of York, Norwich, Ipswich, Chester, and
                    Evesham. The most notable among them is the Domesday of St Paul’s, made in 1181
                    by the Dean, Ralph de Diceto, and edited by Archdeacon Hale.</p>

                <p>In 1783 Domesday Book was published in two volumes, andin 1816 a volume of
                    indices was printed by the Record Commission, to which a very valuable “general
                    introduction was prefixed.” During the latter year another volume appeared
                    containing the Exon Domesday, and the Inquisitio Eliensis, already noticed; the
                    Winton Domesday, comprising lands in Winchester between 1107 and 1128; and the
                    Boldon Book, or Survey of the Palatinate of Durham in 1183. Within the last few
                    years the whole of Domesday has been issued in parts, each part comprising a
                    county, and printed by the process of photozincography, under the scholarly
                    superintendence of Mr W. B. Sanders, one of the assistant keepers of the Public
