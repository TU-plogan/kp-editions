                <p><label type="entry">DURHAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">County Palatine of</hi></label>,
                    one of the northern shiresof England. Thecounty is triangular in form, its
                    eastern limit or base being a coast-line exposed to the German Ocean It is
                    separated from Northumberland chiefly by the Tyne and its tributary the Derwent,
                    and from Yorkshire by the Tees. Towards its western extremity it joins
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland. Its greatest length is 45 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth 36 miles; and it contains an area of 1012 3quare miles, or 647,592
                    acres. It is divided into four wards,—Chester and Easington in the north, and
                    Darlington and Stockton in the south. There were formerly three outlying
                    portions of the county, shown in old maps, and known as North Durham (including
                    Norhamshire and Islandshire), Bedlingtonshire, and Crayke. These were attached
                    to the county as having formed parcels of the ancient “patrimony of St
                    Cuthbert,” of which the land between Tyne and Tees was the chief portion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> The western angle of the county is
                    occupied by spurs of the Pennine chain, and hence is mountainous, with black,
                    naked, and barren regions, from which issue numerous streams flowing to the sea.
                    The elevations vary from 1000 to 2196 feet. There are some beautiful and fertile
                    valleys in the eastern and central parts, pleasantly varied with hill and dale,
                    and alternately appropriated to com and pasture. Extensive tracts, principally
                    in the western part of the county, are waste, but rich in minerals. In the
                    southern districts the area of cultivation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n581/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0581-0560"/> has been considerably increased within the last
                    few years. The ancient common fields belonging to the townships are now mostly
                    inclosed. Draining having been carried on to a great extent; there is very
                    little marshy ground left. Near the river Tees, and in some places bordering on
                    the other rivers, the soil is loam or a rich clay. At a farther distance from
                    these rivers it is of an inferior quality, with patches of gravel interspersed.
                    The hills between the sea and an imaginary line from Barnard Castle on the Tees
                    to Alansford on the Derwent, are covered with a dry loam, the fertility of which
                    varies with its depth. From this line westward the summits as well as the sides
                    of the hills are in great part moorish wastes.</p>
                <p>At the distance of about three miles from Darlington, at Oxeuhall, are cavities
                    in the earth, called “Hell Kettles.” There are similar natural pits in the
                    neighbourhood of Ripon, and elsewhere. The diameter of the largest is not less
                    than 114 feet, and that of the least 75. About five miles from Hartlepool is one
                    of the most singular clusters of rocks in the north of England, called “Black
                    Halls,” formed by the force and constant action of the waves, which have
                    separated enormous masses of the magnesian limestone, washing some entirely
                    away, but leaving others standing, like vast towers. In some places the rock is
                    perforated so as to form curious arches.</p>
                <p>The only considerable river, beside those just mentioned, is the Wear, which
                    rises in the western hills and flows past Durham to join the sea at
                    Bishop-Wearmouth and MonkWearmouth, which places unite with Sunderland to form
                    one great town. The Team, which gives its name to the Team Valley Railway, is a
                    mere rivulet.</p>
                <p>Trees are chiefly confined to the parks and seats of the nobility and gentry; but
                    many plantations have been made of late years. The banks of the rivers and
                    brooks, particularly in the vicinity of Durham, are fringed with wood of long
                    growth and much value, and the deep wooded <hi rend="italic">denes</hi> or
                    ravines which open on to the sea-coast, each having a small stream at the
                    bottom, are very characteristic. Castle Eden dene is about four miles in length,
                    and famous for its beautiful trees and wild flowers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The western hills are composed of carboniferous
                    limestone, succeeded eastward by millstone grit, coal-measures, magnesian
                    limestone, and new red sandstone. The south-east portion of the limestone is
                    covered with sand, resulting from disintegration of the coal-measures and often
                    showing black beds of coal-detritus. The mountain limestone contains productive
                    veins of lead ore, which are extensively worked, also zinc ore. The beds of coal
                    in the coal-measures are from 5 to 6 feet thick, and have long been source of
                    enormous wealth. The mines are among the most extensive and productive in the
                    kingdom. At Sunderland the coal trade furnishes employment for hundreds of
                    vessels, independently of the “keels” or lighters which convey the coal from the
                    termini of the railroads and tramways to the ships. The seams now worked extend
                    horizontally for many miles, and are from 20 to 100 fathoms beneath the surface.
                    Under almost every seam of coal is a bed of fire-clay, full of roots of primeval
                    forest trees. The basaltic formation known as the “Great Whin Sill” appears in
                    Teesdale, and is also remarkable at Cockfield. A beautiful variety of the
                    mountain limestone known as Frosterley marble, has for many centuries been
                    quarried near Stanhope for decorative purposes, in Durham Cathedral and
                    elsewhere taking the place of Purbeck marble, while in modem houses it is used
                    chiefly for chimney-pieces. Ironstone is extensively worked in the neighbourhood
                    of Swalwell and Winlaton. Some excellent quarries of slate for buildings have
                    been opened in different parts of the county. The neighbourhood of Wolsingham
                    abounds in fine millstones. The Newcastle grindstones are procured at Gateshead
                    Fell; and firestone of high estimation, for building ovens, furnaces, and the
                    like, is obtained in various parts of Durham, and exported in considerable
                    quantity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns. —</hi> Besides the city of Durham, the county includes
                    seven ancient boroughs, viz., Hartlepool, Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland,
                    Darlington, Sunderland, Stockton, and Gateshead. The large villages of
                    Staindrop, Wolsingham, Stanhope, and Sedgefield are “market towns.” The port of
                    Stockton-upon-Tees is well situated for commerce: Hartlepool, being on a
                    promontory, nearly encompassed by the German Ocean, which forms a capacious bay
                    to the south of the town is advantageously placed for maritime traffic;
                    Sunderland and South Shields are also well placed at the mouths of the Wear and
                    Tyne.</p>
                <p>No county in England presents a closer network of railways than Durham. The York,
                    Newcastle, and Berwick trunk line enters the country south of Darlington, and
                    continues due north until at Gateshead it crosses the Tyne and enters
                    Northumberland. From this a great many smaller lines diverge to the ports and
                    mineral fields.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.</hi> —Improvements in agriculture have been
                    pursued with considerable spirit and success. On some spots of gravelly soil,
                    turnips and barley are grown in almost perpetual succession, a crop of clover
                    being sometimes interposed. The manures are chiefly lime and the produce of the
                    fold-yard; and though abundance of sea-weed might be collected on the coast, as
                    it was in mediaeval times, the farmers now make but little use of it. The farms
                    are of moderate size, few of them exceeding 200 acres. The largest portion of
                    each is arable, except towards the western extremity of the county, where the
                    whole is pasture. The farm houses are well situated and commodious; and improve
                    ments in farming and farming machinery keep pace with the age. The cattle of
                    Durham have long been in great repute; in point of form, weight, produce of
                    milk, and quickness of fattening, there are none better. The cows yield from 25
                    to 30 quarts of milk daily. The sheep also stand high in estimation,
                    particularly the Tees-Water breed. The Weardale sheep are small, but their
                    mutton is finely flavoured.</p>
                <p>The following figures, taken from the Agricultural Returns for 1873 and 1876,
                    show the acreage of the principal crops and the numbers of the live stock in the
                    county in those years :—</p>

                <p>According to the Owners of Land Return, Durham was divided in 1873 among 34,317
                    separate proprietors, of whom the large proportion of 91 per cent, owned less
                    than 1 acre—the average of England and Wales being 71 per cent. The gross rental
                    of the land amounted to £2,889,152, or an average of £5, 11s. 2⅛d. peracre—as
                    compared with £3, 0s. 2d., the average of England and Wales. This unusual value
                    per acre is to be ascribed to the presence of minerals. The proprietors
                    possessing more than 8000 acres were as follows :—duke of Cleveland, 55,837
                    acres; Ecclesiastical Commissioners, 26,868; Viscount Boyne, 15,310; earl of
                    Durham, 14,664; marquis of Londonderry, 12,823; earl of Eldon, 11,841; John

                    and black game are abundant in suitable localities, and one heronry still
                    remains. But the shores of Durham are deserted by the sea fowl, which 200 years
                    ago were so abundant by Tees and Tyne that, as an old writer says, “in tyme of
                    breeding one can hardly sett his foote so warylye that he spoyle not many of
                    theyr nestes.” The badger and the otter still linger in one or two nooks; the
                    last marten was killed in Weardale 30 years ago, and meantime the squirrel has
                    become common. Stockton is almost the last retreat in England of the native
                    black rat. Of the former abundance of deer, wild ox, and boar every peat bog
                    testifies by its remains; the hoar appears to have existed in the reign of Henry
                    VIIL, and records of red deer in the county may be traced down to the middle of
                    the last century.</p>

                    to have been known in Britain at that remote period. One mile north of Eggleston
                    are some remains of an ancient structure called the Standing Stones. This
                    originally consisted of a cairn in the centre, surrounded by a trench, and that
                    again encompassed by a circular arrangement of rough stones, many of which have
                    been removed and broken to repair the roads. Near a brook, at a small distance,
                    is a large barrow, crossed from east to west by a row of stones. There are
                    frequent references to “Standing Stones” now gone in old charters, where they
                    are referred to as marking boundaries. The principal Roman remains are connected
                    with the ancient Watling Street, which entered the county by crossing the Tees
                    at Pierse-bridge, and left it on crossing the Derwent just north of Ebchester.
                    The boundaries of the four stations of Pierse-bridge, Binchester, Lanchester,
                    and Ebchester, on the line of this road, may still be clearly discerned. At
                    Lanchester there are considerable remains of masonry, and at Binchester the most
                    perfect hypocaust in the north of England. Chester-le-Street, as its name
                    indicates, occupies the site, now obliterated, of a Roman station, on a
                    subsidiary Roman road; and there was a camp, still partly to be recognized, on
                    “Maiden Castle Hill,” near the city of Durham. Many Roman altars and sculptured
                    stones from Lanchester and elsewhere are preserved in the chapter library at
                    Durham. Roman altars, coins, &amp;c., have been found at South Shields, as well
                    as about the above-mentioned stations. To the Anglo-Saxon period are to be
                    referred portions of the churches of MonkWearmouth and Jarrow, and numerous
                    sculptured crosses, two of which are <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> at Aycliffe.
                    The best remains of the Norman period are to be found in Durham Cathedral (the
                    finest Norman building in England) and in the castle, also in some half-dozen
                    parish churches. Of the Early English period are the eastern portion of the
                    cathedral (see below), the fine churches of Darlington, Hartlepool, and St
                    Andrew, Auckland, and portions of a few other churches. The Decorated and
                    Perpendicular periods are very scantily represented, on account, as is supposed,
                    of the incessant wars between England and Scotland in the 14th and 15th
                    centuries. The principal monastic remains, beside those surrounding Durham
                    Cathedral, are those of its subordinate house or “cell,” Finchale Priory,
                    situated in a lovely valley by the Wear. The most interesting castles are those
                    of Durham, Raby, Brancepeth, and Barnard. There are ruins of castelets, or
                    peel-towers, at Dalden, Ludworth, and Langley Dale. The hospitals of Sherburn,
                    Greatham, and Kepyer, founded by early bishops of Durham, retain but very few
                    ancient features.</p>
                <p>The principal noblemen’s seats are Raby Castle (duke of Cleveland), Lambton
                    Castle (earl of Durham), Wynyard Castle (marquis of Londonderry), Ravensworth
                    Castle (earl of Ravensworth), Brancepeth Castle (Viscount Boyne), and Whitham
                    Hall (Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bart.)</p>
                <p>The county is divided for parliamentary purposes into two divisions (North and
                    South Durham), each of which returns two members. The northern division includes
                    20 polling-places, and the southern 33. The population has greatly increased
                    within the last thirty years. In 1851 the inhabitants numbered 390,997; in 1861,
                    508,666; and in 1871, 685,089—353,117 males and 331,972 females. The increase
                    between 1851 and 1871 amounts to 72J per cent. The population is estimated at
                    upwards of 850,000 in 1877.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Before the arrival of the Romans the county
                    formed part of the British territory of the Brigantes, which comprised all
                    between Tyne and Humber. Then it became part of the Roman province Maxima
                    Caesariensis. In Anglo-Saxon times it was included in Bernicia, in the kingdom
                    of Northumbria. After the Norman Conquest it gradually acquired in one way or
                    another that peculiar independence which was attached to “Counties Palatine.”
                    The bishops of Durham were temporal princes as well as spiritual rulers,
                    exercising most of the royal prerogatives, such as paramount property in all
                    lands, and supreme jurisdiction both civil and military, as in making war, right
                    of forfeiture, levying of taxes, &amp;c. These privileges would be the more
                    readily conceded to this county on account of its remoteness from the
                    metropolis, and its proximity to the hostile kingdom of Scotland, in order that
                    the inhabitants, having justice administered athome, might not be obliged to go
                    out of their county, and leave it open to an enemy’s incursions. For theÿ
                    pleaded privilege not to pass over Tees or Tyne for military service, their
                    special charge being, as was alleged, to keep and defend the sacred body of St
                    Cuthbert, whence they were called * ‘ Haliwer folc” (Holy war folk). By an Act
                    passed in the 27th year of Henry VIII. a heavy blow was struck at the regal
                    powers which the bishops of Durham had enjoyed, and at the death of Bishop Van
                    Mildert in 1836, an Act was passed whereby all temporal jurisdictions and
                    privileges were declared to be for ever removed from the bishopric. Up to that
                    time the bishops opened the assizes in person, as being still at the head of the
                    administration of justice, the judges sitting by virtue of the bishop’s writ.
                    Durham is now included in the province of York, and in the north-eastern
                    circuit.</p>
                <p>The principal county histories are those by Hutchinson and Surtees, the latter
                    incomplete, but, so far as it goes, it is a noble work, one of the very best of
                    that class ever published. Murray’s handbooks to the county and to the
                    cathedral, though occasionally inaccurate, are full of interesting and valuable
                    information.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Durham City,</hi> a municipal and parliamentary borough of
                    England, and the chief town of the county of Durham, is situated on the River
                    Wear (which is crossed there by four bridges), 14 miles S. of Newcastle and 60
                    miles N,N.W. of York. Though there was a small Roman camp at Maiden Castle Hill,
                    about a mile distant, Durham itself dates only from the end of the 10th century,
                    when the monks of Lindisfarne rested there with the body of St Cuthbert, after
                    wandering about with it almost all over the north of England. Soon afterwards a
                    church was built by Bishop Ealdhune, and the removal of the see from Lindisfarne
                    thither, together with the growing fame of the incorruptible body of the saint,
                    led to the rise of the city. The rocky peninsula on which Ealdhune’s church was
                    founded, about 80 feet above the river, was called Dunholme (Hill Island), <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n583/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0583-0562"/> which in Norman times was softened to “Duresme,”
                    whence “Durham.” The castle was erected by William the Conqueror in 1072, across
                    the neck of the peninsula, so as to guard the church and monastery. In 1093
                    Ealdhune’s church was rebuilt by Bishop Carileph, who changed the Anglo-Saxon
                    establishment of married priests into a Benedictine abbey.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cathedral.—</hi> Carileph’s grand Norman church still forms
                    the main part of the cathedral buildings; but numerous additions have been made
                    from time to time, the chief of which are—the Galilee or western chapel, of the
                    Transitional period, the eastern transept or “Nine Altars” and the western
                    towers (Early English), and the central tower (Perpendicular). Decorated and
                    Perpendicular windows have, as is usual in old churches, been freely inserted.
                    The interior presents the appearance, as Dr Johnson remarked, of “rocky solidity
                    and of indeterminate duration,” and combines, we may add, absolutely perfect
                    proportion in all its original parts with a harmonious magnificence of detail in
                    its massive columns, arches, and stone groining. It has recently been thoroughly
                    cleaned, and supplied with much painted glass and very costly modern fittings,
                    including a new organ built on the largest scale and of fine tone. Durham
                    Cathedral, or “The Abbey,” as old-fashioned residents still call it, has long
                    been celebrated and still maintains its reputation for its choral services, as
                    being at least equal to any in England in point of musical execution. This
                    glorious building has been admirably illustrated in Carter’s Plates, and in
                    Billings’s <hi rend="italic">Architecture of Durham Cathedral.</hi> It is 507
                    feet in length, by 200 in extreme breadth, with a central tower 214 feet in
                    height, and two smaller ones 138 feet high at the west end. The Galilee or
                    western chapel was built by Bishop Pudsey between 1153 and 1195, and contains
                    the supposed remains of the Venerable Bede. In the chapel of the Nine Altars are
                    the remains of St Cuthbert, brought to light in 1827. The cathedral library,
                    formerly the dormitory and refectories of the abbey, contains a number of
                    curious and interesting printed books, and MSS., and the portable altar,
                    vestments, and other relics found in St Cuthbert’s grave.</p>
                <p>The see of Durham was long the richest bishopric in England. The total revenue of
                    the dean and chapter during the seven years ending 1834 amounted to £36,937 a
                    year. On the death of the incumbent in 1836, at the recommendation of the
                    Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the income of the bishop was fixed at £8000 per
                    annum—the surplus revenues of the see being reserved to form a fund for
                    augmenting the incomes of the poorer bishops.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Castle, &lt;kc.—</hi> The castle of Durham consists of a
                    polygonal keep, now reconstructed to form a very inconvenient set of college
                    rooms; the great hall built by Bishop Hatfield, which in some respects exceeds
                    any hall in the older universities; the Norman hall, now cut up into rooms: the
                    old Norman crypt chapel; Bishop Tunstall’s chapel, at present in use; the Black
                    Staircase, built by Bishop Cosin; and the kitchen, the gate-house, and other
                    offices. These are grouped round a court very irregular in plan, and not less
                    picturesque in general effect. Durham Castle was the chief residence of the
                    bishops of the Palatinate, but is now appropriated to the uses of the
                    university, with the exception of the state apartments, which are partly
                    reserved for the bishop and for Her Majesty’s judges of assize. The university
                    was opened in 1833; an account of it will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Universities.</hi> Besides the cathedral, Durham has seven parish churches.
                    There are also places of worship for Roman Catholics, and for various
                    denominations of Protestants. The grammar school attached to the cathedral was
                    founded by Henry VIII. in 1541, and possesses eighteen “king’s scholarships,” of
                    the annual value of nearly £40 each. There are also several scholarships and
                    exhibitions tenable at the universities. The original school-room is noλv used
                    by the university of Durham; the new buildings are beautifully situated to the
                    west of the city, and are very handsome and commodious, including residences for
                    the head and second masters, and a school infirmary. Durham possesses
                    flourishing diocesan training colleges for schoolmasters and schoolmistresses:
                    and about four miles to the west of the city is the great Roman Catholic College
                    called St Cuthbert’s College, Ushaw, the present representative of the old
                    college at Douai.</p>
                <p>The civil corporation of Durham and Framwellgate consists of the mayor, six
                    aidermen, and eighteen councillors, with a recorder, a chaplain, and town clerk,
                    two elective auditors, and two elective assessors. On the passing of the
                    Corporation Act, 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 76, the election of the eighteen
                    councillors was vested in the citizens occupying houses and paying poor and
                    other rates. The councillors so elected have to choose the six aidermen, and the
                    aidermen aud councillors have the election of the mayor. Four charters (all,
                    except the third, preserved in the “Hutch” at the Guild Hall) have been granted
                    to the city by different bishops of Durham:—the first by Hugh Pudsey, confirmed
                    by Pope Alexander III., 1179 or 1180; the second by Tobias <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0584-0563"/> Matthew, confirmed by James I.; the third by
                    Nathaniel Lord Crew, 1684 (afterwards redelivered to the bishop, the corporation
                    acting under the second charter); and the fourth by John Egerton, 1780.</p>
                <p>Durham can scarcely be said to have any staple trade or manufacture, though it
                    possesses one carpet factory and one large mill for the preparation of “Durham
                    mustard.” It is now a very different place, socially, from w hat it was when
                    there were twelve prebendaries with much larger incomes than the six canons now
                    have, and when “The College” was a noted centre for dignified and liberal
                    hospitality. At that time, canonical residence was kept with much more
                    strictness than it is at present, and the prebendary in residence entertained
                    guests of all classes. Noblemen and gentlemen then resided in houses in
                    Framwellgate and Elvet, now let out into tenements and serving as the squalid
                    homes of the very poorest class. The Bailey and Old El vet are, however, still
                    chiefly occupied by the upper classes, and Western Hill is a new aud rapidly
                    increasing suburb. The Palace Green is an open space having the cathedral on the
                    south side, the castle, now University College, on the north, the Exchequer
                    Buildings, now the university library, together with Bishop Cosin’s library, on
                    the west, and the museum, alms-houses, and other offices on the east. The museum
                    contains an almost complete collection of British birds. Six out of the seven
                    parish churches are ancient, and possess features of interest. The high banks of
                    the river on which the cathedral and castle stand are richly wooded, and
                    traversed in all directions by well-kept paths, which afford ever-changing views
                    of wood, water, rocks, bridges, the cathedral, the castle, picturesque old
                    houses, and terraced gardens.</p>
                <p>In 1861 the municipal borough of Durham had within its area of 880 acres 2007
                    inhabited houses, with a population of 14,088. In 1871, the number of inhabited
                    houses was 2349, and the population comprised 6956 males and 7450 females, or
                    14,406 in all. The parliamentary borough, which with an area of 967 acres had
                    14,833 inhabitants in 1871, returns two members to Parliament. <hi
