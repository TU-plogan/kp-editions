                    incisor teeth or tusks, which are well developed in the male, but which in the
                    female are arrested in their growth, and remain concealed beneath the surface.
                    There are never more than five molar teeth on each side of either jaw, or twenty
                    in all, and these are flat on the grinding surface. The flippers are unprovided
                    with nails, and the tail is broad, and differs from that of the manatee in being
                    crescent-shaped instead of rounded. The bones are very hard and firm, and take a
                    polish equal to that of ivory. The dugongs frequent the shallow waters of the
                    tropical seas, extending from the east coast of Africa north of the mouth of the
                    Zambesi river, along the shores of the Indian, Malayan, and Australian seas,
                    where they may be seen basking on the surface of the water, or browsing on

                    preeminently fit them. They are gregarious, feeding in large numbers in
                    localities where they are not often disturbed. The female produces a single
                    young one at a birth, and is remarkable for the great affection it shows for its
                    offspring, so that when the young dugong is caught there is no difficulty in
                    capturing the mother with it. There are two species—the Indian Dugong <hi
                    rend="italic">(Halicore</hi><hi rend="italic">indicus)</hi> and the Australian
                    Dugong <hi rend="italic">(Halicore australis).</hi> The former is very abundant
                    along the shores of the Indian Ocean, and is captured in large numbers by the
                    Malayans, who esteem its flesh as a great delicacy; while the lean portions,
                    especially of young specimens, are regarded by Europeans even as excellent
                    eating. It is generally taken by spearing, the main object of the hunter being
                    to raise the tail out of the water, when the animal becomes perfectly powerless.
                    It seldom attains a length of more than 8 or 10 feet. The Australian Dugong is a
                    larger species, attaining sometimes a length of 15 feet. It occurs along the
                    Australian coast from Moreton Bay to Cape York, and is highly valued by the
                    natives, who hunt for it with spears, and gorge themselves with its flesh, when
                    they are fortunate enough to secure a carcase. In recent years the oil obtained
                    from the blubber of this species has been largely used in Australia as a
                    substitute for cod-liver oil. It does not contain iodine, but is said to possess
                    all the therapeutic qualities of cod-liver oil without its nauseous taste. A
                    full grown dugong yields from 10 to 12 gallons of oil, and this, according to
                    Bennet, “forms in cold weather a thick masβ, and requires to be melted before a
                    fire previously to being used.” According to the same authority, the flesh of
                    the Australian dugong is easy of digestion, the muscular fibre when fresh
                    resembling beef, and when salted having the flavour of excellent bacon. In the
                    earliest Australian dugong fishery, natives were employed to harpoon these
                    cetaceans; they soon, however, became too wary to allow themselves to be
                    approached near enough for this purpose, and the harpoon was abandoned for the
                    net. The latter is spread at night, and in its meshes dugongs are caught in
                    considerable numbers. The skin is nearly half an inch thick, and can be made
                    into gelatine or glue.</p>
