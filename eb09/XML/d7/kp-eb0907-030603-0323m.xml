                    Turla of the Turks, a river of south-eastern Europe belonging to the basin of
                    the Black Sea. It takes its rise on the northern slope of the Carpathian
                    Mountains in the Sambor circle of Galicia, and belongs for the first 330 miles
                    of its course to Austrian, for the remaining 600 to Russian territory. In its
                    excessive meandering it frequently almost returns to the same spot; for example,
                    while the actual distance from Turunchuk to Mayakoff is about 33 miles, the
                    development of the river would require about 133. At the same time, as the
                    average fall is from 25 to 26 inches in the mile, the current in most parts even
                    during low water is pretty rapid, the mean rate per hour being calculated at
                    8638 feet. The average width of the channel is from 560 to 700 feet, but in some
                    places it attains as much as 1400 feet; the depth is various and changeable. The
                    banks are usually about 3500 feet apart, but in certain reaches approach each
                    other so as to leave room for nothing but the actual bed; their average height
                    above the water in the Bessarabian portion is 350 feet. The principal
                    interruption in the navigable portion of the river, besides the somewhat
                    extensive shallows, is occasioned by a granitic spur from the Carpathians, and
                    bears the name of the Yampo]skie Porogi, or Yampol Rapids. For ordinary
                    river-craft the passage of these rapids is rendered possible, but not free from
                    danger, by a natural channel on the left side, and a larger and deeper
                    artificial channel on the right; for steam-boats they form an insuperable
                    barrier. The river falls into the sea by several shallow arms, of which the most
                    important has a depth of only 2∣ feet near its mouth; but the Turunchuk, an
                    independent stream, disemboguing in the neighbourhood, has a depth of 7 or 8
                    feet, and is connected with the main channel of the Dniester by the Surovtzoff
                    canal, so named after the merchant at whose expense it was constructed. There
                    are two periodical floods in the river,—the first and greatest caused by the
                    breaking up of the ice, and occurring in the latter part of February or in
                    March; and the second, due to the melting of the snows of the Carpathians, and
                    consequently taking place about June. The spring flood raises the level of the
                    water 20 feet, and pours along so violent a current that large blocks of stone
                    are drifted from their position; towards the mouth of the river gardens and
                    vineyards are submerged, and the surface of the stream measures from four to six
                    miles across. In some years the general state of the water is so low that
                    navigation is possible only for threeor four weeks, while in other years it is
                    so high that navigation continues without interruption. Steamboat traffic was
                    introduced in the lower reaches in 1840, when <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0324-0307"/> the government vessel “Prince Vorontzoff” began
                    to make regular trips between Ovidiopol and Akerman; and since that date it has
                    acquired very considerable dimensions. The fisheries of the estuary are of some
                    importance; and the lakes which are formed by the inundations of the valley
                    furnish a valuable addition to the diet of the people in the shape of carp,
                    pike, and tench. The principal towns on the river are Sambor, Khotin, Mohileff,
                    Dubossari, Grigoriopol, Bender, Tiraspol, and Akerman; its tributaries are
                    numerous, but not of individual importance.</p>
