                    Kennedy, line 110.</p></note> In his fifteenth or sixteenth year he was sent to
                    the university of St Andrews, where he received the degree of B.A. in 1477, and
                    that of M.A. in 1479.</p>
                <p>Of the events of his life for nearly twenty years after this we possess little
                    information. He mentions, however, in his poems that he had been employed as a
                    preaching friar of the order of St Francis, and as such had made good cheer in
                    every nourishing town in England had ascended the pulpit at Dernton and
                    Canterbury, and had crossed th sea at Dover, and instructed the inhabitants of
                    Picardy. He also mentions that this mode of life compelled him to have recourse
                    to many a pious fraud, from whose guilt no holy water could clear him. After
                    this he appears to have entered the service of James IV., by whom he was sent on
                    numerous embassies to foreign princes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In a poem to the king he reminds him that he had boen
                    employed nυt only in France, England, and Ireland, but also in Germany, Italy,
                    and Spain. (Notes by Laing, vol. i. app. 263).</p></note> In 1491 he was
                    residing at Paris, most likely in connection with the Scottish embassy there.
                    The knowledge of the Continent he thus obtained must have had considerable
                    influence in imparting greater strength and energy to his poetical
                    conceptions.</p>
                <p>In the year 1500 Dunbar obtained from the king a yearly pension of £10, until he
                    should be promoted to one of greater value. In 1501 he went to England with the
                    ambassadors sent to conclude the negotiations for the marriage of the young King
                    James with the Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. During the festivities
                    on this occasion Dunbar was styled “the Rhymer of Scotland,” and received from
                    Henry a present of £6, 13s. 4d. in December, and a similar sum in January of the
                    subsequent year. On his return to Edinburgh a sum of £5 was paid to him in
                    addition to his salary. In honour of this marriage Dunbar composed his well
                    known poem, <hi rend="italic">The Thrissil and the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pois,</hi> another in honour of the city of London, and several others in which
                    he described the personal attractions of the young queen. After this he lived
                    much at court writing poems, although at the same time he hoped to obtain
                    preferment in the church.</p>
                <p>In 1504 he first performed mass before the king, whose offering on that occasion
                    was £4, 18s., a larger sum than that usually paid on the occasion of a priest’s
                    first mass. In 1507 his pension was augmented to £20, and three years afterwards
                    it was raised to £80, to be paid during his life, or until he should be promoted
                    to a benefice of £100 or more. In 1511 he seems to have been in the train of
                    Queen Margaret when she visited the northern part of Scotland, as one of his
                    poems, descriptive of her reception at Aberdeen, is evidently written by an
                    eye-witness.</p>
                <p>After the disaster of Flodden, in 1513, Dunbar’s fortunes seem to have changed,
                    and no further mention of him occurs as receiving pension. That he may have
                    obtained church preferment is quite possible, but the probability is that the
                    early death of the king, and the unpopularity of the queen and the little
                    influence she had after her marriage with the earl of Angus, may have led to
                    neglect of Dunbar in his old age. His poems contain many allusions to the
                    unequal division of the world’s goods. He was alive in 1517, as in that year he
                    wrote a poem on the occasion of the Regent Albany passing into France, in which
                    he laments the distracted state of public affaire in Scotland.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is considerable doubt
                    about the period of Dunbar’s death, as the poem relative to the Regent Albany
                    may have been attributed to him by mistake. Mr Laing has conjectured that he may
                    have accompanied King James, and been killed along with him in the battle of
                    Flodden, where so many ecclesiastics perished. The volume of the accounts of the
                    Treasurer from 1513 to 1515, which might have settled this and other important
                    points, has been lost.</p></note> He is supposed to have died about the year
                    1520, when he had attained his sixtieth year.</p>
                <p>The poems of Dunbar, “the darling of the Scottish muse,” are about a hundred in
                    number, for the most part of no great length. <hi rend="italic">The Thrissil and
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">Pois,</hi> written, as before remarked, on the
                    occasion of the marriage of James IV., is an allegory in which he describes the
                    amity between England and Scotland in consequence of that event. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Golden Targe</hi> is a moral poem of great power of imagery,
                    in which the ascendency of love over reason is shown to be general—the golden
                    shield of reason being insufficient to ward off the shafts of Cupid. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Twa Maryit Wemen and the Wedo,</hi> a tale in which the poet
                    overhears three females relating their experiences of married life, is an
                    imitation of Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Wife of Bath. The Freiris of
                    Berwik,</hi> a tale, is also in the Chaucerian style. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy</hi> is perhaps the most obscure of his poems,
                    though it seems to have been very popular, and frequently imitated in the 16th
                    century. Several of his smaller poems show a quick appreciation of peculiarities
                    of character, but some of them—such as the tournament, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Justis</hi><hi rend="italic">betuix the Tailyeour and Sowtar—</hi> though
                    ludicrous, are very coarse. In one called <hi rend="italic">Of a Dance in the

                <p>Thain cam in Dunbar the makkar, On all the flure thair was nane frakkar, And

                    as extravagant a piece as can well be conceived. In contrast, however, he wrote
                    several poems of a religious character, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Off the
                    Nativitie of Christ; Off the Passioun of Christ; Off the licsurreciioη of

                <p>More fortunate than Douglas and some of the earlier Scottish poets, Dunbar had
                    the satisfaction of seeing his principal works in print. <hi rend="italic">The

                    illustrative notes. In 1873 a minute analysis of the language of Dunbar was
                    published at Bonn by Dr Johannes Kaufmann of Elberfeld.</p>
