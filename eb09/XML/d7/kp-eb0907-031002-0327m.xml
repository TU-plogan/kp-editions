                <p><label type="entry">DOCKYARDS</label>. Previously to the reign of Henry VIII.,
                    the kings of England had neither naval arsenals nor dockyards, nor any regular
                    establishment of civil or naval officers to provide ships of war, or to man
                    them; they had. admirals, however, possessing a high jurisdiction and very great
                    power (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral).</hi> There are strong
                    evidences of the existence of dockyards, or of something answering thereto, at
                    very early dates, at Rye, Shoreham, and Winchelsea. In November 1243 the sheriff
                    of Sussex was ordered to enlarge the house at Rye in which the king’s galleys
                    were kept, so that it might contain seven galleys. In 1238 the keepers of some
                    of the king’s galleys were directed to cause those vessels to be breamed, and a
                    house to be built at Winchelsea for their safe custody. In 1254 the bailiffs of
                    Winchelsea and Rye were ordered to repair the buildings in which the king’s
                    galleys were kept at Rye. At Portsmouth and at Southampton there seem to have
                    been at all times depots both for ships and stores, though there was no regular
                    dockyard at Portsmouth till the reign of Henry VIII. It would appear, from a
                    very curious poem in Hakluyt’s <hi rend="italic">Collection,</hi> called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Policie of Keeping the Sea,</hi> that Henry V. had ships,
                    officers, and men exclusively appropriated to his service, and independently of
                    those which the Cinque Ports were bound, and the other ports were occasionally
                    called upon, to furnish on any emergency. By this poem it also appears that
                    Little Hampton, unfit as it now is, was the port at which Henry built his great
                    <hi rend="italic">Dτomions</hi></p>
                <p>Which passed other great shippes of the commons.</p>
                <p>The “dromion,” “dromon,” or “dromedary,” was a large war ship, the prototype of
                    which was furnished by the Saracens. Roger de Hoveden, Richard of Devizes, and
                    Peter de Longtoft celebrate the struggle which Richard I., in the “Trench the
                    Mer,” on his way to Palestine, had with a huge dromon,—“a marvellous ship! a
                    ship than which, except Noah’s ship, none greater was ever read of.” This vessel
                    had three masts, was very high out of the water, and is said to have had 1500
                    men on board. It required the united force of the king’s galleys, and an
                    obstinate fight, to capture the dromon.</p>
                <p>The foundation of a regular navy, by the establishment of dockyards, and the
                    formation of a board, consisting of certain commissioners for the management of
                    its affairs, was first laid by Henry VIII.; and the first dockyard erected
                    during his reign was that of Woolwich. Those of Portsmouth, Deptford, Chatham,
                    and Sheerness followed in succession. Plymouth was founded by William III
                    Pembroke was established in 1814, a small yard having previously existed at
                    Milford.</p>
                <p>From the first establishment of the dockyards to the present time, most of them
                    have gradually been enlarged and improved by a succession of expedients and
                    makeshifts, which answered the purposes of the moment; but the best of them have
                    not possessed those conveniences and advantages which might bo obtained from a
                    dockyard systematically laid out on a uniform and consistent plan, with its
                    wharfs, basins, docks, slips, magazines, and workshops arranged according to
                    certain fixed principles, calculated to produce convenience, economy, and
                    despatch.</p>
                <p>Neither at the time when our dockyards were first established, nor at any
                    subsequent periods of their enlargement, could it have been foreseen what
                    incalculable advantages would one day be derived from the substitution of
                    machinery for human labour; and without a reference to this vast improvement in
                    all mechanical operations, it could not be expected that any provision would be
                    made for its future introduction; on the contrary, the docks and slips, the
                    workshops and storehouses, were successively built at random, and placed
                    wherever a vacant space would most conveniently admit them, and in such a manner
                    as in most cases to render the subsequent introduction of machinery and
                    railways, and those various contrivances found in large private manufacturing
                    establishments, quite impossible, even in the most commodious of Her Majesty’s
                    dockyards.</p>
                <p>From a brief description of the royal dockyards as they now stand a general idea
                    may be formed of their several capacities, advantages, and defects. Taking them
                    in succession, according to their vicinity to the capital, the first is <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Deptford.</hi> —Deptford dockyard was first established about
                    the year 1513, and continued to be a building yard, as well as a large depot for
                    naval stores, until 1869, when it was closed as a building yard in pursuance of
                    a recommendation of a committee of the House of Commons, which reported in 1864.
                    The increasing size of ships of war rendered the yard unsuitable for any but the
                    smaller types of vessels, while the continuous deposits of river mud, not only
                    along the frontage but also in the docks and basins, rendered it a costly and
                    decreasingly valuable place of construction. It had an interesting history. Not
                    only were some of the most celebrated ships of the navy built there, but during
                    the Great Plague the office of the Admiralty was removed thither from Seething
                    Lane. Peter the Great worked in the yard as a shipwright, dwelling the while at
                    Sayes Court, the residence of Evelyn, the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylvia</hi> and of the diary not less famous than Pepys’s. Evelyn was the
                    grantee of some of the ground on which the dockyard stood, for no other
                    consideration than that there should always be a keel laid down in the yard.
                    Queen Elizabeth’s Admiralty officials were at one time resident at Deptford; and
                    thither went the queen in 1580 to confer the honour of knighthood on Sir Francis
                    Drake, and to dine with him on board the ship in which he had circumnavigated
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Though closed as a building yard in 1869, in accordance with the recommendation
                    of a committee of the House of Commons, part of the establishment, with suitable
                    storehouses, was retained as a dépôt for naval stores, and as the one place from
                    which shipments of stores to naval depots abroad should be made. Of the residue,
                    part was sold to Mr Evelyn, who made the purchased part into a recreation ground
                    for the Deptford people, and gave it to them. The rest was sold for a
                    metropolitan meat market to the Corporation of London. When intact the front or
                    wharf wall of this dockyard, facing the Thames, was about 1700 feet in length,
                    and the mean breadth of the yard 650 feet; the superficial content about 30
                    acres. It had three slips <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0328-0311"/> for ships of the line on the face next the river;
                    and two for smaller vessels, which launched into a basin or wet dock, 260 by 220
                    feet. There were also three dry docks,— one of them a double dock, communicating
                    with the Thames, and the other a smaller one, opening into the basin. The number
                    of men employed in this yard, in time of war, was about 1500, of whom one-half
                    were shipwrights and artificers, and the other half labourers. There were,
                    besides, 18 or 20 teams of 4 horses each, to drag timber and heavy stores.</p>
                <p>The proximity of Deptford yard to the capital is of great importance, in the
                    convenience it affords for receiving from this great mart all the home
                    manufactures and products which may be purchased for the use of the navy. It is
                    the general magazine of stores and necessaries for the fleet, whence they are
                    shipped off, as occasion requires, to the home yards, the outports, and the
                    foreign stations, in store-ships, transports, coasting sloops, lighters, and
                    launches, according to the distance they have to be sent.</p>
                <p>The management of Deptford naval store yard is now merged in that of the
                    victualling yard, a most complete establishment of its kind. Till 1869 this
                    management comprised a naval captain superintendent, with a master in the navy
                    as his assistant. Under them a storekeeper, a store receiver, an accountant, an
                    inspector of stores, and their respective staffs, conducted the administrative
                    duties of the place. In 1869 the Board of Admiralty, in accordance with the
                    recommendations of a departmental committee, abolished the offices of captain
                    superintendent and master attendant, and placed the establishment under the
                    civilian management of the storekeeper. The naval superintendents were appointed
                    for five years, and after that time were withdrawn to make way for others. The
                    superintending storekeeper is appointed as a permanent officer, and under him
                    experience is accumulated and applied in all the manufactories and other
                    business departments of the yard. The manufactures conducted by and for the
                    Government at Deptford comprise biscuit making on such a scale as to supply,
                    with the yield of the victualling yards at Gosport and Plymouth, biscuit enough
                    for the whole navy, and also chocolate making, mustard making, flour grinding,
                    and the operations of a large cooperage. Most of the salt beef required for the
                    navy is salted and put up there. Deptford may be called the heart of the
                    victualling service. From its stores are shipped the whole of the consignments
                    required for replenishment of depots abroad, as well as the requirements of the
                    other two victualling yards in England, except that at the last-named the
                    supplies of biscuits and flour are provided on the spot. The number of men
                    employed at Deptford necessarily varies. During war upwards of a thousand men
                    are required. The space occupied by the victualling yard is about 19 acres.
                    There is a river frontage of 1700 feet, and a mean depth of 1000 feet.</p>
                <p>In 1877 there are employed in the naval store and victualling yard at Deptford
                    258 men on the establishment, and 390 men on the hired list, at a cost of
                    £25,847.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Woolwich Dockyard.</hi> —This no longer exists as a naval
                    station. Though retaining its name, it remains as a dépôt in the hands of the
                    War Department, for whose work its river frontage of 3680 feet, and its docks
                    and basins, afford excellent accommodation. Woolwich was the first and most
                    ancient of all the dockyards, having been established in the reign of Henry VII.
                    From it have been launched some of the finest and most celebrated ships of the
                    English navy. In 1512 the “Harry Grace de Dieu” was built, and in 1552 was
                    accidently burnt, there. In more modern times the “Nelson” and the “Ocean” were
                    from Woolwich, and those latest specimens of the now extinct class of fighting
                    ship, the “Trafalgar,” “Agamemnon,” and “Royal Albert.” As an establishment for
                    the building and repair of ships, especially steam ships, Woolwich was perhaps
                    the completest and best furnished of all the dockyards. Its power to make and
                    repair engines and all iron work, whether of ship or fittings, was so extensive
                    as to enable the Government, before the introduction of ironclads, to be nearly
                    independent of the private trade. With occupation for 1800 workmen, it was able
                    to rely upon its own resources almost exclusively. Its proximity to London gave
                    it other great advantages, including this, that the Admiralty were thereby
                    enabled the more easily to supervise the constructive work for which its
                    architects were responsible. But for the fatal operation of two causes, the
                    increased and increasing depth of ships of war, and the continuous silting of
                    the river into the docks and basins of the yard, Woolwich would probably have
                    remained one of the chief dockyards. Both these causes, however, operated. The
                    depth of the “Nelson’s” hold had tobe lessened in order to ensure her passing
                    Erith; and it was stated in the <hi rend="italic">Eighth Report of the Select
                    Committee on Finance</hi> (1818) that “the wharf wall at Woolwich, owing to the
                    action of the tide on the foundation, is in a falling state, and in danger of
                    being swept into the river, it being secured only in a temporary manner; and
                    requires to be immediately rebuilt in a direction that will preserve it from
                    similar injury hereafter, and prevent, in a great degree, that accumulation of
                    mud which has, in the course of the last ten years, occasioned an expense of
                    upwards of £125,692, and would threaten in time to render the yard useless.”
                    Till 1869, however, notwithstanding the recommendations of a parliamentary
                    committee, and the frequent urgings of members on both sides of the House of
                    Commons, Woolwich yard was kept open. Then, in accordance with a policy long
                    commended, it was closed, steps were taken to dispose of the plant and material
                    that remained, and the place itself was handed over, with its workshops and
                    factories, to the War Department in 1872.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Woolwich Division of Royal Marines.—</hi> About the same time
                    that the dockyard was broken up, the division of marines—no longer in contact
                    with ships and shipping— was abolished, and its strength was distributed between
                    the divisions at Chatham and Plymouth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chatham Dockyard.</hi> —This dockyard, founded by Queen
                    Elizabeth, though not on the present site, is situated on the right bank of the
                    Medway, to which it presents a line of wharfage extending 10,000 feet, and of
                    embankment 4500 feet more. The superficial contents may be estimated at about
                    500 acres. The old part of the yard has seven building-slips on the front, from
                    which ships are launched into the river, all equal to the building of ships of
                    the line, and three others for frigates and smaller vessels. In the same front
                    are four dry docks communicating with the Medway. At the southern extremity of
                    the yard is the ropery, 1248 feet in length and 47¾ feet in width, in which are
                    employed about 250 persons. It is equal to the manufacture of every description
                    of cordage required for the naval service, including the largest size cable. The
                    hemp houses, 306 feet long by 36 feet wide, are equal to the stowage of 1600
                    tons of hemp and 3000 hauls of yarn. Next to these are the slips and docks, with
                    the working-sheds and artificers’ shops close in the rear, an excellent
                    smithery, timber-berths, seasoning sheds, deal and iron yard, &lt;fcc., and
                    beyond these, on the eastern extremity of the yard, the officers’ houses and
                    gardens. The superintendent’s house is situated nearly in the centre of the
                    yard. The lower or north-eastern part of the old yard is occupied by mast-ponds,
                    mast-houses and slips, store-boat houses and slips, ballast wharf,
                    timber-berths, and saw-pits.</p>
                <p>Before the construction of the extension works in 1867- 73, there was no wet dock
                    or basin in Chatham-yard; but the <pb break="no"

                    water, in some degree answered the purpose of one. Owing to the shallowness of
                    the water and the crooked navigation from Chatham round Upnor Point, ships were
                    obliged to take in their water and ballast at one place, their stores and
                    provisions at another, their guns, powder, and ammunition at a third; in
                    consequence of which, a ship was usually longer in getting out to sea from
                    Chatham than even from Deptford.</p>
                <p>The necessity of improving the accommodation at Chatham forced itself upon the
                    attention of those who were responsible for the navy many years before the
                    opportunity came for effecting the improvements. Pepys records a visit to
                    Chatham in July 1663, to inspect the site of a projected wet dock. It was
                    estimated to cost £10,000, and Pepys remarked that “the place indeed is likely
                    to be a very fit place when the king hath money to do it with.” In effect,
                    however, it was not taken in hand by the king, who allowed the Dutch, instead of
                    docks, to be found in the Medway. It was not till 1867 that ground was broken
                    for the extension works at Chatham, though the plans had been prepared and
                    certain preparations made many months before, under the supervision of Colonel
                    Sir Andrew Clarke, C.B. The extension works may be thus described. Three basins
                    give access from Gillingham Reach, which formerly connected the mainland with
                    the salt marshes. These marshes were covered with water every spring tide. The
                    Government bought 150 acres of them, and proceeded to re-make the ground which
                    forms the site of the new dockyard workshops and factories. The three basins
                    communicate with each other by caissons, so that ships of the largest class can
                    pass from the bend of the Medway at Gillingham to that at Upnor. Upnor Reach
                    entrance, opposite Upnor Castle, is 80 feet wide, the others are 84 feet. The
                    first (Upnor) basin is the repairing basin, which has an area of 22 acres, and a
                    depth, in common with the others, of 33 feet at spring, and 30 feet at neap
                    tides. On the south side of this basin, and opening into it, are four graving
                    docks, each capable of receiving the largest man of war. From this basin a
                    passage about 175 feet long leads to the “factory” basin, which has an area of
                    20 acres. Contiguous to it are being erected the engine and boiler factories,
                    and the principal workshops necessary for iron war-ship building. Next to the
                    “factory” basin is the fitting-out basin, with an area of 28 acres. In this
                    place ships are to receive their sea stores and be got ready for service. Here,
                    too, they will be dismantled and paid out of commission.</p>
                <p>Very great engineering difficulties had to be contended against in prosecuting
                    these works, owing chiefly to the soft mud and to the treacherous character of
                    the ground on which foundations had to be laid. Convict labour was largely
                    employed in the work of excavation, and in the manufacture of bricks, whereof
                    20,000,000 a year were turned out, at small cost, on the spot. The cost of these
                    new works is reckoned at about £2,000,000.</p>
                <p>A considerable piece of new ground (about 2000 feet in length by 200 in breadth)
                    was added a few years ago to the upper part of the present Chatham dockyard, on
                    which Mr Brunel erected one of the completest saw-mills in the United Kingdom.
                    It is supposed to be equal to the power of fifty saw-pits and nearly one hundred
                    sawyers, and is capable of supplying the dockyards of Chatham and Sheerness with
                    all the straight-sawn timber that they can require. But the great advantage of
                    the plau is in its application of the steam engine to the management and
                    arrangement of timber, by which the labour and expense of a great number of
                    horses are saved, and the obstruction and impediments to the general services of
                    the yard avoided.</p>
                <p>Since the introduction of iron as the material for ships hulls, Chatham has taken
                    a more prominent place amongst dockyards. Most of the iron ships built in the
                    royal yards have been built at Chatham and Pembroke,—the capabilities being
                    greater at Chatham, where the “Achilles,” “Monarch,” “Glatton,” “Rupert,”
                    “Raleigh,” “Bellerophon,” “Sultan,” “Alexandra,” “Temeraire,” and many also of
                    the Musquito fleet of gunboats were built. At Chatham and Devonport the whole of
                    the cordage required for the navy is manufactured; and, since 1869, the whole
                    business of remanufacturing copper and old iron for the navy has been
                    concentrated at Chatham.</p>
                <p>The first division of royal marines, consisting of twenty-eight companies, is
                    stationed at Chatham, in excellent barracks, situated near one of the
                    extremities of the dockyard, and occupying nine acres of ground.</p>
                <p>There was formerly a small victualling depot, situated partly in the parish of
                    Chatham and partly in that of Rochester, from which the ships at Chatham and at
                    Sheerness and the Nore received a supply of provisions and water. Ships now
                    obtain their supplies from Deptford, except fresh meat and vegetables, which are
                    obtained on local contracts on demand.</p>
                <p>It may be found necessary to establish a fresh depot for victualling stores at
                    Chatham when the port becomes developed as a place for fitting out and repairing
                    as well as for building. This process of development is going on rapidly. In
                    March 1873 the executive of the Sheerness steam reserve with their ship were
                    removed to Chatham, and the steps necessary for transferring the principal
                    powers and attributes of the exposed dockyard at Sheerness to the strongly
                    defended port of Chatham will be quickly taken. The great difficulties of
                    navigation in the Medway, combined with the successive forts and torpedo
                    stations which stud the river, are calculated to make Chatham unassailable. As
                    Hollingshed said of Lundy Island, there will be “no entrance but for friends.”
                    When the Chatham works shall have been finished, the question will probably be
                    revived whether Sheerness should not, as has been often recommended, be closed;
                    but the advantages of having even a small yard whither ships only slightly
                    injured by sea or by the enemy can run for repair, without having to thread the
                    reaches of the Medway up and down, are so great that it is unlikely the place
                    will be abandoned.</p>
                <p>In 1876 Chatham dockyard was raised to a rear-admiral’s command. The number of
                    workmen employed at Chatham yard in 1877 is 1478 established and 2022 hired men,
                    at an aggregate cost of £220,138.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sheerness Dockyard.</hi> —This dockyard is situated on a low
                    point of land on the island of Sheppey, of which the soil is composed of sand
                    and mud brought from the sea on the one side, and down the Medway on the other,
                    and has so much contracted the mouth of that river as completely to command the
                    entrance of it. The situation, in a military point of view, is a most important
                    one, particularly from its vicinity to the North Sea and to the anchorage at the
                    Nore; by which anchorage, and by the works of Sheerness, the mouths of the
                    Thames and the Medway are completely defended.</p>
                <p>As a situation for a dock, the objections to which it was liable are now in a
                    great measure removed. On account of the low swampy ground on which it stood,
                    fevers aud agues were at one time so prevalent that shipwrights and other
                    artificers were literally impressed and compelled to work at Sheerness. In
                    process of time, however, a town sprung up close to the dockyard, and with it
                    some little improvement by drainage, embankments, and other measures. Still it
                    continued, for a considerable time, an unhealthy and disagreeable place. As a
                    dockyard it was totally destitute of all convenience or arrangement; and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0330-0313"/> the whole premises, mixed among wharfs and
                    buildings belonging to the Ordnance Department, did not cover more than 15
                    acres. The storehouses were dispersed in various parts of this space, and in so
                    ruinous a state, that a ship hauled up in the mud was by far the best storehouse
                    in the whole yard. There were two small inconvenient docks for frigates or
                    smaller vessels. It was in fact a mere port of refitment, and might be
                    considered as an appendage to Chatham.</p>
                <p>The very limited capacity of Sheerness, and other considerations, led to the
                    origination of the project of a naval arsenal at Northfleet, which, from change
                    of circumstances, and from the important improvements now carried out at
                    Sheerness, is not likely ever again to be revived. These improvements were of
                    sufficient magnitude to render any establishment at Northíieet wholly
                    unnecessary, by making Sheerness a very complete dockyard. Previously to
                    carrying into execution this important undertaking, a committee of engineers and
                    others was appointed, whose plan was afterwards minutely examined, and with some
                    slight improvements adopted. The first stone was laid on the 19th August 1814,
                    and the whole work was completed at an expense not far short of one million
                    sterling. The additions, together with some part of the premises held by the War
                    Department, make the whole area of the dockyard of Sheerness amount to upwards
                    of 50 acres. The wharf wall on the south side of the basin in front of the
                    mast-houses is 100 feet, and that on the river front 60 feet in width, lined on
                    both sides with as complete a specimen of good and beautiful masonry of granite
                    as any in the kingdom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Portsmouth Dockyard.</hi> — Portsmouth dockyard, founded by
                    Henry VII., will always be considered as the grand naval arsenal of England, and
                    the headquarters or general rendezvous of the British fleet. It appears at all
                    times to have been regarded as a very important naval station, notwithstanding
                    the rivalry of Southampton, which was the principal port in Plantagenet times.
                    In 1225 an order was issued to the barons of the Cinque Ports to provide men for
                    the king’s galleys at Portsmouth. In 1226 the sum of £25, 14s. 4d. was paid to
                    the masters and crews of the “king’s two great ships at Portsmouth.” In 1229,
                    £40 was paid to the king’s clerk for the repairs of the king’s galleys and great
                    ship at Portsmouth. King John on several occasions assembled his barons at
                    Portsmouth for naval expeditions. He seems, moreover, to have aimed at
                    increasing the accommodation there for ships. In May 1212 the sheriff of
                    Southampton was commanded to cause the docks at Portsmouth to be inclosed with a
                    strong wall, in the manner which the archdeacon of Taunton would point out, for
                    the preservation of the king’s ships and galleys. He was also to cause
                    pent-houses to be erected for their stores and tackle. This was to be done
                    immediately, lest the galleys or their stores should be injured in the coming
                    winter.</p>
                <p>In 1540, when the dockyard seems to have been regularly established, the area of
                    the yard was comprised in 8 acres of ground, and abutted upon the harbour near
                    what are now known as the King’s Stairs. Cromwell added 2 acres in 1658; Charles
                    II. added 8 in 1663, and 10 more in 1667. Between 1667 and 1710, 30 acres were
                    reclaimed from harbour mud, or bought from the town, and various subsequent
                    additions gave 90 acres as the area on which Portsmouth dockyard stood at the
                    end of the last century. Early in Queen Victoria’s reign the growth of the steam
                    navy necessitated an enlargement of dock accommodation. In 1843 were ordered,
                    and in 1848 were opened a fine steam basin holding 7 acres of water, and four
                    new docks, the dockyard ground being extended to 115 acres in all. A few years
                    more and the w ant of dock room was as great as ever. Huge iron-clads, of a
                    draught and length greater than had yet been known, required new docks and
                    basins of special construction. The extension works at Chatham (see above) and
                    Portsmouth were accordingly entered upon. At the present time (August 1877)
                    great progress has been made with both sets of works, under the direction of
                    Colonel Sir A. Clarke, C.B., R.E., and Colonel Pasley, R.E. When finished the
                    Portsmouth new works will comprise a tidal basin, three floating basins (upon
                    one of which four docks will abut), a large deep dock, entered from the tidal
                    basin, two floating basin entrance locks, which may also be used as deep docks,
                    and greatly increased wharfage and space for building storehouses and factories.
                    The system of docks and basins will begin with the tidal basin, entered from the
                    harbour by an opening 100 yards wide, aud having a depth of 30 feet of water at
                    low spring tides. The deep dock and the two locks at the head of this basin will
                    carry 28 feet of water over the invert at low spring tides; the two latter will
                    be the entrances to the repairing, rigging, and fitting-out basins, which will
                    lead from each other in the order named. These locks will in themselves be
                    magnificent docks, able to receive the largest iron-clad at once from the tidal
                    basin. They will lead to the repairing basin, a vast excavation, of a
                    parallelogram shape, which will measure 22 acres, and carry at high spring tides
                    35 feet of water. This depth of water will be common to the three basins; it may
                    be made permanent by the closing of the lock gates, and one great use of the
                    locks will be that vessels may be docked in them in any state of the tide
                    without lowering the level of water in the inner basins, "where the tide may be
                    ponded at its highest level of 35 feet of water, if necessary. Having been
                    raised to this level in the locks by ingress of water from the tidal basin,
                    vessels will be able to pass inwards to the repairing and other basins without
                    any lessening of the depth of water. The four large docks of the repairing basin
                    will have a depth of 30 feet of water on their sills, even when filled at high
                    neap tides. Two of them are entirely finished, and the excavation of the others
                    is far advanced. Opposite to these docks will be the entrance to the rigging
                    basin, an excavation o'f 14 acres, in a trapezoid shape. The third, or
                    fitting-out basin, which will receive the ships when they have been repaired and
                    rigged, will be a pentagon of 14 acres. On one side of this basin there will be
                    a coal depot, so that vessels may leave the docks with their coals on board,
                    ready for sea. In addition to these four basins and seven docks there is an
                    entrance between the tidal basin of the new works and the steam basin of 1848,
                    which will connect the old and new portions of the dockyard; and, as for
                    wharfage, the harbour or north wall of the extension works will have 26 feet and
                    the wall of the tidal basin 30 feet of water alongside it at low spring tides,
                    making altogether three miles of wharfage accommodation in connection with the
                    extension works, and that for ships of the largest class. The size of the whole
                    dockyard will be more than doubled, for its present 115 acreswill be increased
                    by more than 177 acres of reclaimed mud land and fortifications glacis, making
                    in all an exact measurement of 293 acres 2 roods and 29 perches. These great
                    works were estimated when designed in 1865 to cost £3,000,000, exclusive of
                    convict labour. They have given employment on the spot to upwards of 1600 free
                    men and about 800 convicts. The latter are employed in brick-making, and have
                    made upwards of 100,000,000 bricks since the works were begun.</p>
                <p>A complete network of railway connects all parts of the yard with the docks and
                    basins, and the whole with the neighbouring railroad to all parts of the
                    kingdom, so that iron or coal can be put into waggons at Sheffield or Cardiff
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n331/mode/1up"

                    medium, to the side of the ship which is to use the material.</p>
                <p>This dockyard, accordingly, is by far the most capacious of all; and the safe and
                    extensive harbour, the noble anchorage at Spithead, the central situation with
                    respect to the English Channel and the opposite coast of France, render
                    Portsmouth of the very first importance as a naval station; and in this view of
                    it, every possible attention appears to have been paid to the extension and
                    improvement of its dockyard.</p>
                <p>In the centre of the old wharf-wall, facing the harbour, is the entrance into the
                    great basin, whose dimensions are 380 by 260 feet, and its area 2¾ acres. Into
                    this basin open four excellent dry docks, and on each of its sides is a dry dock
                    opening into the harbour; and all of these six docks are capable of receiving
                    ships of the largest class. Besides these is a double dock for frigates, the
                    stern dock communicating through a lock with the harbour, and the head dock with
                    another basin about 250 feet square. There is also a camber, with a wharf-wall
                    on each side, 660 feet in length, and of sufficient width to admit of transports
                    and merchant ships bringing stores to the dock-yard. In the same face of the
                    yard are three building slips capable of receiving the largest ships, and a
                    small one for sloops, besides two building slips for frigates on the northern
                    face of the yard, and a smaller slip for sloops. The range of storehouses on the
                    north-east side, and the rigging-house and sail-loft on the south-west side of
                    the camber are magnificent buildings, the former occupying nearly 600 feet in
                    length, exclusive of the two intermediate spaces, and nearly 60 feet in width,
                    and the two latter 400 feet. The sea-store houses occupy a line of building
                    which, with the three narrow openings between them of 25 feet each, extend 800
                    feet. The rope-house, tarring-house, and other appendages of the ropery are on
                    the same scale; but since the suppression of the Portsmouth ropery (in 1869),
                    and the concentration of rope-making at Devonport and Chatham, these premises
                    have been used as general storehouses. The two sets of quadrangular storehouses,
                    and the two corresponding buildings, with the intervening timber-berths and
                    saw-pits, at the head of the dry docks, issuing from the great basin, are all
                    excellent, and conveniently placed. The smithery is on a large scale, and
                    contiguous to it are the various factories for metal work used in the building
                    and repair of iron ships. Formerly there was also a copper mill, capable of
                    turning out 300,000 sheets a year, besides bolts, bars, and gudgeons for ships’
                    use. But since 1869 the whole business of remaking old metal of whatever kind
                    has been concentrated at Chatham. Most of these factories were constructed under
                    the direction of General Bentham. At the head of the north dock are the wood
                    mills, at which every article of turnery, rabetting, &lt;fcc,, is performed for
                    the use of the navy, from boring the chamber of a pump to the turning of a
                    button for a chest of drawers. But the principal part of these mills is the
                    remarkable machinery for making blocks, contrived by Brunel (see <hi

                <p>The northern extremity of the dock-yard is chiefly occupied with seasoning-sheds,

                    the eastern extremity are situated the houses and gardens of the superintendent

                <p><hi rend="italic">Naval College.—</hi> The establishment of a college at
                    Portsmouth for the education of young gentlemen for the navy was first formed in
                    1729 under the title of the Naval Academy. It contained 40 scholars, the sons of
                    the nobility and gentry. In 1806 it was reorganized under the name of the Royal
                    Naval College, and the number of scholars was raised from 40 to 70; of whom 40
                    were to consist of the sons of commissioned officers of the navy, and to receive
                    their board, clothing, lodging, and education free of all expense; the remainder
                    to consist of sons of noblemen, gentlemen, civil and military officers, on
                    payment of £72 a year. The age of admission was from twelve and a half to
                    fourteen years. No student to remain at college longer than three years; at the
                    end of which time, or sooner if he should have completed the plan of education,
                    he was to be discharged into one of Her Majesty’s ships, the college time being
                    reckoned two years of the six required to be served to qualify for such a
                    commission. In 1837 the Royal Naval College for the education of young gentlemen
                    for the navy was abolished, and by an order in council of 1838 it was reopened
                    as an establishment for the scientific education of a certain number of officers
                    and mates of the naval service, the latter to have passed both their
                    examinations in seamanship and in navigation, and to remain one year in the
                    college. A limited number of commissioned officers of any rank were also
                    permitted to study at the college, but no expense was incurred on their
                    account.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On 1st February
                    1873 Portsmouth College was superseded by the Royal Naval College at Greenwich.
                    The means of education pro vided at Portsmouth were at once too limited and not
                    technical enough. The disused buildings of Greenwich hospital furnished the
                    extra space required, and the new system of higher education of naval officers,
                    which was pronounced by the select committee on that subject to be necessary,
                    was considered and carried out by Mr Goschen, then first lord of the Admiralty.
                    Rear-admiral Sir Cooper Key, K.C.B., was the first president of the college. The
                    minute of the Board of Admiralty consequent upon the Order in Council of 16th
                    January 1873, whereby Greenwich College was founded, states that—“My Lords
                    intend that the Royal Naval College at Greenwich shall be so organized as to
                    provide for the education of naval officers of all ranks above that of
                    midshipman, in all branches of theoretical and scientific study bearing upon
                    their profession; but my Lords will continue the instruction given in the ‘
                    Excellent ’ gunnery ship as heretofore, and arrangements for instruction in
                    practical surveying will also be continued at Portsmouth. My Lords desire, by
                    the establishment of the college, to give to the executive officers of the navy
                    generally every possible advantage in respect of scientific education; but no
                    arrangements will be made at all prejudicing the all-important practical
                    training in the active duties of their profession.” All matters relating to the
                    particular classes of officers admitted to study, and the different subjects of
                    study, are determined by such regulations as may from time to time be laid down
                    by the Admiralty. Special pecuniary concessions are made to officers on half-pay
                    who may enter for study, and officers of the lower grades are put upon full pay,
                    while in all cases there is a Government contribution in aid of the mess.
                    Special professional inducements to study are offered, and everything is done to
                    make the college answer thoroughly the purposes for which it was founded.
                    Practical knowledge is taught on the Thames and its estuaries, as theory is
                    taught in the college.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Naval Architectural

                    supplying the ships with water and provisions, more especially such as had to
                    take them on board at Spithead. The former consisted chiefly of provision-stores
                    and magazines, with a tidemill and a bakery; at the latter there were a
                    cooperage and a brewery. The victualling establishments are now consolidated at

                    exceptions there is no manufacture at Gosport. The depot is supplied with sea
                    provisions and clothing from Deptford, and re-issues them to the fleet at
                    Portsmouth. There is an excellent slaughter yard in the place, where cattle
                    delivered under contract are slain, and the meat issued to the fleet.</p>

                    the harbour. It is in charge of a resident medical inspector-general, who is
                    assisted by a competent medical and clinical staff.</p>
                <p>The second division of royal marines, consisting of twenty-six companies, is
                    stationed at Forton barracks, on the Gosport side. Sixteen companies of royal
                    marine artillery have excellent quarters at Eastney, three miles from

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Plymouth Dockyard.</hi> —The naval station of Plymouth is
                    hardly inferior to that of Portsmouth. It possesses one of the finest harbours
                    in the world, capable of containing, in perfect security at their moorings, not
                    less than a hundred sail of the line; and by means of the breakwater it may
                    boast of an excellent roadstead for eighteen or twenty sail of the line. The old
                    dockyard has only one basin, without gates, but the dimensions are 300 by 280
                    feet. The excellent harbour of Hamoaze, on the western bank of which the
                    wharfwall extends, almost compensates for the want of other basins, especially
                    as the depth of water allows the largest ships to range along the jetties, and
                    receive their stores on board immediately from the wharf.</p>
                <p>Plymouth dockyard proper extends in a circular sweep along the shores of Hamoaze
                    3500 feet, its width about the middle, where it is greatest, being 1600, and at
                    each extremity 1000 feet, making its superficial contents about 96 acres. The
                    land front is about 2850 feet. In the line facing the harbour are two dry docks
                    for ships of the first rate, a double dock for seventy-four gun ships,
                    communicating with Hamoaze, and another dock for ships of the line, opening into
                    the basin. There is, besides, a graving-dock without gates, and a canal or
                    camber similar to that in Portsmouth yard, for the admission of vessels bringing
                    stores into the yard, which, communicating with the boat-pond, cuts the
                    dock-yard nearly into two parts. There are five jetties projecting from the
                    entrances of the dry docks into Hamoaze, alongside of which ships are
                    conveniently brought when undocked. All these are situated between the centre
                    and the northern extremity of the harbour line. On the southern part are three
                    building slips for the largest class of ships and two for smaller vessels, the
                    outer mast-pond and mast-houses, timberberths, saw-pits, and smithery. Higher
                    up, on this end of the yard is an extensive mast-pond and mast-locks, with
                    plank-houses over them, and, above these, three hemp magazines, contiguous to
                    which is the finest ropery in the kingdom, consisting of two ranges of
                    buildings, one the laying-house, the other the spinning-house, each being 1200
                    feet in length, and three stories in height. In the construction of the new
                    rope-house no wood has been used excepting the shingles of the roof, to which
                    the slates are fastened. All the rest is of iron. The ribs and girders of the
                    floors are of cast iron, covered over with Yorkshire paving stone, and the
                    doors, window frames, and staircases are all of cast iron, so that the whole
                    building may be considered as proof against fire.</p>
                <p>The northern half of the yard, besides the docks and basin, with all the
                    appropriate working sheds and artificers’ shops,· contains a cluster of very
                    elegant stone buildings, ranged round a quadrangle, the longest sides being
                    about 450 feet, and the shortest 300 feet. Within the quadrangle are also two
                    new ranges of buildings, in which iron has been used in the place of wood. These
                    buildings consist of magazines for different kinds of stores, rigging-houses,
                    and sail-lofts. The northern and upper part of the yard is occupied by a range
                    of handsome houses, with good gardens behind them, for the
                    admiral-superintendent and the principal officers of the yard, the chapel, the
                    guard-house, and pay-office, stables for the officers and the teams, and a fine
                    reservoir of fresh water for the supply of the yard.</p>
                <p>Plymouth is not only a good building and repairing yard, on account of its
                    excellent docks and slips, and the great length of line along the Hamoaze, but
                    also a good refitting yard.</p>
                <p>A large addition has been made tö Plymouth yard by the fine establishment of
                    Keyham steam factory which adjoins it, with a water frontage of about 1300 feet,
                    with two steam basins—one 630 feet by 560 feet, and another 700 feet by 400
                    feet. There are also excellent graving docks leading into these basins, around
                    which are coal sheds, storehouses, boat berths, engineers’ shops, boiler
                    factories, and all the necessary appliances of mast shears, cranes, and capstans
                    worked by hydraulic or steam machinery. There is no railway within the yard
                    connecting it with the general system of railroad, though means are being taken
                    to secure a junction with the narrow gauge line through Okehampton. Traction
                    engines, called “camels,” at present discharge most of the work of a
                    railway.</p>

                    shore of Milford Haven, not two miles from the town of Pembroke. It includes an
                    area of about 60 acres, its surface descending in a gradual slope to the water’s
                    edge, along the shore of which there is a frontage of about 2350 feet. It has a
                    dock, and 14 building slips, 6 of which are for first-rates. The largest wooden
                    ship of the royal navy, the “Duke of Wellington,” 131 guns, was launched from
                    this yard. Here, too, were built the “Thunderer” and the “Fury,” the huge
                    mastless iron-clads, intended with the “Devastation” and the “Staunches” to form
                    the sea police of the coasts.</p>

                    classed in one of the four classes, according to the state in which they are
                    when paid off, or the state of forwardness for further service to which they may
                    be ordered by the Admiralty. The reserves used to be comprehended in what was

                    under a captain of the navy, the flag captain of the dockyard admiral. The

                    the ship’s “establishment,” from cordage to hammocks and lanterns, are kept
                    ready for immediate shipment. These arrangements apply to the ships in the first
                    division of the reserve. Competent technical officers, all the ship’s artificers
                    in port not otherwise employed, and a large body of seamen are under the orders
                    of the captain of the reserve.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History of Management of Dockyards.</hi> —When Henry VIII.
                    first established a regular king’s dockyard at Woolwich, he appointed a board,
                    consisting of certain commissioners for the management of all naval matters; and
                    it is curious enough (see the <hi rend="italic">Pepysian Collection of
                    Manuscripts</hi> in the university of Cambridge), that the regulations which he
                    made for the civil government of the navy, and which were in the reign of Edward
                    VI. revised, arranged, and turned into ordinances, form the broad basis of all
                    the subsequent instructions given to the several officers to whom the management
                    of the civil affairs of the navy has been committed. The commissioners of the
                    navy then consisted of the vice-admiral of England, the master of the ordnance,
                    the surveyor of the marine causes, the treasurer, comptroller, general surveyor
                    of the victualling, clerk of the ships, and clerk of the stores. They had each
                    their particular duties; and once a week they were ordered to meet at their
                    office on Tower Hill, and once a month report their proceedings to the lord high
                    admiral.</p>
                <p>In 1609 the principal officers for conducting the civil affairs of the navy were
                    suspended, in consequence of many abuses being complained of; and other
                    commissioners were appointed, with powers to manage, settle, and put the affairs
                    of the navy into a proper train, and to prevent, by such measures as might
                    appear to be necessary, the continuance of the many great frauds and abuses
                    which had prevailed. A similar commission was renewed in 1618, which in a full
                    and minute report detailed and explained those frauds and abuses. That
                    commission, which ended on the death of James I., was renewed by his successor,
                    and remained in force till 1628, when it was dissolved, and the management of
                    the navy was restored to the board of officers established by Edward VI.</p>
                <p>In the disturbed reign of Charles I. the navy was suffered to go to decay; but by
                    the extraordinary exertions of Cromwell it was raised to a height which it had
                    never before reached; it again declined, however, under the administration of
                    his son. At the Restoration, the duke of York, of whom Macaulay wrote that he
                    was the only honest man in his dockyards, was appointed lord high admiral; and
                    by his advice a committee was appointed to consider a plan he had drawn out for
                    the future regulation of the affairs of the navy, at which he himself presided.
                    “In all naval affairs,” say the commissioners of revision, “he appears to have
                    acted with the advice nod assistance of Mr Samuel Pepys, who first held the
                    office of clerk of the acts, and was afterwards secretary of the Admiralty,—a
                    man of extraordinary knowledge in all that related to the business of that
                    department, of great talents, and the most indefatigable industry.”</p>
                <p>The entire management of the navy was now in the hands of the duke, as lord high
                    admiral, by whom three new commissioners were appointed to act with the
                    treasurer of the navy, the comptroller, the surveyor, and clerk of the acts, as
                    principal officers and commissioners of the navy. A book of instructions, drawn
                    out by Pepys, was sent to the navy board for its guidance. A rapid progress was
                    made in the repair and augmentation of the fleet; but the duke being called
                    away, in consequence of the Dutch w ar in 1664, the example of zeal and industry
                    set by Pepys was not sufficient, in the duke’s absence, to prevent neglect and
                    mismanagement in every department, except his own.</p>
                <p>From 1673 to 1679, the office of lord high admiral was put in commission with
                    Prince Rupert at the head of it. The king, through Pepys, arranged all naval
                    affairs; but in the latter year, when the duke was sent abroad, and Pepys to the
                    Tower, a new set of men were made commissioners of the navy, who, without
                    experience, ability, or industry, suffered the navy to go to decay. “All the
                    wise regulations,” say the commissioners of revision, “formed during the
                    administration of the duke of York, were neglected; and such supineness and
                    waste appear to have prevailed as, at the end of not more than five years, when
                    he was recalled to the office of lord high admiral, only twenty-two ships, none
                    larger than a fourthrate, with two fireships, were at sea; those in the harbour
                    were quite unfit for service; even the thirty new ships which he had left
                    building had been suffered to fall into a state of great decay, and hardly any
                    stores w ere found to remain in the dock-yards.” Pepys was re-appointed
                    secretary of the Admiralty; the king instituted an inquiry into the characters
                    and abilities of the first ship-builders in England, and by the advice of Pepys
                    added Sir Anthony Dean, eminent in that profession, with three others, to the
                    former principal officers. The old commissioners were directed entirely to
                    confine their attention to the business of a committee of accounts. To each of
                    the new commissioners was intrusted a distinct branch of the proposed reform;
                    and it appears that, highly to their credit, “they performed what they had
                    undertaken in less time than was allowed for it, and at less expense,” having
                    completed their business to the general satisfaction of the public two months
                    before the Revolution. The business of the navy, thus methodized and settled,
                    remained undisturbed by that event.</p>
                <p>It will readily be seen that the vast increase of our naval force since that time
                    has necessarily required many additional orders and regulations, some of which,
                    from circumstances, were not compatible with each other; some were given to one
                    dockyard and not to another; others in’ona yard became obsolete, while they
                    continued to be acted upon in another; so that there was no longer that
                    uniformity in the management which it is desirable—indeed, essen-, tially
                    necessary—to preserve. From the year 1764 to 1804, when the king appointed a
                    commission “for revising and digesting the civil affairs of his navy,” the
                    attention of the lords of the admiralty and the navy board had frequently been
                    directed to this important subject; but nothing was done to forward so desirable
                    an arrangement, except that Sir Charles Middleton (afterwards Lord Barham), when
                    comptroller of the navy, classed and digested under distinct heads all orders
                    and regulations prior to the year 1786. The commissioners of naval inquiry,
                    appointed in 1803, state the necessity of revising the instructions, and
                    digesting the immense mass of orders <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0334-0317"/> issued to the dockyard officers, and regret that
                    a work of such utility should not have been completed. The commission consisted
                    of Admiral Lord Barham, John Fordyce, Esq., Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, Bart.,
                    Vice-Admiral Domett, and Ambrose Serle, Esq. They made fifteen distinct reports,
                    the date of the first being 13th June 1805, of the last the 6th March 1808. All
                    these except two were printed by order of the House of Commons, and were mostly
                    carried into effect by Orders in Council. One of the two not printed is an
                    inquiry into the state of the navy at different periods, and of naval timber;
                    the other relates to the formation of a new dock-yard at Northfleet.</p>
                <p>These reports led to the establishment, for the first time, in all dockyards, of
                    one uniform system of management, by which it was hoped incalculable advantages
                    would have been secured, in the preventing of frauds, in the saving of labour
                    and materials, and consequently time and expense, and in securing better
                    workmanship in the construction of ships; but the system was cumbrous and
                    expensive, and has given way to other more judicious management.</p>
                <p>The management of the dockyards, and of all the civil affairs of the navy, was
                    formerly intrusted to certain commissioners, of whom the comptroller of the
                    navy, three surveyors, and seven other commissioners formed a board at Somerset
                    House, for the general direction and superintendence of the civil concerns of
                    the navy, subject to the control of the Admiralty. At most of the yards, both
                    home and foreign, was a commissioner of the navy, who was nearly always a naval
                    officer of the rank of captain. The foreign yards over which a commissioner
                    presided were Bermuda, Cape of Good Hope, Gibraltar, Halifax, Jamaica, Malta,
                    Quebec, Kingston (Canada), and Trincomalee. These, with the five belonging to
                    the home yards, Woolwich (including Deptford), Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth,
                    and Plymouth, made the whole number of commissioners of the navy amount to
                    twenty-four.</p>
                <p>In 1832 Sir James Graham, then first lord of the Admiralty, substituted for these
                    commissioners five departmental officers, who were called “principal” officers
                    of the navy. These were the surveyor of the navy, the accountant-general, the
                    storekeeper - general, the comptroller of victualling and transports, the
                    director general of the medical department (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiralty).
                    To</hi> these were subsequently added a director of works and a director of
                    transports. In 1869 this arrangement was modified. The post of
                    storekeeper-general was abolished, and the duties discharged by him were
                    incorporated with the department of the comptroller of the navy, who had a few
                    years before superseded the more limited surveyor of the navy; the office of
                    comptroller of victualling was also modified, and the work of his department was
                    incorporated with that of the Admiralty generally, under the control of the sea
                    lord. The business of purchase and sale for each of the five departments was at
                    the same time concentrated in one purchase department under a director of navy
                    contracts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Victualling establishments.—</hi> At each of the dockyards at
                    Deptford, Portsmouth, and Plymouth are victualling establishments for supplying
                    the fleet with provisions and water; and also at Cork, Cape of Good Hope,
                    Gibraltar, Malta, Jamaica, Halifax, Trincomalee, Rio de Janeiro, Barbados,
                    Sierra Leone, Hong Kong, Valparaiso, and Bermuda. The victualling board at
                    Somerset House consisted formerly of a chairman and deputy chairman, and five
                    other commissioners, two secretaries, a registrar of securities, and 136
                    clerks.</p>
                <p>The transport board having been dissolved at the end of the great French war, its
                    twofold duties were divided between the navy and victualling boards; those which
                    concerned the hiring of transports devolved on the commissioners of the navy,
                    and those which related to the sick and hurt department, on the commissioners of
                    the victualling board, on whom also devolved the direction and superintendence
                    of all the naval hospitals at home and abroad. These have also merged in the
                    Admiralty, where there is a transport department under the supervision of a
                    director of transports,— a naval officer, first appointed after the Crimean
                    war.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Officers of the dockyard.—</hi> The principal officers of an
                    established dockyard, prior to 1833, were—1, the commissioner; 2, the master
                    attendant; 3, the master shipwright; 4, the clerk of the check; 5, the
                    storekeeper; 6, the clerk of the survey; to which were added the subordinate
                    officers of timber-master, and the master measurer. By the regulations in 1833,
                    the commissioner was superseded by a superintendent, the offices of clerk of the
                    check, clerk of the survey, and master measurer were abolished, and a
                    store-receiver was substituted for the timber-master. Many subordinate offices
                    were abolished, and the whole system of working the men and keeping the accounts
                    was simplified and amended. Some idea may be formed of the diminution of the
                    expense by the simple fact that, while in the ordinary estimate of the navy for
                    1817 the establishment of officers in Portsmouth yard was £50,065, in 1833 it
                    was only £19,803, and in 1853, £20,121. To this last, however, must be added the
                    salaries of officers employed in the steam factory, which amounted to £2555. The
                    principal officers in the factory are—1, the chief engineer and inspector of
                    machinery; 2, his assistant; 3, assistant inspector of machinery; 4, foreman of
                    the factory; 5, foreman of boilermakers; 6, pay-clerk and book-keeper.</p>
                <p>At one time the men in the dockyards were employed almost wholly on job and
                    task-work. Between 1850 and the present time they have been almost wholly on a
                    day pay smaller than that given in the general trade, but having a title to a
                    pension, contingently upon good service and good behaviour, attached to it. In
                    1869 Mr Childers cut down to a considerable extent the “establishment” system of
                    dockyardmen, replaced the vacancies with hired men on higher pay, but without a
                    title to pension, and with the usual liability to discharge at a week’s notice
                    when work is slack. The salary system, with its concomitant vested interests,
                    was not found to be productive of quick and therefore of economical work. Mr
                    Childers’s alteration improved matters not a little, but job and taskwork,
                    besides being more in accordance with the usages of the day, is far more likely
                    to interest and stimulate the men. One great advantage, however, of the salary
                    system is the discouragement it gives to strikes. The conditions under which
                    alone pensions are earned act as deterrents.</p>
                <p>In ordinary years the number of workmen of all kinds required for the service of
                    the dockyards is, in round numbers, 16,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Defence of the yards.—</hi> In the year 1847 the workmen of the
                    several dockyards were enrolled into a corps for the defence of the yards; and
                    certain numbers were trained to the use of the great gun exercise, so that each
                    of the dockyard battalions had some artillery attached to them. In 1854 the
                    corps fell into desuetude, and was finally swallowed up in the volunteer
                    movement.</p>
