                    were seconded by a friend obtaining a “bourse” for the young Desmoulins, who at
                    the age of fourteen left home for Paris, and entered the college of Louis le
                    Grand. In this school, in which Robespierre was also a bursar and a
                    distinguished student, Camille laid the solid foundation of his learning, and
                    made an acquaintance with the literature and history of the classical nations so
                    deep and extensive that it furnished him throughout the whole of his short and
                    chequered life with illustrations which he applied with brilliancy and effect to
                    the social manners and political events of his time.</p>
                <p>Desmoulins having been destined by his father for the law, and having completed
                    his legal studies, was admitted an advocate of the Parliament of Paris in 1785.
                    His professional success was not great; his manner was violent, his appearance
                    far from attractive, and his speech was impaired by the natural defect of a
                    painful stammer. He indulged and fostered, however, his love for literature, he
                    was closely observant of the course of public affairs, and he was thus gradually
                    being prepared for the main duties of his life—those of a political <hi
                    rend="italic">littérateur.</hi></p>
                <p>In March 1789 Desmoulins began his political career. Having been nominated deputy
                    from the bailiwick of Guise, he appeared at Laon as one of the commissioners for
                    the election of deputies to the States General summoned by royal edict of 24th
                    January. Camille heralded its meeting by his <hi rend="italic">Ode to the States
                    General.</hi> It is, moreover, highly probable that he was the author of a
                    radical pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">La Philosophie au peuple
                    Français.</hi> His hopes of professional success were now scattered, and he was
                    living in Paris in extreme poverty and almost in squalor. He, however, shared to
                    the full the excitement which attended the meeting of the States General. As
                    appears from his letters to his father, he watched with exultation the
                    procession of deputies at Versailles, and with violent indignation the events of
                    the latter part of June which followed the closing of the Salle des Menus to the
                    deputies who had named themselves the National Assembly. It is further evident
                    that Desmoulins was already sympathizing, not only with the enthusiasm, but also
                    with the fury and cruelty, of the Parisian crowds.</p>
                <p>The sudden dismissal of Necker by Louis was the event which brought Desmoulins to
                    fame. On the 12th of July 1789 Camille, leaping upon a table in one of the cafés
                    of the Palais Royal, startled a numerous crowd of listeners by the announcement
                    of the dismissal of their favourite. Losing in his violent excitement the
                    stammer which impeded his ordinary speech, he inflamed the passions of the mob
                    by his burning words and his call “To arms !” “This dismissal,” he said, “is the
                    tocsin of the St Bartholomew of the patriots.” Drawing, at last, two pistols
                    from under his coat, he declared that he would not fall alive into the hands of
                    the police who were watching his movements. He descended amid the embraces of
                    the crowd, and his cry “To arms !” resounded on all sides. This scene was the
                    beginning of the actual events of the Revolution. Following Desmoulins the crowd
                    surged through Paris, procuring arms by force; and on the 13th it was partly
                    organized as the Parisian militia which was afterwards to be the National Guard.
                    On the 14th the Bastille was taken.</p>
                <p>Desmoulins may be said to have begun on the following day that public literary
                    career which lasted till his death. In May and June 1789 he had written <hi
                    rend="italic">La France</hi><hi rend="italic">libre,</hi> which, to his chagrin,
                    his publisher refused to print. The taking of the Bastille, however, and the
                    events by which it was preceded, were a sign that the times had changed; and on
                    the 15th of July Desmoulins’s work was issued. It attracted immediate attention.
                    By its erudite, brilliant, and courageous examination of the rights of king, of
                    nobles, of clergy, and of people, it attained a wide and sudden popularity; it
                    secured for the author the friendship and protection of Mirabeau, and the
                    studied abuse of numerous royalist pamphleteers. Shortly afterwards, with his
                    vanity and love of popularity inflamed, he pandered to the passions of the lower
                    orders by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Discours</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">lanterne aux Parisiens,</hi> which
                    with an almost fiendish reference to the excesses of the mob he headed by a
                    quotation from St John, <hi rend="italic">Qui</hi><hi rend="italic">male</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">agit odit lucem.</hi> Camille was dubbed “Procureur-général de la
                    lanterne.”</p>
                <p>In November 1789 Desmoulins began his career as a journalist by the issue of the
                    first number of a weekly publication— <hi rend="italic">Révolutions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de France</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Brabant.</hi> He conducted this alone till July 1790, and thereafter with the
                    assistance of Stanislas Fréron till July 1792, when the publication ceased.
                    Success attended the <hi rend="italic">Révolutions</hi> from its first to its
                    last number, Camille was everywhere famous, and his poverty was relieved. These
                    numbers are valuable as an exhibition not so much of events as of the feelings
                    of the Parisian people during the most stormy period of their history; they are
                    adorned, moreover, by the erudition, the wit, and the genius of the author, but
                    they are disfigured, not only by the most biting personalities and the defence
                    and even advocacy of the excesses of the mob, but by the entire absence of the
                    forgiveness and <pb break="no"

                    eloquently to plead.</p>
                <p>Desmoulins had now become an acknowledged leader of public opinion. Its sudden
                    changes suited his fickle temperament, and form the only excuse for the glaring
                    inconsistencies which disfigure his published writings. Mirabeau, for instance,
                    whose genius and hospitality he had frequently and openly lauded, he afterwards
                    thought fit to denounce as the “god of orators, liars, and thieves.” He was
                    powerfully swayed by the influence of more vigorous minds; and for some time
                    before the death of Mirabeau, in April 1791, he had begun to be led by Danton,
                    with whom he remained associated during the rest of his life. In July 1791
                    Camille appeared before the municipality of Paris as head of a deputation of
                    petitioners for the deposition of the king. In that month, however, such a
                    request was dangerous; there was excitement in the city over the presentation of
                    the petition, and the private attacks to which Desmoulins had often been subject
                    were now followed by a warrant for the arrest of himself and Danton. Danton left
                    Paris for a little; Desmoulins, however, remained there, appearing occasionally
                    at the Jacobins club. He resigned his functions as a journalist, and the issue
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Révolutions</hi> ceased.</p>
                <p>Three months afterwards, however, he again appeared in public, having been
                    appointed secretary to the Society of the Friends of the Constitution. His
                    second attempt at journalism was made in April and May 1792, in the issue of
                    several numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Patriotes,</hi> but success did not attend the effort, and it was in his
                    pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Jean Pierre</hi><hi rend="italic">Brissot
                    démasqué,</hi> which abounded in the most violent personalities, that Desmoulins
                    again secured the eager attention of the public. This pamphlet, which had its
                    origin in a petty squabble, was followed in 1793 by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragment</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >histoire secrète de la Révolution,</hi> in which the party of the Gironde, and
                    specially Brissot, were most mercilessly attacked.</p>
                <p>On the nomination of Danton, after the excesses of the 10th of August 1792, to
                    the post of minister of justice, Desmoulins was appointed his secretary general.
                    On September the 8th he was elected one of the deputies for Paris to the lately
                    created National Convention. He was not successful as an orator. He was of the
                    party of “the Mountain,” and voted for the abolition of royalty and the death of
                    the king. With Robespierre he was now more than ever associated, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Brissotins,</hi> the fragment
                    above alluded to, was inspired by the archrevolutionist. The success of the <hi
                    rend="italic">brochure,</hi> so terrible as to send the leaders of the Gironde
                    to the guillotine, alarmed Danton and the author. Not so with Robespierre; and
                    the split was formed which was to end in the ruin of the Dantonists.</p>
                <p>In December 1793 was issued the first number of the <hi rend="italic">Vieux
                    Cordelier,</hi> by which Danton’s idea of a committee of clemency was formulated
                    and upheld. From the first Robespierre, although revising the sheets,
                    disapproved of it, and at the fifth number the actual rupture became visible.
                    Robespierre took advantage of the popular indignation roused against the
                    Hébertists to send them to death, but the time had come when Saint Just and he
                    were to turn their attention not only to <hi rend="italic">les enragés,</hi> but
                    to <hi rend="italic">les</hi><hi rend="italic">indulgents</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> the powerful faction of the Dantonists. On the 7th of January 1794
                    Robespierre, who on a former occasion had defended Camille when in danger at the
                    hands of the National Assembly, in addressing the Jacobins club counselled not
                    the expulsion of Desmoulins, but the burning of certain numbers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vieux Cordelier.</hi> Camille sharply replied that he would answer
                    with Rousseau,—“burning is not answering,” and a bitter quarrel thereupon
                    ensued. By the end of March not only were Hébert and the leaders of the extreme
                    party guillotined, but their opponents, Danton, Desmoulins, and the best of the
                    moderates were arrested. On the 31st the warrant of arrest was signed and
                    executed, and on the 3d, 4th, and 5th of April the trial took place before the
                    Revolutionary Tribunal. It was a scene of terror not only to the accused but to
                    judges and to jury. The retorts of the prisoners were notable. Camille on being
                    asked his age, replied, “I am thirty-three, the age of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sans-culotte</hi> Jesus, a critical age for every patriot.” This was false; he
                    was thirty-four.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                    borne out by the register of his birth and baptism, and by words in his last
                    letter to his wife,—“I die at thirty-four.” The dates (1762-94) given in nearly
                    every biography of Desmoulins are certainly inaccurate.</p></note> Tinville,
                    alarmed at the eloquence of Danton, procured from the Committee of Public Safety
                    a decree which closed the mouths of the accused. Armed with this and the false
                    report of a spy who charged the wife of Desmoulins with conspiring for the
                    escape of her husband and the ruin of the republic, Tinville by threats and
                    beseechings at last obtained from the jury a sentence of death. It was passed in
                    absence of the accused, and their execution was appointed for the same day.</p>
                <p>Since his arrest the courage of Camille had miserably failed. He had exhibited in
                    the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Vieux Cordelier</hi> almost a disregard of
                    the death which he must have known hovered over him. He had with consummate
                    ability exposed the terrors of the Revolution, and had adorned his pages with
                    illustrations from Tacitus, the force of which the commonest reader could feel.
                    In his last number, the seventh, which his publisher refused to print, he had
                    dared to attack even Robespierre, but at his trial it was found that he was
                    devoid of physical courage. He had to be torn from his seat ere he was removed
                    to prison, and as he sat next to Danton in the tumbrel which conveyed them to
                    the guillotine, the calmness of the great leader failed to impress him. In his
                    violence, bound as he was, he tore his clothes into shreds, and his bare
                    shoulders and breast were exposed to the gaze of the surging crowd. Of the
                    fifteen guillotined together, including among them Hérault de Séchelles,
                    Westermann, and Philippeaux, Desmoulins died third; Danton, the greatest, died
                    last. With them also died the hope of the Revolution. But a few months were to
                    pass ere it was to be solemnly decreed that they had “deserved well of
                    humanity.”</p>
                <p>On the 29th of December 1790, Camille had married Lucile Duplessis, and among the
                    witnesses of the ceremony are observed the names of Brissot, Pétion, and
                    Robespierre. The only child of the marriage, Horace-Camille, was born on the 6th
                    of July 1792. Two days afterwards Desmoulins brought it into notice by appearing
                    with it before the municipality of Paris to demand “the formal statement of the
                    civil estate of his son.” The boy was afterwards pensioned by the French
                    Government. Lucile, Desmoulins’s accomplished and affectionate wife was, a few
                    days after her husband, and on a false charge, condemned to the guillotine. She
                    astonished all onlookers by the calmness with which she braved death.</p>
