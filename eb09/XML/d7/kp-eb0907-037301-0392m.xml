                    excesses of the period; but, owing doubtless to the nobler qualities which he
                    none the less displayed, the graceful scapegrace found more favour with the
                    public than the rest of the dissolute crew. He was high-spirited, generous, and
                    humane; as years passed on his character ripened and refined, and he who had
                    been the worthy rival of Charles II. lived to be laughed at by Etherege for
                    fidelity to his wife. Though present as a volunteer under the duke of York
                    during the Dutch war in 1665, and afterwards sent on more than one mission to
                    the court of France, he took comparatively an unimportant part in politics until
                    the commencement of the troubles which ended in the Revolution of 1688. Deprived
                    in 1667 of his office as lord-lieutenant of Sussex, for his refusal to comply
                    with James H.’s arbitrary demands, he soon after became one of the active
                    members of the opposition, and in 1688 assisted the flight of the Princess Anne.
                    After James had left the country, Dorset was a member of the council for the
                    preservation of the public peace; and on William’s accession he was appointed
                    lord chamberlain. Tn 1691 he accompanied the new king to Holland; and, though he
                    was afterwards involved in the accusations of infidelity brought forward by
                    Preston, he retained and deserved the royal favour to the last. He died at Bath
                    in January 1705-6, and was succeeded in the earldom by Lionel Cranfield
                    Sackville, his only son by his second wife, Mary, daughter of James Compton,
                    earl of Essex. Dorset keeps his place in the list of English poets in virtue of
                    a few lyrical and satirical pieces, which, though extravagantly praised by his
                    contemporaries, and, even according to Macaulay, displaying the easy vigour of
                    Suckling and wit as splendid as that of Butler, are after all of no great moment
                    in themselves, and only suggestive of what in happier circumstances the writer
                    might have done. The best known is a pleasant careless song— <hi rend="italic"
                    >To all you Ladies now at Land—</hi> written at sea shortly before the
                    engagement with the Dutch, in which Admiral Opdam’s ship was blown up. As a
                    patron of literature, however, Dorset stands unrivalled,—judicious, impartial,
                    and munificent. To him Prior was indebted for his education, Montague for
                    promotion, and Wycherly for support against the disfavour of the public. Though
                    compelled as lord chamberlain to deprive Dryden of his official laurel, he took
                    care to make good from his private purse the pecuniary loss involved in the
                    dismissal.</p>
