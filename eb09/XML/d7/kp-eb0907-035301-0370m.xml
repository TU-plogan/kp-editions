                <p><label type="entry">DOMINIC</label>, Sτ, founder of the Dominican order of monks,
                    was born at Calahorra, a village of Old Castile, in 1170. His family name is
                    said to have been Guzman, an illustrious name connected with many of the most
                    honourable families in Spain. Little is known of his father and mother, but in
                    the mediaeval legends his birth is surrounded with portents indicative of his
                    future greatness. His mother dreamed she gave birth to a boy with a torch in his
                    mouth, which set the world on fire. At his baptism a new sign was given. A
                    starry radiance encircled the baptismal font. His followers delighted to
                    recognize a similar radiance in his countenance, which drew all hearts to him.
                    His childhood gave evidence of his future devotion and self-denial. He used to
                    creep from his bed and prostrate himself on the hard boards. At seven years of
                    age he quitted the paternal home for the house of his uncle, who was a
                    churchman, and gave him his first lessons in divine things. At fifteen he went
                    to the university of Palencia, afterwards translated to Salamanca, where it
                    attained reputation as the most famous university in Spain. He applied himself
                    to letters and philosophy, but above all to theology,—opening his mind,
                    according to one of his biographers, to the true knowledge, and his ears to the
                    doctrines, of Holy Scripture. Two stories are told of him at this time, showing
                    the intensity of his character, and indicating the future zealot in behalf of
                    religion and the church. He sold his clothes to feed the poor in a time of
                    famine, and, to a woman who complained that her brother had been made a slave by
                    the Moors, he offered himself to be given in exchange. His career as a student
                    is obscure. He appears to have remained at the university for about ten years,
                    and it is only in 1195, when he was twenty-five years of age, that he begins to
                    emerge into notice. He is then one of the canons of Osma, under the guidance of
                    a new and zealous bishop, wſhose heart was full of extending the power of the
                    church and reforming its abuses. He gradually became known by his fervour as a
                    preacher and the severity of his austerities, although it was still nearly ten
                    years later before the opportunity came for him to show his true character and
                    abilities. In 1203 the bishop of Osma was delegated to negotiate the marriage of
                    Alphonso VIII, of Castile with a Danish princess, and for this he undertook a
                    journey to Denmark with Dominic as his companion. Accustomed to the obedience
                    and reverence everywhere paid to the clergy in Spain, a very different spectacle
                    presented itself to them as soon as they crossed the Pyrenees, and found
                    themselves in the plains and cities of Languedoc. There a new spirit—half
                    poetical and half spiritual—had sprung up in opposition to the church. The
                    Provençal poets found much of their <hi rend="subscript"> χ</hi> inspiration in
                    a prevailing excitement at the worldly vices and corruptions of the clergy, as
                    well as in the chivalric loves and gaieties of their time. And in addition to
                    the poets there had arisen in this interesting and beautiful country multitudes
                    of preachers of a new, more simple, and more liberal faith. Peter de Brueys and
                    Henry the Deacon became the organs of popular indignation against the
                    superstitious observances which the priests everywhere encouraged,—the worship
                    of the cross, transubstantiation, prayers, alms, and oblations to the dead, and
                    even infant baptism,—for, as in all such cases of popular movement, the church
                    was attacked not merely in its abuses but in its essential rites and its very
                    existence. The “Poor Men of Lyons” rejected the whole church system, and
                    permitted women to officiate at the altars. The “Paulicians,” a sect of
                    Manichaeans surviving from the 5th century, had spread from the East through the
                    Greek provinces of Sicily and Italy, and settled amongst the other elements of
                    disturbance in the south of France. “It was discovered,” as Gibbon says (c. 54),
                    “that many thousand Catholics of every rank and of either sex had embraced the
                    Manichaean heresy;” and the flames consumed twelve canons of Orleans supposed to
                    be tainted with the heresy. “The same vicissitudes of martyrdom and revenge as
                    had been displayed in the East were repeated in the 13 th century on the banks
                    of the Rhone.” The result of all was a state of heretical insurrection and
                    confusion sufficiently startling to men like St Dominic or even St Bernard, who
                    has left us a description of what he himself observed—“Churches without people,
                    the people without priests, priests without respect, Christians without Christ,
                    holy places denied to be holy, the sacraments no longer sacred, and holy days
                    without their solemnities.” (Quoted by Milman, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Latin
                    Christianity,</hi> iv. 178.)</p>
                <p>In such a country, and in such a state of things, St Dominic found his mission as
                    a champion of the church añd a preacher of Catholic truth. Painfully impressed
                    by what he saw on his journey to Denmark, he was so aroused by the spectacle of
                    abounding heresy on his return that he resolved to devote himself to the
                    conversion of the inhabitants, and the revival of the church in a land which
                    appeared to him so given over to evil. The Pope had sent legates thither for the
                    correction and repression of the heretics, but after a year’s labours they had
                    met with no success, and were on their way back to report the failure of their
                    mission at Rome. Dominic met with them on his journey, and, struck at once by
                    their splendid retinue and their failure, he exclaimed,—“How can you expect
                    success with all this secular pomp? These men cannot be touched by words without
                    corresponding deeds. The heretics deceive them by their simplicity. You must
                    throw aside all your splendour, and go forth, as the disciples of old, barefoot,
                    without purse or scrip, to proclaim the truth.” He acted without delay on his
                    own principle, and betook himself to the profession of a mendicant preacher.
                    Even the legates were shamed for a time to follow in the wake of the
                    enthusiastic Spaniard. But their enthusiasm did not last long, and Dominic w as
                    left alone in his self-denying labours.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to describe with any fidelity the character of St Dominic’s
                    career, which his mediaeval biographers have enveloped in a haze of miraculous
                    exaggeration. Apparently at first he confined himself in the main to moral and
                    intellectual influences, preaching against the heretical errors, and inviting
                    the heretics to conferences and reasonings. His modern biographer, Lacordaire,
                    has even ventured to compare this early phase of his work with St Paul’s
                    conferences with the Jews, and St Augustine’s expostulations w ith the Donatists
                    and Manichaeans. His arguments were of course powerfully enforced by miraculous
                    tokens when otherwise likely to fail of their purpose. Wherever he moved the
                    glory of the supernatural ïnoved with him. Signs and portents, most of them too
                    trivial and absurd for mention, gave emphasis to his preaching and triumph to
                    his mission. But withal the success that awaited him as a preacher was
                    disappointing; and the flames of war, kindled by the growing antagonism of the
                    sects and the church, and fomented by the rival ambitions which are always at
                    hand to make use of the fury of religious passion, soon swept over the country,
                    and hid from <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0371-0354"/> view the figure of the missionary and the
                    preacher. It was, as Milman says, a stubborn generation, which, besides
                    preaching, argument, and miracles, needed the sword of Simon de Montfort to cure
                    it of its heresies. The atrocious crusade known as the Albigensian war, the
                    violent incident and picturesque display of character on both sides, the
                    pleasant, vacillating, and humiliated Count Raymond, the intrepid and
                    bloodthirsty Montfort,—all belong to history rather than to the life of Dominic.
                    What part he really played in the war evades clear historical judgment. Did he
                    share in its atrocities, as religious zealots in similar cases have often done,
                    or did he mourn the interruption of his peaceful labours of conversion, and
                    preach moderation to the conquerors, as well as penitence to the heretics? Facts
                    fail us in the matter. All that is known is that he remained through all the
                    friend of De Montfort, and obeyed the call to bless the marriage of his sons and
                    the baptism of his daughter. This implies that the darker features of the
                    crusade, and the conduct of its leader, awakened no such horror in him as they
                    ought to have done; aud when to this is added the glory (!) claimed for him of
                    instituting the Holy Inquisition, the light which is thus thrown upon his
                    character is far from pleasing. It is in no spirit of apostolic mildness,
                    certainly, that he at last left the country in 1217, after the death of De
                    Montfort. <hi rend="italic">“For</hi> many years,” he says, “I have spoken to
                    you with tenderness, with prayers, and tears, but, according to the proverb of
                    my country, where the benediction has no effect the rod may have much. Behold
                    now we rouse up against you princes and prelates, nations and kingdoms, and many
                    shall preach by the sword.” This was a poor gospel for a people already
                    decimated by the armies of the church, and the preacher of it was certainly no
                    apostle of peace. Full of enthusiasm, of eloquence, of dogmatic zeal, with a
                    genius for combination and the great power of inspiring devotion in his
                    followers, Dominic fails in the higher virtues of patience, magnanimity,
                    reasonableness, and moderation. He is a prince of the church, but not a saint
                    save in its official calendar.</p>
                <p>On leaving Languedoc Dominic repaired to Rome, and spent the remainder of his
                    life in the organization of his order, which received the papal sanction in
                    1216, and which, under his generalship, had extended in the course of five years
                    throughout most of the countries of Europe. He died at Bologna in 1221, in the
                    fifty-first year of his age. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Dominicans.</hi><hi
