                <p><label type="entry">DINARCHUS</label> (Δ∈Aαpχoς), the orator, son of Sostratus,
                    was born at Corinth about 361 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Ok 104, 4). Thus,
                    like at least one greater member of the decade, Lysias, this last of the ten
                    Attic orators was not an Athenian citizen. But his career at Athens, as a
                    resident alien, was at least commenced early in life. When not more than
                    twenty-five, he was already active as a writer of speeches for the law courts.
                    He had been the pupil both of Theophrastus and of Demetrius Phalereus, and had
                    early gained a certain fluent force, and a versatile command of style, which
                    gave him some oratorical repute. His first important contact with public life
                    was in 324 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Areopagus, after inquiry, reported
                    that nine men had taken bribes from Harpalus, the fugitive treasurer of
                    Alexander. Ten public prosecutors were appointed. Dinarchus wrote, for one or
                    more of these prosecutors, the three speeches which are still extant—one
                    “Against Demosthenes,” one “Against Aristogiton,” one “Against Philocles.” The
                    authenticity of the speech against Demosthenes was indeed denied by Demetrius of
                    Magnesia, chiefly on the ground that it is largely composed of matter taken from
                    AEschines. Westermann went further, and doubted the genuineness of all three
                    speeches. But Schäfer—who justly remarks that the absence of originality and of
                    character is itself characteristic of Dinarchus—is probably right in accepting
                    the general opinion that they are authentic.</p>
                <p>It must always be borne in mind that Dinarchus was a Corinthian, a mere resident
                    alien at Athens, whose sympathies were in favour of an Athenian oligarchy under
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n260/mode/1up"

                    far as we know of it, engages our respect or esteem, his position must at least
                    be broadly distinguished from that of such a man as Aeschines, an Athenian
                    citizen who, while his city could still be saved, abetted its enemies—or from
                    that of such a hireling as Demades. In the Harpalus affair, Demosthenes was,
                    beyond all reasonable doubt, innocent, and so, probably, were others of the
                    accused. Yet Hyperides, the most fiery of the patriots, was on the same side as
                    Dinarchus.</p>
                <p>Under the regency—for such it really was—of his old master, Demetrius Phalereus,
                    Dinarchus had much political influence. The years 317-306 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> were the most prosperous of his life. On the fall of Demetrius
                    Phalereus, Dinarchus withdrew into exile at Chalcis in Eubaea. About 292 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he ventured to return to Attica, and took up his
                    abode with a former associate, Proxenus, in the country, against whom he
                    afterwards brought an action, on the ground that Proxenus had robbed him of some
                    money and plate which he had brought with him. He died at Athens, at the age of
                    about seventy, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about 291 B.c.</p>
                <p>Dionysius held that, out of 85 extant speeches bearing the name of Dinarchus, 58
                    were genuine,—28 in public causes, 30 in private causes. In addition to the
                    three speeches above mentioned, we have scanty fragments of 88 more which
                    passed, with at least some authors, under his name. The number need not surprise
                    us, when, we remember that Suidas speaks of 160 speeches of Dinarchus, and
                    (following Caecilius probably) allows 60 as genuine. No orator of the Attic
                    decade had so little of an individual style, and to no other, consequently, was
                    alien work so largely ascribed by the Alexandrian critics. Dinarchus imitated by
                    turns the style of Lysias, of Hyperides, of Demosthenes. As Dionysius says of
                    him, <hi rend="italic">ovFev</hi><hi rend="italic">ovτe κoιrou oυτ ιδιov
                    eσχεu,</hi> he had no general stamp of his own, no distinctive trait. He was
                    neither an inventor, like Lysias, Isocrates, and Isaeus, nor a perfecter like
                    AEschines, Hyperides, and Demosthenes. He is called by Hermogenes ó <hi

                    taken either from barley compared with wheat, or, better perhaps, from beer
                    compared with wine,—a Demosthenes whose strength is rougher, and who has neither
                    the flavour nor the sparkle.</p>
