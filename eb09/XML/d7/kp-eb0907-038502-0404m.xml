                    >Demoiselle),</hi> the popular English name applied to the members of a
                    remarkable group of insects which formed the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libellula</hi> of Linnaeus and the ancient authors. In some parts of the United
                    States they appear to be known as “Devil’s Darning Needles,” and in many parts
                    of England are .termed “Horse-stingers.” It is almost needless to say that
                    (excepting to other insects upon which they prey) they are perfectly innocuous,
                    though some of the larger species can inflict a momentarily painful bite with
                    their powerful jaws. Their systematic position is at present contested and
                    somewhat uncertain. By most of the older systematists they were placed as
                    forming part of the heterogeneous order <hi rend="italic">Neuroptera.</hi>
                    Fabricius, however, elevated them to the rank of a distinct order, which he
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Odonata;</hi> and whatever may be the difference of
                    opinion amongst authors at the present day, that term is almost universally
                    employed for the group. Erichson transferred all the groups of so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi> with incomplete metamorphoses, hence including the
                    dragon-flies, as a division of <hi rend="italic">Orthcpteτa,</hi> which he
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Neuroptera.</hi> Gerstäcker more recently also
                    retains them in the <hi rend="italic">Orthoρtera,</hi> terming those groups in
                    which the earlier states are sub-aquatic <hi rend="italic">Orthoptera
                    amphibiotica.</hi> It is not necessary to enter into an examination here of the
                    merits or demerits of those various systems, and it will suffice to say that all
                    are agreed in maintaining the insects as forming a group marked by characters at
                    once extraordinary and isolated in their nature.</p>
                <p>The group <hi rend="italic">Odonata</hi> (using the term as a matter of
                    convenience) is divided into three families, and each of these again into two
                    sub-families. The families are the <hi rend="italic">Agrionidae,
                    Aeschnidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Libellulidae,—</hi> the first including
                    the sub-families <hi rend="italic">Calopterygina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agrionina,</hi> the second <hi rend="italic">Gomphina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeschnina,</hi> and the third <hi rend="italic">Cordulina</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Libellulina.</hi></p>
                <p>The structure of a dragon-fly being so very remarkable, it is necessary to enter
                    somewhat extensively into details. The head is comparatively small, and
                    excavated posteriorly, connected very slightly with the prothorax, on which it
                    turns almost as on a pivot. The eyes are, as a rule, enormous, often contiguous,
                    and occupying nearly the whole of the upper surface of the head, but sometimes
                    <hi rend="italic">(Agrionidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gomphina)</hi> widely
                    distant; occupied by innumerable facets, which are often larger on the upper
                    portion. In front of them is a portion termed the vertex, which sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Libellulidae)</hi> forms a swollen vesicle, before which are
                    placed the three very small ocelli, and on either side of which are inserted the
                    antennae, which are smaller in proportion than in almost any other insects,
                    consisting only of two short swollen basal joints and a 5 or 6-jυinted
                    bristle-like thread. The front of the head is vertical, and consists of a large,
                    often dilated upper portion, which is commonly termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nasus,</hi> followed by a tranverse portion termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhinarium,</hi> and this again by the large labrum, which conceals the jaws and
                    inner mouth parts. The lower lip, or labium, is attached to a very small chin
                    piece (or mentum), and is generally very large, often <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Agrionidae)</hi> divided almost to its base into two portions, or more
                    frequently entire or nearly so; on each side of it are two usually enormous
                    hypertrophied pieces, which form the “palpi,” and which are often furnished at
                    the tips with an articulated spine (or terminal joint), the whole structure
                    serving to retain the prey. Considerable diversity of opinion exists <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0405-0386"/> with respect to the composition of the mouth
                    parts, and by some authors the “palpi” have been termed the side pieces of the
                    lower lip. In a dead dragon-fly the parts are closed on each other, and, for a
                    just appreciation of their structure and power, it is necessary to take a living
                    example in the fingers by the thorax, slight lateral pressure on which causes
                    the insect to display the formidable arrangement. The prothorax is extremely
                    small, consisting of only a narrow ring, the upper portion of which is often
                    elevated into lobes. The rest of the thorax is very large, and consolidated into
                    a single piece, with oblique sutures on the sides beneath the wings; the portion
                    in front of the wings is extremely robust, and offers a median carina or suture
                    above, and a broad transverse sinus posteriorly· The inter-alar portion is
                    somewhat excavated, and on each side of it above are nodosities forming the
                    attachments of the powerful muscles that work the wings; on each side is a large
                    and distinct spiracle. The abdomen varies excessively in form, the two extremes
                    being the filiform structure observable in most <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agrionidae,</hi> and the very broad and depressed formation seen in our
                    familiar <hi rend="italic">Libellula</hi><hi rend="italic">depressa.</hi> It
                    consists of ten distinct segments, whereof the basal two and those at the apex
                    are short, the others elongate, the first being excessively short. In a slit on
                    the under side of the second in the male, accompanied by external protuberances,
                    are concealed the genital organs: on the under side of the eighth in the female
                    is a scale-like formation, indicating the entrance to the oviduct. The tenth is
                    always provided in both sexes with prominent appendages, differing greatly in
                    form, and often furnishing the best specific (and even generic) characters; by
                    some authors these appendages are considered as representing a modified eleventh
                    segment. The basal segments often have additional transverse sutures, and in the
                    common triquetrous abdomen there is a fine longitudinal dorsal carina, and
                    prominent lateral angles; invariably the ventral surface has a longitudinal
                    membranous space connecting the here divided chitinous portion of the external
                    skeleton. The legs vary in length and stoutness, but may, as a rule, be termed
                    long and slender, and in a measure that appears disproportionate to the
                    necessities of the insect; for a dragon-fly can scarcely be said to walk after
                    the short promenade it takes on emerging from its puparium. The anterior pair
                    probably assist in capturing and holding its insect prey, but the greatest
                    service all the legs render is possibly in enabling the creature to rest
                    lightly, so that it can quit a position of repose in chase of passing prey in
                    the quickest possible manner, in which the majority of the species are aided
                    also by the horizontally extended wings. The coxa is short and stout, followed
                    by a still shorter trochanter; the femora and tibiae long and slender, almost
                    invariably furnished on their under surface with two series of strong spines, as
                    also are the tarsi, which consist of three slender joints, the last having two
                    long and slender claws, usually (but not invariably) with a small tooth
                    internally below the tips; the palms are absent or nearly so, and naturally are
                    not necessary in a non-ambulatory insect. The wings are always elongate, and
                    furnished with strong longitudinal neuration and dense transverse nervules
                    strengthening the already strong (although typically transparent) membrane. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Agrionidae</hi> both pairs are nearly equal, and are
                    carried vertically and longitudinally in repose, and the neuration and membrane
                    are less strong; hence the species of this family are not so powerful on the
                    wing as are those of the other groups in which the wings are horizontally
                    extended in a position ready for instant service. The neuration is peculiar, and
                    in many respects without precise analogy in other groups of insects, but it is
                    not necessary here to enter into more than some special points. On the costal
                    margin (excepting in some <hi rend="italic">Caloy&gt;terygina)</hi> there is a
                    small dark space limited by nervules,termed the pterostigma; and between this
                    and the base of the wing is a point termed the “nodus,” at which the sub-costal
                    nervure is suddenly arrested. The arrangement of the nervures at the base of the
                    wing is very singular, and slight differences in it form useful aids to
                    classification. In the <hi rend="italic">Aeschnidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libellulidae</hi> this arrangement results in the formation of a triangular
                    space (known as the “triangle ”), which is either open or traversed by nervules;
                    but in many <hi rend="italic">Agrionidae</hi> this space, instead of being
                    triangular, is oblong or elongately quadrate, or with its upper edge partly
                    straight and partly oblique. This fixitude of type in neuration is not one of
                    the least important of the many peculiarities exhibited in these insects.</p>
                <p>The internal structure is comparatively simple. The salivary glands appear to be
                    absent, and the whole digestive apparatus consists of an elongate canal
                    extending from mouth to anus, comprising the aesophagus, stomach, and intestine,
                    with certain dilatations and constrictions; the characteristic Malpighian
                    vessels are stated to number about forty, placed round the posterior extremity
                    of the stomach. Dragon-flies eat their prey completely, and do not content
                    themselves by merely sucking its juices; the harder portions are rejected as
                    elongate, nearb <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> dry, pellets of excrement.</p>
                <p>But the most extraordinary feature in the economy, —one which has attracted the
                    attention of naturalists from remote times,—is the position of the genital
                    organs, and the corresponding anomalous manner in which the pairing of the sexes
                    and impregnation is effected. In the male the intromittent organ is (as stated
                    above) situated in a slit on the under surface of the second abdominal segment;
                    it is usually very crooked or sinuous in form, and is accompanied by sheaths,
                    and by external hooks or secondary appendages, and also by seminal vessels. But
                    the ducts of the vessels connected with the testes unite and open on the
                    undersurface of the ninth segment; hence, before copulation can take place, it
                    is necessary that the vessels in the second segment be charged from this
                    opening, and in the majority of cases this is done by the male previously to
                    seeking the female. In the latter sex the entrance to the oviduct and genital
                    organs is on the under surface of the eighth abdominal segment. The act of
                    pairing may be briefly stated as follows. The male, when flying, seizes the
                    prothorax of the female with the strong appendages at the extremity of the
                    abdomen, and the abdomen of this latter sex is then curved upward so as to bring
                    the under side of the eighth segment into contact with the organs of the second
                    segment of the male. This act must have been observed by all, though but few
                    nonentomologists are acquainted with the reasons for this most extraordinary
                    position. In the more powerful <hi rend="italic">Libellulidae,</hi> &lt;fcc.,
                    the act is of short duration, and it is probable that polygamy and polyandry
                    exist, for it possibly requires more than one almost momentary act to fertilize
                    all the eggs in the ovaries of a female. But in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agrionidae,</hi> and in some others, the male keeps his hold of the prothorax
                    of the female for a lengthened period, retaining himself in flight in an almost
                    perpendicular manner, and it may be that the deposition of eggs and pairing goes
                    on alternately. There is, however, much yet to be learned on these points. The
                    gravid female usually lays her eggs in masses (but perhaps sometimes singly),
                    and the operation may be witnessed by any one in localities frequented by these
                    insects. She hovers for a considerable time over nearly the same spot, rapidly
                    dipping the apex of her abdomen into the water, or at any rate touching it, and
                    often in places where there are no water-weeds, so that in all probability the
                    eggs fall at once to the bottom. But in some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agrionidae</hi> the female has been often noticed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n406/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0406-0387"/> by trustworthy observers to creep down the steins
                    of aquatic plants several inches below the surface, emerging after the act of
                    oviposition has been effected; and. in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lestes</hi><hi rend="italic">sponsa,</hi> Von Siebold saw the male descend with
                    the female. The same exact observer noticed also in this species that the female
                    makes slight incisions in the stems or leaves of water plants with the double
                    serrated apparatus (vulva) forming a prolongation of the ninth segment beneath,
                    depositing an egg in each excision. He has seen two pairs thus occupied beneath
                    the surface on one and the same stem.</p>
                <p>The duration of the sub-aquatic life of a dragon-fly is no doubt variable,
                    according to the species. In the smaller forms it is probably less than a year,
                    but precise evidence is wanting as to the occurrence of two broods in one year.
                    On the other hand, it is certain that often a longer period is requisite to
                    enable the creature to attain its full growth, and three years have been stated
                    to be necessary for this in the large and powerful <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anax</hi><hi rend="italic">formosus.</hi> Like all insects with incomplete
                    metamorphoses, there is no quiescent pupal condition, no sharp line of
                    demarcation between the larval and so-called “nymph” or penultimate stage. The
                    creature goes on eating and increasing in size from the moment it emerges from
                    the egg to the time when it leaves the water to be transformed into the aerial
                    perfect insect. The number of moults is uncertain, but they are without doubt
                    numerous. At probably about the antepenultimate of these operations, the
                    rudimentary wings begin to appear as thoracic buddings, and in the full-grown
                    nymph these wings overlap about one-half of the dorsal surface of the abdomen.
                    In structure there is a certain amount of resemblance to the perfect insect, but
                    the body is always much stouter and shorter, in some cases most
                    disproportionately so, and the eyes are always separated; even in those genera
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aesclina)</hi> in which the eyes
                    of the imago are absolutely contiguous, the most that can bo seen in the larva
                    is a prolongation towards each other, and there are no ocelli. The legs are
                    shorter and more fitted for crawling about water plants and on the bottom. In
                    the mouth parts the mandibles and maxillae are similar in form to those of the
                    adult, but there is an extraordinary and unique modification of the lower lip.
                    This is attached to an elongate and slender mentum articulated to the posterior
                    portion of the lower surface of the head, slightly widened at its extremity, to
                    which is again articulated the labium proper, which is very large, flattened,
                    and gradually dilated to its extremity; but its form differs according to group
                    as in the perfect insect. Thus in the <hi rend="italic">Agrionidae</hi> it is
                    deeply cleft, and with comparatively slender sidepieces (or palpi), and strongly
                    developed articulated spines; in the <hi rend="italic">Aeschnidae</hi> it is at
                    the most notched, with narrow side-pieces and very strong spines; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Libellulidae</hi> it is entire, often triangular at its apex, and
                    with enormously developed palpi without spines, but having the opposing inner
                    edges furnished with interlocking serrations. The whole of this apparatus is
                    commonly termed the mask. In a state of repose it is applied closely against the
                    face, the elongated mentum directed backward and lying between the anterior pair
                    of legs; but when an approaching victim is seen the whole apparatus is suddenly
                    projected, and the prey caught by the raptorial palpi; in some large species it
                    is capable of being projected fully half an inch in front of the head. The prey,
                    once caught and held by this apparatus, is devoured in the usual manner. There
                    are two pairs of thoracic spiracles, but respiration is mostly affected by a
                    peculiar apparatus at the tail end, and <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Agrωnidce</hi> there are three elongate flattened plates, or false
                    gills, full of tracheal ramifications, which extract the air from the water, and
                    convey it to the internal tracheae (in <hi rend="italic">Calopteryx</hi> these
                    plates are excessively long, nearly equalling the abdomen), the plates also
                    serving as means of locomotion. But in the other groups these external false
                    gills are absent, and in their place are five valves, which by their sudden
                    opening and closing force in the water to the rectum, the walls of which are
                    furnished with branchial lamellae. The alternate opening and closing of these
                    valves enables the creature to make quick jerks or rushes (incorrectly termed
                    “leaps”) through the water,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    conjunction with its mouth parts, to make sudden attacks upon prey from a
                    considerable distance. The lateral angles of the terminal abdominal segments are
                    sometimes produced into long curved spines. In colour these larvae are generally
                    muddy, and they frequently have a coating of muddy particles, and hence are less
                    likely to be observed by their victims. If among insects the perfect dragon-fly
                    may be termed the tyrant of the air, so may its larva be styled that of the
                    water. Aquatic insects and larvae form the principal food, but there can be no
                    doubt that worms, the fry of fish, and even younger larvae of their own species,
                    form part of the bill of fare. The “nymph” when arrived at its full growth
                    sallies forth from the water, and often crawls a considerable distance
                    (frequently many feet up the trunks of trees) before it fixes itself for the
                    final change, which is effected by the thorax splitting longitudinally down the
                    back, through which fissure the perfect insect gradually drags itself. The
                    figures on last page indicate this process as observed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeschna</hi><hi rend="italic">cyanea.</hi></p>
                <p>For a considerable time after its emergence a dragon-fly is without any of its
                    characteristic colours, and is flaccid and weak, the wings (even in those groups
                    in which they are afterwards horizontally extended) being held vertically in a
                    line with the abdomen. By degrees the parts harden, and the insect essays its
                    first flight, but even then the wings have little power and are semi-opaque in
                    appearance, as if dipped in mucilage. In most species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calopterygina,</hi> and in some others, the prevailing colour of the body is a
                    brilliant bronzy green, blue, or black, but the colours in the other groups vary
                    much, and often differ in the sexes. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Libellula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">depressa</hi> the abdomen of the fully adult male is covered with
                    a bluish bloom, whereas that of the female is yellow; but several days elapse
                    before this pulverulent appearance is attained, and a comparatively young male
                    is yellow like the female. The wings are typically hyaline, and colourless, but
                    in many species (especially <hi rend="italic">Caloplerygina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Libellulina)</hi> they may be wholly or in part opaque and often
                    black, due apparently to gradual oxydization of a pigment between the two
                    membranes of which the wings are composed; the brilliant iridescence, or
                    metallic lustre, so frequently found is no doubt due to interference—the effect
                    of minute irregularities of the surface—and not produced by a pigment. A
                    beautiful little genus <hi rend="italic">(Chalcopteryx)</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">Caloptcrygina</hi> from the Amazon is a gem in the world of
                    insects, the posterior wings being of the most brilliant fiery metallic colour,
                    whereas the anterior remain hyaline.</p>
                <p>These insects are pre-eminently lovers of the hottest sunshine (a few are
                    somewhat crepuscular), and the most powerful and daring on the wing in fine
                    weather become inert and comparatively lifeless when at rest in dull weather,
                    allowing themselves to be captured by the fingers without making any effort to
                    escape. Many of the larger species <hi rend="italic">(Aeschna,</hi> &lt;fcc.)
                    have a habit of affecting a particular twig or other resting place like a
                    fly-catcher among birds, darting off after prey and making long excursions, but
                    returning to the chosen spot. Mr Wallace, in his <hi rend="italic">Malay
                    Archipelago,</hi> states that the inhabitants of Lombock use the large species
                    for food, and catch them by means of limed twigs.</p>
                <p>They are distributed over the whole world excepting the polar regions, but are
                    especially insects of the tropics. At the present day about 1700 species are
                    known, dispersed unequally among the several sub-families as follows: <hi
                    rend="italic">Agrionina,</hi> 490 species; <hi rend="italic">Calopterygina,</hi>
                    170; <hi rend="italic">Gomphina,</hi> 210; <hi rend="italic">Aeschnina,</hi>
                    150; <hi rend="italic">Corduliina,</hi> 100; <hi rend="italic">Libellulina,</hi>
                    580. In Europe proper only 100 species have been observed, and about 46 of these
                    occur in the British islands. New Zealand is excessively poor, and can only
                    number 8 species, whereas they are very numerous in Australia. Some species are
                    often seen at sea, far from land, in calm weather, in troops which are no doubt
                    migratory; our common <hi rend="italic">Libellula quadrimaculala,</hi> which
                    inhabits the cold and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, has been
                    frequently seen in immense migratory swarms. One species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pantdla</hi><hi rend="italic">flavescens)</hi> has about the widest range of
                    any insect, occurring in the Old World from Kamtchatka to Australia, and in the
                    New from the Southern States to Chili, also all over Africa and the Pacific
                    islands, but is not found in Europe. The largest species occur in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeschnina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agrionina;</hi> a member of
                    the former subfamily from Borneo expands to nearly 6J inches, and with a
                    moderately strong body and powerful form; in the latter the Central American and
                    Brazilian <hi rend="italic">Megaloprepus caerulatus</hi> and species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mecistogaster</hi> are very large, the former expanding to nearly
                    7 inches, and the latter to nearly as much, but the abdomen is not thicker than
                    an ordinary grass-stem and of extreme length (fully 5 inches in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mecistogastef).</hi> Among living entomologists the dragonflies
                    have received, and are receiving, great attention, especially from the Baron de
                    Selys-Longchamps of Liège, and from Dr H. A. Hagen, formerly of Königsberg, now
                    of Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to prepare dragon-flies for the cabinet so as to retain all the
                    brilliant colours the bodies have in life. They are excessively brittle when
                    dry, and in the smaller species it is advisable to run a bristle into the under
                    side of the thorax, pushing it down till it reach the extremity of the abdomen,
                    when the other end can be cut off close to the thorax. But the larger species
                    should be disembowelled through a slit along the under surface of the abdomen,
                    and then filled (but not too tightly) with clean white cotton wool. The colours
                    stand a much better chance of not greatly altering if the insects be not killed
                    until some hours after they are captured, so as to allow the contents of the
                    intestinal canal to be naturally passed away, for it is the decomposition of the
                    food that assists materially to alter or obliterate the colour and markings.</p>
                <p>Among fossil insects dragon-flies hold a conspicuous position. Not only do they
                    belong to what appears to have been a very ancient type, but in addition, the
                    large wings and strong dense reticulation are extremely favourable for
                    preservation in a fossil condition, and in many cases all the intricate details
                    can be as readily followed as in a recent example. In this country they have
                    been found more especially in the Purbeck beds of Swanage, and the vales of
                    Wardour and Aylesbury, in the Stonesfield Slate series, and in the Lias and
                    Rhaetic series of the west of England. But the richest strata appear to be those
                    of the Upper Miocene at Oeningen, in the Rhine valley; the Middle Miocene at
                    Radaboj, in Croatia; the Eocene of Aix, in Provençe; and more especially the
                    celebrated Secondary rocks furnishing the lithographic stone of Solenhofen, in
                    Bavaria. This latter deposit would appear to have been of marine origin, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n408/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0408-0389"/> and it is significant that, although the remains
                    of gigantic dragon-flies discovered in it are very numerous and perfect, no
                    traces of their sub-aquatic conditions have been found, although these as a rule
                    are numerous in most of the other strata, hence the insects may be regarded as
                    having been drowned in the sea and washed on shore. Many of these Solenhof en
                    species differ considerably in fcrmfrom those now existing, so that Dr Hagen,
                    who has especially studied them, says that for nearly all it is necessary to
                    make new genera. A notice of fossil forms should not be concluded without the
                    remark that indications of at least two species have been found in amber, a
                    number disproportionately small if compared with other insects entombed therein;
                    but it must be remembered that a dragon-fly is, as a rule, an insect of great
                    power, and in all probability those then existing were able to extricate
                    themselves if accidentally entangled in the resin.</p>
