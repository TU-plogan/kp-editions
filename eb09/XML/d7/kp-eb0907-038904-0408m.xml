                    rend="italic                     smallcaps"> (c.</hi> 1545—1595), a celebrated
                    English admiral, was born near Tavistock, Devonshire, about 1545 according to
                    most authorities, but Barrow, in his life, says the date may have been as early
                    as 1539. His father, a yeoman and a zealous Protestant, was obliged to take
                    refuge in Kent during the persecutions in the reign of Queen Mary. He obtained a
                    naval chaplaincy from Queen Elizabeth, and is said to have been afterwards vicar
                    of Upnor Church, on the Medway. This, however, must be a mistake, as there is no
                    evidence of any church ever having existed at Upnor. Young Drake was educated at
                    the expense and under the care of Sir John Hawkins, who was his kinsman; and,
                    after passing an apprenticeship on a coasting vessel, at the age of eighteen he
                    had risen to be purser of a ship trading to Biscay. At twenty he made a voyage
                    to Guinea; and at twenty-two he was made captain of the “Judith.” In that
                    capacity he was in the harbour of San Juan de Ulloa, in the Gulf of Mexico,
                    where he behaved most gallantly in the actions under Sir John Hawkins, and
                    returned with him to England, having acquired great reputation, though with the
                    loss of all the money which he had embarked in the expedition. In 1570 he
                    obtained a regular privateering commission from Queen Elizabeth, the powers of
                    which he immediately exercised in a cruise in the Spanish Main. Having next
                    projected an attack against the Spaniards in the West Indies to indemnify
                    himself for his former losses, he set sail in 1572, with two small ships named
                    the “Pasha” and the “Swan.” He was afterwards joined by another vessel; and with
                    this small squadron he took and plundered the Spanish town of Nombre de Dios.
                    With his men he penetrated across the isthmus of Panama, and committed great
                    havoc among the Spanish shipping. From the top of a tree which he climbed while
                    on the isthmus he obtained his first view of the Pacific, and resolved “to sail
                    an English ship in these seas.” In these expeditions he was much assisted by a
                    tribe of Indians, who were then engaged in a desultory warfare with the
                    Spaniards. Having embarked his men and filled his ships with plunder, he bore
                    away for England, and arrived at Plymouth on the 9th August 1573.</p>
                <p>His success and honourable demeanour in this expedition gained him high
                    reputation; and the use which he made of his riches served to raise him still
                    higher in popular esteem. Having fitted out three frigates at his own expense,
                    he sailed with them to ſreland, and rendered effective service as a volunteer,
                    under Walter earl of Essex, the father of the famous but unfortunate earl. After
                    the death of his <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0409-0390"/> patron he returned to England, where Sir
                    Christopher Hatton introduced him to Queen Elizabeth, and procured him a
                    favourable reception at court. In this way he acquired the means of undertaking
                    that grand expedition which has immortalized his name. The first proposal he
                    made was to undertake a voyage into the South Seas through the Straits of
                    Magellan, which no Englishman had hitherto ever attempted. This project having
                    been well received at court, the queen furnished him with means; and his own
                    fame quickly drew together a sufficient force. The fleet with which he sailed on
                    this enterprise consisted of only five small vessels, and their united crews
                    mustered only 166 men. Having sailed on the 13th December 1577, he on the 25th
                    made the coast of Barbary, and on the 29 th Cape Verd. He reached the coast of
                    Brazil on the 5th of April, and entered the Rio de la Plata, where he parted
                    company with two of his ships; but having met them again, and taken out their
                    provisions, he turned them adrift. On the 29th May he entered the port of St
                    Julian’s, where he continued two months for the sake of laying in a stock of
                    provisions. On the 20th August he entered the Straits of Magellan, and on the
                    25th September passed them, having then only his own ship. On the 25th November
                    he arrived at Macao, which he had appointed as the place of rendezvous in the
                    event of his ships being separated; but Captain Winter, his vice-admiral, had
                    repassed the straits and returned to England. He thence continued his voyage
                    along the coast of Chili and Peru, taking all opportunities of seizing Spanish
                    ships, and attacking them on shore, till his men were satiated with plunder; and
                    then coasted along the shores of America, as far as 48° N. lat., in an
                    unsuccessful endeavour to discover a passage into the Atlantic. Having landed,
                    however, he named the country New Albion, and took possession of it in the name
                    of Queen Elizabeth. Having careened his ship, he sailed thence on the 2flth
                    September 1579 for the Moluccas. On the 4th November he got sight of those
                    islands, and, arriving at Ternate, was extremely well received by the king. On
                    the 10th December he made the Celebes, where his ship unfortunately struck upon
                    a rock, but was taken off without much damage. On the 16 th March he arrived at
                    Java, whence he intended to have directed his course to Malacca; but he found
                    himself obliged to alter his purpose, and to think of returning home. On the
                    25th March 1580 he again set sail; and on the 15th June he doubled the Cape of
                    Good Hope, having then on board only fifty-seven men and three casks of water.
                    He passed the line on the 12th July, and on the 16th reached the coast of
                    Guinea, where he watered. On the 11th September he made the Island of Terceira,
                    and on the 3d November he entered the harbour of Plymouth. This voyage round the
                    world, the first accomplished by an Englishman, was thus performed in two years
                    and about ten months. The queen hesitated for some time whether to recognize his
                    achievements or not, on the ground that such recognition might lead to
                    complications with Spain, but she finally decided in his favour. Accordingly,
                    soon after his arrival she paid a visit to Deptford, went on board his ship, and
                    there, after partaking of a banquet, conferred upon him the honour of
                    knighthood, at the same time declaring her entire approbation of all that he had
                    done. She likewise gave directions for the preservation of his ship, the “Golden
                    Hind,” that it might remain a monument of his own and his country’s glory. After
                    the lapse of a century it decayed and had to be broken up. Of the sound timber a
                    chair was made, which was presented by Charles II. to the university of Oxford.
                    In 1585, open hostilities having commenced with Spain, Drake sailed with a fleet
                    to the West Indies, and took the cities of St Jago, St Domingo, Cartagena, and
                    St Augustine, [n 1587 he went to Lisbon with a fleet of thirty sail; and having
                    received intelligence of a great fleet being assembled in the bay of Cadiz, and
                    destined to form part of the Armada, he with great courage entered the port on
                    the 19th April, and there burnt upwards of 10,000 tons of shipping,— a feat
                    which he afterwards jocosely called “singeing the king of Spain’s beard.” In
                    1588, when the Spanish Armada was approaching England, Sir Francis Drake was
                    appointed vice-admiral under Lord Howard, and made prize of a very large
                    galleon, commanded by Don Pedro de Valdez, who was reputed the projector of the
                    invasion, and who struck at once on learning his adversary’s name.</p>
                <p>It deserves to be noticed that Drake’s name is mentioned in the singular
                    diplomatic communication from the king of Spain which preceded the Armada :—</p>
                <p>Te veto ne pergas bello defendere Belgas;</p>
                <p>Quae Dracus eripuit nunc restituantur oportet;</p>
                <p>Quas pater evertit jubeo te condere cellas: Religio Papae fac restituatur ad
                    unguem.</p>
                <p>To these lines the queen made this extempore response :— Ad Graecas, bone rex,
                    fiant mandata kalendas.</p>
                <p>In 1589 Drake commanded the fleet sent to restore Dorn Antonio, king of Portugal,
                    the land forces being under the orders of Sir John Norris; but they had hardly
                    put to sea when the commanders differed, and thus the attempt proved abortive.
                    But as the war with Spain continued, a more formidable expedition was fitted
                    out, under Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake, against their settlements in
                    the West Indies, than had hitherto been undertaken during the whole course of
                    it. Here, however, the commanders again disagreed about the plan; and the result
                    in like manner disappointed public expectation. These disasters were keenly felt
                    by Drake, and were the principal cause of his death, which took place on board
                    his own ship, near the town of Nombre de Dios, in the West Indies, January 28,
                    1595.</p>
