                    a bitter foretaste of life. He was seven years old when his father died, leaving
                    property (in a manufactory of swords, and another of upholstery) worth about
                    £3500, which, invested as it seems to have been (20 per cent, was not thought
                    exorbitant), would have yielded rather more than £600 a year. £300 a year was a
                    very comfortable income at Athens, and it was possible to live decently on a
                    tenth of it. Nicias, a very rich man, had property equivalent, probably, to not
                    more than £4000 a year. Demosthenes was born, then, to a handsome, though not a
                    great fortune. But his guardians—two nephews of his father, Aphobus and
                    Demophon, and one Therippides— abused their trust, and handed over to
                    Demosthenes, when he came of age, rather less than one-seventh of his patrimony,
                    perhaps between £50 and £60 a year. Demosthenes, after studying with Isaeus—then

                    and gained a verdict for about £2400. But it does not appear that he got the
                    money; and, after some more fruitless proceedings against Onetor, the
                    brother-in-law of Aphobus, the matter was dropped,—not, however, before his
                    relatives had managed to throw a public burden (the equipment of a ship of war)
                    on their late ward, whereby his resources were yet further straitened. He now
                    became a professional writer of speeches or pleas for the law-courts, sometimes
                    speaking himself. Biographers have delighted to relate how painfully Demosthenes
                    made himself a tolerable speaker,—how, with pebbles in his mouth, he tried his
                    lungs against the waves, how he declaimed as he ran up hill, how he shut himself
                    up in a cell, having first guarded himself against a longing for the haunts of
                    men by shaving one side of his head, how he wrote out Thucydides eight times,
                    how he was derided by the Assembly and encouraged by a judicious actor who met
                    him moping about the Peiraeus. He certainly seems to have been the reverse of
                    athletic (the stalwart AEschines upbraids him with never having been a
                    sportsman), and he probably had some sort of defect or impediment in his speech
                    as a boy. Perhaps the most interesting fact about his work for the law-courts is
                    that he seems to have continued it, in some measure, through the most exciting
                    parts of his great political career. The speech for Phormio belongs to the same
                    year as the plea for Megalopolis. The speech for Baeotus “Concerning the Name”
                    comes between the First Philippic and the First Olynthiae. The speech against
                    Pantaenetus comes between the speech <hi rend="italic">“On</hi> the Peace” and
                    the Second Philippic.</p>

                <p>The political career of Demosthenes, from his first direct contact with public
                    affairs in 355 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to his death in 322, has an
                    essential unity. It is the assertion, in successive forms adapted to successive
                    moments, of unchanging principles. Externally, it is divided into the chapter
                    which precedes and the chapter which follows Chaeronea. But its inner meaning,
                    the secret of its indomitable vigour, the law which harmonizes its apparent
                    contrasts, cannot be understood unless it is regarded as a whole. Still less can
                    it be appreciated in all its large wisdom and sustained self-mastery if it is
                    viewed merely as a duel between the ablest champion and the craftiest enemy of
                    Greek freedom. The time indeed came when Demosthenes and Philip stood face to
                    face as representative antagonists in a mortal conflict. But, for Demosthenes,
                    the special peril represented by Philip, the peril of subjugation to Macedon,
                    was merely a disastrous accident. Philip happened to become the most prominent
                    and most formidable type of a danger which was already threatening Greece before
                    his baleful star arose. As Demosthenes said to the Athenians, if the Macedonian
                    had not existed, they would have made another Philip for themselves. Until
                    Athens recovered something of its old spirit, there must ever be a great
                    standing danger, not for Athens only, but for Greece,—the danger that sooner or
                    later, in some shape, from some quarter—no man could foretell the hour, the
                    manner, or the source—barbarian violence would break up the gracious and
                    undefiled tradition of separate Hellenic life.</p>
                <p>What is the true relation of Athens to Greece î The answer which he gave to this
                    question is the key to the life of Demosthenes. Athens, so Demosthenes held, is
                    the natural head of Greece. Not, however, as an empress holding subject or
                    subordinate cities in a dependence more or less compulsory. Rather as that city
                    which most nobly expresses the noblest attributes of Greek political existence,
                    and which, by her pre-eminent gifts both of intellect and of moral insight, is
                    primarily responsible, everywhere and always, for the maintenance of those
                    attributes in their integrity. Wherever the cry of the oppressed goes up from
                    Greek against Greek, it is the voice of Athens which should first remind the
                    oppressor that Hellene differs from barbarian in postponing the use of force to
                    the persuasions of equal law. Wherever a barbarian hand offers wrong to any city
                    of the Hellenic sisterhood, it is the arm of Athens which should first be
                    stretched forth in the holy strength of Apollo the Averter. Wherever among her
                    own children the ancient loyalty is yielding to love of pleasure or of base
                    gain, there, above all, it is the duty of Athens to see that the central hearth
                    of Hellas is kept pure. Athens must never again seek “empire” in the sense which
                    became odious under the influence of Cleon and Hyperbolus,— when, to use the
                    image of Aristophanes, the allies w ere as Babylonian slaves grinding in the
                    Athenian mill. Athens must never permit, if she can help it, the
                    re-establishment of such a domination as Sparta exercised in Greece from the
                    battle of AEgospotami to the battle of Leuctra. Athens must aim at leading a
                    free confederacy, of which the members shall be bound to her by their own truest
                    interests. Athens must seek to deserve the confidence of all Greeks alike.</p>
                <p>Such, in the belief of Demosthenes, was the part which Athens must perform if
                    Greece was to be safe. But reforms must be effected before Athens could be
                    capable of such a part. The evils to be cured were different phases of one
                    malady. Athens had long been suffering from the profound decay of public spirit.
                    It was of the essence of a Greek commonwealth that the citizen, while perfectly
                    free in his social life, should constantly set his duty to the city above
                    private interests. If the state needs his service in war. he must not hire an
                    inferior substitute to do the work.</p>
                <p>If the state requires funds, he must not grudge the money which in quiet times
                    might have been spent on the theatre or the banquet. He must ever remember that,
                    in the phrase of Sophocles, the state is the ship that bears us safe. It does
                    not profit the passenger that his cabin is comfortable if the ship is going
                    down.</p>
                <p>Since the early years of the Peloponnesian war, the separation of Athenian
                    society from the state had been growing more and more marked. The old type of
                    the eminent citizen, who was at once statesman and general, had become almost
                    extinct. Politics were now managed by a small circle of politicians. Wars were
                    conducted by professional soldiers whose troops were chiefly mercenaries, and
                    who were usually regarded by the politicians either as instruments or as
                    enemies. The mass of the citizens took no active interest in public affairs.
                    But, though indifferent to principles, they had quickly sensitive partialities
                    for men, and it was necessary to keep them in good humour. Pericles had
                    introduced the practice of giving a small bounty from the Treasury to the poorer
                    citizens, for the purpose of enabling them to attend the theatre at the great
                    festivals,—in other words, for the purpose of bringing them under the
                    concentrated influence of the best Attic culture. A provision eminently wise for
                    the age of Pericles easily became a mischief when the once honourable name of
                    “demagogue” began to mean a flatterer of the mob. Before the end of the
                    Peloponnesian War the festival-money (“theoricon ”) was abolished. A few years
                    after the restoration of the democracy it was again introduced. But until 354
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it had never been more than a gratuity, of which
                    the payment depended on the Treasury having a surplus. It had never been treated
                    as an annual charge on the revenue, or guaranteed to the citizens as a dividend
                    which they could claim by constitutional right. In 354 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Eubulus became steward of the Treasury. He was an able man, with a
                    special talent for finance, free from all taint of personal corruption, and
                    sincerely solicitous for the honour o <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> Athens, but
                    enslaved to popularity, and without principles of policy. He sought to manage
                    the citizens by humouring to the top of its bent their disinclination for
                    personal sacrifice, and their preference for public show to public strength.
                    More than any other one man, Eubulus represents that new, easy-going,
                    improvident Athens in which the vigilant civic spirit was dead. His first
                    measure was to make the festival-money a permanent item in the budget.
                    Thenceforth this bounty was in reality very much what Demades afterwards called
                    it,—the cement (κo'λλα) of the democracy.</p>
                <p>Years before the danger from Macedon was urgent, Demosthenes had begun the work
                    of his life,—the effort to lift the spirit of Athens, to revive the old civic
                    loyalty, to rouse the city into taking that place and performing that part which
                    her own welfare as well as the safety of Greece prescribed. His formally
                    political speeches must never be considered apart from his forensic speeches in
                    public causes. The Athenian procedure against the proposer of an
                    unconstitutional law— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of a law incompatible w ith
                    existing laws—had a direct tendency to make the law-court, in such cases, a
                    political arena. The same tendency was indirectly exerted by the tolerance of
                    Athenian juries (in the absence of a presiding expert like a judge) for
                    irrelevant matter, since it was usually easy for a speaker to make capital out
                    of the adversary’s political antecedents. But the forensic speeches of
                    Demosthenes for public causes are not only political in this general sense. They
                    are documents, as indispensable as the Olynthiacs or Philippics, for his own
                    political career. Only by taking them along with the formally political
                    speeches, and regarding the whole as one unbroken series, can we see clearly the
                    full scope of the task which he set before him,—a task in which his long <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0080-0069"/> resistance to Philip was only the most dramatic
                    incident, and in which his real achievement is not to be measured by the event
                    of Chaeronea.</p>
                <p>A forensic speech, composed for a public cause, opens the political career of
                    Demosthenes with a protest against a signal abuse. In 355 B.C., at the age of
                    twenty-nine, he wrote the speech “Against Androtion.” This combats on legal
                    grounds a proposal that the <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> out-going Senate
                    should receive the honour of a golden crown. In its larger aspect, it is a
                    denunciation of the corrupt system which that Senate represented, and especially
                    of the manner in which the Treasury had been administered by Aristophon. In 354
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Demosthenes composed and spoke the oration
                    “Against Leptines,” who had. effected a slender saving for the state by the
                    expedient of revoking those hereditary exemptions from taxation which had at
                    various times been conferred in recognition of distinguished merit. The
                    descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton alone had been excepted from the
                    operation of the law. This was the first time that the voice of Demosthenes
                    himself had been heard on the public concerns of Athens, and the utterance was a
                    worthy prelude to the career of a statesman. He answers the advocates of the
                    retrenchment by pointing out that the public interest will not ultimately be
                    served by a wholesale violation of the public faith. In the same year he
                    delivered his first strictly political speech. The Athenians, irritated by the
                    support which Artaxerxes had lately given to the revolt of their allies, and
                    excited by rumours of his hostile preparations, were feverishly eager for a war
                    with Persia. Demosthenes urges that such an enterprise would at present be
                    useless; that it would fail to unite Greece; that the energies of the city
                    should be reserved for a real emergency; but that, before the city can
                    successfully cope with any war, there must be a better organization of
                    resources, and, first of all, a reform of the navy. The scheme of naval reform
                    which he propounds has characteristic exactness of detail. We see how closely he
                    has thought out the question. The same practical and luminous precision is a
                    striking trait in every speech of Demosthenes which recommends a course of
                    action.</p>
                <p>Two years later he is found dealing with a more definite question of foreign
                    policy. Sparta, favoured by the depression of Thebes in the Phocian war, was
                    threatening Megalopolis. Both Sparta and Megalopolis sent embassies to Athens.
                    Demosthenes supported Megalopolis. The ruin of Megalopolis would mean, he
                    argued, the return of Spartan domination in the Peloponnesus. Athenians must not
                    favour the tyranny of any one city. They must respect the rights of all the
                    cities, and thus promote unity based on mutual confidence. In the same year
                    Demosthenes wrote the speech “Against Timocrates,” to be spoken by the same
                    Diodorus who had before prosecuted Androtion, and who now combated an attempt to
                    screen Androtion and others from the penalties of embezzlement. The speech
                    “Against Aristocrates,” also of 352 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> reproves
                    that foreign policy of feeble make-shifts which was now popular at Athens. The
                    Athenian tenure of the Thracian Chersonese partly depended for its security on
                    the goodwill of the Thracian prince Cersobleptes. Charidemus, a soldier of
                    fortune who had already played Athens false, was now the brother-in-law and the
                    favourite of Cersobleptes. Aristocrates proposed that the person of Charidemus
                    should be invested with a special sanctity, by the enactment that whoever
                    attempted his life should be an outlaw from all dominions of Athens. Demosthenes
                    points out that such adulation is as futile as it is fulsome. Athens can secure
                    the permanence of her foreign possessions only in one way—by being strong enough
                    to hold them.</p>
                <p>Thus, between 355 and 352, Demosthenes had laid down the main lines of his
                    policy. Domestic administration must be purified. Statesmen must be made to feel
                    that they are responsible to the state. They must not be allowed to anticipate
                    judgment on their deserts by voting each other golden crowns. They must not
                    think to screen misappropriation of public money by getting partisans to pass
                    new laws about state-debtors. Foreign policy must be guided by a larger and more
                    provident conception of Athenian interests. When public excitement demands a
                    foreign war, Athens must not rush into it without asking whether it is
                    necessary, whether it will have Greek support, and whether she herself is ready
                    for it. When a strong Greek city threatens a weak one, and seeks to purchase
                    Athenian connivance with the bribe of a border-town, Athens must remember that
                    duty and prudence alike command her to respect the independence of all Greeks.
                    When it is proposed, by way of insurance on Athenian possessions abroad, to
                    flatter the favourite of a doubtful ally, Athens must remember that such devices
                    will not avail a power which has no army except on paper, and no ships fit to
                    leave their moorings.</p>
                <p>But the time had gone by when Athenians could have tranquil leisure for domestic
                    reform. A danger, calling for prompt action, had at last come very near. For six
                    years Athens had been at war with Philip on account of his seizure of
                    Amphipolis. Meanwhile he had destroyed Potidaea and founded Philippi. On the
                    Thracian coasts he had become master of Abdera and Maronea. On the Thessalian
                    coast he had acquired Methone. In a second invasion of Thessaly, he had
                    overthrown the Phocians under Onomarchus, and had advanced to Thermopylae, to
                    find the gates of Greece closed against him by an Athenian force. He had then
                    marched to Heraeon on the Propontis, and had dictated a peace to Cersobleptes.
                    He had formed an alliance with Cardia, Perinthus, and Byzantium. Lastly, he had
                    begun to show designs on the great Confederacy of Olynthus, the more warlike
                    Miletus of the 'North. The First Philippic of Demosthenes was spoken in 351 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Third Philippic—the latest of the extant
                    political speeches—was spoken in 341 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Between
                    these he delivered eight political orations, of which seven are directly
                    concerned with Philip. The whole series falls into two great divisions. The
                    first division comprises those speeches which were spoken against Philip while
                    he was still a foreign power threatening Greece from without. Such are the First
                    Philippic and the three orations for Olynthus. The second division comprises the
                    speeches spoken against Philip when, by admission to the Amphictyonie Council,
                    he had now won his way within the circle of the Greek states, and when the issue
                    was no longer between Greece and Macedonia, but between the Greek and Macedonian
                    parties in Greece. Such are the speech “On the Peace,” the speech “On the
                    Embassy,” the speech “On the Chersonese,” the Second and Third Philippics.</p>
                <p>The First Philippic, spoken early in 351 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was no
                    sudden note of alarm drawing attention to an unnoticed peril. On the contrary,
                    the Assembly was weary of the subject. For six years the war with Philip had
                    been a theme of barren talk. Demosthenes urges that it is time to do something,
                    and to do it with a plan. Athens fighting Philip has fared, he says, like an
                    amateur boxer opposed to a skilled pugilist. The helpless hands have only
                    followed blows which a trained eye should have taught them to parry. An Athenian
                    force must be stationed in the north, at Lemnos or Thasos. Of 2000 infantry and
                    200 cavalry at least one quarter must be Athenian citizens capable of directing
                    the mercenaries.</p>
                <p>Later in the same year Demosthenes did another service to the cause of national
                    freedom. Rhodes, severed by its own act from the Athenian Confederacy, had since
                    355 <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n81/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0081-0070"/> been virtually subject to Mausolus, prince <hi
                    rend="italic">(δυvaστης)</hi> of Caria, himself a tributary of Persia. Mausolus
                    died in 351, and was succeeded by his widow Artemisia. The democratic party in
                    Rhodes now appealed to Athens for help in throwing off the Carian yoke.
                    Demosthenes supported their application. No act of his life was a truer proof of
                    statesmanship. He failed. But at least he had once more warned Athens that the
                    cause of political freedom was everywhere her own, and that, wherever that cause
                    was forsaken, there a new danger was created both for Athens and for Greece.</p>
                <p>Next year an Athenian force under Phocion was sent to Eubaea, in support of
                    Plutarchus, tyrant of Eretria, against the faction of Clitarchus. Demosthenes
                    protested against spending strength, needed for greater objects, on the local
                    quarrels of a despot. Phocion won a victory at Tamynae. But the “inglorious and
                    costly war” entailed an outlay of more than &lt;£12,000 on the ransom of
                    captives alone, and ended in the total destruction of Athenian influence
                    throughout Eubaea. That island was now left an open field for the intrigues of
                    Philip. Worst of all, the party of Eubulus not only defeated a proposal, arising
                    from this campaign, for applying the festival-money to the war-fund, but
                    actually carried a law making it high treason to renew the proposal. The
                    amusement of the citizens was thus officially declared to be more important than
                    the protection of their properties or lives, and the expression of a different
                    opinion was henceforth to be a crime. The degree to which political enmity was
                    exasperated by the Eubaea n war may be judged from the incident of Midi as, an
                    adherent of Eubulus, and a type of that opulent rowdyism which shows how
                    curiously loose the hold of the state had now become on men who were not
                    restrained by regard for their purses or their characters. Demosthenes was
                    choragus of his tribe, and was wearing the robe of that sacred office at the
                    great festival in the theatre of Dionysus, when Midias struck him on the face.
                    The affair was eventually compromised. The speech written by Demosthenes for the
                    trial was neither spoken nor completed, and remains, as few will regret, a
                    sketch.</p>
                <p>It was now three years since, in 352, the Olynthians had sent an embassy to
                    Athens, and had made peace with their only sure ally. In 350 a second Olynthian
                    embassy had sought and obtained Athenian help, The hour of Olynthus had indeed
                    come. In 349 Philip opened war against the Chalcidic towns of the Olynthian
                    League. The First and Second Olynthiacs of Demosthenes were spoken in that year.
                    “Better now than later,” is the thought of the First Olynthiae. “The fight must
                    come. Better that it should be fought in Macedonia than in Attica. Everything
                    favours us now. Send one force to defend Olynthus, and another to attack
                    Philip.” The Second Olynthiae argues that Philip’s strength is overrated. “He is
                    weak in so far as he is selfish and unjust. He is strong only because he is
                    energetic. Let us be energetic too, and our just cause will prevail.” The Third
                    Olynthiae—spoken in 348— carries us into the midst of action. It deals with
                    practical details. The festival-fund must be used for the war. The citizeus must
                    serve in person. A few months later, Olynthus and the thirty-two towns of the
                    Confederacy were swept from the earth. Men could walk over their sites,
                    Demosthenes said seven years afterwards, without knowing that such cities had
                    existed. It was now certain that Philip could not be stopped outside of Greece.
                    The question was, What point within Greece shall he be allowed to reach <hi
                    rend="italic">'I</hi></p>
                <p>Eubulus and his party, with that versatility which is the privilege of political
                    vagueness, now began to call for a congress of the allies to consider the common
                    danger. They found a brilliant interpreter in Aeschines, who, after having been
                    a tragic actor and a clerk to the assembly, had entered political life with the
                    advantages of a splendid gift for eloquence, a fine presence, a happy address, a
                    ready wit, and a facile conscience. While his opponents had thus suddenly become
                    warlike, Demosthenes had become pacific. He saw that Athens must have time to
                    collect strength. Nothing could be gained, meanwhile, by going on with the war.
                    Macedonian sympathizers at Athens, of whom Philocrates was the chief, also
                    favoured peace. Eleven envoys, including Philocrates, Aeschines, and
                    Demosthenes, were sent to Philip in February, 346 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    After a debate at Athens, peace was concluded with Philip in April. Philip on
                    the one hand, Athens and her allies on the other, were to keep what they
                    respectively held at the time when the peace was ratified. But here the
                    Athenians made a fatal error. Philip was bent on keeping the door of Greece
                    open. Demosthenes was bent on shutting it against him. Philip was now at war
                    with the people of Halus in Thessaly. Thebes had for ten years been at war with
                    Phocis. Here were two distinct chances for Philip’s armed intervention in
                    Greece. But if the Haliaus and the Phocians were included in the peace, Philip
                    could not bear arms against them without violating the peace. Accordingly Philip
                    insisted that they should not be included. Demosthenes insisted that they should
                    be included. They were not included. The result followed speedily. The same
                    envoys were sent a second time to Philip for the purpose of receiving his oaths
                    in ratification of the peace. It was late in June before he returned from Thrace
                    to Pella—thus gaining, under the terms, all the towns that he had taken
                    meanwhile. He next took the envoys with him through Thessaly to Thermopylae.
                    There—at the invitation of Thessalians and Thebans—he intervened in the Phocian
                    war. Phalaecus surrendered. Phocis was crushed. Philip took its place in the
                    Amphictyonie Council, and was thus established as a Greek power in the very
                    centre, at the sacred hearth, of Greece. The right of precedence in consultation
                    of the oracle <hi rend="italic">(τrρoμavτeia)</hi> was transferred from Athens
                    to Philip. While indignant Athenians were clamouring for the revocation of the
                    peace, Demosthenes upheld it. It ought never to have been made on such terms, he
                    said. But, having been made, it had better be kept. “If we went to war now,
                    where should we find allies <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> And after losing Oropus,
                    Amphipolis, Cardia, Chios, Cos, Rhodes, Byzantium, shall we fight about the
                    shadow of Delphi 1”</p>
                <p>During the eight years between the peace of Philocrates and the battle of
                    Chaeronea, the authority of Demosthenes steadily grew, until it became first
                    predominant and then paramount. He had, indeed, a melancholy advantage. Each
                    year his argument was more and more cogently enforced by the logic of facts. In
                    344 he visited the Peloponnesus for the purpose of counteracting Macedonian
                    intrigue. Mistrust, he told the Peloponnesian cities, is the safeguard of free
                    communities against tyrants. Philip lodged a formal complaint at Athens. Here,
                    as elsewhere, the future master of Greece reminds us of Napoleon on the eve of
                    the First Empire. He has the same imperturbable and persuasive effrontery in
                    protesting that he is doing one thing at the moment when his energies are
                    concentrated on doing the opposite. Demosthenes replied in the Second Philippic.
                    “If,” he said, “Philip is the friend of Greece, we are doing wrong. If he is the
                    enemy of Greece, we are doing right. Which is he? I hold him to be our enemy,
                    because everything that he has hitherto done has benefited himself and hurt us.”
                    The prosecution of AEschines for malversation on the embassy, which was brought
                    to an issue in the following year, marks the moral strength of the position now
                    held by Demosthenes. When the gravity of the charge and the complexity of the
                    evidence are considered, the acquittal of Aeschines by a narrow majority <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0082-0071"/> must be deemed his condemnation. The speech “On
                    the “Affairs of the Chersonese,” and the Third Philippic, were the crowning
                    efforts of Demosthenes. Spoken in the same year, 341 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and within a short space of each other, they must be taken together.
                    The speech <hi rend="italic">“On</hi> the Affairs of the Chersonese” regards the
                    situation chiefly from an Athenian point of view. “If the peace means,” argues
                    Demosthenes, “that Philip can seize with impunity one Athenian possession after
                    another, but that Athenians shall not on their peril touch aught that belongs to
                    Philip, where is the line to be drawn <hi rend="italic">ì We</hi> shall go to
                    war, I am told, when it is necessary. If the necessity has not come yet, when
                    will it come î” The Third Philippic surveys a wider horizon. It ascends from the
                    Athenian to the Hellenic view. Philip has annihilated Olynthus and the Chalcidic
                    towns. He has ruined Phocis. He has frightened Thebes. He has divided Thessaly.
                    Eubaea and the Peloponnesus are his. His power stretches from the Adriatic to
                    the Hellespont. Where shall be the end <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> Athens is the
                    last hope of Greece. And, in this final crisis, Demosthenes was the embodied
                    energy of Athens. It was Demosthenes who went to Byzantium, brought the
                    estranged city back to the Athenian alliance, and snatched it from the hands of
                    Philip. It was Demosthenes who, when Philip had already seized Elatea, hurried
                    to Thebes, who by his passionate appeal gained one last chance, the only
                    possible chance, for Greek freedom, who broke down the barrier of an inveterate
                    jealousy, who brought Thebans to fight beside Athenians, and who thus won at the
                    eleventh hour a victory for the spirit of loyal union which took away at least
                    one bitterness from the unspeakable calamity of Chaeronea.</p>
                <p>But the work of Demosthenes was not closed by the ruin of his cause. During the
                    last sixteen years of his life he rendered services to Athens not less
                    important, and perhaps more difficult, than those which he had rendered before.
                    He was now, as a matter of course, foremost in the public affairs of Athens. In
                    January 337, at the annual winter Festival of the Dead in the Outer Cerameicus,
                    he spoke the funeral oration over those who had fallen at Chaeronea. He was
                    member of a commission for strengthening the fortifications of the city
                    (ταχoτroιoς). He administered the festival-fund. During a dearth which visited
                    Athens between 330 and 326 he was charged with the organization of public
                    relief. In 324 he was chief <hi rend="italic">(apχιθiωpo&lt;s)</hi> of the
                    sacred embassy to Olympia. Already, in 336, Ctesiphon had proposed that
                    Demosthenes should receive a golden crown from the state, and that his
                    extraordinary merits should be proclaimed in the theatre at the Great Dionysia.
                    The proposal was adopted by the Senate as a bill <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πpoβoυλwμfi)</hi>; but it must be passed by the Assembly before it could
                    become an act <hi rend="italic">(ψηφiσμa).</hi> To prevent this, Aeschines gave
                    notice, in 336, that he intended to proceed against Ctesiphon for having
                    proposed an unconstitutional measure. For six years Aeschines avoided action on
                    this notice. At last, in 330, the patriotic party felt strong enough to force
                    him to an issue. Aeschines spoke the speech “Against Ctesiphon,” an attack on
                    the whole public life of Demosthenes. Demosthenes gained an overwhelming victory
                    for himself and for the honour of Athens in the most finished, the most
                    splendid, and the most pathetic work of ancient eloquence—the immortal oration
                    “On the Crown.”</p>
                <p>In the winter of 325-4 Harpalus, the receiver-general of Alexander in Asia, fled
                    to Greece, taking with him 8000 mercenaries, and treasure equivalent to about a
                    million and a quarter sterling. On the motion of Demosthenes he was warned from
                    the harbours of Attica. Having left his troops and part of his treasure at
                    Taenarüm, he again presented himself at the Peiraeus, and was now admitted. He
                    spoke fervently of the opportunity which offered itself to those who loved the
                    freedom of Greece. All Asia would rise with Athens to throw off the hated yoke.
                    Fiery patriots like Hyperides were in raptures. For zeal which could be bought
                    Harpalus had other persuasions. But Demosthenes stood firm. War with Alexander
                    would, he saw, be madness. It could have but one result,—some indefinitely worse
                    doom for Athens. Antipater and Olympias presently demanded the surrender of
                    Harpalus. Demosthenes opposed this. But he reconciled the dignity with the
                    loyalty of Athens by carrying a decree that Harpalus should be arrested, and
                    that his treasure should be deposited in the Parthenon, to be held in trust for
                    Alexander. Harpalus escaped from prison. The amount of the treasure, which
                    Harpalus had stated as 700 talents, proved to be no more than 350. Demosthenes
                    proposed that the Areopagus should inquire what had become of the other 350. Six
                    months, spent in party intrigues, passed before the Areopagus gave in their
                    report (ατr0φαcrις). The report inculpated nine persons. Demosthenes headed the
                    list of the accused. Hyperides was among the ten public prosecutors. Demosthenes
                    was condemned, fined fifty talents, and, in default of payment, imprisoned.
                    After a few days he escaped from prison to Aegina, and thence to Traezen. Two
                    things in this obscure affair are beyond reasonable doubt. First, that
                    Demosthenes was not bribed by Harpalus. The hatred of the Macedonian party
                    towards Demosthenes, and the fury of those vehement patriots who cried out that
                    he had betrayed their best opportunity, combined to procure his condemnation,
                    with the help, probably, of some appearances which were against him. Secondly,
                    it can hardly be questioned that, by withstanding the hotheaded patriots at this
                    juncture, Demosthenes did heroic service to Athens.</p>
                <p>Next year Alexander died. Then the voice of Demosthenes, calling Greece to arms,
                    rang out like a trumpet. Early in August 322, the battle of Crannon decided the
                    Lamian war against Greece. Antipater demanded, as the condition on which he
                    would refrain from besieging Athens, the surrender of the leading patriots.
                    Demades moved the decree of the Assembly by whiçh Demosthenes, Hyperides, and
                    some others were condemned to death as traitors. On the 20th of Boedromion
                    (September 16) 322, a Macedonian garrison occupied Munychia. It was a day of
                    solemn and happy memories, a day devoted, in the celebration of the Great
                    Mysteries, to sacred joy,—the day on which the glad procession of the Initiated
                    returned from Eleusis to Athens. It happened, however, to have another
                    association, more significant than any ironical contrast for the present purpose
                    of Antipater. It was the day on which, thirteen years before, Alexander had
                    punished the rebellion of Thebes with annihilation.</p>
                <p>The condemned men had fled to Aegina. Parting there from Hyperides and the rest,
                    Demosthenes went on to Calauria, a small island off the coast of Argolis. In
                    Calauria there was an ancient temple of Poseidon, once a centre of Minyan and
                    Ionian worship, and surrounded with a peculiar sanctity as having been, from
                    time immemorial, an inviolable refuge for the pursued. Here Demosthenes sought
                    asylum. Archias of Thurii, a man who, like Aeschines, had begun life as a tragic
                    actor, and who was now in the pay of Antipater, soon traced the fugitive, landed
                    in Calauria, and appeared before the temple of Poseidon with a body of Thracian
                    spearmen. Plutarch’s picturesque narrative bears the marks of artistic
                    elaboration. Demosthenes had dreamed the night before that he and Archias were
                    competing for a prize as tragic actors; the house applauded Demosthenes; but his
                    chorus was shabbily equipped, and Archias gained the prize. Archias was not the
                    man to stick at sacrilege. In Aegina, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n83/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0083-0072"/> Hyperides and the others had been taken from the
                    shrine of Aeacus. But he hesitated to violate an asylum so peculiarly sacred as
                    the Calaurian temple. Standing before its open door, with his Thracian soldiers
                    around him, he endeavoured to prevail on Demosthenes to quit the holy precinct.
                    Antipater would be certain to pardon him. Demosthenes sat silent, with his eyes
                    fixed on the ground. At last, as the emissary persisted in his bland
                    persuasions, he looked up and said,—“Archias, you never moved me by your acting,
                    and you will not move me now by your promises.” Archias lost his temper, and
                    began to threaten. “Now,” rejoined Demosthenes, “you speak like a real
                    Macedonian oracle; before you were acting. Wait a moment, then, till I write to
                    my friends.” With these words, Demosthenes withdrew into the inner part of the
                    temple,—still visible, however, from the entrance. He took out a roll of paper,
                    as if he was going to write, put the pen to his mouth, and bit it, as was his
                    habit in composing. Then he threw his head back, and drew his cloak over it. The
                    Thracian spearmen, who were watching him from the door, began to gibe at his
                    cowardice. Archias went in to him, encouraged him to rise, repeated his old
                    arguments, talked to him of reconciliation with Antipater. By this time
                    Demosthenes felt that the poison which he had sucked from the pen was beginning
                    to work. He drew the cloak from his face, and looked steadily at Archias. “Now
                    you can play the part of Creon in the tragedy as soon as you like,” he said,
                    “and cast forth my body unburied. But I, O gracious Poseidon, quit thy temple
                    while I yet live; Antipater and his Macedonians have done what they could to
                    pollute it.” He moved towards the door, calling to them to support his tottering
                    steps. He had just passed the altar of the god, when he fell, and with a groan
                    gave up the ghost.</p>
                <p>As a statesman, Demosthenes needs no epitaph but his own words in the speech “On
                    the Crown.” <hi rend="italic">I say that, if the event had been manifest to the
                    whole world beforehand, not even then ought Athens to have forsaken this course,
                    if Athens had any regard for her glory, or for her past, orfor the ages to
                    come.</hi> The Persian soldier in Herodotus, following Xerxes to foreseen ruin,

                    rend="italic">—</hi> complete, but helpless, prescience. In the grasp of a more
                    inexorable necessity, the champion of Greek freedom was borne onward to a more
                    tremendous catastrophe than that which strewed the waters of Salamis with
                    Persian wrecks and the field of Plataea with Persian dead; but to him, at least,
                    it was given to proclaim aloud the clear and sure foreboding that filled his
                    soul, to do all that true heart and free hand could do for his cause, and,
                    though not to save, yet to encourage, to console, and to ennoble. As the
                    inspiration of his life was larger and higher than the mere courage of
                    resistance, so his merit must be regarded as standing altogether outside and
                    above the struggle with Macedon. The great purpose which he set before him was
                    to revive the public spirit, to restore the political vigour, and to
                    re-establish the Panhellenic influence of Athens,— never for her own advantage
                    merely, but always in the interest of Greece. His glory is, that while he lived
                    he helped Athens to live a higher life. Wherever the noblest expressions of her
                    mind are honoured, wherever the large conceptions of Pericles command the
                    admiration of statesmen, wherever the architect and the sculptor love to dwell
                    on the masterpieces of Ictinus and Phidias, wherever the spell of ideal beauty
                    or of lofty contemplation is exercised by the creations of Sophocles or of
                    Plato, there it will be remembered that the spirit which wrought in all these
                    would have passed sooner from among men, if it had not been recalled from a
                    trance, which others were content to mistake for the last sleep, by the
                    passionate breath of Demosthenes.</p>
                <p>The orator in whom artistic genius was united, more perfectly than in any other
                    man, with moral enthusiasm and with intellectual grasp, has held in the modern
                    world the same rank which was accorded to him in the old; but he cannot enjoy
                    the same appreciation. Macaulay’s ridicule has rescued from oblivion the
                    criticism which pronounced the eloquence of Chatham to be more ornate than that
                    of Demosthenes, and less diffuse than that of Cicero. Did the critic, asks
                    Macaulay, ever hear any speaking that was less ornamented than that of
                    Demosthenes, or more diffuse than that of Cicero? Yet the critic’s remark was
                    not so pointless as Macaulay thought it. Sincerity and intensity are, indeed, to
                    the modern reader, the most obvious characteristics of Demosthenes. His style
                    is, on the whole, singularly free from what we are accustomed to regard as
                    rhetorical embellishment. Where the modern orator would employ a wealth of
                    imagery, or elaborate a picture in exquisite detail, Demosthenes is content with
                    a phrase or a word. Burke uses, in reference to Hyder Ali, the same image which
                    Demosthenes uses in reference to Philip. “Compounding all the materials of fury,
                    havoc, desolation, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivity of
                    the mountains. Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly
                    gazing on this menacing meteor, which darkened all their horizon, it suddenly
                    burst, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the
                    Carnatic.” Demosthenes forbears to amplify. “The people gave their voice, and
                    the danger which hung upon our borders went by like a cloud.” To our modern
                    feeling, the eloquence of Demosthenes exhibits everywhere a general stamp of
                    earnest and simple strength. But it is well to remember the charge made against
                    the style of Demosthenes by a contemporary Greek orator, and the defence offered
                    by the best Greek critic of oratory. Aeschines reproached the diction of
                    Demosthenes with excess of elaboration and adornment (τrepι∈pγια). Dionysius, in
                    reply, admits that Demosthenes does at times depart from simplicity,—that his
                    style is sometimes elaborately ornate and remote from the ordinary usage. But,
                    he adds, Demosthenes a&gt;dopts this manner where it is justified by the
                    elevation of his theme. The remark may serve to remind us of our modern
                    disadvantage for a full appreciation of Demosthenes. The old world felt, as we
                    do, his moral and mental greatness, his fire, his self-devotion, his insight.
                    But it felt also, as we can never feel, the versatile perfection of his skill.
                    This it was that made Demosthenes unique to the ancients. The ardent patriot,
                    the far-seeing statesman, were united in his person with the consummate and
                    unapproachable artist. Dionysius devoted two special treatises to
                    Demosthenes,—one on his language and style (λeκτικ0ς τo7ros), the other on his
                    treatment of subject-matter <hi rend="italic">(πpaγμaτLκ0&lt;i</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">tottoç).</hi> The latter is lost. The former is one of the best
                    essays in literary criticism which antiquity has bequeathed to us. The idea
                    which it works out is that Demosthenes has perfected Greek prose by fusing in a
                    glorious harmony the elements which had hitherto belonged to separate types. The
                    austere dignity of Antiphon, the plain elegance of Lysias, the smooth and
                    balanced finish of that middle or normal character which is represented by
                    Isocrates, have come together in Demosthenes. Nor is this all. In each species
                    he excels the specialists. He surpasses the school of Antiphon in perspicuity,
                    the school of Lysias in nerve, the school of Isocrates in variety, in felicity,
                    in symmetry, in pathos, in power. Demosthenes has at command all the discursive
                    brilliancy which fascinates a festal audience. He has that power of concise and
                    lucid narration, of terse reasoning, of persuasive appeal, which is required by
                    the forensic speaker. His political eloquence can worthily <pb break="no"

                    weighty counsels with lofty and impassioned fervour. A true artist, he grudged
                    no labour which could make the least part of his work more perfect. Isocrates
                    spent ten years on the <hi rend="italic">Panegyricus.</hi> After Plato’s death,
                    a manuscript was found among his papers with the first eight words of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> arranged in several different orders. What wonder,
                    then, asks the Greek critic, if the diligence of Demosthenes was no less
                    incessant and minute? “To me,” he says, “it seems far more natural that a man
                    engaged in composing political discourses, imperishable memorials of his power,
                    should neglect not even the smallest details, than that the veneration of
                    painters and sculptors, who are darkly showing forth their manual tact and toil
                    in a corruptible material, should exhaust the refinements of their art on the
                    veins, on the feathers, on the down of the lip, and the like niceties.” It may
                    be surmised that much of the admiration professed for Demosthenes in modern
                    times has been conventional. The clumsiest and coarsest forgeries which bear his
                    name long received among general readers their share of the eulogy. A soundly
                    critical study of his text is not yet sixty years old. To this day popular books
                    occasionally show traces of the notion that everything which the manuscripts
                    ascribe to him was written by him. But modern study has long since learned to
                    recognize the surest traits of his style; not, indeed, with the exquisite
                    perception of his old Greek critics, yet sufficiently, as a rule, for the
                    discrimination of genuine work from false, and on a firmer diplomatic basis. The
                    modern world can never catch again the finer tones of that great music as they
                    still echoed on the ear of Greece in her calm after-time—</p>
                <p>when all the winds were laid,</p>
                <p>And every height came out, and jutting peak And valley, and the immeasurable
                    heavens Brake open to their highest; but men can still hear the voice of a
                    prophet whose resonant warnings rise above confused sounds of strife; they can
                    still feel the energy, the anguish, the indignation which vibrate through his
                    accents; and they can acknowledge, with an admiration undiminished by the lapse
                    of twenty centuries, the power of his words to quicken the sense of honour in
                    craven hearts, to raise the votaries of selfish luxury to the loyalty of
                    prolonged self-sacrifice, to nerve irresolute arms for an inevitable struggle,
                    and, when all has been lost, to sustain the vanquished with the thought that,
                    though a power above man has forbidden them to prevail, yet their suffering has
                    saved the lustre of a memory which they were bound to guard, and has left them
                    pure before the gods.</p>
                <p>More than half of the sixty-one speeches extant under the name of Demosthenes are
                    certainly or probably spurious. Much difference of opinion still exists in
                    particular cases, especially as regards two or three of the private speeches.

                    rhetoricians. The six epistles are also forgeries; they were used by the

                    various hands and of various dates. They are valuable as being compiled from
                    Demosthenes himself, or from other classical models.</p>
                <p>The ancient fame of Demosthenes as an orator can be compared only with the fame
                    of Homer as a poet. Cicero, with generous appreciation, recognizes Demosthenes
                    as the standard of perfection. Dionysius, the closest and most penetrating of
                    his ancient critics, exhausts the language of admiration in showing how
                    Demosthenes united and elevated whatever had been best in earlier masters of the
                    Greek idiom. Hermogenes, in his works on rhetoric, refers to Demosthenes, as ó
                    <hi rend="italic">pητωp,</hi><hi rend="italic">the</hi> orator. The writer of
                    the treatise On Sublimity knows no heights loftier than those to which
                    Demosthenes has risen. From his own younger contemporaries, Aristotle and
                    Theophrastus, who founded their theory of rhetoric in large part on his <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0085-0074"/> practice, down to the latest Byzantines, the
                    consent of theorists, orators, antiquarians, anthologists, lexicographers,
                    offered the same unvarying homage to Demosthenes. His work busied commentators
                    such as Xenon, Minucian, Basilicus, Aelius Theon, Zosimus of Gaza. Arguments to
                    his speeches were drawn up by rhetoricians so distinguished as Numenius and
                    Libanius. Accomplished men of letters, such as Julius Vestinus and Aelius
                    Dionysius, selected from his writings choice passages for declamation or
                    perusal, of which fragments are incorporated in the miscellany of Photius and
                    the lexicons of Harpocration, Pollux, and Suidas. It might have been anticipated
                    that the purity of a text so widely read and so renowned would, from the
                    earliest times, have been guarded with jealous care. The works of the three
                    great dramatists had been thus protected, about 340 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> by a standard Attic recension. But no such good fortune befell the
                    works of Demosthenes. Alexandrian criticism was chiefly occupied with poetry.
                    The titular works of Demosthenes were, indeed, registered, with those of the
                    other orators, in the catalogues <hi rend="italic">(pητopικoi</hi> π∙ιvακ∈s) of
                    Alexandria and Pergamus. But no thorough attempt was made to separate the
                    authentic works from those spurious works which had even then become mingled
                    with them. Philosophical schools which, like the Stoic, felt the ethical
                    interest of Demosthenes, cared little for his language. The rhetoricians who
                    imitated or analyzed his style cared little for the criticism of his text. Their
                    treatment of it had, indeed, a direct tendency to falsify it. It was customary
                    to indicate by marks those passages which were especially useful for study or
                    imitation. It then became a rhetorical exercise to recast, adapt, or interweave
                    such passages. Sopater, the commentator on Hermogenes, wrote on <hi
                    rend="italic">μeτaβoλai κai</hi> p,eτατroιyσeιs <hi rend="italic">τωv

                    Demosthenes.” Such manipulation could not but lead to interpolations or
                    confusions in the original text. Great, too, as was the attention bestowed on
                    the thought, sentiment, and style of Demosthenes, comparatively little care was
                    bestowed on his subject-matter. He was studied more on the moral and the formal
                    side than on the real side. An incorrect substitution of one name for another, a
                    reading which gave an impossible date, insertions of spurious laws or decrees,
                    were points which few readers would stop to notice. Hence it resulted that,
                    while Plato, Thucydides, and Demosthenes were the most universally popular of
                    the classical prosewriters, the text of Demosthenes, the most widely used
                    perhaps of all, was also the least pure. His more careful students at length
                    made an effort to arrest the process of corruption. Editions of Demosthenes
                    based on a critical recension, and called ’ <hi rend="italic">Aττικιava
                    (avτlγpaφa),</hi> came to be distinguished from the vulgates, or δyμ∙ωδ∈ιs <hi
                    rend="italic">lκ8oσec&lt;s.</hi></p>
                <p>Among the extant manuscripts of Demosthenes—upwards of 170 in number—one is far
                    superior, as a whole, to the rest. This is <hi rend="italic">Parisinus</hi> S
                    2934, of the 10th century. A comparison of this MS. with the extracts of AElius,
                    Aristides, and Harpocration from the Third Philippic favours the view that it is
                    derived from an ’ Aττικιαvov, whereas the δy∕zωδ∈ις ∈κδo-σ∈ις, used by
                    Hermogenes and by the rhetoricians generally, have been the chief sources of our
                    other manuscripts. The collation of this manuscript by Immanuel Bekker first
                    placed the textual criticism of Demosthenes on a sound footing. Not only is this
                    manuscript nearly free from interpolations, but it is the sole voucher for many
                    excellent readings. Among the other MSS., some of the most important are— <hi
                    rend="italic">Marcianus</hi> 416 F, of the 10th century, the basis of the Aldine
                    edition; <hi rend="italic">Augustanus</hi> I. (N 85), derived from the last, and
                    containing scholia to the speeches on the Crown and the Embassy, by Ulpian, with
                    some by a younger writer, who was perhaps Moschopulus; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parisinus</hi> Y; <hi rend="italic">Antverpiensie</hi> Ω—the last two
                    comparatively free from additions. The fullest authority on the MSS. is Th.
                    Voemel, <hi rend="italic">Notitia codicum</hi><hi rend="italic">Demosth.,</hi>
                    and Prolegomena Critica to his edition published at Halle (1856-7), pp.
                    175-178.</p>
                <p>The extant scholia on Demosthenes are for the most part poor. Their staple
                    consists of Byzantine erudition; and their value depends chiefly on what they
                    have preserved of older criticism. They are better than usual for the ∏epi
                    Sτ∈&lt;∕&gt;αroυ, Kατα Tιμ,oκpaτoυs) best for the ∏∈pi ∏aρaτrpεσ∙- ∕3ειaς. The
                    Greek commentaries ascribed to Ulpian are especially defective on the historical
                    side, and give little essential aid. Editions :— <hi rend="italic"
