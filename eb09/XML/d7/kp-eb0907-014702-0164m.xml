                    rend="italic">βaιvω,</hi> to pass), a disease characterized by a habitually
                    excessive discharge of urine. Two forms of this complaint are described, viz.—
                    Diabetes Mellitus, or Glycosuria, where the urine is not only increased in
                    quantity, but also contains a greater or less amount of sugar, and Diabetes
                    Insipidus, or Polyuria, where the urine is simply increased in quantity, and
                    contains no abnormal ingredient. The former of these is the disease to which the
                    term diabetes is most commonly applied, and is by far the more serious and
                    important ailment.</p>
                <p>Although sometimes classed by medical writers among diseases of the kidneys, <hi
                    rend="italic">diabetes</hi><hi rend="italic">mellitus</hi> is rather to be
                    regarded as a constitutional disorder. Its cause is still a matter of
                    uncertainty, but there is sufficient evidence to connect it with a defect in the
                    process of the assimilation of food, more especially that stage in which the
                    function of the liver is concerned. The important researches of Claude Bernard,
                    and subsequently those of Schiff, Harley, Pavy, M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Donell, and others, have shown that this organ, besides the secretion of bile,
                    has the additional function of forming in large quantity a substance to which
                    the names of glycogen, dextrin, or amyloid substance have been given. This
                    matter is capable of being converted by the action of ferments into glucose, or
                    grape sugar, and such a change is supposed by some to take place normally in the
                    blood where the sugar thus formed is consumed by oxidation in the course of the
                    circulation, while by other authorities it is held that the glycogen is not
                    directly converted into sugar, but is transformed into other compounds.</p>
                <p>The theories of diabetes founded on these views ascribe its production either to
                    an excessive formation of glycogen or to some defect in its transformation, the
                    result being that grape sugar passes out of the body by the kidneys. It has long
                    been known, both by experiment and by observation in disease, that injuries to
                    certain parts of the nervous system, particularly the floor of the fourth
                    ventricle in the brain, and that portion of the sympathetic nerve which sends
                    branches to the liver and regulates its blood supply, are followed by the
                    appearance of sugar in the urine. Hence certain pathologists seek an explanation
                    for the disease in a morbid state of the parts of the nervous system whereby
                    these particular nerves are either irritated or paralyzed and the flow of blood
                    through the liver temporarily or permanently increased. It must, however, be
                    remarked that, although in some instances the portions of the nervous system
                    above mentioned are found after death to be involved in disease, this is by no
                    means constant, and that in many cases of diabetes the <hi rend="italic">post
                    mortem</hi> appearances are entirely negative. While, therefore, considerable
                    light <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n165/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0165-0148"/> has by modern research been thrown upon this
                    disease, its pathology cannot be regarded as yet settled.</p>
                <p>It ought to be mentioned that small quantities of sugar are frequently found in
                    the urine in many diseases, and even in health after articles of food rich in
                    sugar or starch have been eaten, as also in some forms of poisoning.</p>
                <p>Little is known regarding the exciting causes of diabetes. Exposure to wet and
                    cold, privation, depressing mental emotions, or mental overwork, the abuse of
                    alcohol and of saccharine and starchy substances, have all been assigned as
                    causes. It appears to be in some instances hereditary. It is most common among
                    adults, and occurs much more frequently in males than in females.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of diabetes are usually gradual in their onset, and the patient may
                    suffer for a length of time before he thinks it necessary to apply for medical
                    aid. The first symptoms which attract attention are failure of strength, and
                    emaciation, along with great thirst and an increased amount and frequent passage
                    of urine. From the normal quantity of from two to three pints in the twenty-four
                    hours it maybe increased to 10, 20, or 30 pints, or even more. It is usually of
                    pale colour, and of thicker consistence than normal urine, possesses a decidedly
                    sweet taste, and is of high specific gravity (l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    03 to l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 05). It frequently gives rise to
                    considerable irritation of the urinary passages.</p>
                <p>By simple evaporation crystals of sugar may be obtained from diabetic urine,
                    which also yields the characteristic chemical tests of sugar, while the amount
                    of this substance can be accurately estimated by certain analytical processes.
                    The quantity of sugar passed may vary from a few ounces to two or more pounds
                    per diem, and it is found to be markedly increased after saccharine or starchy
                    food has been taken. Sugar may also be found in the blood, saliva, tears, and in
                    almost all the excretions of persons suffering from this disease. One of the
                    most distressing symptoms is intense thirst, which the patient is constantly
                    seeking to allay, the quantity of liquid consumed being in general enormous, and
                    there is usually, but not invariably, a voracious appetite. The mouth is always
                    parched, and a faint, sweetish odour may be evolved from the breath. The effect
                    of the disease upon the general health is very marked, and the patient becomes
                    more and more emaciated. He suffers from increasing muscular weakness, the
                    temperature of his body is lowered, the skin is dry and harsh, the teeth are
                    loosened or decay, while dyspeptic symptoms, constipation, and loss of sexual
                    power are common accompaniments. There is in general great mental depression or
                    irritability.</p>
                <p>Diabetes as a rule advances comparatively slowly except in the case of young
                    persons, in whom its progress is apt to be rapid. Various complications arise in
                    the course of the disease, among which may be mentioned cataract, various
                    cutaneous eruptions, kidney diseases, inflammatory chest affections, and
                    especially pulmonary consumption, which is one of the most frequent modes of
                    fatal termination in diabetet. Occasionally death occurs suddenly from
                    exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Diabetes is a very fatal form of disease, recovery being exceedingly rare.
                    Nevertheless much may be done by appropriate treatment to mitigate the severity
                    of the symptoms and to prolong life.</p>
                <p>Cases may thus continue for years without material change to the worse, and in
                    some rare instances it would seem that the disease is cured. The unfavourable
                    cases are chiefly those occurring in young persons, also where serious chest or
                    other complications arise, and especially where the disease itself is of severe
                    character, the quanti ty of sugar passed being persistently large, and the
                    patient losing flesh and strength rapidly.</p>
                <p>With respect to the treatment of diabetes, the regulation of the diet has by all
                    authorities been regarded as a matter of the first importance, inasmuch as it
                    has been proved beyond question that certain kinds of food have a powerful
                    influence in aggravating the disease, more particularly those consisting largely
                    of saccharine and starchy matter; and it may be stated generally that the
                    various methods of treatment proposed aim at the elimination as far as possible
                    of these constituents from the diet. Hence it is recommended that such articles
                    as bread, potatoes, and all farinaceous foods, turnips, carrots, parsnips, and
                    most fruits should be avoided; while animal food and soups, green vegetables,
                    milk, cream, cheese, eggs, butter, and tea and coffee without sugar, may be
                    taken with advantage. As a substitute for ordinary bread, which most persons
                    find it difficult to do without for any length of time, bran bread, gluten
                    bread, almond biscuits, and even well-browned toast or rusks are recommended.
                    Alcoholic stimulants are of little or no use, but if prescribed should be in
                    those forms containing the least saccharine matter, such as claret, Burgundy,
                    brandy, or bitter ale.</p>
                <p>Thirst may be mitigated by iced water, or water slightly acidulated with
                    phosphoric acid. The employment of a diet consisting entirely of skimmed milk
                    has been recommended by Dr Donkin of London, who has obtained good results from
                    this method of treatment. The milk is administered in quantities of from 8 to 12
                    pints in the twenty-four hours, all other articles of diet being excluded.</p>
                <p>The plan of treatment once proposed, of administering sugar in large quantity in
                    diabetes, proved to be highly injurious, and is now abandoned.</p>
                <p>Numerous medicinal substances have been employed in diabetes, but few of them are
                    worthy of mention as possessed of any efficacy. Opium is often found of great
                    service, its administration being followed with marked amelioration in all the
                    symptoms, and, according to some high authorities, with cure of the disease. It
                    is borne in diabetes in larger doses than usual, and from 5 to 12 grains or wore
                    may be taken in the twenty-four hours. In like manner codeia (one of the
                    constituents of opium), in doses of half a grain increased to two or three
                    grains three times a day, has been used with good effect.</p>
                <p>In most cases, however, it is the dieting of the patient to which the physician
                    has to look in dealing successfully with this formidable disease; and sufferers
                    ought always to be impressed with the necessity of strictly abstaining from
                    those articles of food which by general consent are allowed to exercise a
                    hurtful influence in aggravating the symptoms.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">diabetes insipidus,</hi> there is constant thirst and an
                    excessive flow of urine, which, however, is not found to contain any abnormal
                    constituent. Its effects upon the system are often similar to those of diabetes
                    mellitus, except that they are much less marked, the disease being in general
                    very slow in its progress. In some cases the health appears to suffer very
                    slightly. It is rarely a direct cause of death, but from its debilitating
                    effects may predispose to serious and fatal complications. Little is known as to
                    its pathology, but it is generally supposed to own a similar origin to diabetes
                    mellitus. It is best treated by tonics and generous diet. Opium and valerian
                    have been found beneficial. (J. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.)</hi></p>
