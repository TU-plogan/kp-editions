                    ancient Roman republic. The original name of this office was <hi rend="italic"

                    seemed that the safety of the state might advantageously be intrusted for the
                    time to some one man, whose past life had gained for him the esteem and respect
                    of the whole body of the citizens. The idea of this office was borrowed by the
                    Romans from the constitution of some of the Latin towns which they had subdued.
                    It lay with the senate to decide when the services of a dictator were necessary.
                    The power of nominating a man to the office was by that body made over to one of
                    the consuls. It is not exactly determined to which of these officers the
                    nomination of a dictator properly appertained.</p>
                <p>The insignia of the dictator’s office were—first, the lictors, twenty-four in
                    number, who bore the fasces and secures; second, the curule chair; and third,
                    the toga praetexta.</p>
                <p>The first dictator was appointed at Rome 501 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> nine
                    years after the expulsion of the Tarquins. Who the first dictator was is
                    differently stated by different historians, but it is most probable that it was
                    T. Lartius.</p>
                <p>Dictators were generally appointed to conduct a foreign war, but it often
                    happened that in matters of less importance they were appointed with nominal
                    authority. The dictator was generally selected in the absence of the consuls to
                    perform some small ceremonies, which in strict propriety could only be gone
                    through by one of the consuls. Thus he was sometimes chosen to hold the comitia,
                    to appoint holidays, to affix the <hi rend="italic">clavus annalis</hi> in the
                    temple of Jupiter, and to preside at trials. As soon as the dictator was
                    appointed, he was required to select a master of the horse <hi rend="italic"
                    >(magister</hi><hi rend="italic">equitum),</hi> whose term of office was the
                    same as his own.</p>
                <p>The power of the dictator was absolute; and so long., as he remained in office no
                    appeal was open against his mandates to any other authority in the state. He was
                    nearly altogether independent of the senate. He could inflict much severer
                    punishments than the consuls without being liable, as these officers were, to
                    have his sentence reversed by the assembly of the people. His power was as
                    irresponsible as it was absolute. In token of the absolute power of the
                    dictators over the lives of their fellow-citizens, their lictors bore the axe in
                    the midst of the fasces, even in their walks through the city—a mark of
                    distinction which the consuls had formerly enjoyed, but which had been abolished
                    in their case by the Valerian law.</p>
                <p>Though the power of the dictator was thus great, it was nevertheless limited by
                    certain indirect restrictions. The most important of these was, that he had no
                    control whatever over the public money, and had to content himself with such
                    sums as were allowed him by the senate. He was not allowed to leave Italy; and
                    could not appear on horseback in the city without the express permission of the
                    people. The surest safeguard, however, against any treacherous designs on the
                    part of the dictator was the shortness of the period during which he remained in
                    office. This was never permitted to exceed six months.</p>
                <p>When a dictator was appointed, all the ordinary magistrates ceased to be directly
                    responsible to the governing authorities of the state, and took their orders
                    directly from him. The only magistrates exempt from this necessity were the
                    tribunes of the commons. The inferior officers, however, did not, as has been
                    supposed, retire from office altogether. They merely obeyed the dictator so long
                    as he continued in power, and on his resignation entered once more upon the
                    untrammelled exercise of their authority.</p>
                <p>It remains to be added that dictators were only appointed at Rome so long as
                    Italy remained unsubdued. The last dictator appointed at Rome held office in 202
                    B.c.; from that time the constitutional dictatorship disappears from Roman
                    history.</p>
