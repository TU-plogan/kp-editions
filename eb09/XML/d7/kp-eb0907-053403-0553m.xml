                    2° 58' W.; it is distant from Edinburgh 42 miles N.N.E., from Perth 22 miles E.,
                    and from Forfar, the county-town, 14 miles S. It extends nearly three miles
                    along the shores of the Tay, and varies in breadth from half a mile to a mile;
                    and the ground gradually rises towards the hill of Balgay and Dundee Law, the
                    summit of the latter being 535 feet above the sea-level. Its general appearance
                    is pleasing and picturesque, and the surrounding scenery very beautiful.</p>
                <p>Dundee is the chief seat of the linen manufacture in Britain, and from a very
                    early time appears to have had a special reputation in this branch of industry.
                    Hector Boece, a native of the town, in his <hi rend="italic">History and
                    Cronilclis of Scotland,</hi> thus quaintly refers to it: “Dunde, the toun quhair
                    we wer born; quhair mony virtewus and lauborius pepill ar in, making of claith.”
                    It was not, however, till the introduction of steam power, in the beginning of
                    the present century, that there was any remarkable development of flax-spinning
                    in Dundee. The first work of importance was the Bell Mill (which is still
                    extant), built in 1806; and the first power-loom factory was erected in 1836.
                    Side by side with the extension of the linen trade has been that of jute
                    spinning and weaving. Large cargoes of this material are imported into Dundee
                    direct from India, and it is manipulated on an enormous scale. In fact, the
                    manufacture of flax, hemp, and jute fabrics constitutes the staple trade of the
                    town, and supports, directly or indirectly, the great bulk of the inhabitants.
                    There are upwards of seventy steam spinning-mills and power-loom factories,
                    employing above 50,000 persons. Some of these buildings are of great size and
                    considerable architectural elegance, those of Messrs Baxter, Messrs Cox, and
                    Messrs Gilroy being especially conspicuous. These three afford employment to
                    above 12,000 hands. The principal textile productions are osnaburgs, dowlas,
                    canvas, sheetings, bagging, jute carpeting, &amp;c.; and the total value of
                    these fabrics annually produced has been estimated at upwards of £7,000,000.
                    Among the other industries of Dundee may be mentioned ship-building,
                    engineering, tanning, and leather manufactures (including shoemaking by
                    machinery), all of which are conducted on a large scale. There are also
                    considerable foundries, breweries, corn and flour mills, and confectionery and
                    fruitpreserving works—Messrs Keiller &lt;fc Son’s “Dundee marmalade” having a
                    most extensive reputation. The prosperity of Dundee is in a large measure due to
                    its commodious harbour and its magnificent docks. The harbour works extend about
                    two miles along the river side, and the docks, five in number, cover an area of
                    35 acres. Although they cannot compare in extent with those of London or
                    Liverpool, they are probably unsurpassed in the kingdom for stability and
                    convenience. They have cost, from 1815, when the works were begun, to May 1877,
                    £800,000; and the harbour revenue amounted in 1876 to £50,751. The principal
                    imports for year ending May 1876 were </p>

                <p>The principal public buildings are the following :—The Town-House, designed by
                    “the elder Adam,” and erected in 1734, a plain but pleasing structure; the
                    Custom-House; the Post-Office; the Town Churches, an imposing group, surmounted
                    by a noble old tower; St Paul’s Free Churçh, with spire 167 feet high; St Paul’s
                    Episcopalian Church, designed by Sir G. G. Scott, with spire 211 feet high; the
                    High School, a fine specimen of Grecian Doric, designed by Angus; Morgan
                    (Hospital, erected and endowed by bequest (amounting to nearly £80,000) of the
                    late Mr John Morgan, a native of Dundee, for the board and education of a
                    hundred boys; the Royal Infirmary, a magnificent structure in the Tudor style,
                    designed by Coe and Godwin, and costing about £ 15,000; the Lunatic Asylum; the
                    New Orphan Institution; the Industrial Schools; the Convalescent Hospital; the
                    Asylum for Imbecile Children; the Deaf and Dumb Institution, the Royal Exchange;
                    the Clydesdale Bank; the court-house and police buildings, with a fine bold
                    portico; the Eastern Club, designed by Pilkington and Bell; the Christian Young
                    Men’s Association Buildings; the Theatre Royal, drill hall, newspaper offices,
                    and public baths. To these may be added as deserving of notice the Royal Arch,
                    designed by Mr Rochead, and commemorating Her Majesty’s visit to Dundee in 1844,
                    and the Albert Institute, a Gothic building in memory of the late Prince Consort
                    (mainly designed by Sir G. Gilbert Scott), and erected, at a cost of upwards of
                    £20,000, on a site purchased for £8000. Bronze statues of George Kinloch, the
                    first M.P. for Dundee in the Reformed Parliament, and James Carmichael, the
                    engineer, have been erected in Albert Square.</p>
                <p>The most notable of the few antiquities of Dundee is the "Old Steeple” (dating
                    from the 14th century), 156 feet high, which has been recently restored, under
                    the direction of Sir G. Gilbert Scott, R.A., at a cost of £7000. Dudhope Castle,
                    the old seat of the Scrym-seoures, hereditary constables of the burgh, and
                    granted by James II. to Viscount Dundee, is now used as barracks. The old
                    custom-house, in the Green Market, is a quaint building of the 16th century. The
                    East Port, the sole relic of the ancient walls, is allowed to stand in
                    commemoration of George Wishart the martyr, who, according to tradition,
                    preached from it during the plague in 1544. The pillar of the old town cross,
                    bearing date 1586, has been re-erected. In High Street, Vault, Castle Court, and
                    Fish Street there still remain a few buildings of the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    But the castle, the mint, and the numerous convents have entirely disappeared,
                    the last of the monastic buildings, once occupied by the nuns of St Clare,
                    having been demolished only a few years ago. The old burying-ground (or “Howff
                    ”), now closed, contains many interesting monuments and epitaphs. Three spacious
                    suburban burying-grounds have taken its place—the Western Cemetery, the Eastern
                    Necropolis, and the Balgay Cemetery. Till the middle of the present century, or
                    even later, many of the streets were narrow and irregular, and many of the
                    buildings unhealthy and unsightly; but of late a great change for the better has
                    taken place. Under the Improvement Act of 1871, the narrow gorge of the
                    Murraygate has been swept away; the ugly and tortuous Bucklemaker Wynd has been
                    transformed into the spacious Victoria Road, with the Victoria Bridge at its
                    upper end; and a dense and dingy mass of buildings between Meadowside and
                    Seagate has been replaced by Commercial Street, which, when completed, will be
                    one of the finest civic thoroughfares in Britain. Many improvements still remain
                    to be accomplished, and although the total cost will probably amount to
                    £400,000, it is expected that there will be ultimately a profit on the street
                    improvements. By the aid of local building societies a large number of working
                    men’s houses have recently been erected; and a double line of tramways has been
                    laid from the post-office to the west end of the town.</p>
                <p>Dundee is well supplied with recreation grounds. The Baxter Park, 35 acres in
                    extent, designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, was presented by Sir David Baxter to the
                    community in 1863; the pavilion contains a marble statue of the donor by Sir
                    John Steell, erected by public subscription. The Balgay Park, a picturesque
                    wooded hill commanding fine prospects on every side, was secured by the police
                    commissioners and opened to the public in 1871. Besides these there are the
                    Magdalen Green, the Barrack Park, the Bleaching Green, and Dundee Law. A
                    magnificent promenade along the river side between Magdalen Point and the Craig
                    Pier has lately been opened. It is called the Esplanade, and incloses a space of
                    54 acres, which when filled up will give ample station and traffic accommodation
                    for the Caledonian and North British railways, and leave the public a clear
                    carriage-way and foot-path by the river side. The expense of the undertaking
                    (about £40,000) is borne in nearly equal proportions by the two railway
                    companies and the Harbour Trustees. An extensive abattoir and cattle market have
                    recently been constructed by the police commissioners at the east end of the
                    town. Dundee has regular and frequent steam-boat traffic with London, Hull,
                    Newcastle, Liverpool, Leith, and Rotterdam. To render communication with the
                    south more direct, the North British Railway Company designed the Tay Bridge, a
                    colossal work, completed in 1877 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridges,</hi> vol.
                    iv. p. 340).</p>
                <p>The water supply of Dundee is copious and excellent. Thirty years ago works were
                    established at Monikie, but in time the quantity (about 2⅜ million gallons per
                    day) proved insufficient, while the quality deteriorated. The loch of
                    Lintrathen, 20 miles distant, with necessary grounds, was accordingly purchased
                    for £33,108. The surface of the loch, originally 180 acres, has been raised 20
                    feet, and is now 405 acres in extent; the storage capacity is 257,000,000 cubic
                    feet; the drainage area, 19,000 acres. The main pipe from Lintrathen, 27inches
                    indiameter, transmittingδ million gallons per day, conveys the water to Clatto
                    reservoir, four miles from the town, which has an area of 21 acres, and holds 80
                    million gallons; two pipes from Clatto lead to the service reservoirs. The total
                    cost of the works exceeds £305,000.</p>

                    witnessed the beginning of that rapid and healthy growth which of late years has
                    been so marked. The following figures show the population at successive periods
                    of 30 years since 1755 :—</p>

                <p>In 1876 the births numbered 5231, deaths 3076, maιτiages 1222. The birth-rate was
                    37 and the death-rate 22 per 1000.</p>
                <p>The rainfall in Dundee for 1876 was 43 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 12 inches,
                    which is considerably above the average, in fact, the highest of any recorded
                    year except 1872, when it was 43’70. The number of “wet days” in 1876 was 230,
                    being 50 above the average. The prevailing winds are westerly.</p>
                <p>Previous to 1832, Dundee was grouped with Forfar, Perth, Cupar, and St Andrews in
                    returning a member to Parliament; the Reform Act gave it the privilege of a
                    member for itself, and the Act of 1868 added another. For municipal purposes the
                    town is divided into nine wards, the third of which includes the populous and
                    thriving suburb of Lochee. The town council is composed of the provost, dean of
                    guild, 6 bailies, and 20 councillors; these are also the police and water
                    commissioners. Part of the town being rn the parish of Dundee, and part in the
                    united parishes of Liff and Benvie, there are two parochial boards. When the
                    Education Act came into operation (1873) there was class-room accommodation
                    within the burgh for 17,719 pupils, and since then the school board has built or
                    enlarged 10 schools. In 1877 there was accommodation for 20,615 pupils, and the
                    number of children in the town of school age, that is from 5 to 13 years, was
                    estimated at 21,000. The principal educational institution is the high school,
                    where an excellent curriculum is available; and since 1875 classes, taught by
                    professors from St Andrews, have been opened for the study of chemistry,
                    geology, physiology, and literature.</p>
                <p>In 1866 the ratepayers cordially adopted the Free Libraries’ Act, and advantage
                    has been largely taken of the privileges thus afforded. The library premises are
                    centrically situated in Albert Square, and include a lending library, reference
                    library, museum, and picture gallery, admission being free. In the lending
                    library there are 25,000 volumes, in the reference library 5500. A fine arts
                    exhibition is occasionally held within the free library buildings, and an Art
                    Union for Dundee has just been sanctioned by the Board of Trade.</p>
                <p>There are 78 places of worship in the town, which may be classified as follows
                    :—In connection with the Established Church, 16; Free Church, 20; U.P. Church,
                    11; Congregationalist, 6; Episcopalian, 5; Roman Catholic, 4; Baptist, 3; other
                    denominations, 13.</p>
                <p>Lochee, a suburb of Dundee, forming part of the municipality, is situated about
                    two miles to the north by the Coupar-Angus road. Till within recent years only a
                    small country village, it has now a population of 15,000. It contains several
                    flax and jute factories,— by far the largest and most comprehensive in the whole
                    district being the Camperdown Linen Works, belonging to Messrs Cox Brothers and
                    Co. They cover an area of 25 acres, and employ upwards of 5000 persons. The most
                    striking external feature, and one of the prominent landmarks in the district,
                    is the stately chimney-stalk (282 feet high) in the style cf the Italian
                    campaniles, built of parti-coloured bricks, with stone cornices.</p>
                <p>Brougnty Ferry, three miles distant, towards the mouth of the Firth of Tay, may
                    also be considered as a suburb of Dundee. The name originally <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bruch-tuy,</hi> is believed to be Pictish, and refers to the castle or
                    fortress, which is mentioned repeatedly during the wars of the 16th century. Its
                    picturesque ruins continued till about 1857, when they were removed to make way
                    for the present fort, which is intended as a defence for the Tay, and which
                    mounts 9 guns, and can accommodate 60 men. Broughty Ferry is a burgh under the
                    General Police Act, which was adopted in 1864, and is partly in the parish of
                    Dundee partly in that of Monifieth. Some thirty years ago it was only a fishing
                    village, although designed and partly laid out with a degree of breadth and
                    regularity in the streets which fishing-villages rarely display. The population
                    in 1861 was 3513, in 1871 it was 5707, and now (1877) it is estimated at 8000.
                    There are nine churches of various denominations, the finest, in an
                    architectural point of view, being the East Free and tlιe Episcopalian, the
                    latter designed by Sir G. G. Scott. Some of the villas on and around Fort Hill,
                    occupied by Dundee merchants, are exceedingly handsome. Reres Hill and the
                    Castle Green have been acquired by the commissioners of police as recreation
                    grounds for the use of the public.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Dundee is said to have been at one time called
                    <hi rend="italic">Alectum,</hi> but of this assertion there is no explicit
                    documentary evidence. The earliest authentic mention of the town is in a deed of
                    gift by Dâvid earl of Huntingdon, dated about 1200, which distinctly designated
                    it “Dunde.” The origin of the name is disputed,—some absurdly tracing it to the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">Donum Dei,</hi> “the gift of God,” others to the Celtic
                    <hi rend="italic">Dun Dhia,</hi> the Hill of God, others to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dun taw,</hi> the hill or fort on the Tay; the last named derivation is the
                    most probable. Dundee was erected into a royal burgh by William the Lion, and
                    has always been a place of considerable importance, figuring conspicuously in
                    the early history of Scotland, especially about the time when Bruce and Baliol
                    were contending for the crown. It was here that Wallace was educated; and here
                    he struck the first blow against the English domination. In the great
                    Reformation movement of the 16th century the inhabitants took such a leading and
                    active part as to earn for the town the appellation of “the Scottish Geneva.”
                    Few places have been subjected to more frequent or serious calamities. It was
                    twice taken by the English in the reign of Edward I., again in that of Richard
                    II., and a fourth time in that of Edward VI. The marquis of Montrose took it by
                    assault, and set part of it on fire in 1645; and in 1651 it was besieged by
                    General Monk, and, after an obstinate resistance, was taken by storm, and given
                    up to plunder and massacre. It was then probably the most opulent, and was
                    certainly the best fortified town in Scotland, and many people of note from
                    Edinburgh and elsewhere had found refuge within its walls. More than one-sixth
                    of the inhabitants and garrison, including the brave governor Lumsden, were put
                    to the sword; while the plunder was so great as to fill 60 vessels which were
                    seized in the harbour; but, says Gumble in his life of Monk, “the ships were
                    cast away within sight of the town, and that great wealth perished.”
                    Notwithstanding the number of burnings and plunderings to which Dundee has been
                    subjected, the collection of charters, council-records, and other ancient
                    documents preserved in the archives of the Town House is remarkably interesting
                    and complete. There are characteristic despatches from Edward I. and Edward II.,
                    the original charter of King Robert Bruce, dated 1327, a papal order from Leo
                    X., and a letter from Queen Mary, dated 1564, providing for extra-mural
                    interments. (C. C. Μ.)</p>
