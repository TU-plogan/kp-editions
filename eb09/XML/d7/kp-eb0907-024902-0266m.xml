                    term applied to an acute infectious disease, which is accompanied by a
                    membranous exudation on a mucous surface, generally on the tonsils and back of
                    the throat or pharynx. Although popularly believed to be a newly discovered
                    disease, there is distinct evidence that diphtheria was known to the ancient
                    physicians as a malady of great virulence. Under the name of the <hi

                    description of a disease which in all its essential characteristics corresponds
                    to diphtheria. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries epidemics of diphtheria
                    appear to have frequently prevailed in many parts of Europe, particularly in
                    Holland, Spain, Italy, France, as well as in England, and w ere described by
                    physicians belonging to those countries under various titles; but it is probable
                    that other diseases of a similar nature were included in their descriptions, and
                    no accurate account of this affection had been published till M. Bretonneau of
                    Tours in 1821 laid his celebrated treatise on the subject before the French
                    Academy of Medicine. By him the term <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Diplvtherτte</hi> was first given to the disease. The subject has since been
                    largely investigated both in Britain and on the Continent, where epidemics more
                    or less extensive have been of common occurrence in recent times; but while many
                    important facts have been made out <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0267-0250"/> regarding the pathology of diphtheria, the real
                    nature of the malady still appears to be undetermined. By some it is regarded as
                    primarily a blood poison, the local manifestations being secondary and not
                    essential, while others hold, and this is the view now largely maintained by
                    Continental authorities, that diphtheria is at first a local disease, the
                    constitution becoming secondarily affected or poisoned from the local affection.
                    This latter view receives support both from experiments on inoculation of the
                    disease in animals, and from the discovery in the diphtheritic membranes and
                    surrounding tissues, as well as in the blood and other fluids of persons
                    suffering from diphtheria, of the lower forms of vegetable organism (bacteria,
                    micrococci, &lt;fcc.), which are supposed to be the infecting agents both in the
                    local affection and in its general constitutional effects. Whether this be the
                    correct explanation of the disease, or whether as is held by many, these
                    organisms are to be looked upon merely as accompaniments or complications of the
                    affection, not present in all cases, the following facts appear to be made out
                    respecting diphtheria :—</p>
                <p>1. That it is a disease communicable both by infection and by contagion.</p>
                <p>2. That grave constitutional disturbance is a constant and prominent symptom of
                    diphtheria.</p>
                <p>3. That certain important consequences or, as they are termed, sequelae are apt
                    to follow diphtheria, particularly some forms of paralysis.</p>
                <p>These points, moreover, serve to distinguish this disease from croup, which,
                    although in some cases presenting certain features of resemblance to diphtheria,
                    differs from it in being a merely local inflammatory affection. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Croup.</hi></p>
                <p>As already observed, diphtheria has frequently appeared as an epidemic. It is
                    probably more common in a sporadic form (single cases). It is sometimes endemic
                    in certain localities where the hygienic conditions are bad; and there is ample
                    evidence to show that air or water contaminated with decomposing animal matter
                    may readily cause an outbreak of diphtheria. The influence of climate, weather,
                    and condition of soil appear to be inappreciable. When the disease has broken
                    out in a dwelling it is apt to spread not merely by direct contagion, but
                    apparently also through the air of apartments, this being notably the case in
                    overcrowded habitations. The contagiousness of diphtheria is very marked, and
                    has unhappily been often exemplified in the case of physicians, who have fallen
                    victims to the disease from inoculation with its morbid products when
                    cauterizing the throats or performing tracheotomy in those suffering from it.
                    Children appear to be on the whole rather more liable to diphtheria than adults;
                    and although the most robust people may be attacked, those whose health is
                    weakened by any cause are specially predisposed. One attack of diphtheria
                    appears to afford no immunity from others.</p>
                <p>It must be observed, however, that the mere existence of a sore throat
                    accompanied with some amount of membranous exudation does not constitute
                    diphtheria, as is often erroneously supposed by non-medical persons, who are apt
                    to fancy they have had diphtheria several times from having suffered from what
                    is a comparatively simple complaint. The diagnosis can only be reliably made by
                    a medical man.</p>
                <p>Cases of diphtheria differ as to their intensity from the mildest forms, which
                    resemble an ordinary catarrhal sore throat, to those of the most severe
                    character (such as the gangrenous form), where the disease is hopelessly intract
                    able from the first.</p>
                <p>In general the symptoms at the commencement of an attack of diphtheria are
                    comparatively slight, being those commonly accompanying a cold, viz., chilliness
                    and depression. Sometimes more severe phenomena usher in the attack, such as
                    vomiting and diarrhoea. A slight feeling of uneasiness in the throat is
                    experienced along with some stiffness of the back of the neck. When looked at
                    the throat appears reddened and somewhat swollen, particularly in the
                    neighbourhood of the tonsils, the soft palate, and upper part of pharynx, while
                    along with this there is tenderness and swelling of the glands at the angles of
                    the jaws. The affection of the throat spreads rapidly, and soon the
                    characteristic exudation appears on the inflamed surface in the form of
                    greyish-white specks or patches, increasing in extent and thickness until a
                    yellowish-looking false membrane is formed. This deposit is firmly adherent to
                    the mucous membrane beneath or incorporated with it, and if removed leaves a
                    raw, bleeding, ulcerated surface, upon which it is reproduced in a short period.
                    The appearance of the exudation has been compared to wet parchment or washed
                    leather, and it is more or less dense in texture. It may cover the whole of the
                    back of the throat, the cavity of the mouth, and the posterior nares, and spread
                    downwards into the air passages on the one hand and into the alimentary canal on
                    the other, while any wound on the surface of the body is liable to become
                    covered with it. This membrane is apt to be detached spontaneously, and as it
                    loosens it becomes decomposed, giving a most offensive and characteristic odour
                    to ths breath. There is pain and difficulty in swallowing, but unless the
                    disease has affected the larynx no affection of the breathing. The voice
                    acquires a snuffling character. When the disease invades the posterior nares an
                    acrid, fetid discharge, and sometimes also copious bleeding, takes place from
                    the nostrils. Along with these local phenomena there is evidence of
                    constitutional disturbance of the most severe character. There may be no great
                    amount of fever, but there is marked depression and loss ’ of strength. The
                    pulse becomes small and frequent, the countenance pale, the swelling of the
                    glands of the neck increases, which, along with the presence of albumen in the
                    urine, testifies to a condition of blood poisoning. Unless favourable symptoms
                    emerge death takes place within three or four days or sooner, either from the
                    rapid extension of the false membrane into the air passage, giving rise to
                    asphyxia, or from a condition of general collapse, which is sometimes remarkably
                    sudden. In cases of recovery the change for the better is marked by an arrest in
                    the extension of the false membrane, the detachment and expectoration of that
                    already formed, and the healing of the ulcerated mucous membrane beneath. Along
                    with this there is a general improvement in the symptoms, the power of
                    swallowing returns, and the strength gradually increases, while the glandular
                    enlargement of the neck diminishes, and the albumen disappears from the urine.
                    Recovery, however, is generally slow, and it is many weeks before full
                    convalescence is established. Even, however, where diphtheria ends thus
                    favourably, the peculiar sequelae already mentioned are apt to follow, generally
                    within a period of two or three weeks after all the local evidence of the
                    disease has disappeared. These secondary affections may occur after mild as well
                    as after severe attacks, and they are principally in the form of paralysis
                    affecting the soft palate and pharynx, causing difficulty in swallowing with
                    regurgitation of food through the nose, and giving a peculiar nasal character to
                    the voice. There are, however, other forms of paralysis occurring after
                    diphtheria, especially that effecting the muscles of the eye, which produces a
                    loss of the poweι of accommodation and consequent impairment of vision. There
                    may be, besides, paralysis of both legs, and occasionally also of one side of
                    the body (hemiplegia). These symptoms, however, after continuing for a variable
                    length of time, almost always ultimately disappear.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of diphtheria regard must be had both <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0268-0251"/> to the local and general nature of the disease.
                    Difference of opinion exists among physicians as to the utility of topical
                    applications in the form of caustics applied to the affected parts, some
                    attaching great importance to their use as tending to arrest the progress of the
                    disease, while others hold that the irritation so produced favours the spread of
                    the false membranes. Probably at the outset, when the local manifestations are
                    but slight, the use of such a caustic as nitrate of silver, either in the solid
                    form or in strong solution, may be of service; but after any considerable
                    surface has been invaded by the false membrane little good, it is to be feared,
                    can be done in this way. The forcible removal of the false membrane is generally
                    condemned, as by this means a raw bleeding surface is left, upon which the
                    deposit is reproduced with great rapidity. The exudation, however, tends to be
                    cast off spontaneously by a process of suppuration, and, as favouring this, and
                    at the same time acting as a soothing remedy, the inhalation of steam is
                    recommended. The employment, in the form of spray or of washes or gargles, of
                    solutions of carbolic acid, Condy’s fluid, perchloride of iron, chlorine water,
                    or chlorate of potash, is valuable in the way of disinfecting the parts, and
                    subduing the fetid exhalations which are always present. When the disease has
                    spread into the larynx and the breathing is embarrassed, an emetic may be of use
                    in aiding the expulsion of the false membrane. It is, however, in great measure
                    to the constitutional treatment that the physician’s attention must be directed
                    in diphtheria. The effect of the disease upon the patient’s strength is so
                    marked that from the very beginning there is an urgent demand for strong
                    nourishment, which should be freely administered in the form of milk, soup,
                    &amp;c., as long as there exists the power of swallowing, and when this fails
                    nutrient enemata should be resorted to. Large doses of quinine and of the
                    tincture of the perchloride of iron are recommended, and stimulants will in
                    almost all cases be called for from an early period. The question of tracheotomy
                    has to be considered when the false membrane has spread into the air passages
                    and threatens death by asphyxia; and although the operation in such
                    circumstances affords but a feeble chance of success, the cases of recovery by
                    this means have been sufficiently numerous to justify its employment as a last
                    resort. The paralysis •which follows diphtheria usually yields in the course of
                    time to tonics and. good nourishment.</p>
                <p>It should be mentioned that in all cases of diphtheria means should be taken by
                    isolation of the patient and the use of disinfectants to prevent as far as
                    possible the spread of the disease in a household; while the attendants ought to
                    be scrupulously careful to avoid inoculation with the products of the disease,
                    and should frequently use gargles of some of those substances above mentioned,
