                    rend="smallcaps">Louiche(1751-1833),</hi> French botanist, was a native of
                    Brittany, born at Tremblay, in the department of Ile-et-Vilaine, in 1751 or
                    1752. He was sent to the town school, but made slow progress in learning, and
                    was at length dismissed by the schoolmaster as a dullard and a robber of apple
                    orchards. This treatment left a life-long painful impression on his mind. At the
                    college of Rennes, to which he was next sent, he applied himself heartily to
                    study, and rejoiced in a success which falsified the judgment of his old master.
                    From Rennes he passed to Paris, to study medicine; but this soon became a
                    secondary pursuit, his chief attention being drawn to the study of plants. At
                    Paris he acquired the friendship of Lemonnier, physician to the king, and of
                    Jussieu. At the age of thirty he took his degree of M.D., and in 1783 he was
                    elected member of the Academy of Sciences. In the same year he set out for North
                    Africa, and spent two years in a scientific exploration of Barbary. In 1785 he
                    returned to Paris, bringing with him a large collection of plants, animals, and
                    other objects illustrative of natural history. The collection, it is stated,
                    comprised 1600 species of plants, of which about 300 were described for the
                    first time. His successful labours were rewarded, and a new congenial field of
                    work was opened to him, by his nomination by Buffon to the post of professor at
                    the <hi rend="italic">Jardin</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes,</hi> vacated in
                    his favour by his friend Lemonnier. The garden, says one of his biographers, now
                    became his world. His life was thenceforth marked by few incidents. He devoted
                    himself to his pupils, to his plants, and to the preparation of various
                    botanical works. He purposed to publish a narrative of his African explorations,
                    but the manuscript journal being lent to Lemonnier, and by him to the king,
                    Louis XVI., was lost, and only a few fragments of the narrative appeared. His
                    great work is entitled <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi><hi rend="italic">Atlantica
                    sive historia plantarum quae in Atlante, agro Tunetano et Algeriensi
                    crescunt.</hi> It was published in 2 vols. 4to in 1798, and is esteemed for the
                    singular clearness and precision of its descriptions and its nomenclature.
                    Desfontaines, as a recluse student, escaped the perils of the Reign of Terror.
                    On two occasions he courageously quitted his retirement to rescue the
                    naturalists Ramond and Lheritier from prison and from death. He was admitted to
                    the Legion of Honour at the time of its establishment. At the age of sixty-three
                    he married a young wife, but the prospect of happiness thus opened was soon
                    closed by her death. In 1831 he became blind, and was reduced to the recognition
                    of his favourite plants by touch alone. Desfontaines was author of many valuable
                    memoirs on vegetable anatomy and physiology, descriptions of new genera and
                    species, &amp;c., contributed to learned societies and scientific journals. One
                    of the most important was the “Memoir on the Organization of the
                    Monocotyledons,” which gave him a high place among discoverers. He published in
                    1804 a <hi rend="italic">Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">de l'école
                    botanique</hi><hi rend="italic">du museum</hi><hi rend="italic">d'histoire
                    naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> of which a third edition appeared
                    in 1831, under the new title <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Plantarum Horti
                    Regii</hi><hi rend="italic">Parisiensis.</hi> His modesty, simplicity of life,
                    and good humour endeared him to his friends and to his pupils. He died at Paris
                    on the 16th November 1833, a daughter surviving him. His Barbary collection was
                    bequeathed to the museum, and his general collection passed into the handsof the
                    botanistWebb.</p>
