                    Surrey, five miles from London Bridge, remarkable for its college and picture
                    gallery. The manor, which had belonged to the Cluniac monks of Bermondsey, was
                    granted by Henry VIII., in 1541, to Thomas Calton; and his grandson, Sir Francis
                    Calton, sold it in 1606 to Edward Alleyn, whose name is indissolubly associated
                    with the place by his princely foundation. Dulwich College, or, as he quaintly
                    and piously called it, “God’s Gift College” (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Alleyn,</hi> vol. i. p. 584), was opened with great state on September 13,
                    1619, in the presence of Lord Chancellor Bacon, Lord Arundell, Inigo Jones, and
                    other distinguished men. According to the letters patent the almspeople and
                    scholars were to be chosen in equal proportions from the parishes of St Giles
                    (Camberwell), St Botolph without Bishopsgate, and St Saviour’s (Southwark), and
                    “that part of the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate which is in the county
                    of Middlesex.” By a series of statutes signed in 1626, a few days before his
                    death, Alleyn ordained that his school should be for the instruction of 80 boys
                    consisting of three distinct classes :—(1) the twelve poor scholars; (2)
                    children of inhabitants of Dulwich (who were to be taught freely); and (3)
                    “towne or foreign schollers,” who were “to pay such allowance as the master and
                    wardens shall appoint.” That it was the founder’s intention to establish a great
                    public school upon the model of Westminster and St Paul’s, with a liberal
                    provision for university training, is conclusively shown by the statutes; but he
                    was scarcely dead when his grand project was overthrown, and for more than two
                    centuries the educational benefits of God’s Gift College were restricted to the
                    twelve poor scholars. In 1858, however, the foundation was entirely
                    reconstituted by Act of Parliament. The government of the college is now vested
                    in 19 governors, of whom 11 are nominated by the Court of Chancery and 8 elected
                    by the four parishes already mentioned. The first head of the reconstituted
                    college, and the first also who has not borne the name of Alleyn, is the Rev. A.
                    J. Carver, D.D. The revenue is at present (1877) more than .£17,000 a year, with
                    the prospect of a large and progressive increase. After provision for the
                    expenses of management and the maintenance of the chapel and library, the
                    surplus is divided into four portions, of which three are assigned to the
                    educational and one to the eleemosynary branch of the foundation. The
                    educational foundation comprises two distinct schools, the “Upper” and the
                    “Lower.” In the former the curriculum of study, as defined by Act of Parliament,
                    includes, besides ancient and modern languages and mathematics, drawing and
                    designing, civil engineering, physics, chemistry, and other branches of science;
                    in the latter it is similar to that adopted in so-called middle-class schools.
                    The Upper School contained in 1877 nearly 600 boys, and the Lower 160. The
                    buildings of the lipper School are a splendid pile, designed by Mr Charles
                    Barry, in the “Northern Italian style of the 13th century.” They are said to
                    form the most commodious and complete, as probably they have proved the most
                    costly, fabric erected for educational purposes in recent times. The main
                    architectural feature is the interior of the great hall, which will compare
                    advantageously with some of the best college halls at Oxford or Cambridge. There
                    are about 25 acres of play-ground and cricket-field included within the boundary
                    fence of the college. Dulwich College possesses one advantage peculiar to itself
                    in its splendid picture gallery, bequeathed to the college by Sir P. F.
                    Bourgeois, R.A., in 1811, with a separate endowment of £520 a year. The pictures
                    most widely known and most highly appreciated are probably the exquisite
                    Murillos and the choice specimens of the Dutch school. The surplus income of the
                    gallery fund is devoted to instruction in drawing and design in the two
                    schools.</p>
