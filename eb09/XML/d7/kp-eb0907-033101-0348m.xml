                    rend="italic">duce,</hi> from the Latin <hi rend="italic">dux,</hi> a leader or
                    duke, employed to designate the chief magistrate in the republics of Genoa and
                    Venice. In both cities the office underwent from time to time a variety of
                    transformations, for details on which the larger histories of the republics must
                    be consulted.</p>
                <p>In Venice the doge was originally chosen by universal suffrage, held office for
                    life, and was regarded as the civil, military, and ecclesiastical chief. His
                    duties and prerogatives were not defined with much precision, and the limits of
                    his ability and ambition were practically the limits of his power. In 755 his
                    independence was diminished by the appointment of two assistants or <hi
                    rend="italic">duumvirs;</hi> but this institution was again allowed to fall into
                    the background, and the doge acquired more and more of irresponsible authority,
                    while at the same time the office was usually committed to a member of one or
                    other of the more powerful families. This tendency towards a hereditary
                    despotism was checked in 1033 by Flabenigo’s law, which reinstituted the
                    duumvirate, and declared distinctly that no doge had the right of associating
                    any member of his family with himself in the government, or of transmitting his
                    office on his decease. In 1172 a still more important change was introduced; not
                    only was the duumvirate replaced by a body of six councillors, but universal
                    suffrage was abolished, and the election of the doge intrusted to a committee of
                    twelve persons, elaborately selected from the members of the great council. On
                    the death of Ziani II. in 1229, two commissions were appointed, which obtained a
                    permanent place in the constitution, and gave emphatic testimony to the fact
                    that the doge was merely the highest servant of the community; the first
                    consisted of five <hi rend="italic">Correttori della promisione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ducale,</hi> whose duty was to consider if any change ought to be
                    made in the oath of investiture administered to the doge; the second was a board
                    of three <hi rend="italic">inquisitori</hi><hi rend="italic">sul doge,</hi>
                    intrusted with the curious task of examining and passing judgment on the acts of
                    the deceased magistrate, whose estates might be mulcted in accordance with their
                    decision. To minimize as far as possible the influence of individual families,
                    the election of the doge was in 1268 effected by a curiously complex machinery,
                    which remained, with some modifications, till the close of the republic; thirty
                    members of the great council, elected by ballot, selected nine members, who in
                    their turn chose forty; of these forty twelve taken by lot chose twenty-five;
                    the twenty-five were next reduced to nine; the nine elected forty-five; the
                    forty-five were reduced to eleven; and the eleven chose the final forty-one in
                    whose hands lay the actual election of the doge. In proportion to the
                    development attained by the oligarchical element in the constitution, the more
                    important functions of the office were assigned to other officials or to
                    administrative boards, and he wſlio had once been really the pilot of the ship
                    became little more than an animated figure-head, properly draped and garnished.
                    On state occasions he was still attended by all the ceremonial observances of
                    former times: his robe was still purple, the horns of his beretta were still
                    exalted, the sword, the tapers, and the trumpets were borne before him, his
                    leaden seal was affixed to public documents, and the ring was still dropped
                    yearly from his hand in symbolic espousal of Venice and the sea. But he was
                    under the strictest surveillance, had to w ait for the presence of other
                    officials in order to open the despatches from foreign powers, was forbidden to
                    leave the city, could not legally <pb break="no"

                    contract a foreign alliance for any of his children, and was moreover liable to
                    the infliction of a fine .for any trespass he might commit. The office was
                    maintained, however,.till the last days of the republic, and from time to time
                    was held by men who knew how to make it something more than such an empty
                    simulacrum. (See Cecchetti, <hi rend="italic">Il Doge di Venezia,</hi>
                    1864.)</p>
                <p>In Genoa the institution of the doge dates from 1339, and at first he was elected
                    without any restriction by popular suffrage, and held office for life; but after
                    the reform effected by Andrea Doria in 1528, the term was reduced to two years,
                    plebeians were declared ineligible, and the appointment was intrusted to the
                    members of the great and the little councils, who were bound, however, to
                    employ, in proof of impartiality, nearly as complex a machinery as that of the
                    later Venetians.</p>
