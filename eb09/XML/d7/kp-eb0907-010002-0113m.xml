                    English law, was a personal chattel (any animal or thing) which, on account of
                    its having caused the death of a human being, was forfeited to the king for
                    pious uses. Blackstone, while tracing in the custom an expiatory design, alludes
                    to analogous Jewish and Greek laws,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> Compare also the rule of the Twelve Tables, by which an
                    animal which had inflicted mischief might be surrendered in lieu of
                    compensation.</p></note> which required that that what occasions a man’s death
                    should be destroyed. In such usages the notion of the punishment of an animal or
                    thing, or of its being morally affected from having caused the death of a man,
                    seems to be implied. The forfeiture of the offending instrument in no way
                    depends on the guilt of the owner. The imputation of guilt to inanimate objects
                    or to the lower animals, repugnant as it is to our habits of thought, is not
                    inconsistent with what we know of the ideas of uncivilized races. In English
                    law, deodands came to be regarded as mere forfeitures to the king, and the rules
                    on which they depended were not easily explained by any key in the possession of
                    the old commentators. The law distinguished, for instance, between a thing in
                    motion and a thing standing still. If a horse or other animal in motion killed a
                    person, whether infant or adult, or if a carb run over him, it was forfeited as
                    a deodand. On the other hand, if death were caused by falling from a cart or a
                    horse at rest, the law made the chattel a deodand if the person killed were an
                    adult, but not if he were a person below the years of discretion. Blackstone
                    accounts for the greater severity against things in motion by saying that in
                    such cases the owner is more usually at fault, an explanation which is doubtful
                    in point of fact, and would certainly not account for other instances of the
                    same tendency. Thus, where a man’s death is caused by a thing not in motion,
                    that part only which is the immediate cause is forfeited, as “if a man be
                    climbing up the wheel of a cart, and is killed by falling from it, the wheel
                    alone is a deodand;” whereas, if the cart were in motion, not only the wheel but
                    all that moves along with it (as the cart and the loading) are forfeited. A
                    similar distinction is to be found in Britton. Where a man is killed by a vessel
                    at rest the cargo is not deodand; where the vessel is under sail, hull and cargo
                    are both deodand. For the distinction between the death of a child and the death
                    of an adult Blackstone accounts by suggesting that the child “was presumed
                    incapable of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n114/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0114-0101"/> actual sin, and therefore needed no deodand to
                    purchase propitiatory masses; but every adult who died in actual sin stood in
                    need of such atonement, according to the humane superstition of the founders of
                    the English law.” Sir Matthew Hale’s explanation was that the child could not
                    take care of himself, whereon Blackstone asks why the owner should save his
                    forfeiture on account of the imbecility of the child, which ought to have been
                    an additional reason for caution. The finding of a jury was necessary to
                    constitute a deodand, and the investigation of the value of the instrument by
                    which death was caused occupies an important place among the provisions of our
                    early criminal law. It became a necessary part of an indictment to state the
                    nature and value of the weapon employed—as, that the stroke was given by a
                    certain penknife, of the value of sixpence—so that the king might have his
                    deodand. Accidents on the high seas did not cause forfeiture, being beyond the
                    domain of the common law; but it would appear that in the case of ships in fresh
                    water, the law as quoted above from Britton held good. The king might grant his
                    right to deodands to another.</p>
                <p>In later times these forfeitures, so unintelligible in their purpose, so
                    capricious and unjust in operation, became extremely unpopular; and juries, with
                    the connivance of judges, found deodands of trifling value, so as to defeat the
                    inequitable claim. But deodands were not abolished till the 9 and 10 Vict. c. 62
                    was passed, whereby it is enacted that “there shall be no forfeiture of any
                    chattel for or in respect of the same having caused the death of a man; and no
                    coroner’s jury sworn to inquire, upon the sight of any dead body, how the
                    deceased came by his death, shall find any forfeiture of any chattel which may
                    have moved to or caused the death of the deceased, or any deodand whatsoever;
                    and it shall not be necessary in any indictment or inquisition for homicide to
                    allege the value of the instrument which caused the death of the deceased, or to
                    allege that the same was of no value.” The date of this Act (1846) may suggest
                    the great inconvenience which the law, if it had remained in operation, would
                    have caused to railway and other enterprise in which loss of life is a frequent
                    occurrence.</p>
