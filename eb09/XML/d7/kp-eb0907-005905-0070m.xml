                    from 494 to 460 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His father (who is called by no
                    less than three names) was a man of such wealth as to be able to entertain
                    Xerxes and his army on their return home after the battle of Salamis. On coming
                    into his inheritance, Democritus, there is good reason to believe, devoted
                    several years to travel. He visited the East, and is supposed with great
                    probability to have spent a considerable time in Egypt. The intensity of his
                    thinking was figured by the ancients in the story that he put out his eyes in
                    order that he might not be diverted from his meditations. But of the way in
                    which he obtained the vast learning for which he was famed, and of his
                    intercourse with other philosophers, even with Leucippus, we have no certain
                    information. According to one very doubtful tradition, he was so honoured in his
                    native city that, his patrimony being all spent, the incredible sum of 500
                    talents was voted him by his fellow-citizens, together with the honour of a
                    public funeral; but, according to another tradition, his countrymen regarded him
                    as a lunatic and sent for Hippocrates to cure him. All are agreed that he lived
                    to a great age; Diodorus Siculus states that he was ninety at his death, and
                    others assert that he was nearly twenty years older. He left, according to
                    Diogenes Laertius, no less that 72 works, treating of almost every subject
                    studied in his time, and written in Ionic Greek, in a style which for poetic
                    beauty Cicero deemed worthy of comparison with that of Plato. But of all these
                    works nothing has come down to us beyond small íragments.</p>
                <p>The cosmical theory propounded by Democritus—which in part at least was adopted
                    from the doctrines of Leucippus —is of all the materialistic explanations of the
                    universe put forth by the Greeks the one which has held the most permanent place
                    in philosophical thought. All that exists is vacuum and atoms. The atoms are the
                    ultimate material of all things, including spirit. They are uncaused, and have
                    existed from eternity. They are invisible, but extended, heavy, and
                    impenetrable. They vary in shape; though whether Democritus held that they vary
                    also in density is debated. And, lastly, these atoms are in motion. This motion,
                    like the atoms themselves, Democritus held to be eternal. According to some, he
                    explained it as caused by the downward fall of the heavier atoms through the
                    lighter, by which means a lateral whirling motion was produced; but whether this
                    explanation was given by Democritus is extremely doubtful. Another principle
                    also is said by some to have been used by Democritus to explain the concurrence
                    of the atoms in certain ways, viz., that there is an innate necessity by which
                    similar atoms come together. However this may be, he did declare that by the
                    motion of the atoms the world was produced with all that it contains.</p>
                <p>Soul and fire are of one nature; the atoms of which they consist are small,
                    smooth, and round; and it is by inhaling and exhaling such atoms that life is *
                    maintained. It follows that the soul perishes with, and in the same sense as,
                    the body. There is, in fact, no distinction made between the principle of life
                    and the higher mental faculties.</p>
                <p>The Atomic theory of perception was as follows. From <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n71/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0071-0060"/> every object αδωλα (or images) of the object are
                    continually being given off in all directions; these enter the organs of sense,
                    and give rise to sensation. The rest of the theory remarkably anticipates
                    certain famous modern theories of perception (1) by its reduction of all
                    sensation, on the objective side, to touch, and (2) by the distinction which it
                    involves between the qualities of extension and resistance, which are said to be
                    the only qualities that really belong to objects of sense, and the other (or
                    secondary) qualities, which are said to exist only through the action of the
                    organs of sense modifying the ειδωλα.</p>
                <p>Sensation, Democritus appears to have taught, is our only source or faculty of
                    knowledge; indeed his first principles admit the existence of no mental faculty
                    of a nature distinct from sensation. He was classed among the most extreme
                    sceptics of antiquity, -and tradition attributes to him such sayings as—“There
                    is nothing true, and if there is, we do not know it,” “We know nothing, not even
                    if there is anything to know.”</p>
                <p>The system of Democritus was altogether anti-theological. He denied that the
                    creation of the world was in any way due to reason. He also rejected all the
                    popular mythology; but, according to one account, he taught that, as men were
                    produced by the motion of the atoms, so was produced a race of grander beings,
                    of similar form, and, though longer-lived, still mortal, who influence human
                    affairs, some benevolently, some malevolently, and who appear to men in
                    dreams.</p>
                <p>The moral system of Democritus is strikingly like the negative side of the system
                    of Epicurus. The <hi rend="italic">summum bonum</hi> is placed in an even
                    tranquillity of mind. Fear, and too strong desire, and all that is likely to
                    bring sorrow or even care, are to be avoided, as, for example, notably marnage,
                    to which Democritus cherished the strongest objections. This habit of mind
                    Democritus is said to have himself so well attained that the merry spirit with
                    which he regarded all that happened earned him the title of “the laughing
                    philosopher." Another version, however, asserts that he received the name on
                    account of the scorn w lιich he poured on human ignorance and weakness.</p>
