                <p><label type="entry">DONEGAL</label>, a maritime county in the extreme northwest
                    of Ireland, in the province of Ulster, bounded on the N. and W. by the Atlantic
                    Ocean, on the E. by Lough Foyle, and the counties of Londonderry and Tyrone, and
                    on the S. by Donegal Bay and the counties of Fermanagh and Leitrim. It covers an
                    area of 1870∣ square miles, or 1,197,154 acres, of which 22,880 are under
                    water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast.—</hi> The county possesses a large extent of sea-coast
                    indented by numerous inlets. Ballyshannon harbour, the most southern of them, is
                    small, and has a bar at its mouth, as have Donegal and Inver harbours farther
                    west. Killibegs harbour is well sheltered, and capable of receiving large
                    vessels. On the western coast are Bruckles or M‘Swiney’s Bay, and Teelin
                    harbour, suitable for small vessels; and on the north is Sheephaven, within
                    which is Dunfanaghy Bay, where the largest ships may lie in safety, as they may
                    also in Mulroy Bay and Lough Swilly farther east. Lough Foyle, which divides
                    Donegal from Londonderry, is a noble sheet of water, but is shallow and dry at
                    ebb tide, contracted at its entrance, and encumbered with shoals. A few miles
                    from Malin Head, the most northerly portion of the mainland of Ireland, the
                    varied and extensive Lough Swilly runs far into the interior. From these two
                    loughs much land has been reclaimed. Numerous islands and rocks stud the coast.
                    The largest island is North Aran, about fifteen miles in circumference, with a
                    lofty hill in its centre, and a gradual declivity down to the sea. On the
                    northern coast are Tory Island, on which is one of those singular round towers
                    marking the holy places of ancient times, and, further east, Innistrahul the <hi
                    rend="italic">ultima Thule</hi> of Ireland. The inhabitants of the islands
                    obtain a precarious livelihood by fishing, kelp-burning, and rude husbandry, but
                    are often reduced to extreme destitution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> Mountains and irregular groups of highlands
                    occupy the whole interior of the county, and a considerable portion is bog and
                    moor land. Arrigal mountain attains an elevation of 2462 feet above the level of
                    the sea, and commands from its summit a fine view over a considerable portion of
                    the country. Bluestack (2213 feet), Muckish mountain (2190 feet) in Kilmacrenan
                    barony, and Slieve Snaght (2019) in Innishowen are, next to Arrigal, the highest
                    mountains. The eastern and southern portions of the county are comparatively
                    level, and contain the most fertile land. Occasionally the scenery attains a
                    character of savage and romantic grandeur in the highland districts and on the
                    sea-coast, and of much beauty in the eastern part of the county; but a
                    considerable portion of the surface is occupied bý.bogs, and entirely destitute
                    of timber.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The main body of the county rests upon mica
                    slate, which forms the eastern districts and most of the barony of Bannagh. From
                    Sheephaven to Lochrusmore and the north-western coast, granite forms the surface
                    rock, and quartz is very abundant, often forming mountains of considerable
                    elevation. Carboniferous or mountain limestone occurs round Donegal Bay. The
                    geological aspect of the county affords many indications of internal wealth, but
                    very few attempts have been made to ascertain the mineral resources of the
                    district. The minerals hitherto discovered are lead and iron. Steatite is worked
                    to some extent at Gartan. Manganese, copper pyrites, and clay for potteries and
                    brick-making are also found. Siliceous sand, raised in Muckish Mountain, was
                    formerly conveyed in large quantities to Belfast and Scotland for the
                    manufacture of glass Indications of coal have been observed near Lough Swilly,
                    and at Inver on the southern coast; and marble of fine quality exists in many
                    places. Among the mountain streams the pearl-mussel <hi rend="italic">(Unio
                    margaritifera)</hi> is sometimes found. There are several mineral springs, the
                    chief of which is the sulphureo-chalybeate water at Killymard near the town of
                    Donegal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> With the exception of the tidal river Foyle,
                    which forms the boundary between this county and Tyrone and Londonderry, the
                    rivers, though numerous, are of inferior size. The branches of the Foyle which
                    rise in Donegal are the Derg, issuing from Lough Derg, and the Finn, rising in
                    the beautiful little lake of the same name in the highlands, and passing through
                    some of the best cultivated land in the county. The Foyle, augmented by their
                    contributions, and by those of several other branches from Tyrone and
                    Londonderry, proceeds northwards, discharging its waters into the southern
                    extremity of Lough Foyle, at the city of Londonderry. It is navigable for
                    vessels of large burden to this place, and thence by lighters of fifty tons as
                    far as Lifford. Boats of fourteen tons can proceed up the Finn river as far as
                    Castlefinn. The fine river Erne flows from Lough Erne through the southern
                    extremity of the county into the southern extremity of Donegal Bay. Its
                    navigation is prevented by a fall of 12 feet, generally called the Salmon Leap,
                    in the neighbourhood of Ballyshannon, and by rapids between Ballyshannon and
                    Belleek, on the confines of Fermanagh. The Guibarra, the Awen Ea, and the Eask
                    are the only other streams of any note.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes, or</hi> rather tarns, are very numerous in
                    Donegal-The<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0379-0362"/> most remarkable, and also the largest, is Lough
                    Derg, comprising within its waters several small islets, on one of which,
                    Station Island, is the cave named Saint Patrick’s Purgatory, a celebrated place
                    of resort for pilgrims and devotees. The circumference of the lake is about nine
                    miles, and the extent of the island to which the pilgrims are ferried over is
                    less than one acre. The landscape around Lough Derg is desolate and sombre in
                    the extreme, barren moors and heathy hills surrounding it on all sides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The modes of agriculture present little that
                    is peculiar to the county, and the spade still supplies the place of the plough
                    where the rocky nature of the surface prevents the application of the latter
                    implement. The soil of the greater portion of the county, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the granite, quartz, and mica slate districts, is thin and cold,
                    while that on the Carboniferous limestone is warm and friable. Owing to the
                    boggy nature of the soil, agriculture has not made much progress, although in
                    certain districts (Gweedore, for instance) much land has been brought under
                    cultivation, through the enterprise of the proprietors. In 1871 about 43∣ per
                    cent, of the land was returned as bog and waste, about 35 per cent, under
                    pasture, and 21 per cent, under tillage. As an indication of the stationary
                    condition of the husbandry of Donegal, it may be stated that the number of acres
                    returned as under crops in 1853 was 236,097, while in 1876 it was 236,015.</p>
                <p>The following statistics will show the details of the agricultural acreage and
                    the numbers of live stock in recent years :—</p>

                <p>Wheat and barley are quite an inconsiderable crop, and in this as well as in
                    other respects Donegal is much behind the rest of Ulster in the extent of its
                    crops. It bears, however, a more favourable comparison as regards its live
                    stock, possessing, as it does, the largest number of cattle and sheep of any
                    county in the province, and after Cavan the largest number of poultry.</p>
                <p>As regards the division of the land, according to the Return of 1876, the county
                    was held in 1874 by 2174 separate owners, whose estates amounted in the
                    aggregate to 1,172,526 acres, valued at £340,632. There were 1171 proprietors of
                    less than 1 acre of ground, forming a proportion of 54 per cent, of the total
                    proprietors,—that of all Ulster being 48 per cent. The average size of the
                    properties was 539 acres, and the value per acre, 5s. 9d., while the averages
                    for Ulster were respectively 239¾ acres and 15s. 8¾d. Sixteen proprietors owned
                    more than 15,000 acres each, and together an aggregate equal to about 45 per
                    cent, of the whole land. They were the following:—Marquis of Conyngham, 122,300
                    acres; Earl of Leitrim, 54,352; H. G. Murray Stewart, 50,818; W. H. Μ. Style
                    (Glenmore), 39,564; A. J. R. Stewart (Castlemore), 39,306; John Leslie, 28,827
                    '; George Harvey, 25,593; Lord G. A. Hill, 24,189; Messrs Musgrave, 23,673; Sir
                    Samuel H. Hayes, Bart., 22,825; Thomas Connolly, 22,736; <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> In Donegal, as in other counties of Ulster,
                    the linen manufacture affords employment to a number of the inhabitants,
                    especially at Raphoe, while the manufacture of woollen stockings and worked
                    muslin is carried on pretty extensively. The trade in these manufactures and in
                    the domestic produce of the county finds its principal outlets through the port
                    of Derry and the inland town of Strabane, county Tyrone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> The deep sea fisheries are important. They
                    comprise the three districts of Killybegs, Dunfanaghy, and Carndonagh—the
                    last-named including a small part of the Derry coast — and extend to 395 miles
                    of maritime boundary. In 1875 there were 777 boats registered in the fisheries,
                    manned by 3053 men and boys. The salmon fishery is also prosecuted to a
                    considerable extent, the principal seats of the trade being at Ballyshannon and
                    Letterkenny.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration,</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;sh.</hi> —The county
                    is divided into the six baronies of Innishowen, Kilmacrenan, Boylagh, Raphoe,
                    Bannagh, and Tyrhugh, and into 51 parishes. It contains seven poor law unions,
                    and ecclesiastically it belongs for the most part to the diocese of Raphoe. It
                    is included in the military district of Belfast, and the assizes are held at
                    Lifford on the borders of Tyrone. The population has decreased within the last
                    20 years at a greater ratio than the rest of Ulster, and emigration has drawn
                    off a greater proportion of the people than in other parts of the province. For
                    the 24 years ending in 1875 the rate of emigration has averaged 2908 per annum.
                    By the census of 1851 Donegal contained 255,158 persons, in 1861, 237,390, and
                    in 1871, 218,334, of whom 106,080 were males andl 12,254 females— thus showing a
                    decrease within these 20 years of 14 ⅛ per cent. In 1875 the population was
                    estimated at 208,607.</p>
                <p>After Cavan, Donegal is the most Catholic county in Ulster. In 1871, 75 per cent,
                    of the inhabitants belonged to that persuasion, while 12∣ per cent, were
                    Episcopalians and 10⅛ per cent. Presbyterians. Education in the same year was
                    conducted in 7 superior and 407 primary schools. There were, however, 93,285
                    persons above five years of age who were returned as illiterate, and 18,629 who
                    could speak Erse only. The Donegal dialect is said to be the purest of the Irish
                    language.</p>
                <p>This county returned no fewer than twelve members to the Irish parliament,—two
                    for the county at large, and two for each of the insignificant boroughs of
                    Ballyshannon, Donegal, Killybegs, Lifford, and Johnstown. Since the union with

                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> The towns are small in extent and importance.
                    Lifford, the county town (population 660), and formerly a parliamentary borough,
                    is practically a suburb of Strabane, in the neighbouring county of Tyrone.
                    Ballyshannon (population 2958) is the most populous and important town in the
                    county. It stands on both sides of the river Erne, but does not derive much
                    advantage from its favourable situation in consequence of the fall of the river,
                    usually called the Salmon Leap, above the town, and the bar at the mouth of the
                    harbour. Letterkenny at the head of Lough Swilly, with 2116 inhabitants, is,
                    next to Ballyshannon, the largest town in the county. Donegal (population 1422),
                    is situated at the foot of a range of hills in the midst of scenery of great
                    natural beauty, with a mineral spa in the neighbourhood, and sea-bathing close
                    to the town.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The greater part of Donegal was anciently called
                    Tir-conaill, or the country of Conall; and it was sometimes called O’Donnell’s
                    country, after the head chieftains of the district. The other chieftains of note
                    were the O’Doghertys, MacSweeneys, O’Boyles, O’Gallaghers, O’Gormleys,
                    O’Breslins, &amp;c. Tyrconnell is connected with some of the earliest events
                    recorded in Irish history or tradition. The chief castle of the O’Donnells, who
                    became princes of Tyrconnell in the 12th century, was at Donegal, and the place
                    of their inauguration the rock of Doune in Kilmacrenan. The celebrated Red Hugh
                    O’Donnell, one of the most distinguished chieftains of the race, in conjunction
                    with the Earl of Tyrone, became a formidable opponent to the Government of Queen
                    Elizabeth; but being ultimately defeated, he sailed to Spain to solicit fresh
                    succours, was there seized with fever, and died at Valladolid. Rory O’Donnell,
                    who was promoted to the chieftainship by the English Government, and created
                    Earl of Tyrconnel, a title <pb break="no"

                    Government and fled to Rome, where he died in'exile, his estates having been
                    previously confiscated by James I. In 1608, Sir Cahir O’Dogherty, lord of
                    Innishowen, deceived by hopes of aid from Spain, raised an insurrection against
                    the English Government in Ulster. He burnt Londonderry and maintained his ground
                    for a short period; but the Lord-Deputy Chichester having offered a reward for
                    his head, he retired to the wilds of Kilmacrenan, and was shot by a Scotch
                    settler in his encampment on the rock of Donne. His extensive estates were
                    confiscated and transferred to Chichester, the ancestor of the earls and
                    marquises of Donegall. Shortly afterwards, the colonization of Ulster with
                    English and Scotch undertakers and settlers, in pursuance of the scheme of James
                    I., was partially carried out, and the baronies of Boylagh and Bannagh were
                    allotted to’John Murray; Sir James Cunningham, Sir John Stewart, and others,
                    received the district of Portlough; the London Grocers’ Company obtained Muff in
                    Innishowen; Sir Roger Bingley, Sir John Kingsmill, and other English settlers
                    the district round Lifford; Sir William Stewart, Sir John Kingsmill, Sir George
                    Macburie, Captain Hart, Sir Μ. Μ‘Swine, Turlogh Roe O’Boyle, MacSwine Bannagh,
                    MacSwine Fannet, and other servitors and natives the district of Kilmacrenan.
                    Since the period of the settlement of Ulster, no forfeitures have taken place in
                    this county. The landholders remained loyal in the rebellion of 1641, and also
                    during the war of the Revolution.</p>
                <p>This district was formed into the county of Donegal in the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth, in 1585, by the Lord-Deputy Sir John Perrott.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> The most noteworthy architectural remains of
                    antiquity in the county are to be found at the head of Lough Swilly, where,
                    situated on the summit of a hill 802 feet high, some remarkable remains exist of
                    a fortress or palace of the Northern Irish kings. These are known as the Grianan
                    of Aileach, and evidently date from a period prior to the 12th century. On Tory
                    island there is one of the best specimens of a round tower and some other
                    interesting remains.</p>
                <p>Numerous ruins of ancient castles along the coast prove that much attention was
                    formerly paid to the defence of the country from invasion. The principal
                    are—Kilbarron Castle, an ancient stronghold of the O’Clerys, near Ballyshannon;
                    Donegal Castle, built by the O’Donnells, anciently their chief residence, and
                    now a fine ruin standing close to the water’s edge; Burt Castle, built in the
                    reign of Henry VIII. on the shores of Lough Swilly by Sir Calιir O’Dogherty, to
                    whom is also attributed the erection of Green Castle, one of the strongholds of
                    the clan on Lough Foyle.</p>
                <p>Near the Castle of Doe, or M ’ Swiney ’ s Castle, at Hom Head, is a natural
                    perforation in the roof of a cave, called M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Swiney ’ s Gun, formed by the workings of the ocean into the o’verhanging cliff.
                    When the wind blows due north, and the tide is at half flood, the gun is seen to
                    spout up jets of water to a height of 100 feet, attended with explosions heard
                    occasionally in favourable weather at an immense distance. Gulmore Fort, on the
                    coast of Lough Swilly, supposed to have been erected by the O’Doghertys, having
                    come into the possession of the crown, was granted in 1609 to the corporation of
                    London. It was afterwards enlarged or rebuilt, and acted a prominent part in the
                    celebrated siege of Derry.</p>
                <p>. Traces of religious houses, some existing only in traditionary or documental
                    records, are also numerous. Ashroe Abbey, on a small stream near Ballyshannon,
                    was of great extent. The ruins of that of Donegal, founded in 1474, also afford
                    proofs of its ancient grandeur. It was there that the celebrated collection of
                    ancient Irish annals were written, known by the name of the Annals of the Four
                    Masters, and sometimes called the Annals of Donegal, compiled in the year 1632,
                    by Michael O’Clery and his coadjutors.</p>
