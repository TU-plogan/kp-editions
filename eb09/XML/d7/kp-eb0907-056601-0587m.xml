                    <hi rend="italic">The Return of Ulysses to Ithaca,</hi> which failed in Paris,
                    but was represented with great applause at Orleans. The author, however, soon
                    became sensible of the faults of his work, and abandoned a species of
                    composition in which he found he was not destined to excel. He soon afterwards
                    went to England with an introduction to Pitt, which he had received from a
                    sister of the statesman. His first residence in London was brief, but he soon
                    returned and obtained a situation as tutor in a private family. The father of
                    the pupil was a man of considerable literary and scientific attainments, who
                    instructed him in those branches of knowledge in which he was deficient. In this
                    manner he learnt Greek and mathematics, and studied the Oriental languages, and
                    Italian and Spanish. Soon after the termination of this engagement he was
                    appointed chaplain and secretary to Mr Mackenzie, the English minister at the
                    court of Turin, and left England in October 1758. In 1760, when Mr Mackenzie
                    returned to England, the secretary remained at Turin as chargé d’affaires, until
                    1762, when he returned to England and attached himself to the family of Lord
                    Bute, who, before retiring from office in 1763, procured him a pension. He again
                    went to Turin as chargé d’affaires; and during this second mission he undertook
                    the task of collecting and publishing a complete edition of the works of
                    Leibnitz (Geneva, 6 vols. 1769) and wrote his work on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discoveries of the Ancients.</hi> On again returning to England he attached
                    himself to the duke of Northumberland, who procured him the living of Elsdon, in
                    Northumberland. He accompanied the duke’s son, Lord Algernon Percy, in his
                    travels through France, Italy, Germany, and Holland; and while at Paris he was
                    chosen a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, in 1775. In the same year he was
                    made a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1776 he returned to England, and soon
                    afterwards accompanied Mr Mackenzie and his wife on a tour to Naples. On his
                    return Dutens was invited by Lord Mountstuart, who had been appointed envoy
                    extraordinary, to accompany him to Turin, and found himself for the third time
                    chargé d’affaires at that court, during a short absence of the envoy. From Turin
                    he went to Florence, and thence to Rome. He was in Paris in 1783, and returned
                    to London the following year. The revenue he derived from his living amounting
                    to .£800 per annum, together with a considerable legacy left him by Mr
                    Mackenzie, and estimated at .£15,000, enabled him to pass the remainder of his
                    life in affluence. He died at London, May 23, 1812.</p>
