                    placed under the care of certain Irish teachers who had settled at Glastonbury;
                    and he devoted his boyhood to study with a fervour so intense that he at length
                    brought on himself a severe attack of brain fever, the effects of which are
                    apparent in the fantastic visions which troubled his after life. He was still a
                    boy when he entered the household of Athelstan, and he was only fifteen or
                    sixteen at the accession of Edmund; but he had not been long at court before his
                    ambitious and lofty temper had surrounded him with bitter enemies. In all the
                    accomplishments of his time, except those of the warrior, he stood pre-eminent.
                    His memory was stored with the ancient Irish ballads and legends, and he
                    excelled in music, in painting, and even in the mechanical arts. But he soon
                    found that his talents, while making him a favourite in the ladies’ bowers, only
                    inflamed the jealousy of his rough, ignorant soldier rivals. He was accused of
                    dealing in witchcraft, was driven with rude force from the court, and, perhaps
                    under the pretext of testing whether he was really wizard or no, was flung into
                    a muddy pond, whence he was glad to escape to the protection of his uncle
                    Aelfheah. The result of this outrage was a second attack of fever, from which he
                    rose to yield to his uncle’s persuasions, and take the vows as a monk. It λvas
                    with great reluctance that ho took this step, for he was deeply in love with a
                    lady at court; but the feeling, natural in that age, that his illness was a
                    direct indication of the will of providence, was likely to impress itself with
                    peculiar force upon an imagination such as his, and he was also, doubtless,
                    conscious that the only protection for his physical weakness lay in the power of
                    the church. After his recovery, he spent some time quietly studying and
                    teaching, and practising the austerities which gained him the reputation of a
                    saint; but it was not long before he returned to court. Again his enemies seemed
                    likely to prove too powerful for him. He, however, gained the favour of King
                    Edmund, who created him abbot of Glastonbury when he was about twenty-two years
                    of age. He became principal treasurer of the kingdom, and we find him a few
                    years later (953), on account of his tenure of that office, refusing an offer of
                    the see of Crediton.</p>
                <p>From 946 to 955 the throne was occupied by Edred, whose constant ill health threw
                    the chief power into Dunstan’s hands. In 955 Edwy came to the throne; and the
                    party of Edgiva, to which Dunstan belonged, lost its influence. Of the details
                    of the party struggles which ensued we have no trustworthy information; but one
                    incident of the quarrel between the king and the minister has become famous.
                    Edwy, though then probably a mere boy, was deeply in love with his kinswomau
                    Elgiva, whose mother Ethelgiva, a lady of the highest rank, is accused, with
                    what degree of truth cannot now be determined, of having used the most shameful
                    means to gain power over the young king. What relationship really existed
                    between Edwy and Elgiva is unknown, but it was such as to be considered by the
                    churchmen as an insuperable bar to marriage. Edwy, however, defied their
                    opposition. On the evening of his coronation he withdrew from the banquet to the
                    society of Elgiva. Dunstan was sent by the Witan to recall him, and exhibited a
                    violence which may be excused, when we consider that Edwy had both grievously
                    insulted the Witan and openly sought, upon so solemn an occasion, the dangerous
                    society of a girl whom the church forbade him to marry.</p>
                <p>A year or so after Ethelgiva and her party triumphed, and Dunstan being outlawed,
                    was obliged to flee to Ghent. In 957, however, a revolt placed Edwy’s brother
                    Edgar on the throne of Mercia and Northumbria, and at his court Dunstan resumed
                    his old position of chief minister He was created bishop (perhaps at first
                    without a see), and, in defiance of strict ecclesiastical law, he obtained and
                    held at once the sees of Worcester and London. By the death of Edwy in 959,
                    Edgar gained the sovereignty of Wessex; and a few months after Dunstan wa3
                    appointed archbishop of Canterbury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In connection with the coronation of Edgar, Osbern of

                    seven years; but there are several reasons for doubting this story. The question
                    is elaborately discussed in the article on the “Coronation of Edgar,” in Mr E.

                    But a fierce struggle ensued between Dunstan and his enemies. In 977 the Witan
                    met three times; and the last meeting, that at Caine, was signalized by an
                    accident, which the friends of Dunstan called a miracle. Half the floor of the
                    room in which the Witan was assembled gave way at the moment that Dunstan was
                    making a solemn appeal to God, so that the enemies of Dunstan fell, and Dunstan
                    and his friends remained unhurt. This accident has been explained by reference
                    to the archbishop’s well-known skill in mechanics. During the first few years of
                    the unhappy reign of Ethelred the Unready, Dunstan probably retained some
                    influence in the government; and it is noteworthy that the year of his death
                    (which took place on the 19th May 988) marks the commencement of the most
                    disastrous invasions of the Danes. Towards the close of his life Dunstan is said
                    to have retired from the court, and his last years were devoted to religious
                    observances and the composition of sacred music, his favourite amusement being,
                    as of old, the manufacture of bells and musical instruments.</p>
                <p>Dunstan has been frequently painted by historians as one of the most complete
                    types of the bigoted ecclesiastic. If, however, we critically examine the best
                    sources, he will appear to have been statesman much more than ecclesiastic; and
                    the circumstances which caused him to be honoured by the monks as one of their
                    greatest patrons will become manifest. Even in his lifetime he was believed to
                    be endowed with supernatural power, as is shown by the charge of witchcraft
                    brought against him in his youth, and by the story of the miracle at Caine. His
                    earliest biography, written by a contemporary, represents him as a man of vivid
                    imagination, a seer of visions and dreamer of dreams, a man of unusually
                    sensitive nervoue organization, as is indicated by the strange “gift of tears”
                    with which he is said to have been endowed; and in this biography we find the
                    first of the tale3 which became so common ot his interviews with the devil, who
                    is said to have tormented him in the form of a bear and in other frightful
                    shapes. By a very common process, there came to be connected with his name a
                    large number of marvellous legends, of which the best known is the story of how
                    the devil appeared to him with impure suggestions while he was working at his
                    forge, and how the saint retaliated by seizing the nose of the great enemy with
                    a pair of red-hot tongs. It is not surprising that the monkish writers should
                    exaggerate any services rendered to their order by an archbishop possessed of so
                    wonderful a reputation. But in fact there is good reason to believe that Dunstan
                    always treated church affairs as subordinate to political considerations. While
                    Ethelwald, the bishop of Winchester, and Oswald, bishop of Worcester, and
                    afterwards archbishop of York, were introducing monks of the strict Benedictine
                    order into their sees in place of the seculars, and doing their utmost to
                    enforce celibacy among the clergy, he allowed the married priests to retain
                    their places in his diocese without interference. On the other hand, no doubt
                    all Dunstan’s influence in church affairs was given to the monastic party,
                    though that influence was exerted with a statesman-like moderation for which he
                    has not received credit,and it is likely that he did not attain his canonization
                    without performing substantial service to the church. The political services
                    which Dunstan rendered to England were certainly of the first importance. He
                    guided the state successfully during the nine years reign of the invalid Ed red.
                    And there is good reason to believe that he deserves at least as much credit as
                    the king himself for the settlement of Northumbria and the Danes which was
                    effected, for the peace which prevailed, and the glory which was gained, in
                    Edgar’s famous reign.</p>
                <p>Several works have been attributed to Dunstan, including a commentary on the
                    Benedictine rule, and a <hi rend="italic">Regularis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Concordia</hi> (published in Reyner’s <hi rend="italic">Apostolatus

                    real authorship of both of these is doubtful. His reputation as a miracle-worker
                    so long outlasted his life, that a tract on the philosopher’s stone was
                    published in his name at Cassel in 1649.</p>
                <p>The earliest and the most trustworthy of the biographers of Dunstan was ‘ ‘ the
                    priest B.,” whom some authorities have supposed, though not upon conclusive
                    grounds, to be the scholar Bridfeτth of Ramsey.<note anchored="true"

                    Osbern, Eadmer, and William of Malmesbury,—are of far less value, being
                    distorted by prejudice and filled with extravagant legends. The <hi
