                    Frognall</hi></label> (1776-1847), an enthusiastic bibliographer, born at
                    Calcutta in 1776, was the son of Thomas Dibdin, the sailor brother of Charles
                    Dibdin, whom the latter has immortalized in his song “Poor Tom Bowling.” His
                    father and mother both died on the voyage home to England in 1780, and he was
                    brought up by a maternal uncle. He was educated at St John’s College, Oxford,
                    but left the university without taking his degree. Intended for the bar, he was
                    entered at Lincoln’s Inn, and studied for a time in the chambers of Basil
                    Montague. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain practice as a provincial
                    counsel at Worcester, he resolved to abandon law for the church, and he was
                    ordained a clergyman at the close of 1804. His ecclesiastical preferment was
                    slow. For a number of years he had to content himself with the appointment of
                    preacher at various chapels in the West End of London, and it was not until 1823
                    that he received the living of Exning in Sussex. Soon afterwards he was
                    appointed by Lord Liverpool to the rectory of St Mary’s, Bryanstone Square,
                    which he held until his death on the 18th November 1847. The first of the
                    numerous bibliographical works on which Dibdin’s fame entirely rests was his <hi
                    rend="italic">Introduction to the Knowledge of the Rare and Valuable Editions of
                    the Latin and Greek Classics</hi> (1803), which, though superficial, incomplete,
                    and untrustworthy in many of its details, supplied a blank in English
                    literature. A fourth and greatly enlarged edition appeared in 1827. The first
                    edition rendered a valuable service to its author in bringing him under the
                    notice of Earl Spencer, to whom he owed not only his first living but much
                    important aid in his bibliographical pursuits. The rich library at Althorp was
                    thrown open to him; he spent much of his time in it, aud in 1814 published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Spenceriana,</hi> giving an account of the many
                    rare works it contained. As the library was not open to the general public, the
                    information given in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi> was found very
                    useful, but the work was marred by the inaccuracy in matters of detail which
                    more or less characterized all its author’s productions. This fault was
                    naturally least obtrusive in a series of playful, discursive works in the form
                    of dialogues on his favourite subject, in which great exactness was not
                    necessary. The first of these, <hi rend="italic">Bibliomania</hi> (1809), was
                    republished with large additions in 1811, and was very popular, passing through
                    numerous editions. To the same class belonged the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliographical Decameron,</hi> a larger work, which appeared in 1817, and has
                    a higher value than its predecessor, though it did not attain the same
                    circulation. In 1810 he commenced the publication of a new and much extended
                    edition of Ames’s <hi rend="italic">Typographical Antiquities.</hi> The first
                    volume was so great a success that Dibdin realized £600 by it. This, however,
                    was not maintained, and the fourth volume, which did not appear until 1819, fell
                    almost stillborn from the press. The work was scarcely half-finished when its
                    publication was thus checked. The chief cause of its failure was that Dibdin had
                    not critical sagacity enough to make a thorough change in the arrangement his
                    predecessor had followed, and to enable him to distinguish what was valuable
                    from what was worthless in the vast stores of information he had himself
                    collected. In 1818 Dibdin was commissioned by his patron, Earl Spencer, to
                    purchase books for him on the Continent, and he afterwards published an account
                    of his journey in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical, Antiquarian, and
                    Picturesque Tour in France and Germany</hi> (3 vols. 1821), which was got up in
                    a most sumptuous style, the engravings alone, it is said, costing £5000. In 1824
                    he published an ambitious venture in his <hi rend="italic">Library Companion, or
                    the Young Man's Guide and Old Man's Comfort in the Choice of a Library,</hi>
                    which was intended to point out the best works in all departments of literature.
                    His culture was not broad enough to render him competent for the task, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Library Companion,</hi> being severely criticized in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Westminster Reviews,</hi>
                    seriously injured his reputation. He had been for some time involved in
                    pecuniary difficulties, from which he tried to free himself with only partial
                    success by extending the range of his literary activity. He wrote for
                    periodicals, published many of his sermons, and for some years gave himself
                    chiefly to religious literature. He returned to bibliography in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliophobia, or Remarks on the Present Depression in the State of
                    Literature and the Book Trade</hi> (1831), and the same subject furnishes the
                    main interest of his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences of a Literary Life</hi>
                    (1836), and his <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical, Antiquarian, and Picturesque
                    Tour in the Northern Counties of England and Scotland</hi> (1838). Didbin was
                    the originator and vice-president, Lord Spencer being the president, of the
                    Roκburghe Club, founded in 1812,—the first of the numerous book clubs which have
                    done such service to literature in the present century.</p>
