                    In 1752 he abandoned silk-weaving in order to join his son Peter, who had
                    entered upon business as an optical instrument-maker in Vine Court, and before
                    long he became universally celebrated as an optician. His last and most
                    important contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    for which he, in 1758, received the Copley medal of the Royal Society, gave a
                    description of the various experiments, begun early in 1757, on the combined
                    effect of water and prisms and lenses of glass, by which he was led to the
                    discovery of a means of constructing achromatic lenses. Sir Isaac Newton had
                    stated in his <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> “that all refracting substances
                    diverged the prismatic colours in a constant proportion to their mean
                    refraction,” and consequently “that refraction could not be produced without
                    colour,” for which reason “no improvement could be expected in the refracting
                    telescope.” Dollond, however, found that as flint glass causes a greater
                    dispersion in proportion to its refractive power than crown glass, achromatic
                    magnified images could be obtained by using a combination of a doubly concave
                    lens of the former substance with a doubly convex lens of the latter. As the two
                    glasses to be combined were the segments of spheres of considerable curvature,
                    the aberrations from their surfaces were very great, but by varying the surfaces
                    he was enabled to make the aberrations equal, so that, as the refractions of the
                    two glasses were contrary, they corrected each other. In 1761 Dollond was
                    appointed optician to the king, and became a fellow of the Royal Society On
                    September 30th of that year, whilst reading a work by Clairaut on the theory of
                    the moon, he had an attack of apoplexy, of which hθ died in a few hours.</p>
