                <p><label type="entry">DOG</label>, a name common to several species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Canidae</hi> —a family of Carnivorous Mammals widely distributed
                    over nearly every part of the globe. Many of the species belonging to this
                    family, as the wolf and the jackal, are social animals, hunting in packs, and
                    are readily tamed; while in confinement they show little or no repugance to
                    breeding. In a group thus eminently capable of domestication, it is not
                    surprising that in the earliest times one or more species should have been
                    brought under the dominion of man, or that under human care the domestic dog
                    should have become, as Baron Cuvier calls it, “the completest, the most
                    singular, and the most useful conquest ever made by man.” There is sufficient
                    evidence to show that 'the dog existed in the domesticated state during
                    prehistoric times; consequently neither history nor tradition is available to
                    solve the question of its origin. That must be decided, if at all, by the
                    naturalist, and the variety of opinion existing on this point at the present
                    time renders it exceedingly improbable that the parentage of the dog will ever
                    be ascertained with certainty. Some suppose that all our breeds have sprung from
                    a single wild source, others that they are the product of the blending of
                    several distinct species. Of the former, the majority regard the wolf as the
                    parent form, others favour the claims of the jackal, while a few regard them as
                    the descendants of an extinct species, and point to the fossil remains of a
                    large dog, found in the later Tertiary deposits, as the probable wild stock. The
                    prevalent belief at the present day is probably that which regards the domestic
                    dog as the product of the crossing of several species, living and extinct. This
                    opinion is founded on such considerations as the presence in the earliest
                    historic times of many breeds (totally distinct from each other, and nearly
                    ιesembling existing forms), the existence of wild species of dogs in all
                    quarters of the globe, the fondness of savage man for taming wild animals, and
                    the extreme improbability that among so many presumably equally tameable canine
                    species only one should have been chosen for domestication. Nor is it to be
                    forgotten, as Darwin has well shown, that fear of man in most wild animals is a
                    gradually acquired instinct, and that before its acquirement a wild species
                    would have been much more readily tamed than after. Thus the wild dog of the
                    Falkland Islands <hi rend="italic">(Canis antarcticus),</hi> when these were
                    first visited by man, approached him without sign either of fear or of aversion.
                    The weightiest reason for this opinion, however, lies in the fact that many of
                    the breeds of domestic dogs, found in different countries, bear a more or less
                    striking resemblance to the wild species still existing in those countries. The
                    Esquimaux dogs of North America so closely resemble the wolf of the same
                    regions, both in appearance and in voice, that Sir J. Richardson on one occasion
                    mistook a pack of those wild animals for a troop of Indian dogs; and the Indians
                    are said to take the young of wolves in order to improve their canine breed,
                    which would seem to prove that the dog and wolf are sufficiently fertile <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se.</hi> The Hare Indian or Mackenzie River Dog, although
                    somewhat smaller in size than the prairie wolf <hi rend="italic">(Canis
                    latrans)</hi> occurring in the same regions, so resembles the latter that
                    Richardson could detect no decided difference in form. It seems, in fact, to
                    bear the same relation to the prairie wolf that the Esquimaux dog does to the
                    great grey wolf already mentioned. The wolf certainly exhibits few peculiarly
                    dog-like qualities, being both ferocious and cowardly, and showing no attachment
                    to man; but instances, nevertheless, are on record of tamed wolves which in
                    their gentleness, in love for their masters, and in intelligence, showed true
                    dog-like capacity. The Esquimaux dogs are likewise decidedly wolfish in
                    disposition, showing little or no attachment to their owners, and sometimes, it
                    is said, even attacking them when pressed by hunger. Distinct varieties of the
                    wolf occur in Europe and in India, and such European breeds as the shepherd dog
                    of Hungary so closely resemble the wolf that an Hungarian has been known to
                    mistake that animal for one of his own dogs; while certain of the Hindu pariah
                    dogs are said by Blyth to resemble the Indian variety of wolf. The large
                    semi-domesticated dogs of the northern parts of both hemispheres may thus be
                    regarded as principally derived from the various species and varieties of wolves
                    still existing there. The period of gestation in the wolf and dog is the same,
                    being 63 days in both. In the tropical regions of the Old World the wolf
                    disappears, and with it the prevalence of wolf-like dogs, their places being
                    taken by smaller breeds, such as certain of the pariah dogs of India and of
                    Egypt, between which and the jackals abounding in those countries no structural
                    difference can, according to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, be pointed out. Their
                    period of gestation agrees with that of the dog and wolf, and like dogs, tamed
                    jackals when caressed “will,” says Darwin, “jump about for joy, wag their tails,
                    lower their ears, lick their master’s hands, couch down and even throw
                    themselves on the ground belly upwards;” when frightened, also, they carry their
                    tails between their legs. Jackals associate readily with dogs, and their hybrid
                    offspring are not sterile; there is also an instance on record of one of these
                    which barked like an ordinary dog. The habit of barking, so characteristic of
                    dogs, is not, however, universal among them, the domestic dogs of Guinea and
                    certain Mexican breeds being described <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n342/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0342-0325"/> as dumb. This faculty appears to be readily lost
                    and to be capable of reacquirement. The domestic dogs which ran wild on the
                    island of Juan Fernandez are said to have lost the power of barking in 33 years,
                    and to have gradually reacquired it on removal from the island. The Hare Indian
                    Dog makes an attempt at barking, which usually ends in a howl, but the young of
                    this breed born in the Zoological Gardens seem to possess this faculty to the
                    full extent. In tropical America, where jackals are unknown, there are several
                    wild species of dogs to which the domestic breeds of those regions bear a
                    considerable resemblance, and at the present day the Arawak Indians cross their
                    dogs with an aboriginal wild species for the purpose of improving the breed. In
                    Australia the Dingo, regarded by many as constituting a distinct species
                    indigenous to that country, its remains having been found in caves associated
                    with those of other extinct mammals, occurs both in the wild state and
                    domesticated at the present day. Darwin, after reviewing this question,
                    concludes that “it is highly probable that the domestic dogs of the world have
                    descended from two good species of wolves <hi rend="italic">(Canis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lupus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. latrans),</hi> and from two or
                    three other doubtful species of wolves, namely, the European, Indian, and North
                    African forms, from at least one or two South American canine species, from
                    several races or species of the jackal, and perhaps from one or more extinct
                    species.”</p>
                <p>Remains of the dog, of Neolithic age, occur in the kitchenmiddens of Denmark, and
                    in similar deposits in Switzerland. In Denmark the earliest known dog is
                    followed, in the Bronze period, by a larger breed, and that by a still larger
                    form in the succeeding or Iron period; while a somewhat similar succession
                    occurs in Switzerland. These successive changes, however, may merely indicate
                    the appearance in those countries of new races of prehistoric man, who brought
                    with them their own dogs. In historic times the earliest records of the dog are
                    to be found in the figures of these animals on Egyptian monuments from three to
                    five thousand years old; and these show that thus early, such varieties as the
                    hound, greyhound, watch-dog, and turnspit were cultivated on the banks of the
                    Nile. By the ancient Egyptians the dog was worshipped under the title Anubis, as
                    the genius of the River Nile,—the appearance of Sirius, the dog star,
                    corresponding with the time of the annual rise of that river. The city of
                    Cynopolis was built in its honour, and there its worship was carried on with
                    great pomp. Certain kinds of dogs were regularly sacrificed to Anubis, their
                    bodies being afterwards embalmed; and occasionally the mummies of these are
                    still found. The earliest record of the dog in sacred history is in connection
                    with the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt; and the religious homage paid to it
                    by their oppressors may probably explain why the Jews were taught to regard it
                    as unclean. Under Moslem law, which in many matters was founded upon Jewish
                    practices, the dog occupies an equally degraded position; and throughout
                    Mahometan countries at the present day, their generally wretched condition bears
                    ample testimony to the neglect and ill-treatment to which for centuries they
                    have been subjected. The pariah dogs of Eastern cities know no master; they
                    prowl about the streets in troops, eating whatever garbage may come in their
                    way, thus serving the useful purpose of scavengers, and occasionally receiving a
                    meal from the more humane of the inhabitants. On no account, however, must even
                    the garments of an orthodox Mahometan be defiled by their touch, and such is the
                    intelligence and sagacity of these ownerless curs that, having become aware by
                    painful experience of this religious prejudice, they seem to take the greatest
                    care to avoid giving such offence. The value set upon the dog by the Egyptians
                    seems to have been shared in by the ancient</p>
                <p>Greeks and Romans, who possessed many breeds closely allied to still existing
                    forms. Those early breeds, however, are remarkable for the entire absence of
                    pendulous ears, which do not make their appearance till near the decline of the
                    Roman empire. By both Greeks and Romans they were employed in the chase, and in
                    war, and for the latter purpose they were armed with spiked collars, and
                    sometimes even with a coat of mail. Corinth was said to have been saved by 50
                    war dogs, which attacked the enemy that had landed while the garrison slept, and
                    which fought with unbounded courage till all were killed except one, which
                    succeeded in rousing the garrison. Shakespeare thus put no figure of speech in
                    the mouth of Antony when he exclaims—</p>
                <p>“Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.”</p>
                <p>Dogs are naturally carnivorous, preferring flesh that is slightly putrid; but
                    they can also live on vegetable food, and in countries where the dog itself is
                    eaten, it is generally thus fed. In drinking it laps with its tongue, and it
                    never perspires, although when heated its tongue hangs from its mouth, and a
                    fluid runs from it. When about to go to sleep, no matter where, it turns round
                    and round, and scratches the ground with its forepaws as if to form a hollow
                    couch; and in this seemingly senseless action it is no doubt continuing a habit
                    once found useful to its wild progenitors. Its sense of smells and hearing are
                    exceedingly acute, and many suppose that the remarkable power possessed by the
                    dog, in common with the cat, of finding its way for great distances along
                    unknown roads may be due to the exercise of the former sense. The differences
                    that obtain between the various breeds of dogs are very great, the skulls,
                    according to Cuvier, differing more from each other than they do in the
                    different species of a natural genus. The molar teeth, which normally consist of
                    6 pairs above and 7 below, sometimes number 7 pairs above and below, while in
                    the hairless dog of Egypt the teeth are sometimes reduced to a single molar on
                    each side, incisors and canines being entirely awanting. Some varieties are six
                    times as long as others, excluding the tail, and the number of vertebrae in the
                    latter organ is also exceedingly various; nor is the number of mammae always
                    uniform, there being 5 on each side in some, and 4 in others, while occasionally
                    the number on the two sides is unequal.</p>
                <p>While man has thus bestowed great attention on the physical development of the
                    dog, and availing himself of natural variations has, by careful selection and
                    intercrossing, moulded the dog into an almost infinite variety of forms, he has
                    also, by education, developed its moral and intellectual capabilities, so that
                    the dog may, in this respect, be said to have, within its own limits, kept pace
                    with its master’s advancement; and it is undoubtedly owing to a certain
                    community of feeling existing between dog and man that this domestic animal has,
                    since the earliest times, been regarded as the companion as well as the humble
                    servant of mankind. There are few human passions not shared in by the dog. It
                    is, like him, subject to anger, jealousy, envy, love, hatred, and grief; it
                    shows gratitude, pride, generosity, and fear. It sympathizes with man in his
                    troubles, and there are numerous instances on record of its showing sympathy for
                    the distressed of its own kind. It remembers, and is evidently assisted thereto,
                    as man is, by the association of ideas; that it is not devoid of imagination may
                    be assumed from the fact that it dreams, pursuing in its sleep imaginary game.
                    Its judgment is often singularly correct; while it may almost be said to have a
                    religion, in which man is its god, and his will its rule of conduct,
                    disobedience to which produces an evident feeling of shame and a quiet
                    submission to punishment. It shares with man in awe of the unknown, and the most
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0343-0326"/> courageous dog will often tremble at the sudden
                    rustle of a leaf. While the possession of such faculties has rendered him fit
                    above all other animals for the companionship of man, the physical and
                    intellectual qualities characteristic of the various breeds have been seized
                    upon and developed to their utmost by man, so as to enable him to use the dog
                    for a great variety of purposes; what these are will appear in the following
                    necessarily brief account of the more important breeds of dogs.</p>
                <p>According to Professor Fitzinger, there are at least 189 distinct varieties of
                    the domestic dog, and when it is considered that the origin of many if not most
                    of these is uncertain, it is not surprising that considerable difference of
                    opinion should exist as to the most natural mode of grouping them together.
                    Their arrangement into the following six races, founded to a certain extent on
                    the form and development of the ears, probably affords an approximation to a
                    natural classification, viz., <hi rend="smallcaps">Wolf-dogs, Greyhounds,
                    Spaniels, Hounds, Mastiffs,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Terriers.</hi></p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wolf-dogs.</hi> —Throughout the northern regions of both
                    hemispheres there are several breeds of semi-domesticated wolf-like dogs having
                    nearly erect ears, and long woolly hair; these include among others the dogs of
                    the Esquimaux and the Kamtchadales. The Esquimaux Dog is usually of a black and
                    white colour, nearly as large as a mastiff, with a fine bushy tail, and sharp
                    pointed muzzle. It is of the greatest value to the inhabitants of the boreal
                    regions of America in hunting the seal, bear, and reindeer; while it is equally
                    useful as a beast of burden, carrying loads on its back—a kind of work for which
                    dogs are by no means well suited—and drawing sledges over the snow. On a good
                    road half a dozen of these dogs will draw, it is said, from 8 to 10 cwts., at
                    the rate of 7 miles an hour; and Kane, the Arctic traveller, tells how that
                    number of dogs, well worn by previous travel, carried him with a fully burdened
                    sledge, between seven and eight hundred miles during the first fortnight after
                    leaving his ship—a mean rate of 57 miles a day. According to the same authority,
                    the training of these dogs is of the most ungracious sort. “I never neard,” he
                    says, “a kind accent from the Esquimaux to his dog. The driver’s whip of walrus
                    hide, some 20 feet long, a stone or a lump of ice skilfully directed, an
                    imprecation loud and sharp, made emphatic by the fist or foot, and a grudged
                    ration of seal’s meat, make up the winter’s entertainment of an Esquimaux team.”
                    Owing to the ill-treatment to which they are thus habitually subjected, they are
                    highly irritable and difficult to manage, and in sleighing it is necessary to
                    have a well-trained dog as leader, to whom the driver speaks, and by whom the
                    other dogs in the team are guided. They readily relapse into the wild state, and
                    have been known thus to hunt the reindeer in packs like wolves. These dogs have
                    borne a prominent part in Arctic exploration, and much of the difficult work
                    done in this field would have been well-nigh impossible without them. The
                    Kamtchatka dogs are also used for sledging, and are famed for their swiftness
                    and endurance. During summer they run at large and cater for themselves,
                    returning in winter to their masters, who feed them principally with the heads
                    of dried fish.</p>
                <p>7‰ <hi rend="italic">Sheep-dog.—</hi> In Eastern countries where the sheep follow
                    the shepherd, the duties that fall upon the dog are simpler, and require less
                    intelligence, than those performed by the European breeds. Their task is chiefly
                    to defend the flocks and herds from wild beasts and robbers, and for this
                    purpose the wolf-like Turkoman Watch-dog and the Sheep-dog of Natolia are, by
                    their great strength and courage, eminently fitted. The former is described by
                    Sir J. M ’ Neill as a shaggy animal, nearly as large as the Newfoundland dog,
                    and very fierce and powerful, the dam of the specimen he describes having killed
                    a full-grown wolf without assistance. The sheep-dog of Europe is generally
                    classed among the wolf-like dogs, owing to the erect or semi-erect character of
                    its ears, its pointed nose, and shaggy covering; and Buffon, for such reasons,
                    regarded it as nearest to the primitive type of the domestic dog. It is more
                    reasonable to suppose with Martin <hi rend="italic">(History of the Dog)</hi>
                    that those points “only indicate purity of breed unalloyed by admixture with
                    other varieties.” The fact that its life is spent almost entirely out of doors,
                    and that it has little or no opportunity of mixing with dogs other than of its
                    own kind, would tend to preserve uniformity in external appearance; while its
                    high cerebral development and intelligence prove beyond a doubt that the breed
                    of sheep-dogs is one of the most highly improved, and in this respect remotest
                    from the primitive type. Its whole intellect is devoted to the one duty of
                    tending its master’s flocks, and in the performance of this it is equally
                    sagacious, vigilant, and patient. At a word, or even a look, from its master, it
                    will gather the sheep, scattered for miles around, to one place. During and
                    after the snowstorms to which highland districts are so frequently exposed, the
                    sheep-dog is invaluable in saving its master’s property from almost total
                    destruction. Without it the Highlands of Scotland would be almost useless for
                    sheep-farming purposes. “It would require,” says the Ettrick Shepherd, “more
                    hands to manage a stock of sheep, gather them from the hills, force them into
                    houses and folds, and drive them to markets, than the profits of the whole stock
                    would be capable of maintaining.” The sheep-dog stands about</p>
                <p>15 inches high, is covered with long shaggy hair of a black colour varied with
                    dark grey or fulvous brown, and its tail is of moderate length, slightly
                    recurved and bushy. In disposition it is quiet; and although not quarrelsome, it
                    shows great courage in defending its charge. It will not wantonly attack a
                    stranger, but evidently regards him with suspicion, and rejects all friendly
                    advances. There are three varieties of the sheep dog found in Great Britain,
                    viz.—the Scottish Collie, standing only from 12 to 14 inches high, and regarded
                    as the purest and most intelligent; the Southern Sheep-dog, of larger size, but
                    with shorter fur, and having the tail often very short—a peculiarity which,
                    according to Bell, “appears to be perpetuated from parents whose tails have been
                    cut;” and the Drover’s Dog or Cur, generally black and white in colour, and
                    taller in its limbs than the others. It is employed in driving sheep and cattle
                    to the city markets, and in the discharge of this duty shows intelligence quite
                    equal to that of the other varieties; although in the treatment of the herds
                    under its charge, it often displays a more savage disposition. The sheep-dogs of
                    South America are so trained as to unite in themselves the duties of dog and
                    shepherd. “When riding,” says Darwin, “it is a common thing to meet a large
                    flock of sheep, guarded by one or two <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n344/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0344-0327"/> dogs, at the distance of some miles from any
                    house or man.” And on inquiry he found out the method by which this friendship
                    between dog and sheep had been established. The dog when a puppy is removed from
                    its mother, and is no longer allowed to associate with other dogs, or even with
                    the children of the family. It is kept in the sheep pen, and suckled by a ewe.
                    Generally also it is castrated and thus has little or no community of feeling
                    with its kind. Brought up among the sheep it shows no desire to leave the flock,
                    but assumes the position of leader. “It is amusing,” says the above writer, “to
                    observe, when approaching a flock, how the dog immediately advances barking, and
                    the sheep all close in his rear as if round the oldest ram.” It comes home daily
                    for food, on receipt of which it immediately returns to the flock; and this it
                    is often taught to bring home in the evening.</p>
                <p>The Newfoundland and Great St Bernard or Alpine Dogs occupy an uncertain
                    position, forming, according to some authors, a group by themselves, and being
                    classed by others among the wolf-like dogs, although in their large and
                    pendulous ears they differ widely from the typical forms already noticed.</p>
                <p>The Newfoundland Dog is believed to have been brought to England from the island
                    to which it owes its name, but probably owing to partial crossing, it differs
                    somewhat from the original American breed, the latter being smaller in size,
                    with the muzzle less blunted, and almost totally black in colour. In
                    Newfoundland and Labrador these dogs fare used as beasts of burden, drawing
                    considerable loads of wood and provisions on sledges. The feet are partially
                    webbed, and consequently they are unrivalled as water-dogs, and although their
                    weakness of scent and comparative slowness of foot renders them useless to the
                    hunter, yet in a country of fens and morasses, the sportsman finds them of the
                    greatest service in rescuing birds that have fallen into the water; nor do they
                    hesitate in their eagerness for retrieving to make their way through the
                    roughest cover. The English variety of Newfoundland Dog is a noble creature,
                    standing 30 inches high at the shoulders, its hair waved or curly and of a black
                    and white colour in nearly equal proportions, its tail massive and bushy and
                    curled upwards at the extremity. Equally noble in disposition, it does not allow
                    the annoyance of smaller dogs to disturb its serenity, while its patience with
                    children is not readily exhausted. In defence of its master’s property it will
                    fly with bull-dog ferocity at any intruder, while it will battle with the waters
                    to save him from drowning. Its services in the saving of life are well known.
                    When kept in confinement its temper is more variable, and in a fit of irritation
                    these dogs have been known to attack those for whom they have previously shown
                    the greatest regard; but even in confinement such cases are altogether
                    exceptional. This breed is supposed by some not to be indigenous to North
                    America, but to have been introduced either on the first discovery of
                    Newfoundland by the Norwegians about the year 1000, or on its re-discovery by
                    Cabot in 1497. The Norwegians, according to Martin, have dogs closely resembling
                    the Newfoundland breed, which are used in hunting bears and wolves, and which
                    are armed with spiked collars in order to protect them from the wolves which
                    seek to seize them by the throat. The Great St Bernard Dog of the present day is
                    a powerful animal, as large as a mastiff, with close short hair and pendulous
                    ears, and varying in colour, in one case being described as “sandy red or tawny”
                    with black muzzle, in another as “more or less marked with grey, liver colour,
                    and black clouds.” Previous to 1820 there existed another breed of these dogs,
                    closely allied in form and size to the Newfoundland, but in that year the
                    greater portion of them died of an epidemic, which necessitated the introduction
                    of the present variety. These dogs are kept by the monks of the Hospice of St
                    Bernard, in their convent, situated on one of the most dangerous passes between
                    Switzerland and Italy, near the top of the Great St Bernard, where they are
                    trained to the work of rescuing travellers who, overtaken by the snowstorm, may
                    have lost their way, or sunk benumbed by the cold. On such occasions these
                    sagacious and powerful dogs set out from the convent in pairs, one bearing a
                    flask of spirits attached to his neck, the other with a cloak. Should they come
                    upon the baffled yet struggling traveller, they conduct him to the convent; but
                    should he have succumbed and be covered by the snow, their keen scent detects
                    his presence although buried several feet beneath the surface. By loud
                    barking—and a young dog of this breed kept many years ago in the suburbs of
                    Edinburgh was able to make itself heard a mile away—they apprise the monks of
                    the need of succour, while with their feet they attempt to clear away the snow
                    from the body. In this way these dogs are instrumental in saving many lives
                    every year, although often at the sacrifice of their own; one dog which thus met
                    its death bore a medal stating that it had been the means of saving twenty-two
                    lives.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Greyhounds.</hi> —Representations on Egyptian monuments
                    prove the existence of the greyhound race of dogs at least 3000 years ago, and
                    the silky-haired breeds existing in Egypt, Arabia, and Persia at the present day
                    are probably the slightly modified descendants of those ancient forms. The
                    numerous varieties of this race may be conveniently grouped into the wire-haired
                    and smooth-haired breeds,—of the first of which the Irish Greyhound or Wolfdog
                    is an example. In former times this magnificent breed was employed in Ireland in
                    hunting the wolf and the stag, but the extirpation of these beasts of chase led
                    to the neglect and consequent degeneracy of the breed, and it has now become
                    extinct in that country. It was probably introduced from the sister isle into
                    Scotland, where its modified descendant, the Scottish Deerhound, in hunting the
                    stag still bears testimony to the great strength and agility of its progenitor.
                    The Old English Greyhound was only allowed to be kept by the nobles and princes,
                    and the killing of it was, under the old game laws, a felony punishable by
                    death. It was employed in coursing the red deer and fallow deer, and Queen
                    Elizabeth is said to have witnessed, on one occasion, the pulling down of 16
                    bucks by greyhounds. These must have been much more powerful animals than the
                    modern English breed, which, however, is regarded as the finest of the
                    smooth-haired greyhounds. In speed and w ind it is unrivalled, all other points
                    having been sacrificed to these by breeders. It has thus almost lost the power
                    of scent, and is the only dog that hunts by sight alone, hence probably the name
                    <hi rend="italic">gaze</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0345-0328"/><hi rend="italic">hound</hi> formerly applied to
                    it. According to Daniel, its speed on flat ground is little inferior to that of
                    a racehorse, while on hilly ground it is probably superior to it. Every part of
                    its body is suggestive of activity and speed—the long and pointed muzzle, the
                    narrow head, thin neck, chest deep aud flanks contracted, long slender legs, and
                    the tail narrow and curved upwards. It is exceedingly docile, good-tempered, and
                    affectionate. The colour varies in different breeds, and even in individuals of
                    the same breed. Bell suggests that the greyhound may owe its name to the
                    prevailing colour of the original stock; while others, with more probability,
                    derive it from the ancient British <hi rend="italic">gredι</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">greg,</hi> a dog. The Italian greyhound is a small but exceedingly
                    elegant and delicate breed, relegated in this country to the parlour as a
                    ladies’ pet. The Lurcher is supposed to be the result of a cross between the
                    rough greyhound and the sheep-dog, having the sharp, pointed muzzle of the
                    former, and owing its diminished height but greater stoutness to the latter. It
                    resembles the sheep-dog still more in its great intelligence, and in devotion to
                    its master. That master is usually the poacher, and in his illegal pursuit of
                    game, the keeness of scent, the cunning, and the absolute silence of this dog
                    render it the most suitable of all for such nocturnal work. It waylays the
                    rabbit returning to its burrow, its cunning circumvents the hare where its speed
                    would not avail, and it has strength sufficient to pull down the fallow deer.
                    According to Colonel Smith these dogs sometimes run wild when their owners are
                    captured and imprisoned, and when thus catering for themselves they have been
                    regularly hunted with hounds.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Spaniels.</hi> —The spaniels are characterized by large
                    pendulous ears, long silky hair often curled and shaggy, and acute scent. In
                    cerebral development, and, consequently in intelligence, they are probably
                    superior to all other dogs, while they are unrivalled in docility and in
                    devotion to man’s service. They include the Common Spaniel, the Water Dog, and
                    the Setter, besides numerous fancy varieties, as King Charles’s Spaniel, the
                    Blenheim Spaniel, and the Maltese Dog. The Spaniel is the favourite of the
                    sportsman, entering more than any other dog into his master’s feelings, and
                    seeming to enjoy the sport for its own sake. It is elegant in form, with
                    remarkably long ears, and beautifully waved hair, usually of a red and white
                    colour. It takes readily to the water, and has been known to exhibit a
                    remarkable propensity, as well as great dexterity, in fish-catching. The Water
                    Dog is larger than the spaniel, and is covered with abundant curly hair. Its
                    colour is generally a mixture of black and white. From its aquatic habits it is
                    of great service to the water-fowl sportsman as a retriever. It is readily
                    taught to fetch and carry, and the sagacity which it shows in finding any
                    article it has once seen, but which has afterwards been lost or purposely
                    concealed, is truly remarkable. The Setter is also a favourite with sportsmen,
                    its habit of crouching when it has scented game rendering it specially
                    serviceable. This habit, like that of pointing, is probably, as Darwin suggests,
                    “merely the exaggerated pause of an animal about to spring on its prey.” It is
                    generally white in colour, with large liver-coloured spots.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hounds.</hi> —Hounds are those dogs with long pendulous
                    ears, close hair, and long deep muzzle which hunt by scent. They include the
                    Bloodhound, Staghound, Foxhound, Harrier or Beagle, and Pointer.</p>
                <p>The Bloodhound, regarded by many as the original stock from which all the other
                    varieties of British hounds have been derived, is now rarely to be met with in
                    entire purity. Its distinguishing features are long, smooth, and pendulous ears,
                    from 8 to 9 inches in length, full muzzle, broad breast, muscular limbs, and a
                    deep sonorous voice. The prevailing colour is a reddish tan, darkening towards
                    the upper part, and often varied with large black spots, lt stands about 28
                    inches high. The bloodhound is remarkable for the acuteness of its scent, its
                    discrimination in keeping to the particular scent on which it is first laid, and
                    the intelligence and pertinacity with which it pursues its object to a
                    successful issue. These qualities have been taken advantage of not only in the
                    chase, but also in pursuit of felons and fugitives of every kind. According to
                    Strabo, these dogs were used in an attack upon the Gauls. In the clan feuds of
                    the Scottish Highlands, and in the frequent wars between England and Scotland,
                    they were regularly employed in tracking fugitive warriors, and were thus
                    employed, according to early chroniclers, in pursuit of Wallace and Bruce. The
                    former is said to have put the Sleuth-hound, as it was called, off the scent by
                    killing a suspected follower, on whose corpse the hound stood,</p>
                <p>“Nor farther moved fra’ time she found the blood.”</p>
                <p>For a similar purpose captives were often killed. Bruce is said to have baffled
                    his dogged pursuer as effectually, though less cruelly, by wading some distance
                    down a stream, and then ascending a tree by a branch which overhung the water,
                    and thus breaking the scent. In the histories of border feuds these dogs
                    constantly appear as employed in the pursuit of enemies, and the renown of the
                    warrior was great who,</p>
                <p>“By wily turns and desperate bounds, Had baffled Percy’s best bloodhounds.”</p>
                <p>In suppressing the Irish rebellion in the time of Queen Elizabeth, the earl of
                    Essex had, it is said, 800 of these animals accompanying the army, while in
                    later times they <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0346-0329"/> became the terror of deer-stealers, and for this
                    purpose were kept by the earls of Buccleuch so late as the 18th century, and
                    even at the present time their remarkable power of scent is occasionally
                    employed with success in the detection of murder. The Cuban Bloodhound is of
                    Spanish descent, and differs considerably in form from the English variety,
                    having small, though pendulous ears, with the nose more pointed, and with a more
                    ferocious appearance. Its employment in the capture of runaway slaves, and in
                    the cruelties connected with the suppression of negro insurrections, has brought
                    the animal into the evil repute which more properly belongs to the inhuman
                    masters, who thus prostituted the courage, sagacity, and pertinacity of this
                    noble dog to such revolting purposes.</p>
                <p>The Staghound has been generally regarded as the result of a cross between the
                    slow-paced old southern hound and the fleeter foxhound; but it has been objected
                    that the breed was known in England long before the foxhound was made use of,
                    and indeed before there was an animal at all resembling the one which is now
                    known by that term, and those who maintain this view regard the staghound as a
                    bloodhound crossed with some lighter dog, as a greyhound or a lurcher. However
                    produced, it is a majestic dog, of great strength and considerable swiftness,
                    besides possessing in common with the bloodhound, and with it alone, the
                    property of unerringly tracing the scent it is first laid upon among a hundred
                    others. In the reign ofGeorge</p>
                <p>HI., who was himself ardently attached to the sport of stag-hunting, packs of
                    these dogs were maintained in several parts of the country, but since the death
                    of that monarch this form of hunting has declined, and the total extinction of
                    these dogs at no distant date seems probable. The Foxhound is the hunting-dog
                    upon which the breeder has bestowed the greatest pains, and, according to Bell
                    <hi rend="italic">(British Quadrupeds),</hi> his efforts have been rewarded “by
                    the attainment of the highest possible degree of excellence in the union of fine
                    scent, fleetness, strength, perseverance, and temper.” It stands usually from 20
                    to 22 inches high at the shoulders, and is of a white colour, marked with large
                    clouds of black and tan. Its speed is such that a foxhound has been known to get
                    over 4 miles in 7 minutes, while its endurance has been shown in such cases as
                    the 10 hours’ continuous run performed by the duke of Richmond’s hounds in 1738
                    before killing the fox, during which many of the sportsmen tired three horses,
                    and several of the latter died during the chase. The Harrier is smaller than the
                    foxhound, not exceeding 18 inches in height at the shoulders, and is exclusively
                    used, as the name shows, in hunting the hare. Of late years it has been greatly
                    improved, so as to be almost literally a foxhound in minia ture. According to
                    Beckford, to whom much of the improvement in the breed is owing, “harriers, to
                    be good, like all other hounds, must be kept to their own game. If you run fox
                    with them you spoil them; hounds cannot be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0347-0330"/> perfect unless used to one scent and one style of
                    hunting.” A still smaller hound is the Beagle, from 12 to 14 inches high, the
                    most diminutive of the hunting dogs. It was formerly a great favourite, being
                    used in hunting the hare, but in this it has been almost wholly superseded by
                    the harrier. It is much slower than the foxhound or harrier, but in spite of
                    this its exquisite scent and its perseverance seldom fail to secure for it the
                    object of its chase, although it may be after a leisurely hunt of 3 or 4 hours.
                    The voice of the beagle is highly musical, and on this account a certain number
                    of them were formerly added to each pack of hounds as a band now is to a
                    regiment of soldiers. Diminutive packs, from 9 to 10 inches high, have been
                    kept, and O’Connell used to beguile his winter leisure with a dozen of these
                    tiny favourites. The Pointer is related to the hounds, and is supposed to be
                    derived from an old Spanish breed. It is a beautiful, smooth-haired dog,
                    coloured somewhat like a foxhound, active in its movement, and patient of
                    fatigue. It owes its name to its habit of standing fixed at the scent of game,
                    and this, like the crouching of the setter, whether due to long-continued
                    training alone, or to the modification and exaggeration by man of the
                    instinctive start of surprise common to all dogs, when first aware of their
                    prey, is now inherited, the puppy pointing before his training has begun. The
                    strength of this pointing propensity was never more signally shown than in the
                    case, told by Daniel, of two pointers which stood immovable as statues during
                    the hour and a quarter occupied in sketching them. The Dalmatian Dog is a
                    remarkably handsome breed, apparently intermediate between hound and pointer It
                    is of a white colour, thickly marked with rounded black spots, but it is not
                    sufficiently keen scented or sagacious to be of use in hunting. It has
                    accordingly been relegated to the stables, where it receives the training
                    necessary to a coach-dog. It is known in France as th^ <hi rend="italic">Prague
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">Bengale,</hi> and is supposed to be an Indian
                    variety.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mastiffs.</hi> —The Mastiff race of dogs is characterized
                    by extreme shortness and breadth of muzzle, enormous strength of jaws, and
                    general robustness of form. It includes the Mastiff, the Bull-dog, and the
                    Pug.</p>
                <p>The Mastiff equals in courage, while in strength, intelligence, and mildness of
                    disposition it excels, its near ally the bull-dog. It is commonly supposed to
                    have been the breed of large dogs abundant in Britain during Boman times, which
                    were exported in large numbers to Rome for the purpose of fighting in the
                    Amphitheatre, although Colonel Smith believes that these early British dogs were
                    only bull-dogs of a larger size than the present breed, and that the mastiff was
                    introduced into Britain from the cold regions of Central Asia. It is a large
                    dog, standing 30 inches high at the shoulders, with thick muzzle, pendulous bps,
                    and heavy expression, its ears small and drooping, and the tail well developed.
                    It is usually of a buff colour, with ears and muzzle darker. Although fierce in
                    combat, it does not attack without considerable provocation, and it bears the
                    teasings of children with the greatest good nature. When in former times it
                    entered into combat with wild animals, it has been known to engage a bear, a
                    leopard, and a lion, and pull each of them down in succession. At the present
                    time the breed is rarely met with pure, and is chiefly useful as a watch-dog,
                    its sagacity and fidelity in this capacity being well known. While he shows
                    great attachment to man when made his companion, the temper of the mastiff
                    becomes soured by confinement, and he is then dangerous to strangers. The Thibet
                    Mastiff is larger than the English breed, and its countenance is still heavier.
                    It is the watch-dog of the tribes inhabiting Thibet and the Central Asian
                    table-land, to whom it is strongly attached, although exceedingly savage towards
                    strangers. There is a huge mastiff figured on an Assyrian sculpture, G40 B,c.,
                    and Sir H. Rawlinson states that similar dogs are still imported into that
                    country. The Bull-dog is the least sagacious, as well as the most ferocious and
                    obstinate, of the dog tribe. It is smaller than the mastiff, but is strongly
                    built. Its broad, thick head, the projection of the lower jaw beyond the upper
                    disclosing the incisor teeth, the sudden rise of the head from the face, and the
                    scowling expression of the eyes, combine to make the countenance of the bull-dog
                    terrible. Bell points out, in his <hi rend="italic">History of British
                    Quadrupeds,</hi> the resemblance in the deep chest, the narrow loins, muscular
                    limbs, and stiff tapering tail of the bull-dog to the elegant form of the
                    greyhound. The chief difference appears in the muzzle, a variation which may
                    have suddenly arisen in a single individual, and been perpetuated in its
                    progeny. The ears of the bull-dog are short and semi-erect, and the nostrils
                    distended; the colour varies, being brindled in some, and black and white in
                    others. It is essentially a fighting-dog, and was formerly bred for the brutal
                    sport of bull-baiting, in which its terrible obstinacy usually gained for it the
                    victory. It differs from other dogs in giving no warning of its attack by
                    preliminary barking, and when once it has fixed its teeth into the object of
                    attack, no amount of torture will cause it to relax its hold. Colonel Smith
                    states that he has seen one “pinning down an American bison and holding his nose
                    down till the animal gradually brought forward its hind feet, and, crushing the
                    dog to death, tore his muzzle out of the fangs, most dreadfully mangled;” and
                    there is an instance on record of its returning to the attack on a bull, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n348/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0348-0331"/> after each of its feet had been cut off in
                    succession. The intelligence of this breed has been but slightly developed, and
                    it exhibits little of that attachment to man which characterises other dogs,
                    although it may be said to show a sullen sort of fondness for its master. The
                    Spanish Bulldog is larger and more powerful than the English breed. The Pug-dog,
                    which in form might be described as a miniature bull-dog, is probably a
                    monstrous variety, rather than a degenerate form, of the bull-dog. It is,
                    however, wholly unlike the latter in disposition, being timid and good-tempered,
                    and is kept only as a pet, for which its dulness of intellect scarcely fits
                    it.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Terriers.</hi> —These include the numerous varieties of
                    Terrier dog, and the Turnspit. The Terrier is a small but very distinct breed,
                    and is probably one of the oldest dogs found in Great Britain. Three distinct
                    varieties exist in this country, viz., the English Terrier, smooth and graceful
                    in form, with sharp muzzle and erect ears, compact body, strong though slender
                    limbs, and tail carried aloft and somewhat curved—the colour being black, with
                    the belly and extremities usually tan, but sometimes white; the Scotch Terrier,
                    differing from the former in the shortness of the muzzle and limbs, and in the
                    rough wiry character of the hair, which is usually of a dirty white colour; and
                    the Skye Terrier, distinguished by the length aud coarseness of its hair, the
                    extreme shortness of its limbs, and the great length of its body. It is of a
                    light brown colour. The Terrier in all its varieties is an exceedingly bold,
                    active, and intelligent dog. It was formerly a regular accompaniment to every
                    pack of hounds, for the purpose of unearthing the fox, and to its eagerness in
                    taking the earth it owes its name. Terriers are now chiefly employed in the
                    destruction of otters, badgers, weasels, and rats, a form of sport into which
                    they enter with the greatest ardour, and in which they show the most remarkable
                    dexterity, a celebrated Terrier having been known to kill 100 rats, collected in
                    one room, in 7 minutes. The Bull-terrier is a cross between this breed and the
                    bull-dog, and is one of the most savage and obstinate of its kind. It was the
                    breed chiefly used in the brutal sports of badger-baiting and dog-fighting, now
                    almost unknown in England. The Turnspit, a monstrous form of dog, is not
                    confined to any single breed. It is figured on the ancient monuments of Egypt,
                    and occurs among the pariah dogs of India and of Paraguay. In Britain, wſliere
                    they seem to be derived from hounds or terriers, there are smooth and rough
                    turnspits, a name which they owe to their having been formerly employed in
                    turning kitchen spits by working inside a wheel, which when once set in motion
                    forced the dog to continue running At Caerleon in Monmouthshire, a few years
                    ago, a dog of this kind might have been seen thus employed in the inn kitchen.
                    The turnspit is characterized by great length of body and extreme shortness of
                    limb, the latter being generally crooked. (J. Gi.)</p>
