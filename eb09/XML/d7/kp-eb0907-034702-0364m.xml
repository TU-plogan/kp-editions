                    section than these. But some, especially in the East, have what is called an
                    ogival outline, convex below and concave towards the top, and these are
                    generally called <hi rend="italic">cupolas,</hi> though there is no real
                    distinction. Most of the great European domes have an opening or eye at the top,
                    on which stands a lantern, except iu the Pantheon at Rome, where the eye is
                    open. Until modern times all the domes worth notice were of masonry, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> stone, brick, tiles, or pots, which last were used for
                    lightness. Probably the first large wooden dome was St Paul’s, of which the
                    construction is peculiar, the inner dome visible in the church being of brick
                    only 18 inches thick, except near the bottom where it grows out of a cone of the
                    same thickness going up outside it and carrying the stone lantern, which' looks
                    right down into the church through an eye in the internal dome. Outside the cone
                    is built a wooden dome covered with lead. The domes of St Peter’s at Rome and
                    Florence Cathedral are of two stone shells near together, and connected by some
                    vertical ribs, and also carrying lanterns. But Wren’s construction is infinitely
                    stronger, since a cone sufficiently tied at the bottom cannot give way until it
                    is absolutely crushed, while the bursting pressure of a weight on the top of a
                    dome increases the bursting force enormously. St Peter’s dome is cracked in
                    several places, and held to* gether by bands, and it is covered with lead, and
                    therefore looks no better than St Paul’s, and indeed on the whole not near so
                    well, for various reasons which may be seen in architectural books; and the
                    lantern is smaller in proportion. The only full mathematical investigation of
                    the theory of domes with practical results, that we know of, is in a paper by
                    Sir Edmund Beckett (then Mr Denison) in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the
                    Royal Institute of British Architects</hi> of February 1871, and two shorter
                    ones by Mr E. W. Tarn, architect, in the <hi rend="italic">Civil Engineer's
                    Journal</hi> of March 1868, which substantially agree, so far as they deal with
                    the same points. The investigation is long and complicated, and can only be done
                    approximately, because the introduction of the thickness deranges all the
                    ordinary trigonometrical relations, and so we only give the principal results of
                    those calculations. Some more of them are given in Sir E. Beckett’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Book on Building.</hi> It is easy to prove by strict mathematics
                    that the upper 52° (nearly) of a hemispherical dome would be absolutely stable,
                    or have no tendency to fall in or burst out, without any sensible thickness, if
                    only tied strongly enough round the base, where the tension would be <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 of the weight of the complete hemisphere,
                    disregarding the bonding effect of mortar and friction. The weigh t of a thin
                    hemispherical shell is the same as that of a cylinder of the same height and
                    thickness standing on the same base, and is twice that of the area which the
                    dome covers, of the same thickness, provided that bears only a small proportion
                    to the diameter. The weight of any zone of the dome is proportional to its
                    height. A hemisphere of ordinary stone 100 feet wide at mid-thickness and 1 foot
                    thick weighs about 1000 tons. It is also demonstrable that a dome spreading at
                    the bottom a little more than a hemisphere, so as not to start vertically, and
                    rather flattened at the top, would stand without any sensible thickness; and so
                    would sundry other curves, and especially an inverted <hi rend="italic"
                    >catenary,</hi> which will stand even as an independent arch without thickness,
                    for a dome is far more stable than an arch or a barrel vault of the same
                    thickness.</p>
                <p>The essential difference between them is that the mathematical <hi rend="italic"
                    >elemaerd</hi> of a dome is not an arch of any uniform breadth, but one whose
                    breadth, and therefore weight, decreases upwards to nothing, being in fact a <hi
                    rend="italic">lune</hi> enclosed between two meridians very close together. And
                    it was shown in the R.I.B.A. paper, and also by models exhibited, that a dome is
                    stable with a thickness of only ’ 023 of its diameter, while an independent
                    round arch or a barrel vault requires three times as much thickness, or O72 of
                    its diameter. Therefore a barrel vault 100 feet wide must be 7 feet thick to be
                    stable, while a dome of that diameter need only be 27 inches; besides which, the
                    strength of the dome can be increased to almost any extent by building in iron
                    bands in the lower courses, while a barrel vault cannot be so helped. Bands
                    would be of no use whatever in a dome above 52° from the top, as the pressure
                    above that point is entirely inward, assuming it to be tied there, and from
                    thence it gradually increases towards the bottom, where the tension is ∙215 of
                    the weight of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0365-0348"/> hemisphere. It may seem paradoxical that it
                    should be less there than at 52’; but the explanation is that the tension bears
                    a higher proportion to the weight in a thin dome than a thick one, and it was an
                    infinitely thin one which had the tension of *3 of its weight at 52’; and such a
                    dome cannot be carried lower without bands. In a dome of the required thickness
                    ties would have very little to do above 68°.</p>
                <p>As the tension at the bottom is rather more than a fifth of the weight, a dome of
                    proper thickness would be stable standing on a conical <hi rend="italic"
                    >drum,</hi> with a slope inwards of about 1 to 5, or 12°, of which the tangent
                    is *215, if the drum itself has foundations which cannot spread. The thickness
                    requisite, and also the tension at the bottom, may evidently be greatly
                    diminished by gradually tapering the dome upwards. If it is half as thick at the
                    top as at the bottom, with the thickness increasing downwards as the height, it
                    need only weigh ∙⅛ of the lightest uniform dome of the same size, and only need
                    be 20 inches thick at the bottom for 100 feet diameter.</p>
                <p>Pointed domes are also much stronger than hemispheres, having lost the flat top
                    which has the greatest bursting pressure. A dome generated by the revolution of
                    an equilateral arch, or one of 60°, requires a thickness only≡O137 diameter, or
                    16∣ inches for 100 feet; and one of 70° requires 20 inches. The tension at the
                    bottom of a 60’ dome is only ’ 15 of its weight, which weight, however, is 1372
                    of a hemisphere on the same base, their heights being as 1 ’ 73 to 1.</p>
                <p>For the same reason pointed domes are fittest for carrying a lantern, but they
                    are not much benefited by tapering, having already lost the most oppressive
                    part. The Florence dome, across the flat sides of the polygon, is about 70’ of
                    the circle of its curvature. It is shown in the R.I.B.A. paper that both in
                    hemispherical and pointed domes the weight of the lantern they will carry varies
                    practically as the cube of the thickness. Moreover a lanterned dome requires
                    tieing much higher up than a plain one. In short, the cone is the only proper
                    way of carrying a stone lantern. The cone at St Paul’s has a great chain round
                    the base, which is probably superfluous, as the drum below it seems thick enough
                    to contain the requisite slope, and visibly leans inwards besides.</p>
                <p>Ribs inside a dome weaken more than strengthen it, as some persons imagine,
                    unless they are themselves deep enough to be stable as independent arches, or
                    unless they decrease in width and weight upwards like a lune, as those in the
                    Pantheon do, which also is so enormously thick at the haunches that it has
                    superabundant stability. Some of the Indian domes are thick enough for arches,
                    and they have neither eyes nor lanterns. Polygonal domes may be considered as
                    composed of a small number of widish lunes, and only differ from round ones in
                    being rather weaker for any given thickness and size.</p>
                <p>Domes require no wooden centring to build them on as arches do, until you get
                    near the top, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> so long as each stone laid on the
                    ring of stones below it will not slide inwards. Aud if they are notched to
                    prevent sliding the whole dome may be built without centring. The dome of Mousta
                    in Malta was so built in this century by a common mason, who must, however, have
                    been a man of genius. There would be no difficulty in building a dome of almost
                    any size of bricks or stones, with the help of hoop iron in all the lower
                    courses up to about 22’ from the bottom, and then less up to 52“, and higher if
                    it has to carry a lantern. There is no masonry dome in the world wider than 142
                    feet. But there have been several larger iron ones, which are an easy piece of
                    engineering, inasmuch as iron has enormous tensile strength, while stone has
                    very little, and mortar practically none; and all the calculations above
                    mentioned assume the domes to be composed of narrow lunes having no lateral bond
                    or tie; but on the other hand all the stones are assumed to go right through the
                    thickness and not to be liable to crush at the edges. Building the lowest
                    courses with horizontal beds, which some architects suggested, was shown to be
                    exactly the opposite of what is mathematically required, as there would be
                    nothing to prevent their sliding over each other, whereas the essence of
                    dome-construction is that the lower courses should confine the upper. It is not
                    however practically expedient to make the beds lean inwards so much as to
                    involve acute angles of the stones, as such angles in stone will bear very
                    little pressure. Brick domes over wells or tanks, which should always be round
                    for strength, are usually built on mere mounds of earth for centring, and they
                    are always of flat section, or only about the upper half of a hemisphere, and
                    are consequently stable with very little thickness, as the earth round them
                    forms a strong abutment.</p>
