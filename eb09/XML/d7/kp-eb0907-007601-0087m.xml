                    its least width, where it is divided into two unequal portions. It embraces a
                    superficial area of 392,005 statute acres, or 6l2∣ square miles. The population
                    in 1871 amounted to 105,102 persons, 52,866 males and 52,236 females; in 1861 it
                    numbered 100,778, and in 1851, 92,583. The county was formed 27 Hen. VIII., out
                    of the lordships of Denbigh, Ruthin, Rhos, and Rhyfoniog, corresponding roughly
                    with the district called Perfeddwlad (or the midland between the Conway and the
                    Clwyd), and the lordships of Bromfield, Yale, and Chirkland, which at an earlier
                    period had been comprised in the possessions of Gruffydd ap Madoc, the lord of
                    Dinas Bran. It is bounded on the W. in its northern division by the River
                    Conway, from one of its ancient mouths in Llandrillo Bay to its source in the
                    Migneint mountains, in the southern by the Berwyn chain, and on its extreme E.
                    by the line of the Dee, the Ceiriog, and a portion of Offa’s Dyke. The
                    intervening surface is very irregular, and its physical character highly
                    diversified. The N.W. portion is occupied by the bleak, bare table-land of the
                    Hiraethog hills, which slope on the west to the valley of the Conway and on the
                    east to the Vale of Clwyd, by which they are divided from the Clwydian range and
                    the. hills of Yale. On the N. it stretches along the bays of Colwyn and
                    Abergele, and on the S. it is separated from Merionethshire by the Yspytty and
                    Llangwm range. From this watershed flow tributaries of the Clwyd, the Conway,
                    and the Dee—viz., the Elwy, the Aled, the Clywedog, the Merddwr, and the Alwen.
                    The valleys along which some of these streams flow are, from their fertility and
                    natural beauty, in striking contrast to their bleak surroundings. Among these
                    may be specified the beautiful gorge of the Elwy and the broad fertile plain of
                    the Vale of Clwyd. Of the other division, which extends from near Farndon Bridge
                    in the N.E. to the Rhaiadr in Mochnant S.W., that portion which lies between the
                    Rhuabon hills and the Dee is extremely rich in minerals as well as in
                    agricultural produce; the other portion, from the Berwyn to Offa’s Dyke, is
                    comparatively wild and barren, save the pretty valley of the Tanat, the cup-like
                    plain of Llansilin, and the lower reaches of the Ceiriog. One of the feeders of
                    the Tanat rolls down a waterfall named Pistyll Rhaidr, which is 240 feet high;
                    and another rises in the little lake of “Llyncaws,” which nestles beneath Moel
                    Sych, 2716 feet, the highest point in the Berwyn range, and indeed in the
                    county. There are also a few lakes in the Hiraethog district, the largest of
                    which—Aled and Alwen—give rise to rivers of the same names.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil and Agriculture.—</hi> On the uplands the soil is too cold
                    and poor, and the seasons too uncongenial, to admit of good corn crops; but a
                    more profitable investment is made in the rearing of mountain ponies and of
                    sheep and black cattle, which are sold in great numbers to be fattened in the
                    Midland Counties of England, for the London market. Less than a third of the
                    surface is under cultivation; and the agricultural acreage was thus distributed
                    in the years 1873 and 1876 :—</p>

                <p>In the valleys, and indeed far up the sunny slopes of the hills, the latest
                    improvements in agriculture may be observed, and the reaping hook and the flail
                    are fast disappearing before the reaping and the thrashing machines. This
                    progress has been largely due to several Farmers’ Clubs, such as the
                    Denbighshire and Flintshire, the Vale of Conway, and the Cerrigydrudion. But the
                    railways have done still more. The Vale of Llanrwst, the Vale of Clwyd, and the
                    Denbigh and Chester lines have linked their respective districts to the great
                    trunk line of the London and North Western; whilst the Denbigh, Ruthin, and
                    Corwen, the Corwen and Rhuabon, the Wrexham and Connah’s Quay, and yet again the
                    Rhos-llanerchrugog and the Glyn Ceiriog tramways, have done the same for the
                    Great Western,—thus opening all the main arteries of the county alike to
                    external and internal communication, and vastly developing its resources. Down
                    the picturesque Vale of Llangollen also runs the great Holyhead Road—in its day
                    the principal means of communication between London and Ireland, and for
                    engineering skill, excellency of workmanship, and beauty of scenery probably
                    still unsurpassed in the United Kingdom,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">geology</hi> of the county is full of interest, as it
                    develops all the principal strata that intervene between the Lower Silurian and
                    the Triassic series. In the Lower Silurian district, which extends from the
                    southern boundary to the Ceiriog, the Llandeilo formation of the eastern slopes
                    of the Berwyn and the Bala beds of shelly sandstone are traversed east and west
                    by bands of intrusive felspathic porphyry and ashes; northwards from the Ceiriog
                    to the limestone fringe at Llandrillo, the Wenlock shale òf the Upper Silurian
                    covers the entire mass of the Hiraethog and Clwydian hills, but verging on its
                    western slopes into the Denbighshire grit, which may be traced southward in a
                    continuous line from the mouth of the Conway as far a Llanddewi Ystrad Enni in
                    Radnorshire. On its eastern slope a narrow broken band of the Old Red crops up
                    along the Vale of Clwyd and in Eglwyseg. Resting upon this the Carboniferous
                    Limestone extends from Llanymynach, its extreme southern point, to the
                    Cyrnybrain fault, and there forks into two divisions that terminate respectively
                    in the Great Orme’s Head and in Talargoch, and are separated from each other by
                    the denuded shales of the Moel Famma range. In the Vale of Clwyd the limestone
                    underlies the New Red Sandstone, and in the eastern division it is itself
                    overlaid by the millstone grit of Rhuabon and Minera, and by a long reach of the
                    coal measures which near Wrexham are 4J miles in breadth. Eastward of these a
                    broad strip of the Permian succeeds, and yet again between this and the Dee the
                    ground is occupied—as in the Vale of Clwyd—by the New Red.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mineral resources</hi> of the county under these conditions
                    are naturally considerable. Paving flags are raised at Nantglyn; slates and
                    slabs for ornamental purposes, on a large scale, on Rhiwfelen, near Llangollen;
                    and slates at Glyn Ceiriog. The limestone is used largely, and exported
                    extensively for building, fluxing, and agricultural purposes; and at Brymbo
                    there is a fine layer of China stone. The sandstones of Cefn Rhuabon are wrought
                    into grindstones, and the grit is used for millstones. The coal measures at
                    Chirk, Rhuabon, and Brymbo are very productive, the number of collieries in 1875
                    being 61, and the quantity raised annually estimated at 1,379,560 tons. In close
                    contiguity to the coal seams, ironstone is found; and the six furnaces in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n88/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0088-0077"/> blast at Rhuabon and at Brymbo (where John
                    Wilkinson was the first to introduce the industry) produced (together with one
                    in Flintshire) in the same year 55,099 tons of pig iron, valued at £232,000.
                    Lead ore is another and still more important item; the most productive mine has
                    been the Great Minera, which yields profits of about £30,000 a year. The seven
                    mines in the county produced, in 1875, 2600 tons of lead ore, 1954 tons of lead,
                    and 10,873 ounces of silver. One of the latest industries introduced has been
                    the manufacture of dynamite in the valley of the Ceiriog. At the village of
                    Llansantffraid, and at Llangollen, there are woollen factories.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">principal</hi><hi rend="italic">towns</hi> are Wrexham
                    (population 8576), the centre of the mining district, noted for its beautiful
                    church tower, and recently selected as the military centre for North Wales;
                    Denbigh, the nominal capital (4276), notable for its castle ruins and Howell’s
                    female orphan school; Ruthin (3298), where the assizes are held, famous for its
                    grammar school and its fine castle lately rebuilt; Llangollen, with its
                    beautiful scenery; Llanrwst, with its church monuments and rood-loft, its
                    bridge, and salmon fishing; and Holt, with its ancient ruined castle.</p>
                <p>As regards the <hi rend="italic">ownership of the land,</hi> the county (in 1873)
                    was divided among 5708 separate proprietors, whose total rental was estimated at
                    £450,421. Of the owners 3436, or 60 per cent., held less than 1 acre, about the
                    same proportion as in the neighbouring county of Flint; while the average of
                    small proprietors in all England was 71 per cent. The average property amounted
                    to 61 acres, while that of all England was 34, and the average value per acre
                    was £1, 5s. 3d., as against £3, 0s. 2d. for all England.</p>
                <p>The following proprietors held more than 5000 acres in the above year—viz., Sir
                    Watkin W. Wynn, 33,998 acres; J. L. Wynne, Coed Côch, 10,197; Lord Bagot, Pool
                    Park, 9385; H. R. Hughes, Kinmel, 8561; C. W. Finch, Pentrefoelas, 8025; B. W.
                    Wynne, Garthewin, 6435; C. S. Main waring, Galltfaenan, 6428; R. Μ. Biddulph,
                    Chirk Castle, 5513; W. C. West, Ruthin Castle, 5457; and Sir Hugh Williams,
                    Bodelwyddan, 5360.</p>
                <p>For civil purposes, the county is divided into 6 hundreds, 9 petty sessional
                    divisions, 3 police districts, 5 highway districts, and 9 lieutenancy
                    subdivisions; and it forms a part of the North Wales circuit, with a winter
                    assize. For parliamentary purposes the county is an undivided constituency,
                    returningtwo representatives to Parliament, while the contributory boroughs of
                    Denbigh, Ruthin, Wrexham, and Holt return one member. Ecclesiastically the
                    county lies entirely within the diocese of St Asaph; the number of parishes and
                    ecclesiastical districts is 61, comprised under 6 deaneries within the
                    archdeaconry of St Asaph. In educational matters, the Latin or second-grade
                    schools comprise the endowed grammar schools of Holt, founded in 1661; Denbigh,
                    in 1726; Wrexham, in 1603; Rhuabon, by Vicar Robinson, in 1703; and Llanrwst, by
                    Sir John Wynne of Gwydir, in 1610. The Greek, or highest grade, is supplied by
                    that of Ruthin, founded in 1574 by Dr Gabriel Goodman, dean of Westminster, a
                    native of the town and the refounder of its Christ’s Hospital. This school has
                    been the nursery of many eminent Welshmen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities,—</hi> Of prehistoric remains, the caves in the
                    limestone escarpments of Cefn, that overhang the valley of the Elwy, yield a
                    noteworthy supply. They contain remains of the hippopotamus, elephant,
                    rhinoceros, lion, hyena, bear, reindeer, &lt;fcc. The glutton was found in the
                    neighbouring cave of Plas He'aton, felstone implements in the adjoining Bout
                    Newydd cave, and a polished stone-axe in a similar one at Rhosdigre,—all in the
                    same range. Near Cefn, too, was discovered in 1869, on the opening of a carnedd
                    in Tyddyn Bleiddya, a chambered tomb containing skeletons, which, on comparison
                    with a similar type found at Perthi Chwareu, gave rise to the title of the
                    “Platycnémie Men of Denbighshire.”</p>
                <p>A writer in the <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia Cambr</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ensis,</hi> 1855, p. 270, has given a summary of the antiquities of the county,
                    most of which may be put down as British or at least Celtic. Traces of the
                    Romans exist at Clawdd Coch (Mediolanum ?), Penygaer, Bwlch, Penbarras; and
                    their roads passed from Deva (Chester) to Segcntium (Carnarvon) and to Mons
                    Heriri (Tomen-y-Mur) respectively. To the Romano-British period belong the
                    inscribed stones at Gwytherin and Pentrevoelas. The Pillar of “Eliseg,” near
                    Valle Crucis, tells of Brochmael and the struggle against the invading
                    Northumbrians under Ethelfrith, 613 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>; whilst the
                    Dyke of “Offa” hands down the memory of the Mercian advance. Adjoining this
                    last, and running side by side with it, is the similar but shorter earthwork
                    called “Watt’s Dyke,” of debateable origin and purpose.</p>
                <p>Of the earliest <hi rend="italic">castles</hi> the ruins of “Dinas Bran” still
                    crown the conical hill that overhangs Llangollen. Denbigh, which has been
                    compared to Stirling for site and beauty—built in the time of Edward I. and
                    destroyed in the civil wars—overlooks the Vale of Clwyd; Holt, on the banks of
                    the Dee, probably the Caerlegion of Beda, shared the same fate. Ruthin,
                    overthrown at the same time, has been twice rebuilt within this century. Chirk
                    alone has weathered the storms of time and war, and is still occupied as a
                    family residence.</p>
                <p>Among the early <hi rend="italic">ecclesiastical buildings</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">remains</hi> we may name the Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis and
                    the Carmelite chapel at Denbigh, both now in decay; the cloisters at Ruthin, and
                    the old house of Brynyffynnon, sometimes called the nunnery at Wrexham; the
                    collegiate churches of Wrexham and Ruthin; the beautiful rood-lofts and screens
                    of Llanrwst, Gresford, and Derwen; the portrait brasses and monuments in the
                    Gwydir Chapel, Llanrwst, and at Whitchurch, Denbigh; the churchyard cross at
                    Derwen; and the stained glass at Gresford and Llanrhaiadr in Dyffryn Clwyd.</p>
                <p>The principal <hi rend="italic">gentlemen's seats</hi> of Tudor date comprise
