                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Baron de</hi> (1747-1825), artist and archaeologist,
                    was born at Châlon-sur-Saône on the 4th January 1747. His parents sent him to
                    Paris to study law, but he showed from the first a decided preference for art
                    and polite literature, and he soon gave up his professional studies. In his
                    twenty-third year he produced a comedy, <hi rend="italic">Le bon père,</hi>
                    which obtained a <hi rend="italic">succès d'estime,</hi> its author having
                    already made himself a favourite in society by his agreeable manners and
                    exceptional conversational powers. He brought himself under the notice of Louis
                    XV. with such address as to establish at once his position in court favour. The
                    king intrusted him with the collection and arrangement of a cabinet of medals
                    and antique gems for Madame de Pompadour, and subsequently appointed him attaché
                    to the French embassy at St Petersburg. On the accession of Louis XVI. Denon was
                    transferred to Swéden; but he returned, after a brief interval, to Paris with
                    the ambassador Μ. de Vergennes, who had been appointed foreign minister. In 1775
                    Deùon was sent on a special mission to Switzerland, and availed himself of the
                    opportunity to visit Voltaire at Ferney. He took a portrait of the philosopher,
                    which was engraved and published on his return to Paris. His next diplomatic
                    appointment was to Naples, where he spent seven years, first as secretary to the
                    embassy and afterwards as <hi rend="italic">charge d’affaires.</hi> He devoted
                    this period to a careful study of the monuments of ancient art, collecting many
                    specimens and making drawings of others. He also perfected himself in etching
                    and mezzotinto engraving. The death of his patron, Μ. de Vergennes, in 1787, led
                    to his recall, and the rest of his life was given mainly to artistic pursuits.
                    On his return to Paris he was admitted a member of the Academy of Painting.
                    After a brief interval he returned to Italy, and resided for some years chiefly
                    at Venice. He also visited Florence 'and Bologna, and afterwards went to
                    Switzerland. While there he heard that his property had been confiscated, and
                    his name placed on the list of the proscribed, and with characteristic courage
                    he resolved at once to return to Paris. His situation was critical, but he found
                    support and protection in the friendship of the painter David, who obtained for
                    him a commission to furnish designs for republican costumes. This he did to the
                    satisfaction of the Revolutionists, and his name was removed from the list of
                    emigrants. When the terrors of the Revolution were over, Denon was one of the
                    numerous band of eminent men who found a congenial resort in the house of Madame
                    de Beauharnais. Here he formed the acquaintance of Bonaparte, to whose fortunes
                    he attached himself with the happy instinct of one who was always quick to
                    discern the coming power. On the special invitation of the general he joined the
                    expedition to Egypt, and thus found the opportunity of gathering the materials
                    for his most important literary and artistic work. He accompanied General Desaix
                    to Upper Egypt, and made numerous sketches of the monuments of ancient art,
                    sometimes under the very fire of the enemy. The results were published in his

                        rend="italic">la haute</hi><hi rend="italic">Egιjpte</hi> (2 vols, fol.,
                    with 141 plates, Paris, 1802), a work which crowned his reputation both as an
                    archaeologist and as an artist. In 1804 he was appointed by Napoleon to the
                    important office of director-general of museums, which he filled greatly to the
                    benefit of art and artists until the restoration in 1815, when he had to retire.
                    He was a devoted friend of Napoleon, whom he accompanied in his expeditions to
                    Austria, Spain, and Poland, taking sketches with his wonted fearlessness on the
                    various battle-fields, and guiding the conqueror in his choice of spoils of art
                    from the various cities that were pillaged. After his retirement he occupied
                    himself with the preparation of a profusely illustrated history of ancient and
                    modern art, in which he had the co-operation of several skilful engravers. He
                    died at Paris on the 27th April 1825, leaving the work unfinished. It was
                    published posthumously, with an explanatory text by Amaury Duval under the title
