                <p><label type="entry">DOGE</label>, a modified form of the ordinary Italian <hi
                        rend="italic">duce,</hi> from the Latin <hi rend="italic">dux,</hi> a leader
                    or duke, employed to designate the chief magistrate in the republics of Genoa
                    and Venice. In both cities the office underwent from time to time a variety of
                    transformations, for details on which the larger histories of the republics must
                    be consulted.</p>
                <p>In Venice the doge was originally chosen by universal suffrage, held office for
                    life, and was regarded as the civil, military, and ecclesiastical chief. His
                    duties and prerogatives were not defined with much precision, and the limits of
                    his ability and ambition were practically the limits of his power. In 755 his
                    independence was diminished by the appointment of two assistants or <hi
                        rend="italic">duumvirs;</hi> but this institution was again allowed to fall
                    into the background, and the doge acquired more and more of irresponsible
                    authority, while at the same time the office was usually committed to a member
                    of one or other of the more powerful families. This tendency towards a
                    hereditary despotism was checked in 1033 by Flabenigo’s law, which reinstituted
                    the duumvirate, and declared distinctly that no doge had the right of
                    associating any member of his family with himself in the government, or of
                    transmitting his office on his decease. In 1172 a still more important change
                    was introduced; not only was the duumvirate replaced by a body of six
                    councillors, but universal suffrage was abolished, and the election of the doge
                    intrusted to a committee of twelve persons, elaborately selected from the
                    members of the great council. On the death of Ziani II. in 1229, two commissions
                    were appointed, which obtained a permanent place in the constitution, and gave
                    emphatic testimony to the fact that the doge was merely the highest servant of
                    the community; the first consisted of five <hi rend="italic">Correttori della
                        promisione</hi><hi rend="italic">ducale,</hi> whose duty was to consider if
                    any change ought to be made in the oath of investiture administered to the doge;
                    the second was a board of three <hi rend="italic">inquisitori</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">sul doge,</hi> intrusted with the curious task of examining
                    and passing judgment on the acts of the deceased magistrate, whose estates might
                    be mulcted in accordance with their decision. To minimize as far as possible the
                    influence of individual families, the election of the doge was in 1268 effected
                    by a curiously complex machinery, which remained, with some modifications, till
                    the close of the republic; thirty members of the great council, elected by
                    ballot, selected nine members, who in their turn chose forty; of these forty
                    twelve taken by lot chose twenty-five; the twenty-five were next reduced to
                    nine; the nine elected forty-five; the forty-five were reduced to eleven; and
                    the eleven chose the final forty-one in whose hands lay the actual election of
                    the doge. In proportion to the development attained by the oligarchical element
                    in the constitution, the more important functions of the office were assigned to
                    other officials or to administrative boards, and he wſlio had once been really
                    the pilot of the ship became little more than an animated figure-head, properly
                    draped and garnished. On state occasions he was still attended by all the
                    ceremonial observances of former times: his robe was still purple, the horns of
                    his beretta were still exalted, the sword, the tapers, and the trumpets were
                    borne before him, his leaden seal was affixed to public documents, and the ring
                    was still dropped yearly from his hand in symbolic espousal of Venice and the
                    sea. But he was under the strictest surveillance, had to w ait for the presence
                    of other officials in order to open the despatches from foreign powers, was
                    forbidden to leave the city, could not legally <pb break="no"

                    or contract a foreign alliance for any of his children, and was moreover liable
                    to the infliction of a fine .for any trespass he might commit. The office was
                    maintained, however,.till the last days of the republic, and from time to time
                    was held by men who knew how to make it something more than such an empty
                    simulacrum. (See Cecchetti, <hi rend="italic">Il Doge di Venezia,</hi>

                <p>In Genoa the institution of the doge dates from 1339, and at first he was elected
                    without any restriction by popular suffrage, and held office for life; but after
                    the reform effected by Andrea Doria in 1528, the term was reduced to two years,
                    plebeians were declared ineligible, and the appointment was intrusted to the
                    members of the great and the little councils, who were bound, however, to
                    employ, in proof of impartiality, nearly as complex a machinery as that of the
                    later Venetians.</p>
