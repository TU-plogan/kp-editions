                    justice and ecclesiastical affairs, whose <hi rend="italic">fetva</hi> is
                    nominally required for the firmans of the Government. Among other members we may
                    mention the seraskier, or war-minister; the capudan pasha, or minister of
                    marine; the foreign minister (called, until the reforms of Mahmoud, <hi
                    rend="italic">reis</hi><hi rend="italic">effendi);</hi> the grand terftardar, or
                    finance minister; the mustechar, or assistant vizier, who comes in place of the
                    ancient kiaya bey, abolished by Mahmoud; the tchiaous bashi, or intendant
                    general of police; and the intendant of vakufs, or church-lands. The divan meets
                    twice a week; on emergencies an Ajaik Divani, including the provincial pashas,
                    the beys, aijams, and chief military officers, is summoned. On its advice in
                    cases of popular tumult the sultan used to show himself at a window and promise
                    reforms. But the word divan was applied by Turks, Persians, and Arabs to many
                    kinds of assembly. Thus the Abbaside caliphs had a “Divan of Oppression,” which
                    inquired into charges of tyranny against officers of state. A woman is said to
                    have been president of this divan in the reign of Moctader, at the beginning of
                    the 10th century. The Diwan-i-humayun was the imperial court of Persia; while in
                    modern Turkey diwan-khane is any large room or hall in which people meet. Hence
                    the word has been applied to the vizier, or head of the assembly; to the bags in
                    which the judicial records of the kazi were kept; and to the court-hand in which
                    the firmans were written. (See Freytag’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arabico-</hi><hi rend="italic">Latinum,</hi> ii. p. 37; De Sacy
                    <hi rend="italic">Gramm.,</hi> i. p. 76.) It was also the name given by the East
                    Indian Company in Bengal to the principal native officers under them. The origin
                    of the word is not clear. One form of it, said to be connected with the adverb
                    yj⅛ = below or inferior, has the meanings of the desert, the upper end of a
                    chamber, anything on which one leans, a sofa formed in masonry, a pillow, a
                    frame. Another form has the meanings of a list, a register of the several
                    classes of officers and servants regulating the amount of royal gifts and
                    salaries, in particular a muster-roll or military pay-book, an album or ledger,
                    an almanack. (Lane’s <hi rend="italic">Arabic Dictionary,</hi> ed. 1874, i. pp.
                    878-9.) It has been suggested by Fakhreddin Razi that the first of these
                    meanings was really derived from the second; that in the reign of caliph Omar, a
                    Persian marzban, or satrap, introduced a military pay-book, the Persian name of
                    which (diwan) was transferred to a financial board, and subsequently to other
                    boards and to the places where they met. One interesting application of the
                    second meaning is to the selection of several poems by one author in the
                    alphabetical order of the rhyming syllables; for instance, rhymes of the first
                    class ending in 1 (Alif = A); of the second, in (Ba = B)i of the third, in GL·
                    (Ta = T), and so on. The most important diwans are those of Ghassani, Sa’uti,
                    and Zamrani among the Arabs; and of Hafiz, Saadi, and Jami among the Persians.
                    The plan has been imitated by Goethe in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >West-östlicher</hi><hi rend="italic">Divan</hi> (see the notes appended to voh
                    iii. of the Stuttgart ed. of 1828), and Goethe was imitated by Rückert. A few
                    meanings of the word divan remain which it is hard to reconcile, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a game or dance of the magians, which consisted in
                    turning round in a circle so as to imitate the motions of the heavenly bodies;
                    the expression “by your leave,” used in entering a Turkish house where there may
                    be unveiled women; a copper cooking pot wide at the bottom and contracted at the
                    mouth. “Diwan durnak” is the Turkish army phrase for “order arms.” In modern
                    Europe divan often means a café.</p>
