                <p><label type="entry">DUMONT D’URVILLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jules Sébastien
                    César</hi></label> (1790-1842), a French navigator, born in the town of
                    Condé-sur-Noireau, in Normandy. The death of his father, who before the
                    revolution had held a judicial post in Condé, devolved the care of his education
                    on his mother and his maternal uncle, the Abbé De Croisilles. Failing to pass
                    the entrance examination for the Ecole Polytechnique, he went to sea in 1807 as
                    a <hi rend="italic">novice</hi> on board the “Aquilon,” and soon attracted the
                    attention of the captain, Maignon, by his studious disposition. During the next
                    twelve years he gradually rose in his profession, and continued through all its
                    multitudinous vicissitudes to increase his scientific and linguistic
                    acquisitions: botany, entomology, English, German, Spanish, Italian, and even
                    Hebrew and Greek were added to the more professional branches. In 1820, while
                    engaged in a survey of the Mediterranean under Captain Gauthier of the
                    “Chevrette,” he was fortunate enough to recognize the Venus of Milo in a Greek
                    statue recently unearthed, and to secure its preservation by the report he
                    presented to the French ambassador at Constantinople. A wider field for his
                    energies was furnished in 1822 by the exploring expedition of the “Coquille”
                    under the command of his friend Duperrey; and on its return in 1825 his services
                    were rewarded by promotion to the rank of <hi rend="italic">capitaine de
                    frégate,</hi> and he was intrusted with the control of a similar enterprise. The
                    “Astrolabe,” as he new-named the “Coquille,” left Toulon on April 25, 1826, and
                    reached Marseilles again on 25th of March 1829,—having traversed the South
                    Atlantic, coasted the Australian continent from .King George’s Sound to Port
                    Jackson, laid down various parts of New Zealand, and visited the Fiji Islands,
                    the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Amboyna, Van Diemen’s Land, the
                    Caroline Islands, Celebes, and Mauritius. Promotion to the rank of <hi

                    >vaisseau</hi> was bestowed on the commander in August 1829; and in August of
                    the following year he was charged with the deb cate task of conveying the exiled
                    King Charles X. to England. His proposal to undertake a voyage of discovery to
                    the south polar regions was discouraged by Arago and others, who criticised the
                    work of the previous expedition in no measured terms; but at last, in 1837, all
                    difficulties were surmounted, and on 7th September he set sail from Toulon with
                    the “Astrolabe” and its convoy “La Zélée.” On 15th January 1838 they sighted the
                    Antarctic ice, and soon after their progress southwards was blocked by a
                    continuous bank, which they vainly coasted for 300 miles to the east. Returning
                    westward they visited the South Orkney Islands and part of the New Shetlands,
                    and discovered Joinville Island and Louis Philippe’s Land, but were compelled by
                    scurvy to seek succour at Talcahuano in Chili. Thence they proceeded across the
                    Pacific and through the Asiatic archipelago, visiting among others the Fiji and
                    the Pelew Islands, coasting New Guinea, and circumnavigating Borneo. In 1840,
                    leaving their sick at Hobart Town, Tasmania, they returned to the Antarctic
                    region, and on the 21st of the month were rewarded by the discovery of Adélie
                    Land, in 140° E. of Greenwich. The 6th of November found them at Toulon.
                    D’Urville was at once appointed rear-admiral, and in 1841 he received the gold
                    medal of the Société de Géographie. On the 8th of May 1842 he was killed along
                    with his wife and son in a railway accident near Meudon. Though many of his
                    observations are no longer regarded as trustworthy on account of the defective
                    character of the instruments employed, he made many important additions to
                    various departments of scientific geography; and his natural history collections
                    were especially valuable. His principal works are— <hi rend="italic"
