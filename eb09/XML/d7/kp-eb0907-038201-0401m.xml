                    county Armagh. Its area, including Ballymacarret, a suburb of Belfast (1670
                    acres), covers 967 square miles, or 612,409 acres. The coast-line is very
                    irregular, and is indented by several loughs and bays. The largest of these is
                    Strangford Lough, a fine sheet of water studded with 260 islets, 54 of which
                    have names, and all of wſhich are finely wooded or rich in pasturage. The lough
                    runs for ten miles northwards, and the ancient castles and ruined abbeys on the
                    islets render the scene one of singular interest and beauty. Further south
                    Dundrum Bay forms a wider expanse of water. In the south-w est Carlingford Lough
                    separates the county from Louth. On its north-east shore lies the village of
                    Rosstrevor, now the resort of invalids from all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> Between Strangford and Carlingford loughs the
                    county is occupied by a range of hills known in its south-western portion as the
                    Mourne Mountains, which give rise to the four principal rivers—the Bann, the
                    Lagan, the Annacloy, and the Newry. The highest peak in the Mourne range is
                    named Slieve Donard. It is 2796 feet above the level of the sea, and is exceeded
                    only by one peak, Lugduff, in the Wicklow range, and the higher reeks in
                    Killarney.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Springs.—</hi> Down is celebrated for its holy wells and
                    mineral springs. The chalybeate are more numerous than the sulphurous, but both
                    abound. There are springs at Ardmillan, Granshaw, Dundonnell, Magheralin,
                    Dromore, Newry, Banbridge, and Tierkelly. The Struel springs, a mile south-east
                    of the town of Downpatrick, are celebrated for their healing properties. Fifty
                    years ago they were regarded as possessing not only chemical wealth in rare
                    abundance, but miraculous powers; and the decline of public credulity in the
                    latter was coincident with the failure of the former. To this day, however, the
                    wells, which are four in number, are visited, and certain religious observances
                    maintained, sometimes for a week. Circuits on the knees are made round the
                    wells: and amongst the ignorant the reputation of the sacred waters remains
                    unimpaired.</p>
                <p>The scenery of the county is pleasantly diversified, the people are intelligent
                    and comparatively well educated, the landed proprietors are resident, and there
                    is a thriving independence which may be looked for in vain outside the province
                    of Ulster.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> There are several quarries of fine sandstone.
                    The best is that on Scrabb Hill, near Newtownards, where a very close-grained,
                    clear-coloured, and hard and durable stone is raised. Limestone is not very
                    general. Near Comber, on the shores of Strangford Lough, is a very hard and
                    sparkling kind of reddish granular limestone. But the greatest magazine of this
                    rock is in the vicinity of Moira, where the stone lies very near the surface.
                    Granite occurs in many places in detached masses, but the great body of it is
                    confined to the southern and western regions, chiefly in the Mourne Mountains.
                    Crystals of topaz and beryl are found in the granite of Slieve Donard.
                    Indications of lead have been discovered near Castlewellan, Killough,
                    Newtownards, and Warrenpoint; and traces of copper in the Mourne Mountains near
                    Rosstrevor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil.—</hi> The predominating soil is a loam of little depth,
                    in most places intermixed with considerable quantities of stones of various
                    sizes, but differing materially in character according to the nature of the
                    subsoil. Clay is mostly confined to the eastern coast, and to the northern parts
                    of Castlereagh. Of sandy soil the quantity is small; it occurs chiefly near
                    Dundrum. Moor grounds are mostly confined to the skirts of the mountains. Bogs,
                    though frequent, are scarcely sufficient to furnish a supply of fuel to the
                    population.</p>
                <p>According to Owners of Land Return (1876), there were, in 1875, 3605 separate
                    proprietors, owning a total area of 608,214 acres, valued at £776,518. The
                    number of owners of less than 1 acre numbered 1460, or 40 ⅜ per cent., that of
                    all Ulster being 48 per cent. The average size of the properties was 168∣ acres,
                    and the average value per acre was £1, 5s. 6¾d., as against 239¾ acres and 15s.
                    8¾d. respectively for Ulster. As in the neighbouring counties of Antrim and
                    Armagh, the value of the land in Down is considerably higher than that of the
                    rest of the province. Eighteen proprietors owned upwards of 6000 acres each, and
                    among them an aggregate extent equal to 48¾ per cent, of the total area,—the
                    principle holders being :—Marquis of Downshire (Hillsborough), 64,356 acres; the
                    Kilmerley Trustees, 37,454; Earl of Annesley (Castlewellan), 23,567; Marquis of
                    Londonderry (Newtownards), 23,554; Colonel W. B. Forde (Seaforde), 19,882; Earl
                    Dufferin (Clandeboy), 18,238; Hon. R. Meade’s trustees (Dromore), 13,492; R. N.
                    Batt (Belfast), 12,010; and Lord A. E, Hill-Trevor, 10,940.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Of the total area of the county, which is
                    610,740 acres (exclusive of Ballymacarret), there are 339,541 acres under
                    tillage, 187,604 in pasture, and 12,027 under wood. Although comparisons as to
                    yields of crops between different periods is now fallacious, inasmuch’as the
                    increased and' increasing importation of wheat into Ireland has altered the
                    system of agriculture, it may be mentioned that, while in five years the
                    cultivation of wheat has fallen from 244,451 acres to 119,597 in Ireland, during
                    the same period in Down the decrease was from 32,734 acres to 21,272. There are
                    many landed proprietors who hold large tracts in their own hands. The great bulk
                    of the labouring population is orderly and industrious. Their dwellings are
                    better constructed and furnished than those for a similar class in other parts
                    of Ireland. The processes<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n402/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0402-0383"/> of agriculture, owing in a great degree to the
                    example set by the resident gentry, are skilfully carried on. The land is well
                    cultivated. The farms are in some districts small, but the effect of emigration
                    has been to consolidate the holdings.</p>
                <p>The breed of horses is an object of much attention, and some of the best racers
                    in Ireland have been bred in this county. The native breed of sheep, a small
                    hardy race, is confined to the mountains. The various other kinds of sheep have
                    been much improved by judicious crosses from the best breeds. Hogs are reared in
                    great numbers, chiefly for the Belfast market, where the large exportation
                    occasions a constant demand for them, haπιs of very superior quality being
                    prepared in that town.</p>

                <p>Along with Tyrone, the county grows the largest extent of flax in Ireland, and
                    the largest extent of the other cereals of any county in Ulster. In live stock
                    Down possesses a greater number of horses than any other Irish county with the
                    exception of Cork.</p>

                    Kilkeel herring fishery realized £4203 in 1871, £6200 in 1872, £13,349 in 1873,
                    £6000 in 1874, and £1360 in 1875. There are fishing stations at Donaghadee,
                    Strangford, Newcastle, and Carlingford; the total number of vessels in 1875 was
                    678, and of men and boys 2537. In 1850 there were 1468 vessels and 4640
                    hands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county is divided into 14 baronies,
                    70 parishes, and 1258 town-lands. It forms part of the united dioceses of Down,
                    Connor, and Dromore; and it belongs to the military district of Belfast. The
                    assizes are held at Downpatrick; quarter sessions at Banbridge, Downpatrick,
                    Hillsborough, Newry, and Newtownards; and there are 26 petty sessions districts.
                    The poor-law unions of Downpatrick, Kilkeel, and Newtownards are wholly within
                    the county, and those of Banbridge and Newry partly in Down and partly in
                    Armagh. The total sum expended in poor-law administration in 1875 was £21,076,
                    and the average daily number of paupers 1280. The county prison and infirmary
                    are in Downpatrick, but the county lunatic asylum is in Belfast. Down returns 4
                    members to Parliament—2 for the county at large, 1 for Downpatrick, and 1 for
                    Newry. Portions of the boroughs of Belfast and Lisburn are in Down county, but
                    they are regarded more properly as parts of Antrim and Armagh respectively.
                    Previous to the Act of Union Down returned 14 members to the Irish Parliament—2
                    for the county at large, and 2 each for the boroughs of Bangor, Downpatrick,
                    Hillsborough, Newry, Newtownards, and Killyleagh.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The general decrease of population in the
                    province of Ulster between the census of 1851 and that of 1871 indicates a
                    percentage of 8¾, while that of this county amounts to 13∣. This decrease maybe
                    ascribed in some part to the migration of the people to Belfast and the
                    neighbouring manufacturing towns, as well as to the emigration to foreign
                    countries. In 1851, the inhabitants of Down (exclusive of the part of Belfast)
                    numbered 320,817; in 1861, 299,302; and in 1871, 277,294, of whom 130,457 were
                    males and 146,837 females.</p>
                <p>At the last census it appeared that 31¾ per cent, belonged to the Roman Catholic
                    persuasion, the numbers being—Catholics, 88,003; Episcopalians, 60,868;
                    Presbyterians, 116,017 ,∙ and others, 12,406. There were at the same time
                    140,886 persons of five years and upwards who could read and write, 57,140 who
                    could read but could not write, and 45,792 who were illiterate. There were 20
                    superior schools in the county, and 527 primary schools.</p>

                    settlement to the Irish revolt in 1333, Down formed two counties, Newtownards in
                    the north and Down in the south. The English settlers at that time were driven
                    into the maritime baronies of Ards, Lecale, and Mourne, of which they in part
                    retained possession. The remainder of the district fell into the hands of Irish
                    families, the O’Neals of Clandeboy, the MacArtans, MacRorys, and MacGinnises,
                    whose possessions, however, reverted to the crown on the attainder of Shane
                    O’Neal, in the latter half of the 16 th century; but having afterwards submitted
                    to the Government, they received back their former estates. In 1602 the O’Neal
                    estates were again forfeited, and granted to Sir Hugh Montgomery and Mr
                    Hamilton, who planted Scottish colonies on the land. The estates of the
                    remaining old Irish and Anglo-Norman families were mostly forfeited in the
                    rebellion of 1641, or subsequently at the Revolution.</p>
                <p>The county is not wanting in interesting remains. At Slidderyford, near Dundrum,
                    there is a group of ten or twelve pillar stones in a circle, about 10 ten feet
                    in height. A very curious cairn on the summit of Slieve Croob is 80 yards in
                    circumference at the base and 50 at the top, where is a platform on which cairns
                    of various heights are found standing. The village of Anadorn is famed for a
                    cairn covering a cave which contains ashes and human bones. Cromlechs, or
                    altars, are numerous, the most remarkable being the Giant’s Ring, which stands
                    on the summit of a hill near the borders of Antrim. This altar is formed of an
                    unwrought stone 7 feet long by 6¾ broad, resting in an inclined position on rude
                    pillars about 3 feet high. This solitary landmark is in the centre of an
                    inclosure about a third of a mile in circumference, formed of a rampart about 20
                    feet high, and broad enough atop to permit two persons to ride abreast. Near
                    Downpatrick is a rath, or mound of earth, three-quarters of a mile in
                    circumference, its exterior consisting of three artificial ramparts, the largest
                    of which is 30 feet broad. In its vicinity are the ruins of Saul Abbey, said to
                    have been founded by St Patrick, and Inch Abbey, founded by Sir John de Courcy
                    in 1180. The number of monastic ruins is also considerable. The most ancient and
                    celebrated is the abbey or cathedral of Downpatrick, supposed to have been
                    founded by St Patrick soon after his arrival here in 432, and said to contain
                    his remains, together with those of St Columba and St Bridget. It was restored
                    in 1790, when the adjoining round tower was taken down. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.
