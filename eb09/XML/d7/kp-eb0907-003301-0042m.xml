                    them in the main but a helpful republication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Evangelium</hi><hi rend="italic">aeternum,</hi> or directly impugned their
                    divine character, their infallibility, and the validity of their evidences as a
                    complete manifestation of the will of God. The term deism is not only used to
                    signify the main body of the deists’ teaching, or the tendency they represent,
                    but has of late especially come into use as a technical term for one specific
                    metaphysical doctrine as to the relation of God to the universe, assumed to have
                    been characteristic of the deists, and to have distinguished them from atheists,
                    pantheists, and theists,—the belief, namely, that the first cause of the
                    universe is a personal God, but is not only distinct from the world but apart
                    from it and its concerns.</p>
                <p>The words deism and deist were treated as novelties in the polemical theology of
                    the latter half of the 16th century in France, but were used substantially in
                    the same sense as they were a century later in England. By the majority of those
                    historically known as the English Deists, from Blount onwards, the name was
                    owned and honoured. They were also occasionally called <hi rend="italic"
                    >rationalists. Free-thinker</hi> (in Ger many, <hi rend="italic"
                    >freidenkefo</hi> was generally taken to be synonymous with deist, though
                    obviously capable of a wider signification, and as coincident with <hi
                    rend="italic">esprit fort,</hi> and with <hi rend="italic">libertin</hi> in the
                    original and theological sense of the latter word. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturalists</hi> was a name frequently used of such as recognized no god but
                    nature, of so-called Spino≡ists, atheists; but both in England and Germany, in
                    the 18th century, this word was more commonly and aptly in use for those who
                    founded their religion on the <hi rend="italic">lumen naturae</hi> alone. The
                    same men were not seldom assaulted under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >theists;</hi> the later distinction between theist and deist, which stamped the
                    latter word as excluding the belief in providence or in the immanence of God,
                    was apparently formulated in the end of the 18th century by those rationalists
                    who were aggrieved at being identified with the naturalists.</p>
                <p>The chief names amongst the deists are those of Lord Herbert (1581-1648), Blount
                    (1654-1693), Tindal (1657- 1733) Woolston (1669-1733), Toland (1670-1722),
                    Shaftesbury (1671-1713) Bolingbroke (1678-1751), Collins (1676-1729), Morgan
                    (M743), and Chubb (1679-1746). Annet, who died in 1768, and Dodwell who made his
                    contribution to the controversy in 1742, are of less importance. Of the ten
                    first named, nine appear to have been born within twenty-five years of one
                    another; and it is noteworthy that by far the greater part of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0043-0034"/> literary activity of the deists, as well as of
                    their voluminous opponents, falls within the same half century.</p>
                <p>The impulses that promoted a vein of thought cognate to deism were active both
                    before and since the time of its greatest notoriety. But there are many reasons
                    to show why, in the 17th century, men should have set themselves with a new
                    zeal, in politics, law, and theology, to follow the light of nature alone, and
                    to cast aside, to the utmost of their ability, the fetters of tradition and
                    prescriptive right, of positive codes, and scholastic systems, and why in
                    England especially there should, amongst numerous free-thinkers, have been not a
                    few free writers. The significance of the Copernican system, as the total
                    overthrow of the traditional conception of the universe, dawned on all educated
                    men. In physics, Descartes had prepared the way for the final triumph of the
                    mechanical explanation of the world in Newton’s system. In England the new
                    philosophy had broken with time-honoured beliefs more completely than it had
                    done even in France; Hobbes was more startling than Bacon. Locke’s philosophy,
                    as well as his theology, served as a school for the deists. Men had become weary
                    of Protestant scholasticism; religious wars had made peaceful thinkers seek to
                    take the edge off dogmatical rancour; and the multiplicity of religious sects
                    provoked distrust of the common basis on which all founded. There was a school
                    of distinctively latitudinarian thought in the Church of England; others not
                    unnaturally thought it better to extend the realm of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >adiaphora</hi> beyond the sphere of Protestant ritual or the details of
                    systematic divinity. Arminianism had revived the rational side of theological
                    method. Semi-Arians and Unitarians, though sufficiently distinguished from the
                    freethinkers by reverence for the letter of Scripture, might be held to
                    encourage departure from the ancient landmarks. The scholarly labours of Huet,
                    Simon, Dupin, and Clericus, of Lightfoot, Spencer, and Prideaux, of Mill and
                    Fell, furnished new materials for controversy; and the scope of Spinoza’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</hi> had naturally been much more
                    fully apprehended than ever his <hi rend="italic">Ethica</hi> could be. The
                    success of the English revolution permitted men to turn from the active side of
                    political and theological controversy to speculation and theory; and curiosity
                    was more powerful than faith. Much new ferment was working. The toleration and
                    the free press of England gave it scope. Deism was one of the results.</p>
                <p>A great part of the deistical teaching was the same from first to last; but
                    though deism cannot be said to have any marked logical development, it went
                    through a sufficiently observable chronological growth.</p>
                <p>Long ere England was ripe to welcome deistic thought, Lord Herbert earned the
                    name “Father of Deism” by laying down the main line of that religious philosophy
                    which in various forms continued ever after to be the backbone of deistic
                    systems. He based his theology on a comprehensive, if insufficient, survey of
                    the nature, foundation, limits, and tests of human knowledge. And amongst the
                    divinely implanted, original, indefeasible <hi rend="italic">notitiae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">communes</hi> of the human mind, he found as foremost his five
                    articles :—that there is one supreme God, that he is to be worshipped, that
                    worship consists chiefly of virtue and piety, that we must repent of our sins
                    and cease from them, and that there are rewards and punishments here and
                    hereafter. These truths, though often clouded, are found in all religions and at
                    all times, and are the essentials of any religion—their universal prevalence
                    being, along with their immediacy, an unmistakable mark of their verity. Thus
                    Herbert sought to do for the religion of nature what his friend Grotius was
                    doing for natural law,—making a new application of the standard of .Vincentius,
                    <hi rend="italic">Quod semper, quod</hi><hi rend="italic">ubique,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >onmibus.</hi></p>
                <p>Herbert had hardly criticised the Christian revelation either as a whole or in
                    its details. Blount, a man of a very different spirit, did both, and in so doing
                    may be regarded as having inaugurated the second main line of deistic procedure,
                    that of historico-critical examination of the Old and New Testaments. Blount
                    adopted and expanded Hobbes’s arguments against the Mosaic authorship of the
                    Pentateuch; and, mainly in the words of Burnet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archeologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophica,</hi> he asserts the total
                    inconsistency of the Mosaic Hexaemeron with the Copernican theory of the
                    heavens, dwelling with emphasis on the impossibility of admitting the view
                    developed in Genesis, that the earth is the most important part of the universe.
                    He assumes that the narrative was meant <hi rend="italic">ethically,</hi> not
                    <hi rend="italic">physically,</hi> in order to eliminate false and polytheistic
                    notions; and he draws attention to that double narrative in Genesis which was
                    elsewhere to be so fruitfully handled. The examination of the miracles of
                    Apollonius of Tyana, professedly founded on papers of Lord Herbert’s, is meant
                    to suggest similar considerations with regard to the miracles of Christ.
                    Naturalistic explanations of some of these are proposed, and a mythical theory
                    is distinctly foreshadowed when Blount dwells on the inevitable tendency of men,
                    especially long after the event, to discover miracles attendant on the birth and
                    death of their heroes. Blount assaults the doctrine of a mediator as
                    irreligious; and much more pronouncedly than Herbert he dwells on the view,
                    afterwards regarded as a special characteristic of all deists, that much or most
                    error in religion has been invented or knowingly maintained by sagacious men for
                    the easier maintenance of good government, or in the interests of themselves and
                    their class. And when he heaps suspicion, not on Christian dogmas, but on
                    beliefs of which the resemblance to Christian tenets is sufficiently patent, the
                    real aim is so transparent that his method seems to partake rather of the nature
                    of literary eccentricity than of polemical artifice; yet by this disingenuous
                    indirectness he gave his argument that savour of duplicity which ever after
                    clung to the popular conception of deism.</p>
                <p>Shaftesbury, dealing with matters for the most part different from those usually
                    handled by the deists, stands almost wholly out of their ranks. But he showed
                    how loosely he held the views he did not go out of his way to attack, and made
                    it plain how little weight the letter of Scripture had for himself; and, writing
                    with much greater power than any of the deists, he was held to have done more
                    than any one of them to forward the cause for which they wrought. Founding
                    ethics on the native and cultivable capacity in men to appreciate worth in men
                    and actions, and associating the apprehension of morality with the apprehension
                    of beauty, he makes morality wholly independent of scriptural enactment, and
                    still more, of theological forecasting of future bliss or agony. He yet insisted
                    on religion as the crown of virtue; and, arguing that religion is inseparable
                    from a high and holy enthusiasm for the divine plan of the universe, he sought
                    the root of religion in feeling, not in accurate beliefs or meritorious good
                    works. The theology of those was of little account with him, he said, who in a
                    system of dry and barren notions “pay handsome compliments to the Deity,”
                    “remove providence,” “explode devotion,” and leave but “little of zeal,
                    affection, or warmth in what they call rational religion.” In the protest
                    against the scheme of “judging truth by counting noses,” Shaftesbury recognized
                    the danger of the standard which seemed to satisfy many deists; and in almost
                    every respect he has more in common with those who afterwards, in Germany,
                    annihilated the pretensions of complacent rationalism than with the rationalists
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Toland, writing at first professedly without hostility to any of the received
                    elements of the Christian faith, insisted that Christianity was not mysterious,
                    and that the value of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0044-0035"/> religion could not lie in any unintelligible
                    element; though we cannot know the real essence of God or of any of his
                    creatures, yet our beliefs about God must be thoroughly consistent with reason.
                    Afterwards, Toland discussed, with considerable real learning and much show of
                    candour, the comparative evidence for the canonical and apocryphal Scriptures,
                    and demanded a careful and complete historical examination of the grounds on
                    which our acceptance of the New Testament canon rests. He contributed little to
                    the solution of the problem, but forced the investigation of the canon alike on
                    theologians and the reading public. Again, he sketched a view of early church
                    history, further worked out by Semler, and surprisingly like that which, as
                    elaborated by the Tübingen school, is still held with modifications by a large
                    number of students of Christian antiquity. He tried to show, both from Scripture
                    and extra-canonical literature, that the primitive church, so far from being an
                    incorporate body of believers with the same creed and customs, really consisted
                    of two schools, each possessing its “own gospel” —a school of Ebionites or
                    Judaizing Christians, and the more liberal school of Paul. These parties,
                    consciously but amicably differing in their whole relation to the Jewish law and
                    the outside world, were subsequently forced into a non-natural uniformity. The
                    cogency of Toland’s arguments was weakened by his manifest love of paradox.</p>
                <p>Collins, who had created much excitement by his <hi rend="italic">Discourse of
                    Free-thinking</hi>, insisting on the value and necessity of unprejudiced
                    inquiry, published at a later stage of the deistic controversy the famous
                    argument on the evidences of Christianity. Christianity is founded on Judaism;
                    its main prop is the argument from the fulfilment of prophecy. Yet no
                    interpretation or re-arrangement of the text of Old Testament prophecies will
                    secure a fair and non-allegorical correspondence between these and their alleged
                    fulfilment in the New Testament. The inference is not expressly drawn. Collins
                    indicates the possible extent to which the Jews may have been indebted to
                    Chaldeans and Egyptians for their theological views, especially as great part of
                    the Old Testament would appear to have been re-modelled by Ezra; and, after
                    dwelling on the points in which the prophecies attributed to Daniel differ from
                    all other Old Testament predictions, he states the greater number of the
                    arguments still used to show that the book of Daniel deals with events past a∙nd
                    contemporaneous, and is from the pen of a writer of the Maccabean period.</p>
                <p>Woolβton, at first to all appearance working earnestly in behalf of an
                    allegorical but believing interpretation of the New Testament miracles, ended by
                    assaulting, with a yet unknown violence of speech, the absurdity of accepting
                    them as actual historical events, and did his best to overthrow the credibility
                    of Christ’s principal miracles. The bitterness of his outspoken invective
                    against the clergy, against all priestcraft and priesthood, was a new feature in
                    deistic literature, and injured the author more than it furthered his cause.</p>
                <p>TindaΓs aim seems to have been a sober statement of the whole case in favour of
                    natural religion, with copious but moderately worded criticism of such beliefs
                    and usages in the Christian and other religions as he conceived to be either
                    non-religious or directly immoral and unwholesome. The work in which he
                    endeavoured to prove that true Christianity is as old as the creation, and is
                    really but the republication of the gospel of nature, soon gained the name of
                    the “Deist’s Bible.”</p>
                <p>Morgan criticised with great freedom the moral character of the persons and
                    events of Old Testament history, developing the theory of conscious
                    “accommodation” on the part of the leaders of the Jewish church. This
                    accommodation of truth, by altering the form and substance of it to meet the
                    views and secure the favour of ignorant and bigoted contemporaries, Morgan
                    attributes also to the apostles and to Jesus. He likewise expands at great
                    length a theory of the origin of the Catholic Church much like that sketched by
                    Toland, but assumes that Paul and his party, latterly at least, were distinctly
                    hostile to the Judaical party of their fellow-believers in Jesus as the Messias,
                    while the college of the original twelve apostles and their adherents viewed
                    Paul and his followers with suspicion and disfavour. Persecution from without
                    Morgan regards as the influence which mainly forced the antagonistic parties
                    into the oneness of the catholic and orthodox church.</p>
                <p>Annet made it his special work to invalidate belief in the resurrection of
                    Christ, and to discredit the work of Paul.</p>
                <p>Chubb, the least learnedly educated of the deists, did more than any of them,
                    save Herbert, to round his system into a logical whole. From the New Testament
                    he sought to show that the teaching of Christ substantially coincides with
                    natural religion as he understood it. But his main contention is that
                    Christianity is not a doctrine but a life, not the reception of a system of
                    truths or facts, but a pious effort to live in accordance with God’s will here,
                    in the hope of joining him hereafter. Chubb dwells with special emphasis on the
                    fact that Christ preached the gospel to the poor, and argues, as Tindal had
                    done, that the gospel must therefore be accessible to all men without any need
                    for learned study of evidences for miracles, and intelligible to the meanest
                    capacity.</p>
                <p>Dodwell’s ingenious thesis, that Christianity is not founded on argument, was
                    certainly not meant as an aid to faith; and, though its starting-point is
                    different from all other deistical works, it may safely be reckoned amongst
                    their number.</p>
                <p>Though himself contemporary with the earlier deists, Bolingbroke’s principal
                    works were posthumously published after interest in the controversy had
                    declined. His whole strain, in sharp contrast to that of most of his
                    predecessors, is cynical and satirical, and suggests that most of the matters
                    discussed were of small personal concern to himself. He gives fullest scope to
                    the ungenerous view that a vast proportion of professedly revealed truth was
                    ingeniously palmed off by the more cunning on the more ignorant for the
                    convenience of keeping the latter under. But he writes with keenness and wit,
                    and knows well how to use the materials already often taken advantage of by
                    earlier deists.</p>
                <p>In the substance of what they received as natural religion, the deists were for
                    the most part agreed; Herbert’s articles continued to contain the fundamentals
                    of their theology. Religion, though not identified with morality, had its most
                    important outcome in a faithful following of the eternal laws of morality,
                    regarded as the will of God. With the virtuous life was further to be conjoined
                    a humble disposition to adore the Creator, avoiding all factitious forms of
                    worship as worse than useless. The small value attributed to all outward and
                    special forms of service, and the want of any sympathetic craving for the
                    communion of saints, saved the deists from attempting to found a free-thinking
                    church, a creedless communion. They seem generally to have inclined to a
                    quietistic accommodation to established forms of faith, till better times came.
                    They steadfastly sought to eliminate the miraculous from theological belief, and
                    to expel from the system of religious truth all debatable, difficult, or
                    mysterious articles. They aimed at a rational and intelligible faith,
                    professedly in order to make religion, in all its width and depth, the heritage
                    of every man. They regarded with as much suspicion the notion of a “peculiar
                    people” of God, as of a unique revelation, and insisted on the salvability of
                    the heathen. They rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, and protested against
                    mediatorship, atonement, and the imputed righteousness of Christ, always laying
                    more stress on the teaching<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0045-0036"/> of Christ than on the teaching of the church
                    about him; but they repeatedly laid claim to the name of Christians or of
                    Christian deists. Against superstition, fanaticism, and priestcraft they were
                    incessantly lifting up their testimony. They all recognized the soul of man —not
                    regarded as intellectual alone—as the ultimate court of appeal. But they varied
                    much in their attitude towards the Bible. Some were content to argue their own
                    ideas into Scripture, and those they disliked out of it; to one or two it seemed
                    a satisfaction to discover difficulties in Scripture, to point to historical
                    inaccuracies and moral defects. Probably Chubb’s position on this head is most
                    fairly characteristic of deism. He holds that the narrative, especially of the
                    New Testament, is in the main accurate, but, as written after the events
                    narrated, has left room for misunderstandings and mistakes. The apostles were
                    good men, to whom, after Christ, we are most indebted: but they were fairly
                    entitled to their own private opinions, and naturally introduced these into
                    their writings. The epistles, according to Chubb, contain errors of fact, false
                    interpretations of the Old Testament, and sometimes disfigurement of religious
                    truth. Fortunately, however, the points on which the private opinions of
                    apostolic men might naturally differ most widely, such as the doctrine of the
                    Logos, are matters which have nothing to do with the salvation of souls.</p>
                <p>The general tendency of the deistical writings is sufficiently self-consistent to
                    justify a common name. But it is vain to speak of deism as a compact system, or
                    to regard it as the outcome of any one line of philosophical thought. Of matters
                    generally regarded as pertaining to natural religion, that on which they were
                    least agreed was the certainty, philosophical demonstrability, and moral
                    significance of the immortality of the soul, so that the deists have sometimes
                    been grouped into “mortal” and “immortal” deists. For some the belief in future
                    rewards and punishments was an essential of religion; some seem to have
                    questioned the doctrine as a whole; and, while others made it a basis of
                    morality, Shaftesbury protested against the ordinary theological form of the
                    belief as immoral. No two thinkers could well be more opposed than Shaftesbury
                    and Hobbes; yet sometimes ideas from both were combined by the same writer.
                    Collins was a pronounced necessitarian; Morgan regarded the denial of free will
                    as tantamount to atheism. And nothing can be more misleading than to assume that
                    the belief in a Creator, existent wholly apart from the work of his hands, was
                    characteristic of the deists as a body. In none of them is any theory on the
                    subject specially prominent; save in their denial of miracles, of supernatural
                    revelation, and a special redemptive interposition of God in history, they seem
                    to have thought of providence much as the mass of their opponents did. Herbert
                    starts his chief theological work with the design of vindicating God’s
                    providence. Shaftesbury vigorously protests against the notion of a wholly
                    transcendent God. Morgan more than once expresses a theory that would now be
                    pronounced one of immanence. Toland, the inventor of the name of pantheism, was
                    notoriously, for a great part of his life, in some sort a pantheist. And while
                    as thinkers they diverged in their opinions, so too the deists differed
                    radically from one another in their character, in reverence for their subject,
                    and in religious earnestness and moral worth.</p>
                <p>The deists were not powerful writers; none of them was distinguished by wide and
                    accurate scholarship; hardly any was either a deep or comprehensive thinker. But
                    though they generally had the best scholarship of England against them, they
                    were bold, acute, well-informed men; they appreciated more fully than their
                    contemporaries not a few truths now all but universally accepted; and they
                    seemed therefore entitled to leave their mark on subsequent theological thought.
                    Yet while the seed they sowed was taking deep root in France and in Germany, the
                    English deists, the most notable men of their time, were soon forgotten, or at
                    least ceased to be a prominent factor in the intellectual life of the century.
                    The controversies they had provoked collapsed rather than were finally settled;
                    and deism became a by-word even amongst those who were in no degree anxious to
                    appear as champions of orthodoxy.</p>
                <p>The fault was not wholly in the subjectivism of the movement. But the
                    subjectivism that founded its theology on the “common sense” of the individual
                    was accompanied by a fatal pseudo-universalism which, cutting away all that was
                    peculiar, individual, and most intense in all religions, left in any one of them
                    but a lifeless form. A theology consisting of a few vague generalities was
                    sufficient to sustain the piety of the best of the deists; but it had not the
                    concreteness or intensity necessary to take a firm hold on those whom it
                    emancipated from the old beliefs. The negative side of deism came to the front,
                    and, communicated with fatal fateility, seems ultimately to have constituted the
                    deism that was commonly professed at the clubs of the wits and the tea-tables of
                    polite society. But the intenser religious life before which deism fell was also
                    a revolt against the abstract and argumentative orthodoxy of the time.</p>
                <p>That the deists appreciated fully the scope of difficulties in Christian theology
                    and the sacred books is not their most noteworthy feature; but that they made a
                    stand, sometimes cautiously, often with outspoken fearlessness, against the
                    presupposition that the Bible is the religion of Protestants. They themselves
                    gave way to another presupposition equally fatal to true historical research,
                    though in great measure common to them and their opponents. It was assumed by
                    deists in debating against the orthodox, as it is now by orthodox Protestants in
                    contending against the Romish Church, that the flood of error in the hostile
                    camp was due to the benevolent cunning or deliberate selfseeking of unscrupulous
                    men, held to by the ignorant with the obstinacy of prejudice.</p>
                <p>Yet deism deserves to be remembered as a strenuous protest against bibliolatry in
                    every degree and against all traditionalism in theology. It sought to look not a
                    few facts full in the face, from a new point of view and with a thoroughly
                    modern, though unhistorical spirit. It was not a religious movement; and though,
                    as a defiance of the accepted theology, its character was mainly theological,
                    the deistical crusade belongs, not to the history of the church, or of dogma,
                    but to the history of general culture. It was an attitude of mind, not a body of
                    doctrine; its nearest parallel is probably to be found in the eclectic strivings
                    of the Renaissance philosophy and the modernizing tendencies of cisalpine
                    humanism. The controversy was assumed to be against prejudice, ignorance,
                    obscurantism; what monks were to Erasmus the clergy as such were to Woolston.
                    Yet English deism was in many ways characteristically English. The deists were,
                    as usually happens with the leaders of English thought, no class of professional
                    men, but represented every rank in the community. They made their appeal in the
                    mother tongue to all men who could read and think, and sought to reduce the
                    controversy to its most direct practical issue, making it turn as much as
                    possible on hard facts or the data of common sense. And, with but one or two
                    exceptions, they avoided wildness in their language as much as in the general
                    scheme of theology they proposed. If at times they had recourse to ambiguity of
                    speech and veiled polemic, this might be partly excused by the death of
                    Aikinhead on the scaffold, and Woolston’s imprisonment.</p>

                <p>French deism, the direct progeny of the English movement, was equally
                    short-lived. Voltaire was to the end a deist of the school of Bolingbroke;
                    Rousseau could have claimed kindred with the nobler deists. Diderot was for a
                    time heartily in sympathy with deistic thought; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie</hi> was in its earlier portion an organ of deism. But as Locke’s
                    philosophy became in France sensationalism, and as Locke’s pregnant question,
                    reiterated by Collins, how we know that the divine power might not confer
                    thought on matter, led the way to dogmatic materialism, so deism soon gave way
                    to forms of thought more directly and extremely subversive of the traditional
                    theology.</p>
                <p>In Germany there was a native free-thinking theology nearly contemporary with
                    that of England, whence it was greatly developed and supplemented. The compact
                    rational philosophy of Wolff nourished a theological rationalism which in
                    Reimarus was wholly undis tinguishable from dogmatic deism; while, in the case
                    of the historico-critical school to which Semler belonged, the distinction is
                    not always easily drawn—although these rationalists professedly recognized in
                    Scripture a real divine revelation, mingled with local and temporary elements.
                    It deserves to be noted here that the former, the theology of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aufklärung</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> was, like that of the
                    deists, destined to a shortlived notoriety; whereas the solid, accurate, and
                    scholarly researches of the rationalist critics of Germany, undertaken with no
                    merely polemical spirit, not only form an epoch in the history of theology, but
                    have taken a permanent place in the body of theological science. Ere <hi
                    rend="italic">rational-ismus vulgaris</hi> fell before the combined assault of
                    Schleiermacher’s subjective theology and the deeper historical insight of the
                    Hegelians, it had found a refuge successively in the Kantian postulates of the
                    practical reason, and in the vague but earnest faith-philosophy of Jacobi.</p>
                <p>In England, though the deists were forgotten, their spirit was not wholly dead.
                    For men like Hume and Gibbon the standpoint of deism was long left behind; yet
                    Gibbon’s famous two chapters might well have been written by a deist. Even now,
                    between scientific atheism and speculative agnosticism on the one hand and
                    church orthodoxy on the other, many seem to cling to a theology nearly allied to
                    deism. Rejecting miracles and denying the infallibility of Scripture, protesting
                    against Calvinistic views of sovereign grace and having no interest in
                    evangelical Aπninianism, the faith of such inquirers seems fairly to coincide
                    with that of the deists. Wherever religious indifferentism is rife, the less
                    generous forms of deism are still alive. And even some cultured theologians, the
                    historical representatives of latitudinarianism, seem to accept the great body
                    of what was contended for by the deists, though they have a fuller appreciation
                    of the power of spiritual truth, and a truer insight into the ways of God with
                    man in the history of the world.</p>
                <p>The deists displayed a singular incapacity to understand the true conditions of
                    history; yet amongst them there were some who pointed the way to the truer, more
                    generous interpretation of the past. When Shaftesbury wrote that “religion is
                    still a discipline, and progress of the soul towards perfection,” he gave birth
                    to the same thought that was afterwards hailed in Lessing’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erziehung des Menschengeschlechtes</hi> as the dawn of a fuller and a purer
                    light on the history of religion and on the development of the spiritual life of
                    mankind.</p>
