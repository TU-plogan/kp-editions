                    objects of historical interest. The parish church is a fine building of red
                    sandstone, with a tower about 107 feet in height, which forms a well-known
                    landmark to seamen; it dates only from 1819, but occupies the site of what was
                    probably the first collegiate church established in Scotland, and still
                    preserves the large marble monument of Sir George Home, created earl of Dunbar
                    and March by James VI. in 1605. The town-hall, the assembly rooms, the public

                    of wealth is the herring fishery, which fosters' an extensive curing trade; but
                    ship-building is also carried on, and there are several iron foundries,
                    breweries, and distilleries, as weil as a large paper-mill in the vicinity. The
                    harbour, formerly small and shallow, has been greatly enlarged and improved in
                    the course of the present century, at the joint expense of the town and the
                    Fishery Board; but the entrance is rendered somewhat dangerous by the number of
                    craggy islets and sunken rocks. Dunbar unites with Haddington, Jedburgh, Lauder,
                    and North Berwick in returning a member to Parliament. In 1875-6 the value of

                <p>The castle of Dunbar, mentioned as early as 856, from the strength of its
                    position became of great importance as a bulwark against English invasion, and a
                    town grew up under its protection, which was created a royal burgh by Dâvid II.
                    It was captured by Edward I., who defeated the forces of Baliol in the
                    neighbourhood of the town in 1296; it afforded shelter to Edward II. on his
                    flight from Bannockburn; and it was besieged in 1337 by the English under
                    Montague earl of Salisbury, but was successfully defended by Black Agnes of
                    Dunbar, countess of March and a member of the Douglas family. In the 15th
                    century it was chosen as her usual residence by Joanna Beaufort, the widow of
                    James I. of Scotland; and in the 16th it served on several occasions as a
                    retreat for the unfortunate Queen Mary. An Act of Parliament had been passed in
                    1488 ordering the demolition of the castle, but it was reserved for the Regent
                    Murray to effect its destruction in 1567. A battle popularly known as the “race
                    of Dunbar” was fought in 1658 between Cromwell and Leslie, and resulted in the
                    total rout of the Scotch.</p>
