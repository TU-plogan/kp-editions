                    studies, he applied this knowledge, after the example of Borelli and others, to
                    the investigation of physiological subjects. He early translated Borelli’s <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Animalium,</hi> and added notes and
                    illustrations, which, although founded on wrong principles, gave undeniable
                    proofs of zeal and industry.</p>
                <p>He went to Paris when about twenty years of age, and opened a school of anatomy
                    in the winter of 1766, which was soon attended by about 300 pupils, a great
                    proportion of whom were older than himself. His success excited the jealousy of
                    the established teachers and professors, who, although he was patronized and
                    protected by some surgeons of great eminence, would have obliged him to renounce
                    public teaching, had he not resorted to the expedient of adopting the name of
                    another as a sanction to his proceedings. In 1776 he was admitted a member of
                    the corporation of surgeons; and so limited were his finances at this time, that
                    he was allowed to pay his fees at his own convenience. He successively held the
                    positions of honour in the corporation and academy of surgery; and in 1782 he
                    was appointed surgeon-major to the hospital <hi rend="italic">Delà</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Charité.</hi></p>
                <p>Desault was now regarded as one of the first surgeons of Paris. He succeeded to
                    the next vacancy at the Hôtel Dieu; and, after the death of Moreau, almost the
                    whole surgical department of that hospital was intrusted to him. He instituted a
                    clinical school of surgery there on a liberal and extensive plan, which
                    attracted a great concourse of students, not only from every part of France, but
                    also from other countries. He frequently had an audience of about 600; and most
                    of the surgeons of the French army derived their knowledge from his lectures. He
                    introduced many improvements into the practice of surgery, as well as in the
                    construction of various surgical instruments.</p>
                <p>In 1791 he published a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    Chirurgerie,</hi> edited by his pupils, which was a record of the most
                    interesting cases that had occurred in his clinical school, with the remarks
                    which he had made upon them in the course of his lectures. But in the midst of
                    his valuable labours he became obnoxious to some of the Revolutionists, and he
                    was, on some frivolous charge, denounced to the popular sections. After being
                    twice examined, he was seized on the 28th May 1793, while delivering a lecture,
                    carried away from his theatre, and committed to the prison of the Luxembourg. In
                    three days, however, he was liberated, and permitted to resume his functions.
                    When the school of health was established, he was appointed clinical professor
                    for external maladies; and it was through his means that the Evêché was
                    converted into an hospital for surgical operations. He died on the 1st June 1795
                    of an ataxic fever, which he had caught two days previously while attending the
                    dauphin in the Temple. An opinion was prevalent among the populace that he was
                    poisoned because he had refused to do anything against the dauphin’s life. The
                    autopsy which was held went to disprove the story, but it shows the opinion the
                    public entertained of Desault’s integrity. A pension was settled on his widow by
                    the republic. The only work of which he is the sole author is entitled <hi
