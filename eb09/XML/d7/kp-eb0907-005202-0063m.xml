                    and on the S. by the irregular heights of Mount Cirphis. Between the two
                    mountains the Pleistus flowed from east to west, and opposite the town received
                    the brooklet of the Castalian fountain, which rose in a deep gorge in the centre
                    of the Parnassian cliff. The site of the ancient town is now occupied by the
                    village of Castri, and the natural features of the scene have been somewhat
                    altered by the earthquake of 1870; but the main points of interest can still be
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>The principal building of Delphi was the temple of Apollo, which stood
                    immediately under the shelter of the northern cliff. It appears to have been of
                    the Doric order outside, and of the Ionic within. The front was built of Parian
                    marble, and the sculptural decorations were extremely rich. One pediment was
                    adorned with representations of Latona, Diana, Apollo, and the Setting Sun, and
                    the other with Dionysus and the Thyiades; the eastern architrave was hung with
                    gilded shields presented <pb break="no"

                    the western with similar trophies taken -by the Aetolians from the Gauls; while
                    among the subjects of the metopes are mentioned Hercules slaying the Lernean
                    Hydra, Bellerophon and the Chimaera, Zeus and Mimas, Pallas and Enceladus, and
                    Dionysus and a Giant. In the <hi rend="italic">pronaos</hi> were inscribed the
                    maxims of the Seven Sages of Greece; in the <hi rend="italic">cdla</hi> was the
                    sacred hearth with a perpetιral fire and the &lt;5∕x&lt;∕&gt;αλoς, or
                    navel-stone, which was supposed to mark the centre of the world; and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">adytum</hi> was the sacred tripod and the subterranean chamber
                    from which the vapour of prophecy ascended. Of less important buildings may be
                    mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Lesdιe,</hi> or public hall, the walls of which
                    were adorned with the works of Polygnotus and other master-pieces of ancient
                    art; the theatre, where the musical contests connected with the Pythian games
                    were held; the <hi rend="italic">Stadium,</hi> of which there are still
                    considerable remains; and, in the suburb of the same name, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pylaea,</hi> or assembly hall of the Amphictyonie Council. The town was entered
                    from the east by a road from Baeotia known as the Schiste, or Cloven Way, and
                    from the west by the great Crissean road, which was used by the pilgrims who
                    came from the Corinthian Gulf, and by another which βtretched north-west to
                    Amphissa. These roads were regarded almost as the property of the temple, and
                    shared in its sacredness; and each Amphictyonie state was bound to keep them in
                    repair within its own boundaries. About seven miles to the north of the town, on
                    the side of Mount Parnassus, was the famous Corycian cave, a large grotto in the
                    limestone rock, which afforded the people of Delphi a refuge during the Persian
                    invasion. It is now called in the district the Sarånt’ Aulai, or Forty Courts,
                    and is said to be capable of holding 3000 people.</p>
                <p>Of the origin of the Delphian oracle nothing is known. One legend told how the
                    prophetic virtues of the site were discovered by a shepherd whose goats began to
                    frisk about under the influence of the subterranean vapour; and another related
                    how Apollo, after he had slain the great serpent Pytho on the spot, boarded a
                    Cretan ship in the neighbouring gulf, and consecrated the crew to his service.
                    It seems almost certain that the place was the seat of a religious establishment
                    previous to its connection with the worship of Apollo; but its whole historic
                    importance—which can hardly be over-estimated—is entirely due to this
                    connection. The first temple of stone was reputed to have been built by the
                    semi-mythical personages Trophonius and Agamedes. It was burned down in 548
                    B.c.,but was soon after replaced by the building which has already been
                    described. The contract for the work was taken by the Athenian family of the
                    Alcmaeonids,who were at that time in exile from the tyranny of Hippias. They
                    employed the architect Spintharus, and acquired great credit for the
                    disinterested liberality with which they accomplished their task. The principal
                    facts in the history of Delphi have already been narrated in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphictyony</hi> (vol. i. p. 772), where the reader will also
                    find an account of the relation in which the temple stood to the states of
                    Greece. It only remains to tell how the sanctuary and its treasures, which had
                    been miraculously saved from the Persians and the Gauls, were put under
                    contribution by Sulla for the payment of his soldiers; how Nero removed no fewer
                    than 500 brazen images from the sacred precincts; and how Constantine the Great
                    enriched his new city by the sacred tripods, the statues of the Heliconian
                    Muses, the Apollo, and the celebrated Pan dedicated by the Greek cities after
                    the conclusion of the war with the Medes. Julian afterwards sent Oribasius to
                    restore the temple; but the oracle responded to the emperor’s enthusiasm with
                    nothing but a wail over the glory that had departed.</p>
