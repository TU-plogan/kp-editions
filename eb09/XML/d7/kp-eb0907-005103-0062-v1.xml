                    Little Delos, to distinguish it from <hi rend="italic">Megali Dili,</hi> or
                    Great Delos, an island in the AEgean, the smallest but most famous of the
                    Cyclades, and, according to the ancient belief, the spot round which the group
                    arranged itself in a nearly circular form. It is a rugged mass of granite, about
                    12 square miles in extent, in 37° 23' N. lat. and 25° 17' E. long., about half a
                    mile to the east of Megali Dili, or Rheneia, and two miles to the west of
                    Myconos. Towards the centre it rises to its greatest height of 350 feet in the
                    steep and rocky peak of Mount Cynthus, which, though overtopped by several
                    eminences in the neighbouring islands, is very conspicuous from the surrounding
                    sea. It is now completely destitute of trees; but it abounds with brushwood of
                    lentisk and cistus, and here and there affords a patch of corn-land to the
                    occasional sower from Myconos. Of the many traditions that were current among
                    the ancient Greeks regarding the origin of Delos—or, as they sometimes named it,
                    Asteria, Ortygia, Chlamydia, or Pyrpile—the most popular describes it as struck
                    from the bed of the sea by a dint of Neptune’s trident, and drifting devious
                    through theAEgeantill moored by Jupiter as a refuge for his persecuted Latona.
                    It was soon after flooded with the birth-radiance of Apollo and Diana, and
                    became for ever sacred to these twin deities of light. The island first appears
                    in history as an Ionian colony and the seat of a great Ionic festival to which
                    the Athenians, among the rest, were accustomed annually to despatch a Θeωpιs, or
                    sacred ship, with a number of Deliasts, Θeωp&lt;√, or sacred delegates. In the
                    6th century B.c. the influence of the Delian Apollo was at its height;
                    Polycrates of Samos dedicated the neighbouring island of Rheneia to his service,
                    and Pisistratus of Athens caused all the area within sight of the temple to be
                    cleared of the tombs by which its sanctity was impaired. About a hundred years
                    afterwards, in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war (426 B.c.), the Athenians
                    instituted a more elaborate lustration, caused every tomb to be removed from the
                    island, and established a law that ever after any one whose condition seemed to
                    threaten its pollution by either birth or death should be at once conveyed from
                    its shores. And even this was not accounted sufficient; for, in 422, they
                    expelled all its secular inhabitants. After the overthrow of Corinth, in 146
                    B.c., the commercial element which had in all probability been present from the
                    first in the religious gatherings, came prominently forward, and Delos became
                    the central mart of the AEgean. In the Mithridatic war it was laid waste by
                    Menophanes, the general of the Bithynian king; and it never recovered its former
                    prosperity, though it is said that, under the Roman empire, 10,000 slaves were
                    sometimes put up for sale in a single day. Hadrian attempted to found a city
                    which was to bear the proud name of New Athens; but, when visited by Pausanias
                    towards the close of the same century, the whole island was almost depopulated.
                    It is now absolutely without a permanent inhabitant, though during the summer
                    months a few shepherds cross over with their flocks from Myconos or Rheneia. As
                    a religious centre it is replaced by Tenos.</p>

                <p>and as a commercial centre by the flourishing port of Syra. Besides the site of
                    the chief settlement or city, the following are the spots of antiquarian
                    interest which can still be identified :—the temple of Apollo, a splendid
                    building of the Doric order which, in the words of Mr Tozer, now forms “a
                    confused heap of white marble fragments, columns, bases, and entablatures, lying
                    indiscriminately together ;” the portico erected by Philip of Macedon; the base
                    (within the temple area) of the colossal statue dedicated to the Delian Apollo
                    by the people of Naxos; a theatre of Parian marble on the slope of Mount
                    Cynthus; a temple to Isis, further up the hill, which probably explains the myth
                    of the connection between the brook Inopus and the Nile; the so-called
                    “treasury” of Delos; an Ionic temple on the summit; and the circular tank or
                    lake which supplied the water for the religious rites. The ordinary buildings on
                    the island were constructed of native granite, but marble was imported for the
                    nobler edifices, which were destined to serve as so many quarries to the
                    mediaeval builders of Constantinople and Venice.</p>
