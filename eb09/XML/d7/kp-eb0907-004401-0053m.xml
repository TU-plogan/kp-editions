                <p>It is bounded on the N. by Pennsylvania, on the W. and S. by Maryland, and on the
                    E. by the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay and River. Its rivers are small
                    and unimportant, and most of them flow into the Delaware Bay or River. The
                    Delaware and Chesapeake Canal connects the two great bays, and makes an easy
                    water transit for produce between Philadelphia and Baltimore. Delaware is an
                    agricultural State; a part of it is in a high state of cultivation. Besides
                    wheat, maize, and other grain, peaches are grown in immense quantities, and sent
                    over the country. Small fruits are also raised for transportation. In the
                    northern parts of the State are numerous manufactories. Wilmington has large
                    machineshops, and cotton, paper, morocco,and carriage factories; and iron-ship
                    building is largely carried on there. New Castle, also, has rolling-mills, and
                    cotton and woollen factories. The flour-mills of Delaware are famous, and the
                    Dupont Gunpowder Works, six miles from Wilmington, are the largest and oldest in
                    the country. The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad runs through
                    the northern part of the State, and the Delaware Railroad goes through the whole
                    length of the peninsula. The Wilmington and Reading Railroad makes a connection
                    with the Pennsylvania coal region. There are five judges in the State, viz., a
                    chancellor, who is also president of the Orphans’ Court (the associate judge
                    residing in the county serving with him in the county where the court is held),
                    a chief justice, and an associate judge from every one of the three counties.
                    There is a State school fund, which is further increased by the proceeds of the
                    marriage and liquor licences. Every hundred which, by either taxation or
                    subscription, supports a free school is entitled to its share of the fund. The
                    debt of the State is $1,224,000, and as the cost of the government is moderate,
                    the taxes are small.</p>
                <p>On the 28th of August 1609 Henry Hudson sailed into the Delaware Bay; but,
                    finding the water shallow and difficult to navigate, he made no exploration,
                    leaving that honour to the Dutch navigators,—Hendrickson in 1616, and in 1623
                    Mey, whose name is borne by the eastern cape of the bay. There is a tradition
                    that Lord De la Warr, when on his way to Virginia in 1610, anchored in the bay,
                    but it is not authentic. It was in 1626 that Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden,
                    by the advice of a Hollander, William Uesselinx, issued letterspatent for a
                    settlement on the west shore of the Delaware River—called by the Indians
                    Poutaxat, and by the Dutch South River—for a trading-post. The queen dowager,
                    the royal council, the nobility, the bishops and clergy, as well as large
                    numbers of the people, contributed money for the colony; but the long war with
                    Germany, and the death of the king, caused the scheme to fail. In 1639 Queen
                    Christina sent out a colony under the charge of a Dutchman, Peter Menewe, who
                    first landed at the mouth of the</p>
                <p>Delaware, near the present town of Lewes, which they named Paradise Point. Here
                    they made a purchase from the Indians of all the land on the west side of the
                    river, from Cape Henlopen, at the mouth of the bay, to Trenton Falls; and as
                    none of the Swedes understood the Indian language, the deeds were written in
                    Dutch, and sent to Sweden for preservation. The first settlement the Swedes made
                    in their newly acquired country, which they called New Sweden, was near the
                    Delaware River, where the Christine and Brandywine Creeks join, and where the
                    city of Wilmington now stands. Here they built a fort, which they called
                    Christiana. The Dutch had a few weak settlements on the Jersey shore, but they
                    also claimed the west bank of the river, and wrote a remonstrance to Menewe,
                    though they did not, perhaps could not, interfere with the colony, which
                    Minnewitz governed for three years, appointing at his death a successor. The
                    Dutch proved troublesome neighbours, and as a retaliation for the building of
                    Fort Christiana, they built Fort Casimir, six miles below the Swedish
                    settlement. Still Governor Stuyvesant and the Swedish governor, Printz, were on
                    amicable terms; and when the former visited his new fort on the west side of the
                    Delaware, the two promised to be neighbourly and friendly, and to act as allies
                    if needful. But in 1654, Governor Rising was sent from Sweden with a large
                    number of colonists; and his first act was to take Fort Casimir, which he did
                    without bloodshed, renaming it the Fort of the Holy Trinity, in honour of
                    Trinity Sunday, when he captured it. This brought Governor Stuyvesant from New
                    York, with six or seven vessels, and as many hundred men, who not only retook
                    Fort Casimir, but marched to Fort Christiana and captured it also. Stuyvesant
                    compelled the Swedes to swear allegiance to the Dutch Government, and those who
                    refused the oath were forced to leave the country. Thus the colony of New Sweden
                    was obliterated, and the Dutch became owners of the west shore of the Delaware
                    River, having at Fort Casimir, which they called New Amstel, a governor of their
                    own, though under the jurisdiction of the governor of Manhattan (New York). In
                    1664 Sir Robert Carr, after capturing Manhattan, sailed up South River, and took
                    New Amstel, changing the name of the river to Delaware, and New Amstel to New
                    Castle on Delaware; though the Swedish chronicler affirms—“there has never been
                    a castle in it.” For nine years was the colony held by the English, Carr being
                    governor under Governor Lovelace of New York. Lord Baltimore had claimed, during
                    the Dutch administration, all the lower part of the territory, within two miles
                    of New Amstel, and whilst Governor Lovelace was in office he still urged his
                    claim. In 1673 the Dutch admiral Eversten stormed New York, took it without
                    capitulation, and again there was a Dutch governor on the Delaware. This rule
                    was short, for in the very next year all the English colonies were ceded back to
                    England by the Peace of Westminster. Yet the settlement on the Delaware seemed
                    doomed to change its owners; for, becoming the property of the duke of York by a
                    special grant, there was a governor sent to New Castle in the name of the duke,
                    who himself never visited his possessions in America. In 1682 the duke gave, or
                    nominally sold, “the three lower counties” to William Penn, so that they became
                    a part of Pennsylvania. At first an effort was made that the “three lower
                    counties” should send their delegates to the Pennsylvania assembly, which should
                    legislate for the whole; but as the interests of the two sections of the
                    province were different, the “three lower counties” insisted upon a separate
                    assembly held at New Castle. After Penn’s death, in 1718, there was a lawsuit
                    between his heirs and those of Lord Baltimore, as to the boundary line between
                    their possessions. The suit was carried into the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n56/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0056-0045"/> Court of Chancery in England, and pending the
                    trial the “three lower counties” were not sure to whom they belonged, and so
                    paid no land rents. In 1768 the suit Was decided, and commissioners appointed,
                    who defined the boundary line of Maryland as it now stands. It was in the year
                    1776 that the first constitution of the State of Delaware was framed, whereby
                    “the three lower counties on the Delaware” lost their awkward name, and again
                    had a new form of government. In the same year Delaware, as one of the thirteen
                    colonies, signed the Declaration of Independence; andin 1787 the State, in
                    convention, adopted the constitution of the United States. In 1792 a new State
                    constitution was enacted, and again in 1831, which is now in force. Under it,
                    the governor is elected for four years, and the legislature meets biennially at
                    Dover, the State capital. Delaware was one of the original thirteen States, and,
                    though slave-holding, remained loyal to the Union at the secession of the
                    Southern States in 1861.</p>
