                    extraction; and the family had been settled in his native place for several
                    generations. When six years old, Emanuel began to attend the gymnasium of
                    Neisse, and continued a pupil for two years; after which, in compliance with the
                    earnest wish of his uncle, David Deutsch of Mislowitz, the charge of the boy’s
                    education was transferred to him. Rabbi Deutsch was a first-rate scholar, deeply
                    learned in the Talmud, with stern ideas of duty, as we may infer from the fact
                    that he made his nephew rise the whole year round at 5 o’clock, study for the
                    first two hours, and then spend an hour in prayer, before allowing him to taste
                    food or light a fire. The rest of the day, with the exception of half an hour
                    for exercise and recreation, was devoted to hard study. This dull routine, which
                    proved at once the foundation of his accurate scholarship and of his ill-health,
                    continued till Emanuel was thirteen years old, when he returned to Neisse, to
                    solemnize his religious majority (Bar-mitzva). He proceeded once more to the
                    gymnasium, where he enrolled in the highest class. On reaching his sixteenth
                    year he began his studies in Berlin University, paying special attention to
                    theology and the Talmud. Indeed the Talmud was seldom absent from his thoughts;
                    and, after his death, a great accumulation of papers was found, containing parts
                    of it, copied or translated, beginning in a child’s hand-writing, and reaching
                    down to a comparatively late period. Deutsch supported himself by teaching, and,
                    about two years after going to Berlin, wrote some stories and poems on Jewish
                    subjects for magazines. He also mastered the English language and studied
                    English literature. In 1855 Deutsch was offered an appointment as assistant in
                    the library of the British Museum, which he gladly accepted. “For nigh twenty
                    years,” he says, “it was my privilege to dwell in the very midst of that
                    pantheon called the British Museum, the treasures whereof, be they Egyptian,
                    Homeric, palimpsest, or Babylonian cuneiforms, the mutilated glories of the
                    Parthenon, or the Etruscan mysterious grotesqueness, were all at my beck and
                    call, all days, all hours.” He worked intensely, always aiming at a book on the
                    Talmud as his master-piece, and contributed no less than 190 papers to <hi
                    rend="italic">Chambers’s Encyclopaedia,</hi> in addition to essays in Kitto’s
                    and Smith’s Biblical Dictionaries, and articles in periodicals. In October 1867
                    his article on “The Talmud,” published in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                    Review,</hi> at once made him famous. It was translated, within twelve months,
                    into French, German, Russian, Swedish, Dutch, and Danish. He was passionately
                    desirous of travelling in the East; and, having obtained leave of absence for
                    ten weeks, he left England on the 7th of March 1869. The rapidity and fatigue of
                    the journey permanently injured his health; but he thoroughly enjoyed his visit
                    to Palestine, where his intense patriotism and finely-strung poetical nature
                    found much food for reflection. Never, to the end of his life, did he mention
                    his visit to the Wailing Place of the Jews in Jerusalem without profound
                    emotion. He reached England on the 10 th of May, submitted a valuable report of
                    his travels to the trustees of the British Museum, and delivered a number of
                    lectures, chiefly on Phoenicia. His article on “Islam” appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi><hi rend="italic">ioτ</hi> October 1869; and,
                    at the same time, overwork, the consciousness of approaching ill-health, and the
                    death of attached friends brought on terrible depression. Broken health
                    continued to drag him down; and, in the autumn of 1872, his old longing for the
                    East returned so powerfully upon him that, after obtaining six months leave, he
                    left for Italy and Egypt. There a cold moist winter told severely on his health.
                    On the 30th of March 1873, he reached Cairo, and was ultimately removed to
                    Alexandria, where, becoming rapidly worse, he died on the 12th of May. He was
                    buried next day in the Jewish cemetery in Alexandria, where a granite stone
                    marks his resting-place. Deutsch was one of the hardest workers of the century,
                    and added to his own special studies of Sanskrit, Chaldaic, Aramaic, and
                    Phoenician, a remarkable acquaintance with English literature. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary Remains,</hi> edited by Lady Strangford, were published
                    in 1874, consisting of nineteen papers on such subjects as “The Talmud,”
                    “Islam,” “Semitic Culture,” “Egypt, Ancient and Modern,” “Semitic Languages,”
                    “The Targums,” “The Samaritan Pentateuch,” and “Arabic Poetry.”</p>
