                    even the plaee of his birth has only lately been established beyond
                    dispute—Belgians, Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen claiming him as their
                    countryman. Μ. Fétis, the well-known historian of music, has contributed greatly
                    towards elucidating the doubtful points, and to that author’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographie Universelle</hi> the reader is referred for more detailed
                    information. In his early youth Josquin seems to have been a member of the choir
                    of the collegiate church at St Quentin; when his voice changed he went (about
                    1455) to Ockenheim to take lessons in counterpoint; afterwards he again lived at
                    his birth-place for some years, till Pope Sixtus IV, invited him to Rome to
                    teach his art to the musicians of Italy, where musical knowledge at that time
                    was at a low ebb. Γh Rome Deprès lived till the death of his protector (1484),
                    and it was there that many of his works were written. His reputation grew
                    rapidly, and he was considered by his contemporaries to be the greatest master
                    of his age. Luther, himself an excellent musical amateur, is credited with the
                    saying that “other musicians do with notes what they can, Josquin what he
                    likes.” The composer’s journey to Rome is in itself a most important event in
                    the history of musical progress: for it marks in a manner the transference of
                    the art from its Gallo-Belgian birth-place to Italy, which for the next two
                    centuries remained the centre of the musical world. To the school of the
                    Netherlands, of which Deprès and his pupils Arcadelt, Mouton, and others are the
                    chief representatives, modern music owes its rise. But far more important than
                    this school itself was its outgrowth and successor, the so-called Roman school,
                    immortalized by the name of Palestrina. After leaving Rome Deprès went for a
                    time to Ferrara, where the art-loving duke Hercules I. offered him a home; but
                    before long he accepted an invitation of King Louis XII. of France to become the
                    chief singer of the royal chapel. According to another account, he was for a
                    time at least in the service of the emperor Maximilian I. The date of his death
                    has by some writers been placed as early as 1501. But this is sufficiently
                    disproved by the fact of one of his finest compositions, <hi rend="italic">A
                    Dirge</hi><hi rend="italic">(Déploration)</hi><hi rend="italic">for Five
                    Voices,</hi> being written to commemorate the death of his master Ockenheim,
                    which took place after 1512. The real date of Josquin’s decease has since been
                    settled as the 27th August 1521. He was at that time a canon of the cathedral of
                    Condé. The most complete list of Deprès’s compositions—consisting of masses,
                    motets, psalms, and other pieces of sacred music—will be found in Fétis. The
                    largest collection of his MS. works, containing no less than 20 masses, is in
                    the possession of the Papal chapel in Rome. The well-known works by Drs Burney
                    and Hawkins give specimens of his music.</p>
