                    writing verses. At the age of ten he was sent as page into some great family,
                    and a little later he is supposed to have studied for some time at Oxford. Sir
                    Henry Goodere became his patron, and introduced him to the countess of Bedford,
                    and for several years he was supported by Sir Walter Aston. How the early part
                    of his life was spent, however, we possess no means of ascertaining. It has been
                    surmised that he served in the army abroad. In 1590 he seems to have come up to
                    London, and to havo settled there. In 1591 he produced his first book, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Harmony of the Church,</hi> a volume of spiritual poems,
                    dedicated to Lady Devereux. The best piece in this is a version of the Song of
                    Solomon, executed with considerable richness of expression. A singular and now
                    incomprehensible fate befell the book; with the exception of forty copies seized
                    by the archbishop of Canterbury, the whole edition was destroyed by public
                    order. It is probable that he had come up to town laden with poetic writings,
                    for he published a vast amount within the next few years. In 1593 appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">Idea: The Shepherd's Garland,</hi> a collection of pastorals, in
                    which he celebrated his own love-sorrows under the poetic name of Rowland. The
                    circumstances of this passion appear more distinctly in the cycle of 64 sonnets,
                    published in 1594, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Idea's Mirror,</hi> by
                    which we learn that the lady lived by the river Anker, in Warwickshire. It
                    appears that he failed to win his “Idea,” and lived and died a bachelor. The
                    same year, 1594, saw the publication of <hi rend="italic">Matilda,</hi> an
                    epical poem in rhyme royal, the first of his studies from English history. It
                    was about this time, too, that he brought out <hi rend="italic">Hndimioη and
                    Phoebe,</hi> a volume which he never republished, but which contains some
                    interesting autobiographical matter, and acknowledgments of literary help from
                    Lodge, if not from Spenser and Daniel also. In his <hi rend="italic">Fig for
                    Momus,</hi> Lodge has reciprocated these friendly courtesies. In 1596 Drayton
                    published his long and important poem of <hi rend="italic">Mοrtimeriados,</hi>
                    which deals with the Wars of the Roses, and is a very serious production in
                    ottava rima. He afterwards enlarged and modified this poem, and republished it
                    in 1603 under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Larons Wars.</hi> In 1596, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n471/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0471-0452"/> also, appeared another historical poem, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Legend of Robert, Duke of Normandy,</hi> and a similar piece
                    on <hi rend="italic">Piers Gαveston.</hi> In 1597 appeared <hi rend="italic"
                    >Englands Heroical Epistles,</hi> a series of historical studies, in imitation
                    of those of Ovid. These last poems, written in the heroic couplet, contain some
                    of the finest passages in Drayton’s writings. With the year 1597 the first half
                    of the poet’s literary life closes. He had become famous by this rapid
                    production of volumes, and he rested on his oars. It would seem that he was much
                    favoured at the court of Elizabeth, and he hoped that it would be the same with
                    her successor. But when, •in 1603, he addressed a poem of compliment to James I.
                    on his accession, it was ridiculed, and his services rudely rejected. His
                    bitterness of spirit found expression in a satire, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Owl,</hi> which he printed in 1604, although he had no talent in this kind of
                    composition. Not much more entertaining was his scriptural narrative of <hi
                    rend="italic">Moses in a Map of his Miracles,</hi> a sort of epic in heroics
                    printed the same year. In 1605 Drayton reprinted his most important works, that
                    is to say, his historical poems and the <hi rend="italic">Idea,</hi> in a single
                    volume, which ran through eight editions during his lifetime. He also collected
                    his smaller pieces, hitherto unedited, in a volume undated, but probably
                    published in 1605, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Poems Lyric and
                    Pastoral;</hi> these consisted of odes, eclogues, and a fantastic satire, called
                    <hi rend="italic">The Man in the Moon.</hi> Some of the odes are extremely
                    spirited. He then adopted the extraordinary resolution of celebrating all the
                    points of topographical or antiquarian interest in the island of Great Britain,
                    and on this laborious work he was engaged for many years. At last, in 1613, the
                    first part of this vast work was published under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >PolyOlbion,</hi> eighteen books being produced, to which the learned Selden
                    supplied notes. The success of this great work, which has since become so
                    famous, was very small at first, and not until 1622 did Drayton succeed in
                    finding a publisher willing to undertake the risk of bringing out twelve more
                    books in a second part. This completed the survey of England, and the poet, who
                    had hoped to “crown Scotland with flowers,” and arrive at last at the Orcades,
                    never crossed the Tweed. In 1627 he published another of his miscellaneous
                    volumes, and this contains some of his most characteristic and exquisite
                    writing. It consists of the following pieces :— <hi rend="italic">The Battle of
                    Agincourt,</hi> an historical poem in ottava rima, and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Miseries of Queen Margaret,</hi> written in the same verse and manner; <hi
                    rend="italic">Nimphidia, the Court of Faery,</hi> a most joyous and graceful
                    little epic of fairyland; <hi rend="italic">The Quest of Cinthia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Shepherd's</hi><hi rend="italic">Sirena,</hi> two lyrical
                    pastorals; and finally <hi rend="italic">The Moon Calf,</hi> a sort of satire.
                    Of these <hi rend="italic">Nimphidia</hi> is perhaps the best thing Drayton ever
                    wrote, except his famous ballad on the <hi rend="italic">Battle of
                    Agincourt;</hi> it is quite unique of its kind, and full of rare fantastic
                    fancy. The last of Drayton’s voluminous publications was <hi rend="italic">The
                    Muses' Elizium</hi> in 1630. He died in London on the 23d of December 1631, was
                    buried in Westminster Abbey, and had a monument placed over him by the countess
                    of Dorset, with memorial lines attributed to Ben Jonson. Of the particulars of
                    Drayton’s life we know almost nothing but what he himself tells us; he enjoyed
                    the friendship of some of the best men of the age. He corresponded familiarly
                    with Drummond; Jonson, Browne, Wither, and others were among his friends. In one
                    of his poems, an “elegy” or epistle to Mr Henry Reynolds, he has left some
                    valuable criticisms on poets whom he had known. He was even engaged in the
                    labour of the dramatists; at least he had a share, with Munday, Chettle, and
                    Wilson, in writing <hi rend="italic">Sir John Oldcastle,</hi> which was printed
                    in 1600. That he was a restless and discontented, as well as a worthy man, may
                    be gathered from his own admissions.</p>
                <p>The works of Drayton are bulky, and, in spite of the high place that he holds in
                    critical esteem, it cannot be pretended that he is much read. For this his
                    ponderous style is much to blame. The <hi rend="italic">Poly-Olbioη,</hi> the
                    most famous but far from the most successful of his writings, is tedious and
                    barren in the extreme. The metre in which it is composed, a couplet of
                    Alexandrines, like the French classical measure, is wholly unsuited to our
                    language, and becomes excessively wearisome to the reader, who forgets the
                    learning and ingenuity of the poet in labouring through the harsh and overgrown
                    lines. His historical poems, which he was constantly rewriting and improving,
                    are much more interesting, and often rise to a true poetic eloquence. His
                    pastorals are brilliant, but overladen with colour and sweet to insipidity. He
                    is, with one or two magnificent exceptions, an indifferent sonneteer. The poet
                    with whom it is most natural to compare him is Daniel; lie is more rough and
                    vigorous, more varied and more daring than the latter, but Daniel surpasses him
                    in grace, delicacy, and judgment. In their elegies and epistles, however, the
                    two writers frequently resemble each other. Drayton, however, approaches the
                    very first poets of the Elizabethan era in his charming <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nimphidia,</hi> a poem which inspired Herrick with his sweet fairy fancies, and
                    which stands alone of its kind in our literature; while some of his odes and
                    lyrics are inspired by noble feeling and high imagination.</p>
                <p>In 1748 a folio edition of Drayton’s complete works was published, under the
                    editorial supervision of Oldys, and again in 1753 there appeared an issue in
                    four volumes. But these were very unintelli∙ gently and inaccurately prepared.
                    An attempt is now being made to edit Drayton in α more critical spirit. Three
                    volumes of an edition (to be completed in six or eight volumes), collected by
                    the Bev. R. Hooper, have already appeared, comprising the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ρoly-Olbion</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Harmony of the Church.</hi> (E. W.
                    G.)</p>
