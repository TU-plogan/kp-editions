                <p><label type="entry">DRAWING</label>. Although the verb to draw has various
                    meanings, the substantive <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> is confined by usage to
                    that of design, and is treated as if it were a synonym of design. The word comes
                    from the Latin <hi rend="italic">trahere,</hi> or from a kindred Gothic word, so
                    that traction and drawing are nearly related, and preserve still the same
                    meaning when applied to the work of animals or machines, as we say that a
                    traction engine draws so many tons. Another form of the same word is dray, the
                    strong low vehicle used by brewers and carriers. It may be worth while to
                    inquire what is the connection between the idea of a dray horse and that of a
                    drawing-master.</p>
                <p>The primitive idea, which is the common origin of both senses of the word to
                    draw, is that of moving something in one’s own direction. Thus, a horse draws a
                    plough; but a carpenter does not draw his plane, he pushes it; and we should say
                    that a locomotive drew a train when the locomotive was in front, but not when it
                    was behind. The same idea is preserved in the fine arts. We do not usually say,
                    or think, that a sculptor is drawing when he is using his chisel, although he
                    may be expressing or defining forms, nor that an engraver is drawing when he is
                    pushing the burin with the palm of the hand, although the result may be the
                    rendering of a design. But we do say that an artist is drawing when he uses the
                    lead pencil, and here we have a motion bearing some resemblance to that of the
                    horse or engine. The fingers of the artist draw the pencil point along the
                    paper. The analogy may be clearly seen in certain circumstances. When the North
                    American Indians shift their camps they frequently tie a tent-pole on each side
                    of the horse like a shaft, leaving the ends to drag along the ground, whilst
                    their baggage is laid on cross pieces. Here we have a very close analogy with
                    artistic drawing. The poles are drawn on the ground as a pencil is on paper, and
                    they leave marks behind them corresponding to the lines of the pencil.</p>
                <p>The same analogy may be observed between two of the senses in which the French
                    verb <hi rend="italic">tirer</hi> is frequently employed. This verb is not
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">trahere,</hi> but may be ultimately traced, like
                    our own verb <hi rend="italic">to tear,</hi> to the Ionic δ∈tpω. It was formerly
                    used by good writers in the two senses of our verb to draw. Thus Lafontaine
                    says, “Six forts chevaux <hi rend="italic">tiraient</hi> un coche and Caillières
                    wrote, “Il n’y a pas longtemps que je me suis fait <hi rend="italic">tirer</hi>
                    par Rigaud,” meaning that Rigaud had drawn or painted his portrait. At the
                    present day the verb <hi rend="italic">tirer</hi> has fallen into disuse amongst
                    cultivated Frenchmen with regard to the drawing and painting, but it is still
                    universally used for all kinds of design and even for photography by the common
                    people. The cultivated use it still for printing, as for example “cette gravure
                    sera tirée à cent exemplaires,” but here rather in the sense of pulling than of
                    drawing.</p>
                <p>A verb much more nearly related to the English verb <hi rend="italic">to
                    draw</hi> is <hi rend="italic">traire,</hi> which has <hi rend="italic"
                    >trait</hi> for its past participle. It comes from <hi rend="italic"
                    >trahere,</hi> and is so little altered as to be scarcely even a corruption of
                    the original Latin form. <hi rend="italic">Traire</hi> is now used exclusively
                    for milking cows and other animals, and the analogy between this and artistic
                    drawing is not obvious at first, nevertheless there is a certain analogy of
                    motion, the hand passing down the teat draws the milk downwards. The word <hi
                    rend="italic">trait</hi> is much more familiar in connection with art as “les
                    traits du visage,” the natural markings of the face, and it is very often used
                    in a figurative sense, as we say “traits of character.” It is quite familiar in
                    <hi rend="italic">portrait,</hi> derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >protrahere.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient Romans used words which expressed more clearly the conception that
                    drawing was done in line <hi rend="italic">(delineare)</hi> or in shade <hi
                    rend="italic">(adumbrare),</hi> though there are reasons for believing that the
                    words were often indiscriminately applied. Although the modern Italians have <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0466-0447"/> both <hi rend="italic">traire</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">trarre,</hi> they use <hi rend="italic">delineare</hi> still in
                    the sense of artistic drawing, and also <hi rend="italic">adombrare.</hi></p>
                <p>The Greek verb <hi rend="italic">γpαφeιv</hi> is familiar to the English reader
                    in “graphic” and in many compounds, such as photograph, &amp;c. It is worth
                    observing that the Greeks seem to have considered drawing and writing as
                    essentially the same process, since they used the same word for both. This
                    points to the early identity of the two arts when drawing was a kind of writing,
                    and when such writing as men had learned to practise was essentially what we
                    should call drawing, though of a rude and simple kind. “The origin of the
                    hieroglyphics of Egypt,” says Dr Wilson <hi rend="italic">(PreHistoric Man,</hi>
                    chap, xviii.), “is clearly traceable to the simplest form of picture-writing,
                    the literal figuring of the objects designed to be expressed. Through a natural
                    series of progressive stages this infantile art developed itself into a phonetic
                    alphabet, the arbitrary symbols of sounds of the human voice.” Even in the
                    present day picture writing is not unfreq uently resorted to by travellers as a
                    means of making themselves intelligible. There is also a kind of art which is
                    writing in the modern sense and drawing at the same time, such as the work of
                    the mediaeval illuminators in their manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The mental processes by which man has gradually become able to draw, in our
                    modern sense of the word, may be followed, like the development of a chicken in
                    the egg, by examining specimens at various stages of formation. His first
                    efforts are remarkable for their highly abstract character, because the
                    undeveloped intellect has few and simple ideas, and takes what it perceives in
                    nature without being embarrassed by the rest. It seizes upon facts rather than
                    appearances, and the primitive artist is satisfied w hen the fact has been
                    clearly stated or conveyed by him. The study of appearances, and the effort to
                    render them, come much later; and the complete knowledge of appearances is the
                    sign of a very high state of civilization, implying most advanced artistic
                    culture both in the artist and in the public to whom he addresses himself. The
                    work of the primitive artist is an affirmation of the realities that he knew
                    without mystery or confusion. In all early Egyptian work you see at once what
                    the artist intended to draw, whereas the finest modern drawing is often so
                    mysterious as to be most obscure to those who have not made a special study of
                    the fine arts. The primitive artist knew that his work was really that of a
                    writer, and as the sign-painter of the present day takes care to make his
                    letters plain in order that they may be read, so the early Egyptian draftsman
                    had no thought of any more delicate truth of appearance that that which sufficed
                    to let people clearly understand what his figures and symbols were intended for.
                    There was no conception of what artists call “effect,” which enters into the
                    greater part of modern drawing, until a very much later period.</p>
                <p>We may mention briefly two survivals of primitive art in our own day, which have
                    for their purpose a high degree of legibility. These are coats-of-arms and
                    trade-marks. Heraldic drawing, when properly done, is executed on primitive
                    principles, and is a survival of the earliest uses of graphic art, being really
                    a kind of writing intended to be recognizable by the illiterate when they saw it
                    on shield or banner. Modern trade-marks, of which the use has greatly extended
                    of late years, are of the same class, and are often designed with a simplicity
                    of intention like that of remote antiquity.</p>
                <p>Archaic forms of drawing are thus not all extinct even in our own day, and
                    certain arts are practised among us which compel the modern mind to recover by
                    effort and study something of that simplicity and decision which were
                    instinctive in earlier ages. Book-binding, illuminating, and designing for
                    pottery are often rightly practised in these days in an archaic spirit. In some
                    of the best modern caricatures there are peculiarities which belong to early
                    symbolic drawing, in which, as Dr Wilson says, “the figures are for the most
                    part grotesque and monstrous from the very necessity of giving predominance to
                    the special feature in which the symbol is embodied.”</p>
                <p>The first idea of drawing is always <hi rend="italic">delineation,</hi> the
                    marking out of the subject by lines, the notion of drawing without lines being
                    of later development. In primitive work the outline is hard and firm, but
                    interior markings are given also. When the outline was complete, the primitive
                    artist would proceed at once in many cases to fill up the space inclosed by it
                    with flat colour, but he did not understand light and shade and gradation. The
                    historical development of drawing may always be seen in the practice of children
                    when left to draw for their amusement. They begin, as the human race began, with
                    firm outlines, representing men and animals, usually in profile. The next thing
                    they do, if left to their own instincts, is to fill up the spaces so marked out
                    with colours, the brightest they can get. This is genuine primitive art.</p>
                <p>By referring to the earliest kind of drawing we perceive how drawing may exist
                    without certain elements which in modern times are usually associated with it.
                    We generally conceive of drawing in close association with perspective, and at
                    least with some degree of light and shade, but it may exist independently of
                    both. This may perhaps help us to a definition of drawing. Such a definition
                    would need to be exceedingly comprehensive, or else it would certainly exclude
                    some of the many arts into which drawing more or less visibly enters. A modern
                    critic would be very likely to say that a figure was deficient in drawing if it
                    was deficient in perspective, and yet the two are easily separable, as for
                    example in the work of the mechanical draftsman; or drawing may be associated
                    with a kind of perspective which is visually false, as isometric perspective. We
                    might say that drawing was the imitation of form, but a moment’s reflection
                    would enable us to perceive that it may create forms without imitating, as it
                    does in many fanciful conceptions of ornamental designers. It might be suggested
                    that drawing was the representation on a flat surface of forms which are not
                    flat, but the most variously curved surfaces, as in vases, are frequently drawn
                    upon, and flat objects are sometimes represented on rounded surfaces. The Greeks
                    were so logieal in their use of <hi rend="italic">ypαφeLv</hi> for both drawing
                    and writing that it is not possible to construct a definition comprehensive
                    enough to include all the varieties of drawing without including writing also.
                    If we say that <hi rend="italic">drawing is a motion which leaves significant
                    marks,</hi> we are as precise as the numerous varieties of the art will permit
                    us to be.</p>
                <p>The first step in the arts of design is a resolute and decided conventionalism.
                    Drawing always begins with line, and there are no lines in nature. The natural
                    world presents itself to the eye as an assemblage of variously-coloured patches
                    or spaces, always full of gradation both in shade and colour, but in all this
                    there is no such thing as a real line. Even the sea-horizon, which is commonly
                    spoken of as a line, is not so in reality, it is only the ending of a coloured
                    space. The conventionalism of the line being once admitted, it may be considered
                    as neither good nor bad in itself, but a simple necessity. Beyond this, however,
                    in the use of the line when it has once been adopted, there may be artistic
                    merit or demerit.</p>
                <p>All primitive line-drawing gives a version of natural truth which is idealized in
                    one way or the other, and it is always conventional not only in the sense of
                    using conventional means, but also in that of interpreting natural forms with
                    conventional amplifications or omissions. The temper of a primitive civilization
                    always led it≡ artists to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n467/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0467-0448"/> expression of certain customary ways of seeing
                    things which were transmitted traditionally by art, so that the artists in their
                    turn became the means of imposing the authority of public sentiment upon their
                    successors. The liberty of individual artists, even to draw what may seem such a
                    simple thing as the outline of a human figure, is dependent upon the degree in
                    which the civilization under which they live is or is not traditional.</p>
                <p>To understand the effect of customary ways of seeing things on the use of pure
                    line in drawing, the reader is recommended to study some specimens of early
                    design as it was practised in China, in Japan, in Egypt, in Assyria, and in
                    Greece. It is easy, in these days, to procure photographic reproductions of
                    ancient design when the student does not live near a museum. He will perceive at
                    once in the five countries four entirely different ways of seeing and designing
                    the curvature of lines, although the Chinese and Japanese ways are nearer to
                    each other than they are to the Egyptian or the Greek; whilst on the other hand,
                    different as the two latter may be, they are nearer to each other than to the
                    art of China or Japan.</p>
                <p>A certain kind of curvature is dominant in Chinese art, along with the preference
                    for certain easily recognizable forms. In Japanese drawings the curves are
                    wilder, bolder, more unexpected, more audacious; and when the Japanese designer
                    chose to make use of angles he was, from the same tendency to vivacity and
                    exaggeration, disposed to prefer acute angles. In both Chinese and Japanese
                    work, when at its best, there is often the most exquisite beauty aud delicacy of
                    line, especially in the contours of female faces; and there is frequently a
                    masterly power in the interpretation of natural truth, or certain portions of
                    natural truth, by means of the utmost simplicity.</p>
                <p>In ancient Egypt the line was quieter and less “tormented” than in China or
                    Japan, the curvature more restrained, and the artistic expression generally
                    rather that of calm dignity than of vigorous action. Egyptian art was kept
                    within the strictest limits by the most powerful conventionalism that ever
                    existed, but the student of drawing will find much in it that is well worth his
                    attention. The Egyptian draftsmen attained to a most noble use of line,
                    combining a serious and disciplined reserve with much delicacy of modulation.
                    The true grandeur of Egyptian work has only been apprehended of late years,
                    because it was formerly supposed that its conventionalism was due to simple
                    ignorance of nature and want of skill in art. It is of various degrees of
                    excellence, and there were inferior artists in the early Egyptian schools, as in
                    others; but we are often startled by maguificent power in conventionalizing
                    natural material, and by a peculiar sense of beauty. There is in Egyptian design
                    a singular combination of tranquil strength with refinement.</p>
                <p>Assyrian design is very familiar to us through the ancient wall-sculptures, where
                    the line is often rather engraved than carved, so that we can see quite plainly
                    what were the qualities of drawing which the Assyrian artists valued. They, too,
                    conventionalized nature, but sought for those curves and accents of line which
                    express manly beauty rather than feminine. They drew, in their own way,
                    admirably well, with great firmness and self-command, kuo wing always exactly
                    what equivalents or representatives to give for the lines and markings of
                    nature, in accordance with the spirit of their artistic system. Their art is
                    much more strongly accentuated than the Egyptian, and we might even say that it
                    is more picturesque while it is less tranquil. Assyrian design has more of the
                    spirit of painting in it than Egyptian, and less of the spirit of sculpture. The
                    Assyrian line tends to the expression of energy in action, the Egyptian to
                    strength and beauty in repose.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the high degree of power and skill attained in linear design by
                    nations which existed before the artistic development of Greece, it must ever
                    remain an inexplicable marvel that the Greek designers should have attained,
                    apparently without effort and simply by the gift of nature, to a degree of
                    perfection in the use of line which had never been approached before and has
                    never been equalled since. The manly beauty of an Assyrian king at a lion hunt,
                    with his curly beard and his muscular legs, and his arm mighty to bend the bow,
                    is grand indeed, but with a purely barbaric grandeur; the half-feminine beauty
                    of an Egyptian deity lives chiefly in the serene face—the body is often frankly
                    architectural, and has always rather the qualities of a column than those of the
                    living flesh. But in Greece the curves of the line were for the first time made
                    to express the fulness and grace of life, with an ideal perfection coming from
                    the exquisite innate taste aud refinement of the artists, and never to be found
                    in any single model. How much knowledge and taste may be expressed by a simple
                    line may be seen in any Greek vase of the best time, especially if there are
                    both draped and naked figures, of both sexes, in the composition.</p>
                <p>The leading principle of Greek design on vases was the expression of form by
                    pure, firm, and accurate line. Spaces were distinguished by flat tints of red,
                    black, and white, but there was no shading to indicate modelling. When local
                    colour could be easily hinted at by markings of black thicker than a simple
                    outline, it was frequently done, as it was continually in Japanese art, but care
                    was taken that these broader black markings should never be important enough to
                    alter the true character of the design, as essentially a work in simple line.
                    Thus, a woman’s hair might be drawn with broad touches to make us see that it
                    was darker than her flesh, and the dark band round the edges of her dress would
                    be given in pure black of its own width. Nor was this the only device by which a
                    certain degree of local colour was suggested to the eye, though it was not
                    really imitated. The red did for ordinary flesh colour, and white for
                    flesh-colour intended to be of more than ordinary fairness. Great spaces of
                    black were reserved for the background, by which a striking relief was given to
                    the figures. This is the regular principle of Greek vase decoration, though the
                    artists did not strictly confine themselves to it, but would also work in simple
                    black and white, as in the Portland vase, or introduce brighter colour
                    sparingly, like the turquoise of the mantle of Thetis aud in the wings of Eros
                    in the vase of Camirus. This use of colour, however, did not in the least
                    interfere with the unflinching system of Greek drawing, which was, in the
                    strictest sense of the word, <hi rend="italic">delineation.</hi> In this it
                    differs absolutely from many modern kinds of drawing which avoid the line as
                    much as the Greeks delighted in it. This is not intended as an expression either
                    of praise or blame; it. is simply a statement of fact.</p>
                <p>The truth is that Greek line-drawing is simply the most perfect condition of a
                    very early form of art. It is the child’s idea of drawing, carried out with the
                    knowledge and taste of men who lived in the early youth of the human race and
                    were not disturbed and distracted by the dis-≈ cσveries and experiments of
                    modern Europeans. Amongst its other peculiarities may be mentioned its beautiful
                    independence of anatomy. No anatomical markings are ever given simply as such.
                    The figures are living men and women with their skins on, not <hi rend="italic"
                    >écorches</hi> in a dissecting room. There is less of the anatomical tendency in
                    Greek art than in Assyrian. When the Assyrian artist wishes to make you feel
                    that a man’s leg is very strong he maps out every muscle and tendon as far as
                    his know ledge will allow, but the Greek contents himself with showing the
                    vigour and ease of the strong man’s action. It is, however, in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n468/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0468-0449"/> the representation of the female form that the
                    grace of the Greek line-drawing is most conspicuous and most unprecedented.
                    There had been before some lithe feminine grace of motion even in Egyptian art,
                    but it is stiffness and awkwardness themselves in comparison with the Greek.</p>
                <p>The right progress of art-education in modern times could not be better assured
                    than by following in the case of each individual student that course of
                    development which humanity itself has followed. True and careful lines, in
                    combination with the colouring of spaces in a few flat tints, are the natural
                    beginning. What a child does with infantile unsuccess for its amusement the
                    beginner in serious art should be taught to do carefully and well for his
                    instruction. The accurate use of line is the first thing to be learned with -the
                    pencil point, and the equal laying of a flat tint is the first thing to be
                    learned with the brush.</p>
                <p>Even at so early a stage in art as the use of the simple line, we find ourselves
                    face to face with one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the fine as
                    distinguished from the mechanical arts. It does not require much critical acumen
                    to discover that accuracy is one thing in a line and beauty another. The student
                    ought to work at first for accuracy, but from beautiful works of art which are
                    not in themselves accurate copies of nature but copies idealized at least in
                    some degree by the taste and feeling of the artist. All works of art that are
                    worth studying are ideal in one way or another. We have spoken of the Greek
                    line, w4ιich is one of the most highly idealized of all artistic expressions.
                    The Greek artists when they outlined an object always greatly simplified the
                    outline by omitting many minor accidents of angle and curvature which a modern
                    picturesque artist would seek for because of their variety. But simplification
                    does not explain all that the Greek mind did to alter nature in design. Its
                    sense of beauty and elegance was so exquisite that it continually amplified what
                    was meagre in the model, reduced what was superabundant, and corrected what was
                    awkward. All this could be done, and was done, with the simple line alone
                    without any help from chiaroscuro, and it is one of the most remarkable proofs
                    of the expressional power of the line that it even suggests modelling in the
                    blank spaces which are inclosed by it.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the excellence of Greek linear design it would be well that the
                    student’s attention should not be confined to it too exclusively. For, in the
                    first place, we may remember that the vase-paintings which remain to us were not
                    executed by the most eminent painters living at that time, but were only done by
                    clever workmen in the artistic spirit which the eminent painters had rendered
                    prevalent and fashionable; whereas in modern art we can study the <hi
                    rend="italic">ipsissima;</hi><hi rend="italic">lineae</hi> of truly great men,
                    both in their drawings and in many cases more accessibly still in their
                    etchings. Again, the Greek designers had certain excellencies, but not all
                    excellencies, the remarkably harmonious character of their work being, in fact,
                    quite as much due to its absolute neglect of certain qualities of line as to its
                    possession of other qualities. It is a narrow and limited kind of art, the
                    singular perfection of it being due in great measure to that narrowness. Modern
                    art, on the contrary, is infinitely vast and varied, full of imperfection,
                    abounding in all conceivable kinds of error and failure, but also rich beyond
                    all that a Greek could possibly have imagined in knowledge and sentiment of many
                    <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi>.inds.</p>
                <p>The Greek spirit passed through its first decadence in Roman art, and was at last
                    degraded past recognition at Byzantium. A new spirit of linear design arose in
                    the northern countries during the Middle Ages, gradually forming what we call
                    the Gothic schools of architecture and ornament. The mediaeval artists began
                    exactly like the Greeks by the natural primitive process of line and flat
                    colouring of spaces, of which we have abundant examples in their illuminated
                    manuscripts, and examples less abundant in the mural paintings which remain to
                    us. Students who intend to qualify themselves for decorative work, or for
                    carving, will do well to give earnest attention to mediaeval designs of ornament
                    which abound in the richest and most fanciful invention; but students of the
                    figure have little to learn from the Middle Ages, for in those centuries the
                    figure was very imperfectly understood. Sometimes we meet with a startling
                    exception, with some instance of individual observation which strikes us because
                    it looks like science; but the plain truth is that the mediaeval artists of all
                    classes were as inferior to the Greek in the knowledge of the human frame as
                    they were superior to them in the capacity for inventing new and fanciful
                    schemes of decoration. If the student wishes to learn the figure he may
                    therefore pass at once from the period of decline in Greek art to the
                    Renaissance, without concerning himself about the more or less successful
                    attempts of the intervening ages, in which, indeed, may be found examples of
                    quaintly rendered human character, but hardly any of well-studied human form.
                    The best way is to go from antiquity to Hans Holbein the younger at once. He had
                    remarkable power and skill in the use of line, many of his best portraits being
                    hardly anything more than a delicately true outline, with just enough shading to
                    make us understand the modelling, but nothing of what is commonly understood by
                    chiaroscuro. As Holbein was much more of a realist than the Greeks were, his
                    lines have more variety of curvature than theirs, and the forms inclosed by them
                    are more individual. All that is best in the peculiar spirit of northern drawing
                    at that time is to be found in Holbein’s art, which is full of close
                    observation, of calm sobriety, and unflinching truthfulness. In the south of
                    Europe the Renaissance led to that artistic development of which the modern
                    schools of figure design have inherited the ideas and principles. A certain
                    period in the life of Raphael marks the transition from the old spirit to the
                    new, and his great success in the application of the new principles led to their
                    authoritative establishment in the schools of Europe. The Renaissance made
                    drawing at the same time more scientific and more ideal. The artists studied
                    anatomy more than it had ever been studied before, and they gave a degree of
                    attention to the whole of the human body which a mediaeval draftsman would have
                    concentrated almost exclusively on the face. But they did not rest satisfied
                    with copying the facts of nature and investigating the laws of construction and
                    of action,—they took that farther step which the Greeks had taken before them,
                    and drew the figure not merely as it appeared to their bodily eyes, but with
                    that more perfect beauty which was suggested to the eye in the artist’s mind.
                    Raphael openly affirmed this principle by declaring that he drew men and women,
                    not as they were, but as they ought to be, and the process of idealization may
                    be actually seen in what he did by comparing his studies with his completed
                    works.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto spoken simply of the use of line, that being essentially drawing
                    in the strict sense of delineation; but when the European mind had reached the
                    period of the Renaissance a new study took its rise—chiaroscuro— which became so
                    inextricably mingled with that of drawing that it is impossible to speak
                    adequately of the one without giving some account of the other. The increased
                    knowledge of the muscular structure of the body led the artists to pay more
                    attention to modelling than had ever been paid to it before, so that good
                    modelling got to be considered an essential part of drawing. It may be
                    necessary, for the uninstructed in artistic matters to explain in this place <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n469/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0469-0450"/> that modelling in design is the art of shading in
                    such a manner as to give everything its due degree of projection or relief, and
                    the practical difficulty of it lies in the necessity for making the degree of
                    projection in any object or part of an object exactly what it ought to be
                    relatively to other projecting masses or details in the same drawing. The simple
                    line-work of the early stages of art was therefore abandoned by the greatest
                    artists of the Renaissance as a general means of study. Even when using the most
                    rapid means of expression for themselves alone, they were accustomed to treat
                    the outline with little respect, and always to indicate shading in some way,
                    often by the very rudest means, as for example by a few hasty diagonal strokes
                    of the pen. Leonardo da Vinci retained to the last a good deal of that care
                    about the outline which characterizes the earlier stage of art, but even in his
                    case it was accompanied by an equal degree of care in modelling. In the sketches
                    and studies of Michelangelo the care and time given to the outline are always in
                    exact proportion to the pains taken with the modelling, and this employment of
                    the time at the artist’s disposal is a clear proof that he considered modelling
                    as much a part of drawing as the outline itself. When he had time to do the
                    modelling thoroughly, as in his finished studies, he made the outlines very
                    carefully also, but when the time at his disposal was limited he did not
                    economize it by making, as an earlier artist would probably have done, a careful
                    outline without modelling,—he still gave both together, but in a rougher and
                    readier way. The student can find no better examples of this treatment than any
                    three sketches and studies of Michelangelo which may have cost him respectively
                    five minutes, half an hour, and three or fours hours of labour. The work in each
                    instance is economized, not by rejection of one portion of his art, but by
                    summarizing the whole, more or less, with the strictest reference to the time at
                    his disposal. The studies of Raphael are done on the same principle.</p>
                <p>The spirit of the Renaissance was caught from the study of antiquity, but it gave
                    more latitude to original genius by allowing a freer play to personal qualities
                    in art. This led to bold exaggerations, which became a part of artistic
                    expression, and were to it what emphasis is to the orator. Michelangelo himself
                    set the example of this, and it may be observed that, whereas when the works of
                    the ancients seem to lose their spirit on reduction to a smaller scale, and
                    require to be accentuated by the copyist who reduces them, those of Michelangelo
                    bear reduction easily by reason of their own strong accents and exaggerations.
                    Leonardo da Vinci, being of a calmer temper, put little exaggeration into his
                    finished works, which are distinguished by great suavity and sobriety of manner;
                    but he gave it free play in his caricatures, which served as an outlet for the
                    more violent side of his genius.</p>
                <p>A kind of exaggeration almost universal during and since the Renaissance has been
                    a more than natural marking of the muscles, which is opposed to the spirit of
                    the best Greek design, and was directly due to anatomical studies, especially to
                    the habit of dissection. This has continued down to our own day in all the
                    learned schools of Europe. For example, in the St Symphorien of Ingres the
                    figures of the Roman lictors are drawn as if they were without skins, and every
                    muscle is enormously exaggerated.</p>
                <p>A better result of the scientific spirit of the Renaissance was the degree of
                    care and attention which artists began to pay to the measurement of the human
                    body, so as to determine its true proportions. Albert Durer made and recorded
                    very numerous and careful measurements both of man and the horse, declaring that
                    “no one could be a good workman without measuring,” and that “it was the true
                    foundation of all painting.” Leonardo affirmed in words of equal plainness that
                    “a young man ought to begin to learn perspective by measuring everything.” This
                    habit of measurement has been continued down to our own day by the more careful
                    artists. Whenever an animal died in the Jardin des Plantes, at Paris, Barye the
                    sculptor went at once to take all its measurements, and drew or modelled it
                    besides; but he measured animals all his life, notwithstanding his great skill
                    in drawing by the eye.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to say something in this place of the rise of what we call
                    picturesque drawing, which is now more prevalent than any other throughout
                    Europe. We all know what we mean by the word “picturesque” as applied to real
                    objects <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> example, we all consider that a feudal
                    castle or abbey, when it has become an ivied ruin, is a picturesque object, but
                    that a Greek temple in perfect repair is not. Even amongst things in equally
                    good repair the distinction is recognized, thus we say that the costume worn by
                    Charles II. was more picturesque than that worn by William Pitt. We are less
                    acccustomed to recognize the fact that almost any object may be drawn in a
                    manner which is picturesque or not picturesque, according to the temper of the
                    artist. The temper which produces picturesque work is tolerant, observant, and
                    playful; the tempeτ which produces the other kind of work is always either
                    simple or severely disdainful,—simple in Greece and in the purists of the Middle
                    Ages, disdainful in the great men of the Renaissance and in all their strongest
                    successors. The most perfect development of the picturesque spirit in drawing
                    before our own century took place in Holland, the Dutch school working almost
                    entirely in that spirit. The severe spirit has maintained itself chiefly as a
                    sort of academic protest against the picturesque, which is never authoritatively
                    taught in any academy of art. The academies direct students continually to
                    Raphael, but never to Rembrandt. On the other hand, the kind of drawing usually
                    taught to amateurs is picturesque, especially through the medium of
                    water-colour. The strongest reaction against the picturesque has been that of
                    the French “néo-Grecs,” who in study went back to the pure Greek line and flat
                    space, the most earnest of them declaring that nothing more was needed to the
                    perfection of art. The most perfect and studied picturesque in modern drawing
                    will be found in the works of etchers and fusinists (artists who draw in
                    charcoal). The picturesque is always easily recognizable by its love of accident
                    and variety of line and character, and by its strong effects of light and shade.
                    When in excess it violently exaggerates these accidents, varieties, and
                    effects.</p>
                <p>The kind of drawing which is best for landscape differs in some important
                    respects from that which is best for tho figure. To perceive the full truth of
                    this, the reader has only to draw a landscape with the simplicity of the line in
                    a Greek figure, when he will see that the more complicated character of
                    landscape material requires a more varied interpretation. Good landscape
                    draftsmen are seldom very accurate as to form, and it is not necessary that they
                    should be; but they are always careful to preserve truth of character, and have
                    great difficulties of their own to contend against, which are generally much
                    underestimated. The inaccuracy of landscape design comes from the necessity for
                    composition. When the figure painter composes, he can move his models about, and
                    place them in different attitudes, and draw them faithfully after all; but when
                    a landscape painter does the same thing, by an effort of imagination, with his
                    mountains, trees, or towers, he unavoidably violates topographic accuracy. The
                    habit of inaccuracy soon forms itself, for this reason, in all landscape
                    draftsmen who compose; and all artists by profession are compelled to compose in
                    order to make their works attractive in appearance<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n470/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0470-0451"/> and saleable. Simple studies of landscape may,
                    however, be made with perfect accuracy, and are so done occasionally for special
                    purposes. The best examples of such accurate landscape design to which we are
                    able to refer the reader are the engraved studies of Mr Ruskin. Fine examples of
                    artistic landscape design, in which natural scenery is well interpreted but not
                    literally copied, are infinitely more numerous. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritatis</hi> of Claude, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber Studiorum</hi> of Turner, abound in fine examples of composed landscape,
                    and a great number of illustrated works have been published during the present
                    century, in which the student may find endless instruction.</p>
                <p>Landscape design is usually taught to amateurs by drawing masters, because it is
                    thought to be easier than that of the figure; but the choice of landscape for
                    elementary instruction is unfortunate, because a beginner requires simpler and
                    more definite material than is to be found in landscape nature. It is wiser for
                    all beginners in art to study for a long time the most simple and definite
                    objects which can easily be entirely detached from other objects and thoroughly
                    studied by themselves. This was the true early classic manner of drawing, and
                    the student who follows it in the present day will always be rewarded by an
                    earlier insight into the qualities of form than can be attained by any other
                    method. The truth of this is more fully recognized wherever drawing is taught
                    seriously; but those who teach water-colour to amateurs too often encourage them
                    in a confused way of looking at nature which, at the best, only results in a
                    feeble imitation of fifth-rate water-colour landscapes, in which there is
                    nothing worthy to be called drawing at all, nor any real rendering of form. It
                    is of the utmost importance to amateurs that they should not misapply the little
                    time which they can usually give to practical art, and yet they often do
                    misapply it in many ways. A very common cause of loss of time, in their case, is
                    false finish, and labour thrown away by the employment of methods which take
                    more time than other methods for an inferior result, as, for example, when
                    painful pen hatching is employed for shading where the chalk and stump, or
                    charcoal, or the brush, would give a shade of far better quality in a twentieth
                    part of the time. All truly great artists, though prodigal of labour when their
                    purposes required it, have economized it whenever the economy was not
                    artistically an evil, and this is often best seen in their sketches, which give
                    rapidity, not by hurrying the hand, but by using the most summary means of
                    expression. This art of summary expression in drawing is of great use to
                    figure-painters, but it is still more important in landscape, because the
                    effects of nature pass so rapidly that they do not permit any slow method of
                    interpretation. Many of the fine sketches by great men have been done, without
                    hurry, in a few minutes. Tinted papers are often used to economize time, because
                    they supply a middle tint on which lights can be noted in white, and darks in
                    chalk, charcoal, or a wash of water-colour. Good examples of sketches and
                    studies by the greatest artists are now quite easily accessible through the
                    photographic processes, and by their help a student at a distance from the
                    national collections may easily learn for himself how they used the pen by
                    itself, or the pen for line with a wash for shadow, or the lead pencil point, or
                    chalks (white and black) on grey paper, or sanguine, getting a shade more
                    quickly by one method, a line more precisely by another. Original drawings by
                    great masters may be seen in all the capitals of Europe, in the public
                    collections. Of late years drawings by modern artists have attracted more of the
                    public attention than they did formerly, and “black-and-white” exhibitions have
                    been successfully established in London, Paris, and New York. Through the
                    influence of the South Kensington Museum and its affiliated schools of design
                    the knowledge of drawing is now becoming much more general in Great Britain than
                    it has ever been before. The preliminary difficulties of the art can scarcely be
                    overcome without the assistance of a master, but in his absence the student may
                    obtain useful help from books.</p>
                <p>The student should thoroughly master and remember Burnet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on the Education of the Eye,</hi> which is most concise, and contains
                    nothing doubtful or disputable. Mr Harding’s works, and Mr Ruskin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Drawing,</hi> are also useful books for amateurs,
                    especially if taken together. There are also various little treatises on
                    elementary technical practice, usually written by artists, and published by the
                    colour-makers, from which good practical hints may be obtained as to the use of
                    instruments and materials. It is not generally known in England that there is a
                    magnificent national collection of drawings by the old masters in the British
                    Museum, to which access may easily be obtained on compliance with a simple
                    formality. The student is earnestly recommended to avail himself of these
                    treasures, which are generally strangely neglected. A handbook to the Department
                    of Prints and Drawings, with an introduction and notices of the various schools
                    (Italian, German, Dutch and Flemish, Spanish, French, and English) has been
                    lately compiled by Mr Fagan, of the Museum, and published by Messrs Bell &amp;
                    Sons. A selection of drawings by the Italian masters in the British Museum has
                    been been lately published in autotype by Messrs Chatto &amp; Windus, with notes
                    by Mr Cornyns Carr, which, it is to be hoped, will be followed by selections
                    from other schools. It is much to be regretted that some portion, at least, of
                    these national treasures should not be made readily accessible to the general
                    public by framing them and exhibiting them under glass in a gallery, according
                    to the plan adopted in the Louvre. Their very existence is not so much as
                    suspected by the great majority even of cultivated Englishmen. (P. G. H.)</p>
