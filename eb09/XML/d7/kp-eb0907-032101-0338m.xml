                    but now extinct—the <hi rend="italic">Didus ineptus</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>Brief mention of this remarkable creature has already been made (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. ρ. 732), but some further particulars may
                    be welcome. The precise year in which the Portuguese discovered the island we
                    now know as Mauritius is undetermined; various dates from 1502 to 1545 having
                    been assigned. Mascaregnas, their leader, seems to have called it <hi
                    rend="italic">Cerne,</hi> from a notion that it must be the island of that name
                    mentioned by Pliny; but most authors have insisted that it was known to the
                    seamen of that nation as <hi rend="italic">llha do Cisne—</hi> perhaps but a
                    corruption of Cerne, and brought about by their finding it stocked with large
                    fowls, which, though not aquatic, they likened to Swans, the most familiar to
                    them of bulky birds. However, the experience of the Portuguese is unfortunately
                    lost to us, and nothing positive&lt;can be asserted of the island or its
                    inhabitants (none of whom, it should be observed, were human) until 1598, when
                    the Dutch, under Van Neck, arrived there and renamed it Mauritius. A narrative
                    of this voyage was published in 1601, if not earlier, and has been often
                    reprinted. Here we have birds spoken of as big as Swans or bigger, with large
                    heads, no wings, and a tail consisting of a few curly feathers. The Dutch called
                    them <hi rend="italic">Walghvögels</hi> (the word is variously spelled), <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> nauseous birds, because, as is said, no cooking made
                    them palatable; but another and perhaps better reason, for it was admitted that
                    their breast was tender, is also assigned, namely, that this island-paradise
                    afforded an abundance of superior fare. De Bry gives two admirably quaint prints
                    of the doings of the Hollanders, and in one of them the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Walclvvögel</hi> appears, being the earliest published representation of its
                    unwieldy form, with a footnote stating that the voyagers brought an example
                    alive to Holland. Among the company there was a draughtsman, and from a sketch
                    of his Clusius, a few years after, gave a figure of the bird, which he vaguely
                    called <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallinaceus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gallus</hi><hi rend="italic">peregrinus,”</hi> but described
                    rather fully. Meanwhile two other Dutch fleets had visited Mauritius. One of
                    them had rather an accomplished artist on board, and his drawings fortunately
                    still exist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is from

                    was subsequently published. This in the main corroborates what has been before
                    said of the birds, but adds the curious fact that they were now called by some
                    <hi rend="italic">Dodaarsen</hi> and by others <hi rend="italic"

                    investigation, but the former has been shown by Prof. Schlegel (Versl. en
                    Mededeel. K. Akad. Wetensch.ii. pp. 255 <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi

                <p>Henceforth Dutch narrators, though several times mentioning the bird, fail to
                    supply any important fact in its history. Their navigators, however, were pot
                    idle, and found work for their naturalists and painters. Clusius says that in
                    1605 he saw at Pauw’s House in Leyden a Dodo’s foot,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>What has become of the specimen (which may
                    have been a relic of the bird brought home by Van Neck’s squadron) is not known.
                    Broderip and the late Dr Gray have suggested its identity with that row in the
                    British Museum, but on what grounds is not apparent.</p></note> which he
                    minutely describes. Of late years a copy of Clusius’s work has been discovered
                    in the high school of Utrecht, in which is pasted an original drawing by Van de
                    Venne superscribed “Vera effigies huius avis <hi rend="italic">Walghvogel</hi>
                    (quae &amp; a nautis <hi rend="italic">Dodaers</hi> propter faedam posterioris

                    Mauritii. Anno M.DC.XXVI.” Now a good many paintings of the Dodo by a celebrated
                    artist named Roelandt Savery, who was born at Courtray in 1576 and died in 1639,
                    have long been known, and it has always been understood that these were drawn
                    from the life. Proof, however, of the limning of a living Dodo in Holland at
                    that period had hitherto been wanting. There can now be no longer any doubt of
                    the fact; and the paintings by this artist of the Dodo at Berlin and
                    Vienna—dated respectively 1626 and 1628—as well as the picture by Goiemare,
                    belonging to the Duke of Northumberland, at Sion House, dated 1627, may be with
                    greater plausibility than ever considered portraits of a captive bird. It is
                    even probable that this was not the first example which had sat to a painter in
                    Europe. In the private library of the late Emperor Francis of Austria is a
                    series of pictures of various animals, supposed to be by the Dutch artist
                    Hoefnagel, who was born about 1545. One of these represents a Dodo, and, if
                    there be no mistake in Von Frauenfeld’s ascription, it must almost certainly
                    have been painted before 1626, while there is reason to think that the original
                    may have been kept in the <hi rend="italic">vivarium</hi> of the then Emperor
                    Rudolf IL, and that the portion of a Dodo’s head, which was found in the Museum
                    at Prague about 1850, belonged to this example. The other pictures by Roelandt
                    Savery, of which may be mentioned that at the Hague, that in the possession of
                    the Zoological Society of London (formerly Eroderip’s), that in the Schönborn
                    collection at Pommersfelden near Bamberg, and that belonging to Dr Seyffery at
                    Stuttgart are undated, but were probably all painted about the same time <hi
                    rend="italic">{viz.</hi> 1626 to 1628). The large picture in the British Museum,
                    once belonging to Sir Hans Sloane, by an unknown artist, but supposed to be by
                    Roelandt Savery, is also undated; while the still larger one at Oxford
                    (considered to be by the younger Savery) bears a much later date, 1651. Undated
                    also is a picture said to be by Pieter Holsteyn, and in the possession of Dr A.
                    van der Willige at Haarlem in Holland.</p>
                <p>In 1628 we have the evidence of the first English observer of the bird—one
                    Emanuel Altham, who mentions it in two letters written on the same day from
                    Mauritius to his brother at home. These have only of late, through the
                    intervention of Dr Wilmot, been brought to light.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi> 1874,

                <p>which I had at the Hand Mauritius called by ye portingalls a Do Do: which for the
                    rareness thereof I hope wilbe welcome to you.” The passage in the other letter
                    is to the same effect, with the addition of the words “if it line.” Nothing more
                    is known of this valuable consignment. In the same fleet with Altham sailed
                    Herbert, whose <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> ran through several editions and
                    have been long quoted. It is plain that he could not have reached Mauritius till
                    1629, though 1627 has been usually assigned as the date of his visit. The
                    fullest account he gives of the bird is in his edition of 1638, and in the
                    curiously affected style of many writers of the period. It will be enough to
                    quote the beginning: “The Dodo comes first to a description: here, and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dygarrois</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (wer’t in Arabia :) ”—the rest of the passage is entertaining, but the whole has
                    been often reprinted. Herbert, it may be remarked, when he could see a possible
                    Cymric similarity, <pb break="no"

                    statement, corroborated as it is by Altham, cannot be set aside, and hence we do
                    not hesitate to assign a Portuguese derivation for the word.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence we venture to dispute
                    Prof. Schlegel’s supposed origin of “Dodo.” The Portuguese must have been the
                    prior nomenclatore, and if, as is most likely, some of their nation, or men
                    acquainted with their language, were employed to pilot the Hollanders, we see at
                    once how the first Dutch name <hi rend="italic">Wa,lghυogel</hi> would give way.

                    itself.</p></note> Herbert also gave a figure of the bird.</p>
                <p>Proceeding chronologically we next come upon a curious bit of evidence. This is
                    contained in a MS. diary kept between 1626 and 1640 by Thomas Crossfield of
                    Queen’s College, Oxford, where, under the year 1634&gt; mention is casually made
                    of one Mr Gosling “who bestowed the Dodar (ablacke Indian bird) vpon ye Anatomy
                    school.” Nothing more is known of it. About 1638, Sir Hamon Lestrange tells us,
                    as he walked London streets he saw the picture of a strange fowl hung out on a
                    cloth canvas, and going in to see it found a great bird kept in a chamber
                    “somewhat bigger than the largest Tuxky cock, and so legged and footed, but
                    shorter and thicker.” The keeper called it a Dodo and shewed the visitors how
                    his captive would swallow “large peble stones as bigge as nutmegs.”</p>
                <p>In 1651 Morisot published an account of a voyage made by François Cauche, who
                    professed to have passed fifteen days in Mauritius, or “Γisle de Saincte
                    Apollonie,” as he called it, in 1638. According to De Flacourtthe narrative is
                    not very trustworthy, and indeed certain statements are obviously inaccurate.
                    Cauche says he saw there birds bigger than Swans, which he describes so as to
                    leave no doubt of his meaning Dodos; but perhaps the most important facts (if
                    they be facts) that he relates are that they had a cry like a Gosling (“il a un
                    cry comme l’oison ”), and that they laid a single white egg, “gros comme un pain
                    d’un sol,” on a mass of grass in the forests. He calls them “oiseaux de
                    Nazaret,” perhaps, as a marginal note informs us, from an island of that name
                    which was then supposed to lie more to the northward, but is now known to have
                    no existence.</p>
                <p>In the catalogue of Tradescant’s <hi rend="italic">Collection of Rarities,
                    preserved at South Lambeth,</hi> published in 1656, we have entered among the
                    “Whole Birds” a “Dodar from the island <hi rend="italic">Mauritius;</hi> it is
                    not able to flie being so big.” This specimen may well have been the skin of the
                    bird seen by Lestrange some eighteen years before, but anyhow we are able to
                    trace the specimen through Willughby, Lhwyd, and Hyde, till it passed in or
                    before 1684 to theAshmolean collection at Oxford. In 1755 it was ordered to be
                    destroyed, but, in accordance with the original orders of Ashmole, its head and
                    right foot were preserved, and still ornament the Museum of that University. In
                    the second edition of a <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of many Natural
                    Rarities,</hi> &lt;fcc., to be seen at the place formerly called the Music
                    House, near the West End of St Paul’s Church, collected by one Hubert <hi
                    rend="italic">alias</hi> Forbes, and published in 1665, mention is made of a
                    “legge of a Dodo, a great heavy bird that cannot fly; it is a Bird of the
                    Mauricius Island.” This is supposed to have subsequently passed into the
                    possession of the Royal Society. At all events such a specimen is included in
                    Grew’s list of their treasures which was published in 1681. This was afterwards
                    transferred to the British Museum, where it still reposes. As may be seen it is
                    a left foot, without the integuments, but it differs sufficiently in size from
                    the Oxford specimen to forbid its having been part of the same individual. In
                    1666 Olearius brought out the <hi rend="italic">Gottorffisches Kunst
                    Kammer,</hi> wherein he describes the head of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Walghvogel,</hi> which some sixty years later was removed to the Museum at
                    Copenhagen, and is now preserved there, having been the means of first leading
                    zoologists, under the guidance of Prof. Reinhardt, to recognize the true
                    affinities of the bird.</p>
                <p>Little more remains to be told. For brevity’s sake we have passed over all but
                    the principal narratives of voyagers or other notices of the bird. A compendious
                    bibliography, up to the year 1848, will be found in Strickland’s classical

                    This shows its survival till 1681, but the writer’s sole remark upon it is that
                    its “fflesh is very hard.” The successive occupation of the island by different
                    masters seems to have destroyed every tradition relating to the bird, and doubts
                    began to arise whether such a creature had ever existed. Duncan, in 1828, shewed
                    how ill-founded these doubts were, and some ten years latet Broderip with much
                    diligence collected all the available evidence into an admirable essay, which in
                    its turn was succeeded by Strickland’s monograph just mentioned. But in the
                    meanwhile little was done towards obtaining any material advance in our
                    knowledge, Prof. Reinhardt’s determination of its affinity to the Pigeons <hi
                    rend="italic">fColumbcfi)</hi> excepted; and it was hardly until Clark’s
                    discovery in 1865 <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 732) of a large
                    number of Dodos’ remains, that zoologists generally were prepared to accept that
                    affinity without question. The examination of bone after bone by Prof. Owen and
                    others confirmed the judgment of the Danish naturalist, and there is now no
                    possibility of any different view being successfully maintained.</p>
                <p>The causes which led to the extirpation of this ponderous Pigeon have been
                    discussed in a former article, and nothing new can be added on that branch of
                    the subject; but it will be remembered that the Dodo does not stand alone in its
                    fate, and that two more or less nearly allied birds inhabiting the sister
                    islands of Réunion and Rodriguez have in like manner disappeared from the face
                    of the earth. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
