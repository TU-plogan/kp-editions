                    is said, having been able to prolong their submarine descents for periods
                    varying from two to three minutes. It is obvious, however, that not having the
                    aid of any artificial appliances for supplying air, the powers of these bold
                    adventurers, both as regards the depth to which they could descend and the
                    length of time they could remain submerged, were comparatively limited.</p>
                <p>At an early period, therefore, the attention of philosophers and mechanics was
                    turned to the discovery of a contrivance for aiding the diver in prosecuting his
                    daring but useful calling, which was rendered all the more important from its
                    being no longer confined to the acquisition of Eastern luxuries, but to the
                    raising of treasure from sunken vessels. It is not considered expedient to
                    occupy space by further reference to the feats of the early divers, out rather
                    to pass at once to the history and construction of the diving apparatus of
                    modern times, as illustrated by the Diving Bell and the Diving Dress at present
                    in use. And here it may be stated that in addition to the sponge and coral trade
                    of foreign lands, which has been greatly advanced by the use of modern
                    appliances, there are the works of the naval engineer, and more particularly of
                    the civil engineer, in which diving apparatus is so extensively employed and so
                    essentially necessary as to place the art of diving on a wider basis, and to
                    give it an importance only fully developed within the present century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diving Bell.—</hi> The most useful of ancient contrivances is
                    the diving bell, which, introduced at an early period and gradually improved, is
                    now the well-known apparatus used by engineers in the present day; and it may be
                    interesting to trace the successive improvements that have brought it to its
                    present state of perfection and usefulness in conducting submarine works.</p>
                <p>The conception of the diving bell is very simple. The air contained in an
                    inverted jar sunk in a vessel of water excludes the water from the interior, and
                    if the vessel be made of sufficient size to contain persons within it, it may be
                    sunk without their being wetted, and they may continue to be submerged so long
                    as the air within the bell continues pure enough to support animation. Such were
                    the “divingchests” of the first makers, which, though they differed in form and
                    details, were constructed on the same principle as the modern bell, and were
                    generally formed of wood, girded with iron hoops, like a barrel.</p>
                <p>It will be obvious that if such a vessel were submerged in shallow water, having
                    a depth of say one foot of water, a large supply of air would be inclosed in the
                    bell, and the bottom on which it rested would, from the small depth of water
                    upon it, be easily reached for any operation to be performed on it. But if we
                    conceive the same bell to be lowered further below the surface, the air being
                    compressible will be reduced in volume, and the water will rise ir. the bell to
                    fill its place. The result would be that at the depth of about 33 feet the air
                    would be compressed into about one-half its original bulk, and the bell itself
                    would be half filled with water; and the bottom of the sea on which it rested
                    would no longer be so conveniently reached as when the water was only a few
                    inches above the lips of the bell. Moreover, the air by repeated inspiration
                    becomes unfit to support life, and the ancient bells had to be raised to the
                    surface at very short intervals of time that fresh air might be supplied to the
                    men employed. Although, therefore, the <hi rend="italic">original</hi> diving
                    bell was a step towards the perfect appliances afterwards introduced, it will
                    readily be seen that its use in diving operations was very limited indeed.</p>
                <p>Dr Halley, the secretary of the Royal Society, who seems to have taken an
                    interest in diving and divers, and compassionated their want υf fresh air,
                    communicated a paper to the Royal Society in which, to use his own words, he
                    proposes a plan “for carrying the <hi rend="italic">pabulum vitae</hi> down to
                    the divers, who must without being supplied therewith return very soon to the
                    surface or’ perish.” The following is the description of his arrangements for
                    this purpose. After describing the bell itself, which was of wood of the form of
                    a truncated cone, with a capacity of 60 cubic feet, and was suspended by a sprit
                    from the mast of a ship, he says—</p>
                <p>“To supply air to this bell when under water, I caused a couple of barrels, of
                    about 36 gallons each, to be cased with lead, so as to sink empty, each of them
                    having a bung-hole in its lowest parts to let in the water, as the air in them
                    condensed on their descent, and to let it out again when they were drawn up full
                    from below. And to a hole in the uppermost part of these barrels I fixed a
                    leathern hose, long enough to fall below the bung-hole, being kept down by a
                    weight appended, so that the air in the upper part of the barrels could not
                    escape, unless the lower ends of these hose were first lifted up.</p>
                <p>“The air-barrels being thus prepared, I fitted them with tackle proper to make
                    them rise and fall alternately, after the manner of two buckets in a well; and
                    in their descent they were directed by lines fastened to the under edge of the
                    bell, which passed through rings on both sides of the leathern hose in each
                    barrel, so that, sliding doλvn by these lines, they came readily to the hand of
                    a man, who stood on purpose to receive them, and to take up the ends of the hose
                    into the bell. Through these hose, as soon as their ends came above the surface
                    of the water in the barrels, all the air that was included in the upper parts of
                    them was blown with great force into the bell, whilst the water entered at the
                    bung-holes below and filled them, and as soon as the air of one barrel had been
                    thus received, upon a signal given that was drawn up, and at the same time the
                    other descended, and, by an alternate succession, furnished air so quick, and in
                    so great plenty, that I myself have been one of five who have been together at
                    the bottom, in nine to ten fathoms water, for above an hour and a half at a
                    time, without any sort of ill consequence, and I might have continued there so
                    long as I pleased, for anything that appeared to the contrary. I only observed
                    that it was necessary to be let down gradually at first, at about 12 feet at a
                    time; and then to stop and drive out the air that entered, by receiving 3 or 4
                    barrels of fresh air before I descended further. But being arrived at the depth
                    designed, I then let out as much of the hot air that had been breathed as each
                    barrel would replenish with cool, by means of the cock at the top of the bell,
                    through whose aperture, though very small, the air would rush with so much
                    violence as to make the surface of the sea boil, and to cover it with a white
                    foam, notwithstanding the weight of the water over us.</p>
                <p>“Thus I found that I could do anything that required to be done just under us,
                    and that I could, for a space as wide as the circuit of the bell, lay the bottom
                    of the sea so far dry, as not to be over <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n312/mode/1up"

                    light was transmitted, that when the sea was clear, and especially when the sun
                    shone, I could see perfectly well to write or read, much more to fasten or lay
                    hold on anything under us that was to be taken up; and, by the return of the air
                    barrels, I often sent up orders, written w ith an iron pen on small plates of
                    lead, directing how to move up from place to place as occasion required. At
                    other times when the air was troubled and thick, it would be as dark as night
                    below; but in such cases I have been able to keep a candle burning in the beÚ as
                    long as I pleased, notwithstanding the great expense of air necessarv to
                    maintain flame. This I take to be an invention applicable to various uses, such
                    as fishing for pearls, diving for coral or sponges and the like, in far greater
                    depths than has hitherto been thought possible; also for the fitting and placing
                    of the foundations of moles, bridges, &amp;c., in rocky bottoms, and for
                    cleaning and scrubbing of ships’ bottoms when foul, in cairn weather at sea. I
                    shall only intimate that, by an additional contrivance, I have found it not
                    impracticable for a diver to go out of an engine, to a good distance from it,
                    the air being conveyed to him with a continued stream by small flexible pipes;
                    which pipes may serve as a clue to direct him back again when he would return to
                    the belh”</p>
                <p>Such is an account of Dr Halley’s apparatus, which undoubtedly effected an
                    important improvement; but it involved the sending down of constant relays of
                    air vessels, and the great loss of time and interruption which attended such a
                    means of supply. It remained for Smeaton to overcome these objections. In
                    repairing the shoeing of the foundations of Hexham Bridge, in 1778, there being
                    but a small depth of water, to work in, he contrived a bell to the top of which
                    he attached a force pump in lieu of Dr Halley’s air-barrels, and as the bell, in
                    consequence of the small depth of water, did not require to be wholly submerged,
                    the supply of air for the divers was forced directly into the bell, being the
                    first application of the force pump for that purpose. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> Subsequently to this, in 1748, having occasion to remove stones in
                    clearing the foundations for a pier at Ramsgate, he applied an air-pump placed
                    in a ship or barge, and pumped air into the bell at any depth under water by
                    means of a hose screwed into an air-hole in the top of the bell. The following
                    is Smeaton’s description of his last improvement :—</p>
                <p>“Instead of the usual form of a bell, or of a conical tub of wood sunk by weights
                    (externally applied), this for convenience was a square chest of cast iron,
                    which being 50 cwts. was heavy enough to sink itself, and being 4⅛ feet in
                    height, 4⅜ feet in length, and 3 feet wide, afforded room sufficient for two men
                    at a time to work under it. But it was <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> to this
                    machine that the men therein were supplied with a constant influx of fresh air
                    without any attention of theirs, that necessary article being amply supplied by
                    <hi rend="italic">»forcing air-pump</hi> in a boat upon the water’s surface.”
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi></p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that Smeaton’s Ramsgate bell contained all the elements of
                    the present appliances, which, as improved in details, and constructed by Messrs
                    Rennie, has been so extensively employed in harbour works.</p>
                <p>The bell as now used is shown in plan and section in figs. 1 and 2. It is a
                    cast-iron chest weighing about 5 tons, and is suspended by block and tackle.</p>
                <p>On the top of the bell there are 8 apertures α, fitted with very thick glass for
                    admitting light; and in the centre is the passage δ, into which the hose is
                    screwed for admitting the air supply. The interior is fitted with two seats <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> which can be removed to make room when the men are at
                    work; and in the centre is a lifting chain <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> to which
                    stones are attached to facilitate their being lifted and properly adjusted to
                    the beds on which they are to be laid. The bell is used according to two
                    different systems, depending on the nature of the work to be performed. In
                    building masonry under water it is suspended from a staging of timber, but in
                    excavating rock or removing boulders, scattered over a considerable area, where
                    a staging would be inapplicable, it is suspended from a barge or lighter.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3 shows the arrangement as employed in laying Bell-stones or blocks of
                    concrete. It represents a cross section staging, of the staging, bell framing,
                    and bell carriage, in which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the staging, δ

                    the whole breadth of the pier. The stones <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> are brought

                <p>motion at right angles across the work, so that the position of the bell· can be
                    altered with the greatest ease so as to bring it over any spot within the area
                    of the staging.</p>
                <p>In proceeding to work, the men take their seats in the bell from a boat, and the
                    bell is then lowered to the required depth. If the work be that of building a
                    wall a stone is lowered at the same time. The changes in the position of the
                    bell are all made according to signs given by the divers by strokes of a hammer
                    on the bell, which experience has shown can be heard at any depth at which the
                    diving bell has been employed. The signals are— <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    stroke, more air; <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> hold on; <hi rend="italic"
                    >three,</hi> raise; <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> lower <hi rend="italic"
                    >∙,five,</hi> north; <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> south; <hi rend="italic"
                    >seven,</hi> east; <hi rend="italic">eight,</hi> west. These signals are
                    narrowly observed by a watchman stationed in a boat, and reported to the men
                    working the bell carriage. The rule for the supply of air both to the bell and
                    diving dress is to give it so freely that there shall be a constant escape of
                    air rising to the surface in air-bubbles all the time the men are under water.
                    After being lowered, the bell is first moved over the stone to be laid; the
                    divers then unhook the lowering chain from the lewis in the stone, and at the
                    same time make fast the stone to the tackle within the bell, which is at once
                    signalled to be raised, andL carries the stone with it. The bell is then moved
                    over the site on which it is to be placed; it is then lowered until it has
                    nearly reached its bed, on which it is finally deposited. The lewis is then
                    removed and the bell raised for another stone; and with trained workmen it is
                    surprising how expeditiously the bell is moved from place to place, and stone
                    after stone is built in the walls. The staff of men required to work the bell is
                    two divers, one watchman, four men working the air-pump, and four working the
                    bell carriage, besides the men required to bring forward and send down the
                    stones. The men engaged generally work in shifts of from 3 to 6 hours according
                    to the depth, and the diving work may be continued as long as in ordinary
                    day-work, as in clear water the light is good to the greatest depth at which the
                    bell is used in harbour building.</p>
                <p>When engaged in blasting, the bore is made in the ordinary way, and charged with
                    a shot inclosed in a water-tight canvas case, to which is attached a length of 6
                    or 8 feet of patent fuse. The bell is then moved from above the bore, and the
                    fuse ignited, and when the shot is fired the smoke rises to the surface clear of
                    the bell.</p>
                <p>When employed for removing rock or boulder stones—for example, in a river

                    transported, and in that case it is swung from a barge or lighter, which
                    contains the machinery for w orking the bell and air-pumps, and a crane for
                    raising tħe boulders as the divers sling them. It is of course attended with
                    greater trouble and risk to the divers to work the bell from a lighter than from
                    a stage; but, on the other hand, the convenience in being enabled to trans port
                    it from place to place, in a river navigation, is a great advantage.</p>

                <p>The large cost of a diving bell limits its use to works of magnitudo, especially
                    as many submarine works can be done better by the diving dress, which is much
                    less expensive; but there are certain operations, such as the clearing and
                    levelling of foundations, for which the bell is peculiarly well adapted, that
                    still enable it to take its place as one of the most useful appliances of the
                    marine engineer. Mr B. B. Stoney has, in an interesting paper in the <hi

                    with which he successfully built the foundation of the quays of Dublin. Mr
                    Stoney’s apparatus does not come under the article diving, but belongs more
                    properly to the subject of the compressed air cylinders used in bridge building,

                    rend="italic">Diving Dress.—</hi> The diving dress is peculiarly well fitted for
                    such worksas the repair or overhaul of rollers and sluices of lock-gates,
                    cleaning or repairing ships’ bottoms, descending into the hatches of wrecks to
                    recover property, and, in short, everything that cannot be done from the
                    interior of a bell. The inexpensiveness also of the diving dress, dispensing
                    with all costly staging, and its ease of transport and appliance, are much in
                    favour of its use. It is, indeed, so convenient in the repair of propellers,
                    examining ships’ bottoms, recovering anchors, &lt;fcc., that all ships in Her
                    Majesty’s navy of sufficient size to be commanded by captains are now supplied
                    with a diving dress or apparatus, and bear a certain number of divers in their
                    complements; and all sea-going flagships and iron clads on foreign stations
                    carry two sets of diving apparatus, and are allowed a suitable number of trained
                    divers.</p>
                <p>The invention of the diving dress, like that of most useful appliances, was
                    gradual, and the work of many minds. Some early proposals, such as that already
                    referred to in the quotation from Dr Halley’s paper in 1721, and others of more
                    modern date, were made for providing the diver with a dress to enable him with
                    safety to carry on his work, for an account of which the reader is referred to a
                    paper by Mr J. W. Heinke in the <hi rend="italic">Minutes of Proceedings of the
                    Institution of Civil Engineers.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Vol. xv. p. 309.</p></note> But to Mr A. Siebe is due the
                    credit of being the first to introduce a dress which was supplied with a
                    constant stream of fresh air, and may be said to have been the precursor of the
                    dress now in use. We allude to what was called the “open dress” invented in
                    1829, which consisted of a helmet and waterproof jacket, under which, and
                    fitting more closely to the body, were worn trousers reaching to the arm pits,
                    and between the jacket and trousers the air pumped in at the helmet was allowed
                    to force its way and escape to the surface as in the diving bell, and hence it
                    was called “open.” Although some divers of the old school are said still to give
                    a preference to the open dress, its danger became manifest; for if a diver
                    stumbled and fell on his face or side, the water entered his dress, and unless
                    quickly brought to the surface he was in danger of being drowned —a necessary
                    requirement of the open dress being that he should remain in an upright or
                    gently stooping position. To meet this defect, Mr Siebe, in 1837, introduced the
                    “close” dress, which is now almost universally used. Various minor improvements
                    were introduced between 1839 and 1843 connected with the removal of the wreck of
                    the “Royal George” ship of war, conducted by the late Sir Charles Pasley, which
                    will be found fully described in the <hi rend="italic">Minutes of Proceedings of
                    the Institution of Civil Engineers.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Vol. xv. p. 328.</p></note> The long continued experience
                    gained in diving while these operations were in progress suggested improvements
                    and alterations which had a great effect in bringing the diving dresss to its
                    present perfection as now manufactured by Siebe, Heinke, Barnett, and other
                    makers.</p>
                <p>The diving dress, as will be understoood from fig. G, envelops the whole body of
                    the diver, the upper portion <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being the “helmet,” the
                    intermediate portion <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the “breast-plate,” and the lower
                    portion <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the “dress.” The hose by which the air is
                    supplied is shown at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is
                    the “life” or “signal” line, which is attached to the diver’s waist, and by
                    which he makes signals and is hauled to the surface.</p>
                <p>The water-proof material of which the dress is made is very generally sheet
                    indiarubber covered on both sides with tanned twill to protect the india rubber
                    from injury. The cuffs fit tightly round the wrists, leaving the hands free, and
                    india-rubber bands slipped over them render the joint water-tight. The
                    breastplate <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is made of tinned copper with an outer edge
                    of brass, which has screws fitted to it projecting upwards and passing through
                    corresponding holes in the collar of the dress. On the top of this, and with
                    holes in it corresponding to the screws^ four pieces of a metal band are firmly
                    screwed down by wing nuts, nipping the soft material of the collar between the
                    metal of the breast-plate and band, and thus ensuring a water-tight joint. On
                    the front of the breastplate two studs are fastened for securing the back and
                    front weights <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Some makers put a valve <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> on the front of the breast-plate, by means of which the
                    diver can regulate the pressure inside his dress at will, and in this way has
                    the power, by simply inflating his dress more or less, of making himself of any
                    specific gravity, so as to float at any desired depth or rise to the surface
                    without the assistance of the attendant. This arrangement in the hands of a
                    skilled diver is undoubtedly a great convenience. But it is still a matter of
                    difference of opinion whether it is not safer to trust to being hauled up by the
                    watchman on the surface, whose duty it is to hold the <hi rend="italic"
                    >life</hi> or <hi rend="italic">signal</hi> line in one hand, and the air hose
                    in the other, while the diver is at work, and to attend to whatever signal he
                    may give by pulling the life line. The inconvenience of the air bubbling up in
                    front of the bulls’ eyes, and the danger of inexperienced divers becoming giddy
                    and turning the valve the wrong way, have induced some makers to do away with
                    this useful valve, and to substitute at the back of the helmet a valve which the
                    diver can regulate by the pressure of his hand, but which rights itself the
                    moment his hand is removed. The neck of the breast-plate is fitted with a
                    “segmental screw bayonet joint” (introduced by Messrs Siebe), and to this the
                    helmet, the neck of which is fitted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n315/mode/1up"

                    removed by one eighth of a turn. The helmet, a side view of which is given in
                    fig. 7, is made of tinned copper, and fitted in front with three strong
                    plate-glass windows, or bulls’ eyes, in brass frames protected with guards.</p>
                <p>Messrs Heinke introduced sliding covers to draw over these windows in case of
                    their getting broken. The front eye piece is made so that it can be unscrewed,
                    and in this way the diver on ascending can rest himself for a short
                    timeorgiveordeιs without removing the rest of his dress. Messrs Barnett have
                    introduced instead of this a hinged glazed frame, which fits tightly into a
                    conical vulcanized india-rubber seat like the ordinary port hole of a ship, so
                    that it can be ’ opened by the diver himself the moment his head is above water,
                    and being attached to the helmet it cannot be dropped accidentally into the sea
                    or otherwise mislaid. An outlet valve <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is fixed at the
                    back of the helmet, which, opening outwards, permits the escape of the foul air
                    but prevents the entrance of water. The inlet valve <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to
                    which the hose is attached is also fixed at the back of the helmet, and is so
                    constructed as freely to admit the air from the force ρumρ; but should anything
                    occur to the hose or pumps the valve at once shuts, inclosing a sufficient
                    supply of air in the dress to support the diver till he can be hauled to the
                    surface. The air after entering by the inlet valve is conducted in tubes <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> to the front of the helmet, so that the diver has the
                    advantage of inhaling fresh air, and the front glasses are kept free from the
                    condensation of his breath which would otherwise take place. On each side of the
                    helmet is a hook over which the cords pass which carry the front and back
                    weights, and a brass stud to one of which the life line, and to the other the
                    air tube, are attached; <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the
                    joint by which the helmet is screwed upon the breast-plate. The back and front
                    weights weigh about 40 lb each, and are held close to the diver’s body by means
                    of a lashing passing under his arm-pits. The boots are made of stout leather,
                    with leaden soles, secured by two buckles and straps, each boot weighing about
                    20 5&gt;.</p>
                <p>The cost of a diving dress, with all its appliances, is about £140.</p>
                <p>The sponge, pearl, and coral fisheries, originally carried on only by naked
                    divers, as already noticed, are now conducted to a great extent by the help of
                    artificial aids; and, according to Mr Siebe, upwards of 300 sets of diving
                    dresses are employed in the Mediterranean sponge fisheries alone, and they are
                    being introduced in the Bahamas, Bermudas, Ceylon, the West Indian Islands, and
                    on the coast of Australia.</p>
                <p>As already stated, at moderate depths not exceeding 30 to 40 feet, and with clear
                    water, sufficient light is transmitted to enable the diver to perform any
                    ordinary work, and in working in turbid water with the diving bell candles are
                    employed. Air Siebe has also constructed an electric lamp and an oil lamp which
                    can be employed where light requires to be used by divers at great depths.</p>

                    Captain James B. Eads to the President and Directors of the Illinois and St
                    Louis Bridge Company.</p></note> states that at the Mississippi bridge candles
                    were at first employed, which, under a pressure of 100 feet, were found to be
                    burnt down in about three-fifths of the time required in the open air; under a
                    pressure of 80 feet it was found that a candle if blown out by the breath would
                    immediately reignite; and at the depth of 108∣ feet a candle was blown out
                    thirteen consecutive times in the course of half a minute, and each time
                    excepting the last was reignited.</p>
                <p>The depth at which diving can be safely conducted is a question of importance.
                    The ordinary depth at which the diving bell has been employed in harbour works
                    is from 30 to 35 feet, and it has been used in 60 feet at Dover.</p>
                <p>With the diving dress much greater depths have been attained. Mr Siebe relates
                    that in removing the cargo of the ship “Cape Horn,” wrecked off the coast of
                    South America, a diver named Hooper made 7 descents to a depth of 201 feet, and
                    at one time remained 42 minutes, supposed to be the greatest diving feat ever
                    achieved. Μ. Frendenberg states that in the repair of a pump in the Scharley
                    zinc mines in Silesia two divers went down the pump well to a depth of 85 feet,
                    remaining from periods varying from 15 minutes to two hours.<note

                    the knowledge of the author the greatest depth at which the diving dress was
                    used in the open sea was in the Firth of Forth. A Royal Commission “on the
                    Operation of the Acts relating to the Trawling for Herring on the Coast of
                    Scotland” resolved to obtain the herring spawn from various portions of the
                    exposed parts of the firth, and this duty was successfully accomplished in
                    depths of from 14 to 16 fathoms, from the deck of the “Princess Royal” cutter,
                    under the command of Mr Macdonald.</p>
                <p>The writer is indebted to Mr P. J. Messent, the engineer of the Tyne piers, for
                    the following notes of his experience at that work. “On the Tyne Pier works
                    helmet and bell divers are employed simultaneously—the former for excavating for
                    and fixing the feet of the piles of which the staging is formed, the bell divers
                    for levelling the foundations and fixing the blocks of which the pier is
                    composed. The helmet diver has greatest power in lifting. He can exert but a few
                    pounds of force in pulling downwards (unless he can fasten himself down) on
                    account of his buoyancy, and for the same reason he cannot pull or push
                    horizontally with much force unless he has a fulcrum or stop for his feet or
                    body. Thus, in boring an augur hole in a pile he would have to lash himself to
                    it, unless there was a projecting rock or stone that he could get his foot
                    against. In the use of a hammer and other tools for striking he is restricted by
                    the water,” but Mr Messent has known good men do fair work with a hammer and
                    chisel. It is difficult forthem to walk against even a moderate tide, and men
                    who by accident get on the (lee) tide side of their work, generally have to be
                    hauled up to their boat and lowered down again in order to get on the (windward)
                    tideward side of it; again experience enables many of these difficulties to be
                    met or modified, but it is advantageous to bear them in mind in arranging work
                    for divers. Most of the divers at the Tyne have been made or instructed on the
                    works, and of the men who have tried helmet diving not more than one out of
                    three or four succeed or become divers, the failure being sometimes from
                    physical causes, but more often from <hi rend="italic">want of head.</hi> There
                    is less difficulty in making bell-divers, probably on account of their working
                    in company, there being always two men in a bell, and the same amount of
                    self-reliance is not needed.</p>

                <p>The practice of diving obliges the diver to conduct his work under a pressure
                    greater than that of the atmosphere at the surface of the earth. All diving work
                    is done under an abnormal atmospheric pressure, which increases with the depth
                    at which the diver is submerged in water. This pressure, when he is submerged to
                    the depth of 33 feet, is twice that of the normal superficial atmospheric
                    pressure. At greater depths the pressure is proportionately increased, and
                    ultimately becomes so great that life could not be maintained. To descend even
                    to the moderate depth of 30 or 40 feet, which is about the maximum required for
                    ordinary engineering sea works, demands some practice and nerve on the part of
                    the diver, but when greater depths have to be explored, in raising sunk vessels,
                    for example, the energy and power of endurance of the diver are much more
                    severely taxed, and it seems not uninteresting, before concluding this article,
                    to refer to the effect which the work has on the health of the diver, as well as
                    on some physiological facts of interest in general science.</p>
                <p>The sensations experienced in a diving bell are common, it is believed, to all
                    divers. According to the writer’s experience, very soon after the lips of the
                    bell have touched the surface of the water pain is felt in the ears and above
                    the eyes, which continues with greater or less intensity according to the rate
                    of descent until the bell has attained the bottom. So long as the bell continues
                    <hi rend="italic">there</hi> no pain is felt, the only feeling being that of
                    depression due to the depth to which the diver is submerged. As soon as the
                    upward movement commences the pain in the ears and above the eyes returns, and
                    continues till the surface is reached. The motion of the bell is very gradua],
                    sometimes not exceeding 3 feet per minute, but even at that slow rate the head
                    does not accommodate itself to the increase of pressure so as to avoid
                    inconvenience. Aeronauts do not suffer to the same extent in their ascents in
                    balloons, because the alteration of pressure is much more gradual in passing
                    through the atmosphere than through a medium having the density of water.</p>
                <p>Several suggestions have been offered as accounting for the sensations which are
                    experienced in diving, and the following explanation, which the author has
                    submitted to Professor Turner of Edinburgh, is believed to afford the true
                    solution.</p>
                <p>Under the ordinary atmospheric conditions, the air presses not only on the
                    surface of the body, but into every cavity within the body which communicates
                    with the surface, so that the pressure, both externally and internally, is
                    exactly balanced. In passing into a denser atmosphere the increased pressure
                    operates externally more rapidly than it does internally, more especially if the
                    communication of the internal cavities with the surface is by tortuous passages;
                    and so long as this inequality in the pressure exists the disagreeable
                    sensations in the ears and above the eyes will continue. The pain in the ears
                    arises from the effect of the condensed air acting externally on the tympanic
                    membrane of the ear, before the air within the tympanic cavity has acquired the
                    same density to counterbalance it. The tympanic membrane stretches across the
                    bottom of the passage or meatus, which leads from the outer ear into the side of
                    the head (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> fig. 80.) This passage is in
                    direct communication with the atmosphere, the pressure of which, therefore, acts
                    instantaneously on the tympanic membrane. But on its inside the tympanic
                    membrane bounds the tympanic cavity, which has no communcation with the external
                    air, excepting by the Eustachian tube, which leads from the cavity into the
                    pharynx immediately behind the nose. Through this tube, therefore, the condensed
                    air must pass from the pharynx to supply what is necessary within the cavity for
                    restoring the same equilibrium within and without. But the Eustachian tube is a
                    long and narrow passage; at its commencement in the ear it has a bony structure,
                    but towards its termination in the pharynx behind the nostrils, it becomes soft,
                    so that its walls can be forced together. It admits an easy passage from the ear
                    to the pharynx; but when any pressure arises in the opposite direction, it acts
                    in some degree like a valve, shutting the passage, until the increasing pressure
                    again forces it open. Some time then elapses before all this can be
                    accomplished; and during this time the external air, pressing with full force on
                    the tympanic membrane, produces the pain which is felt. When the Eustachian tube
                    opens, it is generally all of a sudden, and with a slight explosion or pop,
                    which is followed by instant relief from the pain. This relief may often be
                    produced by filling the mouth, or gulping the air and passing it into the
                    tube.</p>
                <p>That the above is what really takes place may be shown experimentally by shutting
                    the mouth and nostrils, and exhausting the air from them by the action of the
                    lungs. The air in the tympanic cavity immediately rushing through the Eustachian
                    tube into the mouth, the external air acts on the tympanic membrane and produces
                    a slight sensation of deafness, such as is felt in the bell. But if, instead of
                    exhausting the air, we attempt to compress it, and force it through the tube
                    into the tympanic cavity, at first no effect is produced; but after exerting a
                    considerable pressure a slight pop is felt, and a little pain in the ear, which
                    is just the sudden opening of the tube.</p>
                <p>The pain above the eyes is doubtless due to the inequality between the pressure
                    of the air on the surface of the forehead and that of the air in the frontal
                    sinuses, or air spaces in the frontal and other bones which form the boundaries
                    of the orbits. The return of the disagreeable sensations during the upward
                    ascent of the bell is due to the pressure on the outer surface of the tympanic
                    membrane and of the forehead being diminished, before the air within the
                    tympanic cavity and the air spaces in the bones of the orbits has accommodated
                    itself to the diminished external pressure.</p>
                <p>It may further be interesting to notice that any <hi rend="italic">upward</hi>
                    motion is accompanied by a thick mist within the bèll, which disappears when it
                    is stationary or moving <hi rend="italic">down· wards.</hi> The explanation is
                    that the air inside the bell, when it is ascending, being relieved of pressure,
                    expands, and its temperature is lowered; and as the air inside is about the
                    point of saturation, the fall of temperature pro« duces condensation, which
                    becomes visible in the form of vapour or mist. An analogous phenomenon takes
                    place in commencing to exhaust the receiver of an air-pump.</p>
                <p>The question of the effect produced on the health of the men employed in diving
                    is of interest and importance. So far as the author’s experience goes, he is not
                    aware that divers suffer from prosecuting their submarine work under the
                    pressure of one or two atmospheres to which they are subjected in ordinary
                    harbour works, the men selected for such duty being generally healthy young men
                    of athletic make. Indeed, it is well known that to some constitutions, and in
                    some forms of disease, subjection to moderate increase of atmospheric pressure
                    proves beneficial. But when greater depths and high pressures have to be
                    sustained the case may be very different.</p>
                <p>Mr Siebe, who states the greatest depth to which a diver has descended to be 201
                    feet, with a pressure of 87 5&gt; on the square inch (but who states 150 feet as
                    the limit for safe work), has given various directions, the result of his
                    experience, as to the selection of men for deep diving, and advises that men
                    should not be employed who are of full habit of body, who suffer from headache
                    or deafness, who have at any time had spitting of blood or palpitation of the
                    heart, who are pale and whose circulation is languid, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0317-0300"/> or who are of intemperate habits. He also says
                    that the rate of descent and ascent must depend very much on the constitution
                    and experience of the diver, about 2 feet a second for a strong man for depths
                    not exceeding 80 feet, and for descending to greater depths additional care must
                    be used. The greatest pressures to which men are subjected in engineering works
                    are experienced in the compressed air cylinders used in bridge building (see
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridge).</hi> At Saltash bridge it was found that
                    the men could not work long shifts at the depth of 86 feet without serious
                    inconvenience—some of them, after working seven hours, being slightly paralyzed,
                    but in two or three days they quite recovered. With three hours’ shifts the men
                    could work for several months consecutively.</p>
                <p>At Londonderry bridge, where the men wrought under a pressure of 75 feet, or
                    about two atmospheres, Sir John Hawkshaw found that there was considerable
                    difference in the relative ability of men to stand the pressure. He had found
                    Irishmen less able to stand the work than Englishmen, one of the effects being
                    that the joints began to swell. In other cases no evil resulted.</p>
                <p>Captain Eads, the engineer of the St Louis bridge, built across the Mississippi
                    in 1870, gives some interesting information, in his reports to the directors of
                    the Illinois and St Louis Bridge Company, on the effect of working under high
                    pressure on the men. The maximum depth to which the cylinders had to be sunk was
                    110⅛ feet below summer water level, and the greatest pressure under which the
                    men worked was 50 or 51 lb on the square inch. When the depth of 60 feet had
                    been reached some of the men were affected by paralysis of the lower limbs,
                    which usually passed off in a day or two. At greater depths the symptoms were
                    more severe. The duration of working in the air chamber was gradually shortened
                    from four hours to one hour. The total number of men employed in working under
                    pressure was 352, of whom 30 were seriously affected and 12 cases proved fatal.
