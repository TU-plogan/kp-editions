                    Parry has said, in his <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> “I cannot help thinking
                    that many a man may have been punished for intoxication who was only suffering
                    from the benumbing effects of frost; for I have more than once seen our people
                    in a state so exactly resembling that of the most stupid intoxication, that I
                    should certainly have charged them with that offence had I not been quite sure
                    that no possible means were afforded them on Melville Island to procure anything
                    stronger than snow water.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0501-0482"/> But, apart from the pathological causes of
                    seeming drunkenness, this condition may be actually produced by a multitude of
                    agents whose use is so wide-spread throughout the world as inevitably to lead to
                    the belief that their moderate employment must subserve some important object in
                    the economy of nature. Moreover, the physiological action of all these agents
                    gradually shades into each other, all producing or being capable of producing
                    consecutive paralysis of the various parts of the nervous system, but only in
                    doses of a certain amount,—a dose which varies with the agent, the race, and the
                    individual. Even the cup so often said to “cheer, but not inebriate,” cannot be
                    regarded as altogether free from the last-named effect. Tea-sots are well known
                    to be affected with palpitation and irregularity of the heart, as well as with
                    more or less sleeplessness, mental irritability, and muscular tremors, which in
                    some culminate in paralysis; while positive intoxication has been known to be
                    the result of the excessive use of strong tea <hi rend="italic">(Third Annual
                    lieport of the Massachusetts Board oj Health,</hi> p. 129). In short, from tea
                    to haschisch we have, through hops, alcohol, tobacco, and opium, a sort of
                    graduated scale of intoxicants, which stimulate in small doses and narcotize in
                    larger,—the narcotic dose having no stimulating properties whatever, and only
                    appearing to possess them from the fact that the agent can only be gradually
                    taken up by the blood, and the system thus comes primarily under the influence
                    of a stimulant dose. In certain circumstances and with certain agents—as in the
                    production of chloroform narcosis—this precursory stage is capable of being much
                    abbreviated, if not altogether annihilated; while with other agents—as tea—the
                    narcotic stage is by no means always or readily produced. It is well to
                    remember, also, that there is not a shadow of proof that the moderate use of any
                    one of these agents as a stimulant has any definite tendency to lead to its
                    abuse; it is otherwise with their employment as narcotics, which, once indulged
                    in, is almost certain to lead to repetition, and to a more or less rapid process
                    of degradatioh; but there are many exceptions to this latter statement. In
                    regard to this matter it is interesting to know that opium, which, used in
                    excess, is one of the most deleterious of these stimulants, is employed by
                    400,000,000, or nearly one-third of the whole human race, and that among these
                    we have the Chinese, who almost to a man are opium smokers, and who nevertheless
                    are well known to be one of the most frugal and industrious of peoples,
                    “powerful, muscular, and athletic, and the lower orders more intelligent, and
                    far superior in mental acquirements, to those of corresponding rank in our own
                    country.” It is also interesting to know that a late judge who lived to nearly
                    ninety years of age believed he had prolonged his life and added greatly to his
                    comfort by the moderate use of ether, which he was led to employ because neither
                    wine nor tobacco agreed with him; while the immoderate use of the same agent
                    has—particularly of late, and in the north of Ireland—given rise to a most
                    deleterious form of drunkenness. And, however degrading, demoralizing, and
                    pauperizing the vice of drunkenness may be, it is important to remember in all
                    our thoughts concerning it, that it is the outcome of a craving innate in human
                    nature, whether civilized or savage, and that there has been no period in the
                    world’s history, and no nation on its surface, in which one or other, and often
                    several simultaneously, of the many natural or artificial nervine stimulants
                    have not been employed, and well it has been for those who have used them
                    moderately. Two great influences have been regarded as of importance in
                    regulating the prevalence of intemperance—temperature and race. Of these
                    unquestionably race is by far the most influential. Within the isothermal lines
                    of 77° Fahr, north and south of the equatorial line of 82° 4' Fahr, the mild
                    native tribes seek their happiness in a quiet introspective self-complacency
                    termed keyf, induced by opium or haschisch. Between the isothermal lines of 77°
                    Fahr, and 50° Fahr, north and south lie those regions where the grape-vine grows
                    luxuriantly, and in these riotous intemperance, though still comparatively rare,
                    is no longer regarded as the disgraceful social crime it is looked on in the
                    tropics; while beyond the isotherms of 50° Fahr, north and south the vine is no
                    longer grown, and the stronger beers and distilled spirits become the
                    wide-spread sources of a deeper intoxication, which too often terminates in
                    crime, a result almost unknown in southern latitudes. How much of this is
                    actually due to the more highly intoxicating qualities of the fluids imbibed,
                    and how much to what Parry would rightly have termed the intoxicating quality of
                    the climate, has never been fairly ascertained; but this much is known, that in
                    these northern climes what is merely a stimulant dose in moderate weather
                    becomes stupefying under the influence of cold;—not because cold increases the
                    intoxicating power of any liquor, but because the previous excitement of the
                    cerebro-spinal system produces a condition of functional exhaustion which makes
                    it more readily succumb to the benumbing influence of cold,—renders it, as we
                    say, more liable to become morbidly congested by the reflex action of cold
                    applied to the surface.</p>
                <p>But of the two great influences which regulate the prevalence of intemperance,
                    that of race far exceeds that of temperature. A glance at the map of the world,
                    coupled with some knowledge of its history, teaches us that, whether in
                    temperate, subtropical, or tropical regions, wherever the Teuton is, there
                    drunkenness prevails; and the wild orgies in which Tacitus tells us the Teuton
                    of his day indulged in the cold climate of northern Europe are reproduced with
                    wonderful circumstantiality irrespective of climate or temperature. It may be,
                    as a recent speaker has said, that “a national love for strong drink is a
                    characteristic of the nobler and more energetic populations of the world;” it
                    may be, as he goes on to say, that it “accompanies public and-private
                    enterprise, constancy of purpose, liberality of thought, and aptitude for war;
                    it,” as he further adds, “exhibitsitself prominently in strong and nervous
                    constitutions, and assumes in very many instances the character of a curative of
                    itself.” In other words, in certain constitutions the moderate use of stimulants
                    excites to action rather than to a sensual keyf, and the pleasurable stimulus of
                    action renders such individuals less likely to fall into degrading habits of
                    excess.</p>
                <p>The effects of intoxicants are variously modified by the temperament of the
                    individual and the nature of the inebriant. When that is alcohol, its action on
                    an average individual is first to fill him with a serene and perfect
                    self-complacency. His feelings and faculties are exalted into a state of great
                    activity and buoyancy, so that his language becomes enthusiastic, and his
                    conversation vivacious if not brilliant. The senses gradually become hazy, a
                    soft humming seems to fill the pauses of the conversation, and modify the tones
                    of the speaker, a filmy haze obscures the vision, the head seems lighter than
                    usual, the equilibrium unstable. By and by objects appear double, or flit
                    confusedly before the eyes; judgment is abolished, secretiveness annihilated,
                    and the drunkard pours forth all that is within him with unrestrained
                    communicativeness; he becomes boisterous, ridiculous, and sinks at length into a
                    mere animal. Every one around him, the very houses, trees, even the earth
                    itself, seem drunken and unstable, he alone sober, till at last the final stage
                    is reached, and he falls on the ground insensible— <hi rend="italic">dead
                    drunk—</hi> a state from which, after profound slumber, he at last awakes
                    feverish, exhausted, sick, and giddy, with ringing ears, a throbbing heart, and
                    a violent headache.</p>

                <p>The pDÎson primarily affects the cerebral lobes, and the other parts of
                    cerebro-spinal system are consecutively involved, till in the state of <hi
                    rend="italic">dead-drunkenness</hi> the only parts not invaded by a benumbing
                    paralysis are those automatic centres in the medulla oblongata, which regulate
                    and maintain the circulation and respiration. But even these centres are not
                    unaffected; the paralysis of these as of the other sections of the
                    cerebro-spinal system varies in its incompleteness, and at times becomes
                    complete, the coma of drunkenness terminating in death. More usually the
                    intoxicant is gradually eliminated, and the individual restored to
                    consciousness, a consciousness disturbed by the secondary results of the agent
                    he has abused, and which vary with the nature of that agent. Whether, however,
                    directly or indirectly, through the nervous system the stomach suffers in every
                    case; thus nutrition is interfered with by the defective ingestion of food, as
                    well as by the mal-assimilation of that which is ingested; and from this cause,
                    as well as by the peculiar local action of the various poisons, we have the
                    various organic degenerations induced which in most cases shorten the drunkard’s
                    days.</p>
                <p>The primary discomforts of an act of drunkenness are readily removed for the time
                    by a repetition of the cause. Thus what has been an act may readily become a
                    habit, all the more readily that each repetition more and more enfeebles both
                    the will and the judgment, till they become utterly unfit to resist the
                    temptation to indulgence supplied by the knowledge of the temporary relief to
                    suffering which is sure to follow, and in spite of the consciousness that each
                    repetition of the act only forges their chains more tightly. From this condition
                    there is no hope of relief but in enforced abstinence; any one in this condition
                    must be regarded as temporarily insane, and ought to be placed in an inebriate
                    asylum till he regain sufficient self-control to enable him to overcome his love
                    for drink. The desire for stimulants is one of the strongest instincts of human
                    nature. It cannot be annihilated, but may be regulated by reason, conscience,
                    education, or by law when it encroaches on the rights of others or is injurious
                    to the individual himself. By the Intoxicating Liquors Licensing Act of 1872 any
                    one found drunk on a highway or public place or in a licensed house is liable to
                    a fine of 10s., on a repetition of the offence within twelve months to one of
                    20s., and on a third offence within twelve months to one of 40s. To be drunk or
                    riotous, or to be drunk while in charge of a horse, a carriage, or a gun is
                    punishable with a fine of 20s. or imprisonment for one month. And by the Police
                    and Improvement Act of Scotland, 25 and 26 Vict. c. 101, § 254, persons found
                    drunk on the streets are subject to a fine of 40s. or 14 days’ imprisonment,
                    wherever that Act has been adopted. These Acts, properly enforced, ought to
                    restrain the public exhibitions of drunkenness; while for those seasoned casks
                    who ruin their own health and pauperize their families, without perhaps ever
                    appearing in public offensively drunk, the only remedy which appears to promise
                    hope of reform would seem to be the power of temporarily consigning them to an
                    inebriate asylum. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. w. b.)</hi></p>
