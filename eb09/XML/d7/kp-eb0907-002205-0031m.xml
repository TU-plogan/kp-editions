                <p><label type="entry">DEE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1527-1608), a
                    mathematician and astrologer, was born in July 1527, in London, where his father
                    was a wealthy vintner. In 1542 he was sent to St John’s College, Cambridge.
                    After five years’ close application to mathematical studies, particularly
                    astronomy, he went to Holland, in order to visit several eminent Continental
                    mathematicians. Having remained abroad nearly a year, he returned to Cambridge,
                    and was elected a fellow of Trinity College, then first erected by King Henry
                    VIII. In 1548 he took the degree of master of arts; but in the same year he
                    found it necessary to leave England on account of the suspicions entertained of
                    his being a conjuror, which were first excited by a piece of machinery, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Irene</hi> of Aristophanes, he exhibited to the university,
                    representing the scarabaeus flying up to Jupiter, with a man and a basket of
                    victuals on its back. On leaving England he went first to the university of
                    Louvain, where he resided about two years, and then to the college of Rheims,
                    where he read lectures on Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> with great
                    applause. On his return to England in 1551 King Edward assigned him a pension of
                    100 crowns, which he afterwards exchanged for the rectory of Upton-upon-Severn.
                    Soon after the accession of Mary, he was accused of using enchantments against
                    the queen’s life; but after a tedious confinement, he obtained his liberty in
                    1555, by an order of council.</p>
                <p>When Elizabeth ascended the throne, Dee was asked by Lord Dudley to name a
                    propitious day for the coronation. On this occasion he was introduced to the
                    queen, who took lessons in the mystical interpretation of his writings, and made
                    him great promises, which, however, were never fulfilled. In 1564 he again
                    visited the Continent, in order to present a book which he had dedicated to the
                    Emperor Maximilian. He returned to England in the same year; but in 1571 we find
                    him in Lorraine, whither two physicians were sent by the queen to his relief in
                    a dangerous illness. Having once more returned to his native country, he settled
                    at Mortlake, in Surrey, where he continued his studies with unremitting ardour,
                    and made a collection of curious books and manuscripts, and a variety of
                    instruments, most of which were destroyed by the mob during his absence, on
                    account of his supposed familiarity with the devil. In 1578 Dee was sent abroad
                    to consult with German physicians and astrologers in regard to the illness of
                    the queen. On his return to England, he was employed in investigating the title
                    of the Crown to the countries recently discovered by British subjects, and in
                    furnishing geographical descriptions. Two large rolls containing the desired
                    information, which he presented to the queen, are still preserved in the
                    Cottonian Library. A learned treatise on the reformation of the calendar,
                    written by him about the same time, is still preserved in the Ashmolean Library
                    at Oxford.</p>
                <p>From this period the philosophical researches of Dee were concerned entirely with
                    the pseudo-science of necromancy. In 1581 he became acquainted with Edward
                    Kelly, an apothecary who professed to have discovered the philosopher’s stone,
                    and by whose assistance he performed various incantations, and maintained a
                    frequent imaginary intercourse with spirits. Shortly after, Kelly and Dee were
                    introduced to a Polish nobleman, Albert Laski, palatine of Siradia (Sieradz),
                    devoted to the same pursuits, who persuaded the two friends to accompany him to
                    his native country. They embarked for Holland in September 1583, and arrived at
                    Laski’s place of residence in February following. They lived for some years in
                    Poland and Bohemia in alternate wealth and poverty, according to the credulity
                    or scepticism of those before whom they exhibited. They professed to raise
                    spirits by incantation. Kelly dictated their utterances to Dee, who wrote them
                    down and interpreted them,</p>
                <p>Dee, having at length quarrelled with his companion, quitted Bohemia and returned
                    to England, where he was made chancellor of St Paul’s Cathedral in 1594, and
                    warden of Manchester College in 1595. He afterwards returned to his house at
                    Mortlake, where he died in 1608, at the age of eighty-one.</p>
