                    boundary to the River Indus on the east. Below the hills the country is high and
                    arid, generally level, but sometimes rolling in sandy undulations, and much
                    intersected by hill torrents, 201 in number. With the exception of two, these
                    streams dry up after the rains, and their influence is only felt for a few miles
                    below the hills. The eastern portion of the district is at a level sufficiently
                    low to benefit by the floods of the Indus. A barren tract intervenes between
                    these zones, and is beyond the reach of the hill streams on the one hand and of
                    the Indus on the other. Although liable to great extremes of temperature, and to
                    a very scanty rainfall, the district is not unhealthy. The rainfall in 1872-73
                    was 7 ’ 7 inches; the mean temperature 79° Fahr. The maximum temperature (H2°)
                    occurred in June, the minimum (40°) in December. The principal agricultural
                    products are wheat, great millet, <hi rend="italic">joár,</hi> cotton, rice, and
                    indigo. The poppy plant is also rather extensively cultivated in the south of
                    the district. The less important food grains are barley, spiked millet <hi
                    rend="italic">(bájrá),</hi> and pulses. Oil seeds and tobacco are also grown to
                    a small extent.</p>

                <p>cultivationmainlydependsupon artificial irrigation, effected principally by
                    canals leading from the Indus. In 1872-73 there were 15 main canals, drawing
                    their supply direct from the Indus, of which 2 were the property of private
                    in-viduals, and 13 were under the management of Government. Alum, earth salt,
                    and <hi rend="italic">raggi</hi> (an impure carbonate of soda) are manufactured
                    in some quantities. The exports are indigo, opium, salt, dates, wheat, cotton,
                    barley, millet, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi> and hides. The imports are sugar,
                    fruits from Cabul, gram, woollen goods, English piece goods and broad cloth,
                    metals, salt, and spices. The total revenue of the district in 1872-73,
                    exclusive of local funds and canal collections, amounted to £45,161, of which
                    £35,588, or 79 per cent., was derived from the land. The administrative staff of
                    the district consists of a deputy commissioner, with two assistants and one
                    extra assistant, four tahsildárs, each with a deputy or assistant, a district
                    superintendent of police, and two civil surgeons. The police force numbered 733
                    men. There are 85 schools, maintained or assisted by the state, and 132
                    indigenous village schools—total 167, attended in 1872-73 by 2907 pupils. Three
                    charitable dispensaries afford gratuitous medical relief. The principal town of
                    the district, and chief seat of commerce, is Derá Gházi Khán, situated on the
                    west bank of the Indus, 30° 4' lat., 70° 51' long. Population in 1868
                    :—Mahometans, 10,699; Hindus, 8850; Sikhs, 328; Christians, 52; “others,”
                    194—total, 20,123. The other towns containing a population exceeding 5000 souls
                    are Jámpur, population 7796; Choti, population 7300; Dágil, population 5693; and
                    Rájhan, population 5656. Rájanpur, although not containing 5000 inhabitants, is
                    important as a cantonment, a regiment of cavalry and two companies of infantry
                    being stationed there. The foregoing towns are all municipalities.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 returned the population as follows :— Mahometans, 264,527;
                    Hindus, 38,467; Sikhs, 1124; “others,” 4722; total 308,840. The Beluchis, who
                    are Mahometans, form by far the most important section of the population, and
                    number 82,590. The Játs, who are also Mahometans, are the most numerous,
                    numbering 162,519. Among the Hindu population, the Aroras form the most
                    important caste, 33,024 in number, principally traders. Of the total population,
                    164,729, or 53 per cent., are returned as agriculturists.</p>
