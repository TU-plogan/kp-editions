                    education at Harrow aud at Caius College, Cambridge, from which after four
                    years’ residence he removed to Trinity Hall. In 1683 he graduated M.A. When he
                    quitted the university he made the tour of Europe, in the course of which he
                    acquired a strong prejudice against foreign manners and customs, and became
                    confirmed, as was natural in one born and brought up a Whig, in his dislike of
                    foreign Governments. On his return to England he became acquainted with Dryden,
                    Wycherly, Congreve, and Southerne, whose conversation, inspiring him with a
                    passion for poetry, and a contempt for every attainment that had not in it
                    something of the <hi rend="italic">belles</hi><hi rend="italic">lettres,</hi>
                    diverted him from entering any profession. He lived for a time on a small
                    fortune he had inherited from an uncle, but this was soon squandered. Through
                    the patronage of the duke of Marlborough, to whom he had recommended himself by
                    his zeal for the Protestant succession, he obtained a place in the customs worth
                    £120 per annum. After some years, however, his extravagance reduced him to the
                    necessity of disposing of it; but, in selling it, he reserved to himself an
                    annuity for a term of years. Outliving this term, he was in the closing years of
                    his life reduced to extreme necessity.</p>
                <p>Dennis was the author of several small poems of little merit, and one or two
                    plays which possess none, though one at least of the latter was received with
                    considerable favour at the time of its production, on account of its hitting the
                    strongest popular prejudice then existing. His tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Love
                    Asserted,</hi> produced at Lincoln’s Inn Fields theatre in 1704, was fiercely
                    anti-French, and as such met with warm sympathy and approval. Dennis conceived
                    the insane idea that by writing it he had roused the implacable resentment of
                    the French Government, and amusing stories are told of the precautions he
                    thought it necessary to take in consequence. He is said to have visited the duke
                    of Marlborough, previous to the negotiations for the peace of Utrecht, and asked
                    him to secure the insertion of a special clause in the treaty protecting his
                    person* from vengeance. On another occasion the appearance of an approaching
                    vessel is said to have caused him to flee to London from a friend’s house on the
                    coast of Sussex. His tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Aprpius and Virginia,</hi>
                    produced at Drury Lane in 1709, was unsuccessful. It is memorable only on
                    account of a peculiar kind of thunder used in the performance, which was both
                    novel and effective. A few nights after the failure of his play Dennis, sitting
                    in the pit, heard the thunder introduced into the tragedy of Macbeth, whereupon
                    he rose and cried to the audience, “They won’t act my tragedy, but they steal my
                    thunder.”</p>
                <p>But for his inordinate vanity, and an infirmity of tempeι that fell little short
                    of insanity, Dennis might have made some mark in literature as a critic. His
                    reviews of Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> and Addison’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Cato</hi> showed considerable discernment and not a little wit;
                    but they were disfigured by bitter personal feeling. As his attacks were almost
                    always on persons of abilities greatly superior to his own, like Addison,
                    Steele, and Pope, their replies usually turned opinion strongly against him,
                    irritating his testy temper, and rendering him a perpetual torment to himself.
                    Pope pilloriedhim in the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad,</hi> and in the following
                    epigram—</p>
                <p>Should Dennis publish you had stabb’d your brother, Lampoon’d your monarch, or
                    debauch’d your mother,— Say, what revenge on Dennis can be had?</p>
                <p>Too dull for laughter, for reply too mad; On one so poor you cannot take the law;
                    On one so old your sword you scorn to draw. Uncag’d then let the harmless
                    monster rage, Secure in dulness, madness, want, and age.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0108-0095"/>
                <p>At length, after a long life of vicissitudes, he was compelled to receive
                    obligations from those whom he had been continually reviling. In the very close
                    of his days a play was acted for his benefit at the little theatre in the
                    Haymarket, through the united interests of Thomson, Mallet, and Pope. It is much
                    to the credit of Pope especially that, notwithstanding the gross manner in which
                    Dennis had calumniated him on many occasions, he took part in the arrangements,
                    and even wrote an occasional prologue to the play, which was spoken by Cibber.
                    Not long after this Dennis died, on the 6th of January 1734.</p>
