                    discovered by O. F. Müller. And so slow was the progress of discovery in this
                    field of scientific research that in the course of half a century, when Agardh
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Systema Algarum</hi> in 1821, only 49 species
                    included under 8 genera had been described. Since that time, however,· the
                    microscope has been greatly improved; and eminent naturalists in all parts of
                    the civilized world have been induced to engage in the study of these forms. The
                    result is that the number of known genera and species has been greatly
                    increased; the species found in Great Britain and Ireland may be estimated at
                    little less than 1000; and Rabenhorst, in the index to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora Europcea,</hi> enumerates about 4000 forms which have been discovered
                    throughout the continent of Europe. At a time when little was understood of the
                    structure of these organisms they were generally known among botanists by the
                    appellation of Bacillariaceae; but almost all recent authors are agreed in
                    adopting the later and more appropriate designation of Diatomaceae.</p>
                <p>Various opinions have been entertained as to the position to be assigned to these
                    forms. The earlier observers referred them to the vegetable kingdom. Subsequent
                    authors, including Ehrenberg, regarded them as animals; but in consequence of
                    their analogy to other organisms acknowledged to be vegetable, as regards their
                    general structure, and more especially their modes of reproduction, they are now
                    almost universally included in the vegetable kingdom, and classified with the
                    Monocellular Algae.</p>
                <p>The Diatomaceae exhibit great variety in form. While some species are circular,
                    as <hi rend="italic">Coscinodiscus</hi><hi rend="italic">perforatus</hi> (fig,
                    1), others are of an oval outline, as <hi rend="italic">Surirella</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ovalis</hi> (fig. 2).</p>
                <p>Some are linear, as <hi rend="italic">Synedra radians</hi> (fig. 3); others more
                    or less crescentic, as <hi rend="italic">Epithemia hyndmanii</hi> (fig. 4);
                    others, again, are cuneate, as <hi rend="italic">Podospſienia lyngbyii</hi>
                    (fig. 5); some few have a sigmoid outline, as <hi rend="italic">Pleurosigma
                    balticun</hi> (fig. 6); but the prevailing forms are naviculoid, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Navicula cuspidata</hi> (fig. 7). They vary greatly also in their
                    modes of growth,—some being free, others attached to foreign bodies by
                    gelatinous stipes, the stipes being in some species very short, while in others
                    they are of considerable length. In some genera the forms are simple, while in
                    others the frustules are connected together in ribbon-like filaments, or form,
                    as in other cases, zig-zag chains. In some genera the frustules are naked, while
                    in many others they are inclosed in a more or less definite gelatinous
                    investment, or frond, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n187/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0187-0170"/> as this covering is usually designated. The
                    conditions necessary to their growth are moisture and light. Wherever these
                    circumstances coexist, diatomaceous forms will almost invariably be found. They
                    occur mixed with other organisms on the surface of moist rocks; in streamlets
                    and pools, they form a brownish stratum on the surface of the mud, or cover the
                    stems and leaves of water plants or floating twigs with a furry investment.
                    Marine forms are usually attached to various sea-weeds, and many are found in
                    the stomachs of molluscs, holothurians, ascidians, and other denizens of the
                    ocean. The fresh-water forms are specifically distinct from those incidental to
                    salt or brackish water,—fresh-water species, however, are sometimes carried some
                    distance into the sea by the force of the current, and in tidal rivers marine
                    forms are carried up by the force of the tide. Some notion may be formed of the
                    extreme minuteness of these forms from the fact that one the length of which is
                    - <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> ∏⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> ths of an inch
                    may be considered as beyond the medium size. Some few, indeed, are much larger,
                    but by far the greater proportion are of very much smaller dimensions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure.</hi> —These minute vegetables are distinguished from
                    kindred forms by the fact of having their soft vegetative part covered by a
                    siliceous case. This covering of silex consists of two similar valves nearly
                    parallel to each other, each valve being furnished with a rim projecting from it
                    at a right angle. One of these valves with its rim is slightly smaller than the
                    other, the smaller fitting into the larger pretty much as a pill box fits into
                    its cover. This peculiarity of structure affords ample scope for the growth of
                    the cell-contents usually known as the endochrome. As the endochrome increases
                    in volume the siliceous valves are pushed out, and their corresponding siliceous
                    rims become broader.</p>
                <p>As regards the vegetative contents of this cell, in so brief a description the
                    following parts only need to be referred to. There is first what Pfitzer, a
                    distinguished German writer on this subject, designates the plasm-sac,
                    consisting of a fine colourless plasm forming a closed sac of the same shape as
                    that of the cell. The refractive power of this plasm differing but slightly from
                    that of water, the presence of this structure is not always obvious; but on the
                    application of hydrochloric acid its outline may be discerned as it slowly
                    separates from the cell wall,—at first preserving the shape of the cell, but
                    ultimately contracting into a small round mass. Within the plasm-sac is the
                    structure which the writer just named designates the endochrome-plates. They
                    consist of a thick substance, and are of the same colour throughout, varying
                    from bright yellow to a dark yellowish brown. The number and position of the
                    endochrome plates vary in the different genera—some having two, others only one.
                    Within the folds of these plates is sometimes noticeable a collection of plasm
                    which Ehrenberg describes as resembling the embryo in an egg, and which Pfitzer
                    calls the middle plasm-mass. Within this plasm-mass oil globules and vacuoles
                    are diffused, and in the centre of it a small vesicle may often be observed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Motion.—</hi> One of the first phenomena vhu;n monies ιnder the
                    notice of the observer is the extraordinary power of motion with which the
                    frustules are endowed. Some species move slowly backwards and forwards in pretty
                    much the same line, but in the case of <hi rend="italic">Bacillaria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">paradoxa</hi> the motion is very rapid, the frustules darting
                    through the water in a zig-zag course. To account for this motion various
                    theories have been suggested, none of which appear to be altogether
                    satisfactory. So while the extraordinary motion of the Diatomaceae excites
                    admiration, it must be acknowledged that the mechanical agency which produces
                    the motion remains unexplained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification.—</hi> In this group, as well as in almost all
                    others, various systems of classification have from time to time been adopted;
                    but that which seems to commend itself most strongly, as well by reason of its
                    simplicity as its facility of application, is the system which has been matured
                    by Heiberg, the distinguished Danish writer on the subject, and which he has
                    founded on the symmetrical or unsymmetrical form of the frustule in its several
                    aspects. A diatomaceous frustule may be regarded on what is called the front
                    view, in which the connecting rim or hoop is seen, or on the side view, by which
                    the valv⅛ is presented to the eye of the observer. If the outline be symmetrical
                    both on the transverse and longitudinal axis, in both these aspects the frustule
                    is said to be symmetrical; but if the outline be different on one side from that
                    of the other, or if perfect symmetry does not exist as respects the longitudinal
                    or transverse axis, the frustule is said to be unsymmetrical on the aspect or
                    axis in which want of symmetry is found to exist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reproduction.—</hi> In the Diatomaceae, as well as in the
                    Desmidieae, the ordinary mode of increase is by self-division of the cell (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Algae,</hi> vol. i. p. 508). The cell-contents within the
                    inclosure of the siliceous case separate into two distinct masses. As these two
                    masses of endochrome become more and more developed, the valves of the mother
                    cell are pushed more and more widely apart. A new siliceous valve is secreted by
                    each of the two masses on the side opposite to the original valve. When this
                    process has been completed the hoop of the mother frustule gives way, and two
                    distinct frustules are formed, the siliceous valves in each of these new
                    frustules being one of the valves of the mother cell, and a newly formed valve
                    similar and more or less parallel to it.</p>
                <p>During the life of the plant this process of self-division is continued with an
                    almost incredible rapidity. On this subject the observation of the late
                    Professor Smith is worthy of special notice:—“I have been unable to ascertain
                    the time occupied in a single act of self-division, but supposing it to be
                    completed in twenty-four hours we should have, as the progeny a of single
                    frustule, the amazing number of 1,000,000,000 in a single month, a circumstance
                    which will in some degree explain the sudden, or at least rapid, appearance of
                    these organisms in localities where they were a short time previously either
                    unrecognized or sparingly diffused” <hi rend="italic">(British Diatomaceae,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 25).</p>
                <p>Some authors of reputation have been under the impression that the Diatomaceae,
                    like other kindred forms, are sometimes reproduced by zoospores, and some few
                    facts from time to time have been recorded by various observers which seem to
                    bear out this view of the case. But in this group, as well as in the Desmidieae
                    already referred to, there obtains another mode of reproduction which is
                    generally known as conjugation. It would be unnecessary here to describe in
                    detail the various observed modes of this process. Suffice it to say that
                    usually two parent frustules unite, invest themselves in a gelatinous sac in
                    which their cell contents are discharged and formed into two bodies termed
                    sporangia, which soon are developed into two frustules in all respects
                    resembling the parents but usually <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0188-0171"/> double their size. In some phases of this process
                    the gelatinous sac bears a considerable resemblance to that lowest form of
                    animal life known by the name of Amoeba, so much so that an inexperienced
                    observer might suppose that the object before him was an Amoeba gorged with
                    diatomaceous frustules.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mode of Preparation.—</hi> The Diatomaceae are usually gathered
                    in small bottles, and special care should be taken to collect them as free as
                    possible from extraneous matter. A small portion having been examined under the
                    microscope, should the gathering be thought worthy of preservation, some of the
                    material is boiled in acid for the purpose of cleaning it. The acids usually
                    employed are hydrochloric, nitric, or sulphuric, according as circumstances
                    require. When the operator considers that by this process all foreign matter has
                    been eliminated, the residuum is put into a precipitating jar of a conical
                    shape, broader at the bottom than at the top, and covered to the brim with
                    filtered or distilled water. When the diatoms have settled in the bottom of the
                    jar, the supernatant fluid is carefully removed by a syringe or some similar
                    instrument, so that the sediment be not disturbed. The jar is again filled with
                    water, and the process repeated till the acid has been completely removed. It is
                    desirable afterwards to boil the sediment for a short time with supercarbonate
                    of soda, the alkali being removed in the same manner as the acid. A small
                    portion may then be placed with a pipette upon a slip of glass, and, when the
                    moisture has been thoroughly evaporated, the film that remains should be covered
                    with dilute Canada balsam, and, a thin glass cover having been gently laid over
                    the balsam, the preparation should be laid aside for a short time to harden, and
                    then is ready for observation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Remarks.—</hi> Like all other organisms, the
                    Diatomaceae doubtless have a definite function assigned to them in the grand
                    system of creation, but a special interest attaches to them. Allusion has been
                    made to the fact that the soft cell of these organisms is encased in a siliceous
                    epiderm. When the plant has fulfilled its natural course the siliceous covering
                    sinks to the bottom of the water in which it had lived, and there forms part of
                    the sediment. When in the process of ages, as it has often happened, the
                    accumulated sediment has been hardened into solid rock, the siliceous exuviae of
                    the diatoms remain unaltered, and, if the rock be disintegrated by natural or
                    artificial means, may be removed from what has been called “their stony shroud,”
                    and subjected to examination under the microscope. The forms found may from
                    their character help in some degree to illustrate the conditions under which the
                    stratum of rock had been originally deposited.</p>
                <p>Vast deposits of Diatomaceae have been discovered in various parts of the
                    world,—some the deposit of fresh, others of salt water. Of these deposits the
                    most remarkable for extent, as well as for the number and beauty of the species
                    contained in it, is that of Richmond, in Virginia, one of the United States of
                    America. It is said to extend for many miles, and to be in some places at last
                    40 feet deep. The material has long been used as a polishing powder, and
                    recently has been largely employed in the manufacture of the powerful explosive
                    agent known as dynamite. It is a remarkable fact that existing species of
                    Diatomaceae have been traced so far down as the lower strata of the Tertiary
                    formation; and, though the generations of a diatom in the space of a few months
                    far exceed in number the generation of man during the period usually assigned to
                    the existence of the race, the fossil genera and species are in all respects to
                    the most minute details identical with the numerous living representatives of
                    their class. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. o’m.)</hi></p>
