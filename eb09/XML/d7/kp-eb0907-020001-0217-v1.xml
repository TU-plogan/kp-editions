                    the several phases of internal growth and of external relations, and in old age
                    is still important in prolonging existence, and rendering it agreeable and

                    communicate immorality and disease! A still more determined pessimist was the
                    famous chemist Van Helmont, who thought life had been reduced to its present
                    shortness by our inborn propensities, and proposed to substitute bread boiled in
                    beer and honey for milk, which latter he calls “brute’s food.” Baron Liebig has
                    followed the lead with a “Food for infants,” ip the prescription for which half
                    ounces and quarter grains figure freely, and which has to be prepared on a slow
                    fire, and after a few minutes boiled well. And after all not nearly such a close
                    imitation of human milk is made as by the addition to fresh cow’s milk of half
                    its bulk of soft water, in each pint of which has been mixed a heaped up
                    teaspoontul of powdered “sugar of milk” and a pinch of phosphate of lime.
                    Indeed, in default of these cheap chemicals, the milk and water alone, when
                    fresh and pure, are safer than an artificial compound which requires cooking.
                    And experience shows that the best mode of administering food to the young is
                    also that which is most widely adopted throughout warm-blooded nature, namely,
                    in a fresh, tepid, liquid state, frequently, and in small quantities at a
                    time.</p>

                <p>These are at once the constituents and the proportions of the constituents of
                    food suited to a weakly rapidly-growing animal. The large quantity of water
                    makes it pass easily through the soft absorbent w alls of the digestive canal,
                    and the complete suspension in an alkaline fluid of the finely divided fat and
                    nitrogenous matter introduce more of them than could be effected were they in a
                    solid form. The fat is the germ of new cellular growth, and the nitrogenous
                    matter is by the new cells formed into flesh, which is doubling its bulk
                    monthly. The phosphate of lime is required for the hardening bones, the chloride
                    of sodium and the iron for the daily increasing amount of blood in circulation.
                    Milk may be said to be still alive as it leaves the breast fresh and warm, and
                    quickly becomes living blood in the infant’s veins. A very slight chemical
                    change is requisite. Its frequent administration is demanded by the rapid
                    absorption, and the absence of regular meals prevents the overloading of the
                    delicate young stomach with more than it can hold at once,</p>
                <p>The wſholesomest nutriment for the first six months is milk alone. A vigorous
                    baby can indeed bear with im punity much rough usage, and often appears none the
                    worse for a certain quantity of farinaceous food; but the majority do not get
                    habituated to it, without an exhibition of dislike which indicates rebellion of
                    the bowels.</p>
                <p>To give judicious diet its fair chance the frame must be well protected from the
                    cold; and just in proportion as the normal temperature of the body is maintained
                    so does growth prosper, as is satisfactorily proved by experiments on the young
                    of the lower animals.</p>
                <p>It is only when the teeth are on their way to the front, as shown by dribbling,
                    that the parotid glands secrete an active saliva capable of digesting bread
                    stuffs. Till then anything but milk must be given tentatively, and considered in
                    the light of a means of education for its future mode of nutrition. Among the
                    varieties of such means, the most generally applicable are broth and beef tea,
                    at first pure, and then thickened with tapioca and arrowroot. Chicken soup, made
                    with a little cream and sugar, serves as a change. Baked flour, biscuit powder,
                    tops and bottoms, should all have their turn; change is necessary in the
                    imperfect dietary which art supplies, and for change the stomach should be
                    prepared by habit.</p>
                <p>The consequences of premature weaning are insidious. The external aspect of the
                    child is that of health, its muscles <pb break="no"

                    proportion, and if it tries to walk its limbs give way, and it is said to be
                    suffering from rachitis or “rickets.”</p>
                <p>These consequences follow in other animals as surely as in the human race; and in
                    them it was possible to make the experiment crucial. A gentleman named Guérin
                    set himself to find if he could produce rickets at will. He took a number of
                    puppies in equally good condition, and having let them suckle for a time, he
                    suddenly weaned half of them and fed them on raw meat, a fare which at first
                    thoughtwouldseemthe mostsuitable for carnivorous animals. Nevertheless^ after a
                    short time, those which continued to take the mother’s milk had grown strong and
                    hearty, whilst those which had been treated with a more substantial dietary
                    pined, and frequently threw up their victuals, then their limbs bent, and at the
                    end of about four months they showed all the symptoms of confirmed rickets. From
                    these experiments we must conclude that the rachitis depended mainly on the
                    derangements of nutrition brought on by improper diet. A diet which is taken at
                    a wrong season may fairly be called improper. For carnivora, it is flesh before
                    the age of suckling has passed; for herbivora (and an experiment bearing on the
                    point has been made on pigs), it is vegetable feeding begun when they ought to
                    be at the teat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The time for weaning should be fixed partly by the child’s age, partly by the
                    growth of the teeth. The troubles to which children are subject at this crisis
                    are usually gastric, such as are induced by summer weather; therefore at that
                    season the weaning should be postponed, whereas in winter it should be hurried
                    forward. The first group of teeth nine times out of ten consists of the lower
                    central front teeth, which may appear any time during the sixth and seventh
                    month. The mother may then begin to diminish the number of suckling times; and
                    by a month she can have reduced them to twice a day, so as to be ready when the
                    second group makes its way through the upper front gums to cut off the supply
                    altogether. The third group, the lateral incisors and first grinders, usually
                    after the first anniversary of birth give notice that solid food can be chewed.
                    But it is prudent to let dairy milk form a considerable portion of the fare till
                    the eye teeth are cut, which seldom happens till the eighteenth or twentieth
                    month. At this period children are liable to diarrhoea, convulsions, irritation
                    of the brain, rashes, and febrile catarrhs. In such cases it is often advisable
                    to resume a complete milk diet, and sometimes a child’s life has been saved by
                    its reapplication to the breast. These means are most feasible when the patient
                    is accustomed to milk; indeed, if not, the latter expedient is hardly
                    possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diet in Childhood and Youth.—</hi> At this stage of life the
                    diet must obviously be the best, which is a transition from that of infancy to
                    that of adult age. Growth is not completed, but yet entire surrender of every
                    consideration to the claim of growth is not possible, nor indeed desirable.
                    Moreover that abundance of adipose tissue, or reserve new growth, which a baby
                    can bear, is an impediment to the due education of the muscles of the boy or
                    girl. The supply of nutriment needs not to be so continuous as before, but at
                    the same time should be more frequent than for the adult. Up to at least
                    fourteen or fifteen years of age the rule should be four meals a day, varied
                    indeed, but nearly equal in nutritive power and in quantity, that is to say, all
                    moderate, all sufficient. The maturity the body then reaches involves a
                    hardening and enlargement of the bones and cartilages, and a strengthening of
                    the digestive organs, which in healthy young persons enables us to dispense with
                    some of the watchful care bestowed upon their diet. Three full meals a day are
                    generally sufficient, and the requirements of mental training may be allowed to
                    a certain extent to modify the attention to nutrition which has hitherto been
                    paramount. But it must not be forgotten that the changes in figure and in
                    internal organs are not completed till several years have passed, and that they
                    involve increased growth and demand full supplies. As less bulky food is used,
                    care should be taken that it is sufficiently nutritious, and habits should be
                    acquired which conduce to making the most of it for the maintenance of
                    strength.</p>
                <p>The nutritiousness of food depends on <hi rend="italic">digestibility</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">concentration.</hi> Food is digestible wſhen it yields
                    readily its constituents to the fluids destined for their reduction to
                    absorbable chyme. It is more or less concentrated, according as a given w eight
                    contains more or less matter capable of.supporting life. The degree in which
                    they possess these qualifications united constitutes the absolute nutritive
                    value of alimentary matters.</p>
                <p>The degree of cohesion in the viands influences digestibility. Tough articles
                    incapable of * being completely ground up by the teeth, remain unused, while
                    fluids and semifluids lead the van of digestibles. The tissues of young
                    vegetables and young animals are for this reason more digestible than old
                    specimens. It is desirable also that the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>
                    rigidity, which lasts several days in most instances, should have merged into
                    softness before the meat is cooked, or should have been anticipated by cooking
                    before the flesh is cold. In warm climates and exceptionally warm weather the
                    latter course is the preferable. The dietician, especially when the feeding of
                    the young is in question, will prefer those methods of culinary preparation
                    which most break up the natural cohesion of the viands. And it may be noticed
                    that the force of cohesion acts in all directions, and that it is no advantage
                    for an article to be laterally friable if it remains stringy in a longitudinal
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Fat interposed between the component parts of food diminishes its digestibility.
                    It is the interstitial fat between the fasciculi of muscular fibre in beef which
                    rendersit to young persons and to dyspeptics less digestible than mutton.</p>
                <p>A temperature above that of the body retards digestion. Meat, which is digested
                    by the gastric juice in the stomach, has time to cool before it gets there; but
                    farinaceous food, which depends for its conversion into chyme on the salivary
                    glands, suffers a serious loss if by reason of being too hot it cannot avail
                    itself of the saliva supplied by the mouth. It should also be borne in mind that
                    a temperature much above that of the body cracks the enamel of the teeth.</p>
                <p>Excessive concentration impairs digestibility. The principal medium by which
                    nutriment is carried through the absorbent membrane of the digestive canal is
                    water. There is no doubt it passes more rapidly by endosmosis than anything
                    else. The removal, then, of water is an injury to viands, and drying, salting,
                    over-frying, over roasting, and even over-boiling renders them less soluble in
                    the digestive juices, and so less nutritious. A familiar illustration of this
                    may be taken from eggs. Let an egg be lightly boiled, poached in water,
                    custarded, or raw, and the stomach even of an invalid can bear it; but let it be
                    baked in a pudding which requires a hot oven, or boiled hard, or otherwise
                    submitted to a high temperature for a prolonged period, and it becomes a
                    tasteless, leathery substance, which can be of no more use in the stomach than
                    so much skin or hair. It is obvious then that it is mainly in a commercial point
                    of view that articles of diet can'be called nutritious in proportion to their
                    concentration. About this there can be no question; milk adulterated from the
                    pump is worth so much less than pure milk, and a pound of beef steak sustains a
                    man longer than a pint of veal broth.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0219-0202"/>
                <p>Tiιe attainment of nutritiousness by concentration is of considerable importance
                    to travellers and in military medicine. There are not a few strategists who
                    attribute the success of the Germans in the war of 1870 to the easily carried
                    and easily prepared food supplied to them by the sausage-makers of Berlin.
                    Concentration of viands carried to excess, so as to be likely to affect the
                    health, is usually made manifest by a diminution in the secretion of urine and
                    itscondensed condition; while, on the other hand, if dilution is needlessly
                    great, the action of the kidneys is excessive. Now the urine of young persons is
                    naturally of lower specific gravity, that is, more aqueous, than that of adults.
                    If it is found to equal in density the excretion of full growth, or if it is
                    observed to be voided but rarely, the meals should be made more bulky, or better
                    still, more frequent, so as not to overload the stomach.</p>
                <p>An over-concentrated diet often induces costiveness. This should be counteracted
                    by green vegetables and other dilute appetizing dishes, and never by purgative
                    drugs. The habit of taking a considerable quantity and variety of fresh green
                    vegetables has the further advantage of preventing that tendency to minor
                    developments of scurvy which is not uncommonly found in youths nourished mainly
                    on animal food. A softness or friability of the gums is one of the first signs
                    of this. If the mouth bleeds after the application of a tooth brush, the use of
                    fresh vegetables at every meal should be enforced,</p>
                <p>The young are peculiarly liable to be affected by poisons conveyed in fluids.
                    Their sensitive frames absorb quickly, and quickly turn to evil account such
                    substances, even when diluted to au extent which makes them harmless to adults.
                    The water therefore with which families, and still more with which schools are
                    supplied, should be carefully subjected to analysis. Wherever a trace of lead is
                    found, means should be adopted to remove the source of it; and organic products
                    should have their origin clearly accounted for, and all possibility of sewage
                    contamination excluded. These precautions are essential, in spite of the
                    grown-up portion of the household having habitually used the water without
                    injury.</p>
                <p>Fresh milk has long had a bad popular reputation as occasionally conveying fever,
                    and in some parts of Ireland the peasantry can hardly ever be got to take it
                    “raw.” This is quite irrespective of the state of the cattle which furnish it;
                    no cases of disease thus communicated have ever been traced home to sick cows.
                    It is probably always due either to adulteration with dirty water, or to the
                    vessels being washed in that dangerous medium, or to their being exposed to air
                    loaded with elements of contagion.</p>
                <p>Up to the period of full development the daily use of wine should be allowed only
                    during illness and the express attendance of a medical adviser. Its habitual
                    consumption by healthy children hastens forward the crisis of puberty, checks
                    growth, and habituates them to the artificial sensation induced by alcohol.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diet for Bodily Labour.</hi> —It seems certain that the old
                    theory of Liebig, which attributed the whole of the force exhibited in muscular
                    movements to the oxidation of muscular tissue, is untenable. There is not enough
                    of the material oxidized, that is to say, destroyed and carried away as urea and
                    other nitrogenous excretions, to generate so much force, as measured by the
                    method of Joule. On the other hand, Traube goes too far when he would make out
                    that in the performance of muscular work the metamorphosis of the organized
                    constituents of contractile tissue is not involved, and that non-nitrogenous
                    substances alone are consumed. The prolonged feats of walking performed by the
                    pedestrian Weston in 1876 vastly increased the amounts excreted of those
                    elements of the urine which are derived from the oxidation of muscle and
                        nerve.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dr Pavy

                    The urea formed by the destructive assimilation of contractile fibre, and the
                    phosphates whose main source is nervous tissue, were each nearly doubled during
                    and shortly after the extraordinary strain upon those parts of the body. As
                    might be expected, the machinery wears away quicker when it is harder worked,
                    and requires to be repaired immediately by an enhanced quantity of new material,
                    or it will be worn beyond the power of repair. The daily supply, therefore, of
                    digestible nitrogenous food, meat <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> must be
                    increased whenever the muscular exercise is increased. In making the recent
                    extension of railways in Sicily, the progress was retarded by the slack work
                    done by the Sicilian navvies compared with that got through by the English
                    gangs. The former took scarcely any meat, preferring to save the wages expended
                    by their comrades in that way. The idea occurred to the contractor of paying the
                    men partly in money and partly in meat; and the result was a marked increase in
                    the amount of work executed, which was brought nearly up to the British average.
                    A mixed diet, with an increase in the proportionate quantity of meat when extra
                    corporeal exertion is required, is the wholesomest, as well as the most
                    economical, for all sorts of manual labourers.</p>
                <p>It is absolutely essential that the fleshly machinery for doing work should be
                    continuously replaced by flesh food, as it becomes worn out. Nitrogenous aliment
                    after a few chemical changes replaces the lost muscle which has passed away in
                    the excretions; just as the engineer makes ore into steel and renews the
                    corroded boiler plate or thinned piston. Now, as the renewal of the plate or
                    piston is a “stimulus” to the augmented performances of the engine, so meat is a
                    “stimulus” to augmented muscular action. Taken in a digestible form during
                    exertion, it allows the exertion to be continued longer, with greater ease and
                    less consequent exhaustion. According to the testimony of soldiers
                    experimentally put through forced marches of twenty miles a day, with loads of
                    half a hundredweight each, “meatextract” bears away the palm from the other
                    reputed stimulants commonly compared with it (viz., rum and coffee). “It does
                    not put a spirit into you for a few miles only, but has a lasting effect; if I
                    were ordered for continuous marching, and had my choice, I would certainly take
                    the meat extract,” said an unprejudiced sergeant to Dr Parkes, who was the
                    conductor of the experiments alluded to.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>When the continuous repair of the muscular machinery is fully secured, the
                    production of heat and force is most readily provided for by vegetable aliment,
                    by reason of the large proportion of carbon which it contains. In assigning
                    their physiological functions to the several sorts of food, nearly all the
                    business of begetting active force should ap patently be ascribed to the solid
                    hydrocarbons, starch and fat, by their conversion into carbonic acid. It is not
                    necessary to be acquainted with every step of the process, which in the body we
                    confessedly are not, to appreciate the argument. It is clearly important that
                    these elements of diet should be furnished in sufficient quantity and in a
                    digestible form. In additions to diet made in consequence of additional bodily
                    work not only should the stimulus of animal food be attended to, but the bulk of
                    starch and fat in the rations should be augmented even in larger <pb break="no"

                        type="authorial"><p>This is well illustratrated by a remarkable feat
                            performed on the Great Western Kailway in the summer of 1872. It was
                            necessary to shift the rails from the broad to the narrow gauge on
                            upwards of 500 miles of permanent way within a fortnight. The task was
                            enormous, for the Great Western is one of the few English lines whose
                            rails are held down by bolts screwed into nuts. All these had to be
                            unscrewed and replaced after removing the heavy rail two feet. About
                            3000 men were employed, working double time, sometimes from 4 in the
                            morning till 9 at night; and, without one being sick or drunk, they
                            accomplished the work in the prescribed time. The scheme for generating
                            muscular power was this. The men were hutted along the line, so as not
                            to waste their strength by coming and going, and they brought with them
                            bacon, bread, cheese, cocoa, c., to provide their usual meals at usual
                            times. But they had no beer, nor alcohol in any form. A pound and a half
                            of oatmeal and half a pound of sugar was allowed extra to each man
                            daily, and for every gang of 21 a cock was provided. The first thing
                            done in the morning was to breakfast; and then the cook and his caldron
                            started along the line till water was found convenient; a fireplace of
                            stones was built, and the pot boiled. Oatmeal was then sprinkled into it
                            with sugar, and thoroughly well boiled till thin gruel was made. As soon
                            as the “shout for drink” was heard, buckets were filled and carried
                            round with small pannikins to convey the liquid to the panting mouths.
                            The men liked it exceedingly, and learned by experience the importance
                            of having it well cooked.</p><p>The incident may remind the reader of
                            classical medicine of Hippocrates, who considers the culinary
                            preparation of oatmeal ptisan so important that in a short treatise <hi
                                rend="italic">On the Treatment of Acute Disease</hi> he devotes to
                            it the only cookery recipe he has inserted in his works. He describes
                            how it is to be boiled till it can swell no longer (so that it may swell
                            no more in the stomach), how it is to be settled and strained (through a
                            coarse cullender). He prescribes it indeed for sick people but he would
                            have been the first to agree with our advanced physiologists in the
                            opinion that overstrained muscular effort produces the same effects as
                            continued fever (es <hi rend="italic">τrvftτυv κaθlστaτaι

                <p>The first is aimed at by considerably adding to the daily amount of nitrogenous
                    and by diminishing farinaceous and liquid food, and providing that it should be
                    so consumed as to be fully digested. The second and third are secured by
                    gradually increasing the demands made upon the muscles, till they have learnt to
                    exert at will all the powers of which they are capable, and for as long a period
                    as the natural structure of the individual frame permits. “Wind” is improved by
                    choosing as part of the training an exercise, such as running, which can be
                    sustained only when the respiratory and circulating organs do their duty

                <p>The Cambridge system differs very slightly, and in neither is any exaggerated
                    severity of discipline enforced, while some latitude is permitted to
                    peculiarities and a wish for variety, and plenty of time is left for business
                    and social intercourse. Other plans are objectionable, from involving, without
                    any corresponding advantage, a complete departure from the usual habits of the
                    educated classes. For instance, according to Clasper, dinner is to be at noon,
                    with only a light tea afterwards, and no supper. Then a country walk of four or
                    five miles is to be taken before breakfast, and two hours row afterwards, and
                    another hard row between dinner and tea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    “Stonehenge,” again, requires the time between breakfast and dinner to be spent
                    entirely on billiards, skittles, quoits, rowing, and running, in spite of

                    do not either benefit their health or lengthen their lives by the sacrifice. For
                    it is notorious that “over-training” leads to a condition of system in which the
                    sufferers describe themselves as “fallen to pieces.” The most peculiar symptom
                    is a sudden loss of voluntary power after exertion. It is sometimes called
                    “fainting,” but there is no loss of sense, and it is quickly relieved by liquid
                    food. It is to the pathologist a timely warning of that consequence of
                    overstrained muscle which constitutes paralysis scriptorum, turner’s palsy, and
                    blacksmith’s palsy, and which results in fatty degeneration of the red muscular
                    fibre. To get and to keep its health a muscle needs a constant alternation of
                    active contraction and rest, and an enforced protraction of either one or the
                    other leads to the loss of vital properties. The limbs of an Indian fakir,
                    voluntarily held in a strained posture, or those of a bed-ridden invalid, are
                    equally apt to become useless. Overtrained persons are also liable to a languor
                    and apparent weakness, which is found on examination to depend on an excessive
                    secretion of urea by the kidneys.</p>
                <p>Such are not the results, however, of the training adopted at the universities,
                    by which it would appear that the constitution is strengthened, the intellect
                    sharpened, and life lengthened. Dr John Morgan <hi rend="italic">(University
                        Oars,</hi> 1873), has collected statistics of the subsequent health of those
                    who have rowed in the university races since 1829, and he finds that, whereas at
                    twenty years of age, according to Farr’s life tables, average expectation of
                    survival is forty years, for these oarmen it js forty-two years. Moreover, in
                    the cases of death, inquiry into its causes exhibits evidence of good
                    constitutions rather than the contrary, the causes consisting largely of fevers
                    and accidents, to which the vigorous and active are more exposed than the sick.
                    And <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n221/mode/1up"

                    body is cultivated, for this roll of athletes is adorned with the names of
                    bishops, poets, queen’s counsel, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi></p>
                <p>Training greatly increases the vital capacity of the chest, so that much more air
                    can be blown in and out of the lungs, and with greater force, than previously.
                    And this vital capacity endures longer than the other improvements. It is
                    evidence of the permanent elasticity of the pulmonary tissue, and an efficient
                    protection against asthma, emphysema, and other degenerations of the organ of
                    breathing.</p>
                <p>Indigestion, sleeplessness, nervous indecision, palpitation of heart, and
                    irregularity of bowels disappear under training; but if they exist, the regimen
                    should be entered upon with more than usual caution.</p>
                <p>An important modification of training is that which contemplates the reduction of
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Corpulence</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">v.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >),</hi> which has increased to the extent of interfering with comfort and
                    preventing active exercise. If an exhausting amount of muscular effort is
                    enforced, the digestion of meat is interfered with, while at the same time there
                    still goes on the absorption of such fat as is unavoidably present in the
                    victuals, so that the muscles and nerves lose strength, while the adipose tissue
                    grows. Besides this, if by violent means the weight is worked down, then, to
                    keep it down, those violent means must be persisted in; and if they be neglected
                    for more interesting occupations, the burden rapidly increases to a greater
                    degree than ever. Many uncomfortably obese persons are very active in mind and
                    body, and could not add to their muscular exercise without risk of harm.</p>
                <p>Regimen, then, is more essentially important to them than to other trainers, and
                    they will probably be more induced to attend to it if they understand the
                    principles on which it is based. This is simply to exclude from the bill of fare
                    all those articles which contain fat or which by the chemical actions of the
                    digestive viscera may be converted into fat.</p>
                <p>For the reduction of corpulence the following rules may be observed for a three
                    weeks’ course :—</p>
                <p>Rise at 7, rub the body well with horse-hair gloves, have a cold bath, and take a
                    short turn in the open air. Breakfast (alone) at 8 or 8.30, on the lean of beef
                    or mutton (cutting off the fat and skin), dry toast, biscuit or oat cake, a
                    tumbler of claret and water, or tea without milk or sugar, or made in the
                    Russian way with a slice of lemon. Lunch at one on bread or biscuit, Dutch
                    cheese, salad, water-cresses, or roasted apples, hung beef or anchovies, or
                    red-herring, or olives, and similar relishes. After eating, drink claret and
                    water, or unsweetened lemonade, or plain water, in moderation. Dine at any
                    convenient hour. Avoid soup, fish, or pastry, but eat plain meat of any sort
                    except pork, rejecting the fat and skin. Spinach, haricots, or any other green
                    vegetable may be taken, but no potatoes, made dishes, or sweets. A jelly, or a
                    lemonwater-ice, or a roast apple, must suffice in their place. Take claret and
                    water at dinner, and one glass of sherry or Madeira afterwards.</p>
                <p>Between meals, as a rule, exercise must always be taken to the extent of inducing
                    perspiration. Running, when practicable, is the best form in which to take
                    it.</p>
                <p>Seven or eight pounds is as much as it is prudent to lose during the three weeks.
                    If this loss is arrived at sooner, or indeed later, the severe parts of the
                    treatment may be gradually omitted, but it is strongly recommended to modify the
                    general habits in accordance with the principle of taking as small a quantity as
                    possible of fat and sugar, or of substances which form fat and sugar, and
                    sustaining the respiratory function. By this means the weight may be gradually
                    reduced for a few months with safety.</p>
                <p>Small quantities of dilute alcoholic liquids taken with meals slightly increase
                    the activity of the renewal of the nitrogenous tissues, mainly muscle; that is
                    to say, there is a more rapid reconstruction of those parts, as is shown by the
                    augmented formation of urea and the sharpened appetite. Life is fuller and more
                    complete, old flesh is removed and food appropriated as new flesh somewhat more
                    quickly, than when no alcohol is ingested. There appeal's to be a temporary rise
                    in the digestive powers of the stomach, which is probably the initiative act.
                    The nerve functions are blunted, and a lessened excretion of phosphorus exhibits
                    a temporary check in the wear and renewal of the nerve tissue. The “vital
                    capacity” of the lungs, as indicated by the spirometer, is reduced, showing a
                    diminished oxidation of the blood.</p>
                <p>The effect on a healthy man of taking with a meal such a quantity of fermented
                    liquor as puts him at ease with himself and the world around, without untoward
                    exhilaration, is to arrest the wear of the nervous system, especially that part
                    employed in emotion and sensation. Just as often, then, as the zest for food is
                    raised to its normal standard by a little wine or beer with a meal, the moderate
                    consumer is as much really better as he feels the better for it. Where the food
                    is as keenly enjoyed without it, the consumption of a stimulant is useless. But
                    alcohol is not a source of force, and its direct action is an arrest of
                    vitality.</p>

                    Strictly speaking, it is a groundless assumption, for w e cannot say that
                    intellectual being may not exist joined to any form of matter, or quite
                    independent of matter. We certainly do not know enough of the subject to lay
                    down such a negative statement. And if it be held to mean that the amount of
                    phosphorus passing through the body bears a proportion to the intensity of
                    thought, it is simply a mis-statement. A captive lion, tiger, leopard, or hare
                    assimilates and parts with a greater amount of phosphorus than a hard-thinking
                    man; while a beaver, noted for its powers of contrivance, excretes so little
                    phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot find it in the excreta. All that the
                    physiologist is justified in asserting is that for the mind to energize in a
                    living body that body must be kept living up to a certain standard, and that
                    forthe continuous renewal of life a supply of phosphatifc salts is required. The
                    same may be said with equal justice of water, fat, nitrogen, chloride of sodium,
                    oxygen, &amp;c. The phosphates are wanted indeed, but wanted by pinches, whereas
                    water is required by pailfuls. A few days without water, or a few minutes
                    without oxygen, will terminate the train of consciousness. The practical points
                    taught us by physiology are that for the integrity of thought integrity of the
                    nervous tissue is requisite, and for the integrity of the nervous tissue a due
                    quantity of such food as contains digestible ρhosphatic salts.</p>
                <p>The most perfect regimen for the healthy exercise of thought is such as would be
                    advised for a growing boy, viz., frequent small supplies of easily soluble mixed
                    food, so as to furnish the greatest quantity of nutriment without overloading
                    the stomach, or running the risk of generating morbid half-assimilated products.
                    For it is essential to the intellectual direction of the nervous system that it
                    should not be oppressed by physical impediments. The presence in the stomach or
                    blood of imperfectly assimilated nutriment impedes its functions in close
                    proportion to their amount, so that not only the constituents, but the mode of
                    administering food, must come into the calculation. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi

                    proverb, the application of which saves many a brain and many a stomach from

                    meals, entire abstinence from it during meals, and rest again till the weight

                <p>The physiology of the action of alcohol has a very important bearing on the
                    physical management of the mental functions. Alcohol has the power of curbing,
                    arresting, and suspending all the manifestations of the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0222-0205"/> nervous system, so that we feel its influence
                    on our thoughts sooner than on any other part of the system. Sometimes it brings
                    them more completely under our command, controls and steadies them; more often
                    it confuses or disconnects them, and then breaks off our power over them
                    altogether. When a man has tired himself by intellectual exertion, a moderate
                    quantity of alcoholic stimulant taken with food acts as an anaesthetic, stays
                    the wear of the system which is going on, and allows the nerve force to be
                    turned to the due digestion of the meal. But it must be followed by rest from
                    toil, and is in essence a part of the same treatment which includes rest—it is
                    an artificial rest. To continue to labour and at the same time t∙.&gt; take an
                    anaesthetic is a physiological inconsistency. The drug merely blunts the useful
                    feeling of weariness, and prevents it from acting as a warning. There is no
                    habit more fatal to a literary man than that of taking stimulants between meals;
                    the vital powers go on wearing out more and more without their cry for help
                    being perceived, and in the end break down irrevocably.</p>
                <p>As to quantity, the appetite for solid food is the safest guide. If a better
                    dinner or supper is eaten when it is accompanied by a certain amount of
                    fermented liquor, that is the amount most suitable; if a worse, then an excess
                    is committed, however little be taken.</p>
                <p>The aim of the diet should be (to quote the words of John Milton) “to preserve
                    the body’s health and hardness, to render lightsome, clear, and not lumpish
                    abedience to the mind, to the cause of religion and our country’s liberty, when
                    it shall require from hearts in sound bodies to stand and cover their
                    stations.”</p>
                <p>It is especially when the mind of genius is overshadowed by the dark clouds of
                    threatened insanity, of hypochondriasis, or of hysteria, that a rational mode of
                    life preserves it. Nothing but daily exercise, temperate meals, and a punctual
                    observance of regular hours of rest and study could have kept burning the
                    flickering reason in poor Cowper.</p>
                <p>As regards the proper quantity of alcohol that may be used the two following
                    questions naturally occur—How is a man to know when he has had enough? and what
                    are the signs of too much î The ancients used to wear dark red or purple
                    engraved gems, which they considered preservatives against excess, and called
                    them <hi rend="italic">aμeθvστoi,</hi> “sober-stones,” “amethysts.” The name is
                    now limited to the violet rock crystal, but in early times it was applied to
                    several other stones, cut in intaglio, and* worn on the fingers at festive
                    gatherings. Só long as the wearer could decipher the minute works of art they
                    bore, he had not reached excess. A more delicate test still is the appreciation
                    of temperature by the skin; if a draught does not chill, if a hot room fails to
                    produce the usual discomfort, the wise man knows he has exceeded and must stop
                    at once. In short, the safest rule is that when there is a consciousness of any
                    psychical effect at all beyond that of satisfaction at the relief of bodily
                    weariness—such a satisfaction as is felt on taking a good meal by a vigorous
                    person—then the limits of moderation have been attained. On ordinary occasions
                    of daily life, and “for the stomach’s sake,” no more should be taken. Each fresh
                    drop is a step downwards to the evil results of alcohol. But to the practiser of
                    daily temperance, festive occasions are safe and may be beneficial. A man may
                    from time to time keep up without harm the above mentioned sense of satisfaction
                    by good and digestible wine in good company without fear of getting drunk or
                    failure of health, if lie makes it a law to himself to stop as soon as he
                    experiences any hurry of ideas or indistinctness of the senses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diet of Mothers.—</hi> During pregnancy as much care should be
                    taken not to get too fat as is taken by an athlete training for a race. The

                    but¶t is not desirable to carry the process so far.</p>
                <p>There is a temptation at this time to increase the usual allowance of stimulant;
                    alcohol is taken between meals to overcome the nausea and depression incident to
                    the state of body. And by this mistaken expedient the nausea gradually becomes
                    dyspeptic vomiting. On leaving it off the sickness ceases. A mother should also
                    remember that nearly all the alcohol she consumes mixes with her blood, which
                    now is one with the blood of the faetus.</p>
                <p>During lactation the most suitable drink for a mother is cow’s milk, fresh and
                    unskimmed. If it turns sour on the stomach, lime-water mixed with it not only
                    corrects the acescence, but also supplies a valuable aid to the growing bones of
                    the infant. In her solid dietary also milk may be fairly taken as the type of a
                    due admixture of alimentary principles, because it is not individual growth, or
                    the production of muscular force, but the secretion of milk, that is the object
                    of the selection of diet.</p>

                    the deficiency.</p>

                    benefit therefore most from temperance in eating. Everybody who has passed the
                    age of fifty, or thereabouts, with a fairly unimpaired constitution, will act
                    wisely in diminishing his daily quantity of solid food. There is less demand for
                    the materials of growth, and consequently animal food should bear a smaller
                    proportion than heretofore to vegetable, and it is mainly in that ingredient of
                    the diet that reduction should be effected. Neglect of this rule in declining
                    years is often punished by gout, a disease attributable to excess of nitrogenous
                    aliment, and for this reason common in elderly men.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of life the advantages derived from fermented liquor are more
                    advantageous, and the injuries it can inflict less injurious to the body than in
                    youth. The effect of alcohol is to check the activity of destructive
                    assimilation, to arrest that rapid flux of the substance of the frame which in
                    healthy youth can hardly be excessive, but which in old age exhausts the vital
                    force. Loss of appetite is a frequent and a serious symptom in old age. It
                    usually arises from deficient formation of gastric juice, which, in common with
                    other secretions, diminishes with years. It is best treated physiologically
                    rather than by drugs.</p>

                    been presupposed. The modifications necessitated by sickness are of three
                    kinds:—first the avoidance of such articles of consumption as would increase the
                    disease under the special circumstances, although ordinarily wholesome; second,
                    the maintenance of the functions <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n223/mode/1up"

                    third, the administration, for a special curative purpose, of peculiar food
                    which would not be recommended for general use.</p>
                <p>In all <hi rend="italic">fevers,</hi> which are classed together as being
                    apparently due to a poison multiplying itself in the blood, the art of diet
                    consists in giving an almost continuous supply of liquid nutriment, holding very
                    soluble aliments in a dilute form. There is nothing so digestible as water, and
                    we take advantage of this high digestibility to get whatever it can dissolve
                    digested along with it. For the first three or even four days patients
                    previously strong should have only farinaceous food, well boiled and cooled to
                    the temperature of the body. Evidence has been already quoted of the power which
                    oatmeal gruel possesses of sustaining force under the trying circumstances of
                    excessive toil. Now, fever closely resembles muscular effort in its arrest of
                    the digestive functions, at the same moment that it makes an urgent demand for
                    nutriment. With ultraEgyptian rigour, while straw is withheld, “the tale of the
                    bricks is doubled,” and we know by the quantity of urea and phosphates in the
                    urine, and by the faecal excretion, that the muscles and nerves of the
                    bed-ridden sufferer are melting away as fast as if he were scaling the Alps with
                    nothing to eat. It is quite reasonable to transfer the experiences derived from
                    health to sickness, and to feel satisfied that we are not wasting precious
                    opportunities when we are giving fever patients such a time-honoured diet as
                    oatmeal gruel, care being taken that it is thoroughly well boiled. After three
                    days the tissues are beginning to suffer, and it is advisable to add chicken
                    broth, meat jelly, and strong soup. Let that be supplied which the emaciation
                    shows to be passing away—nitrogenous tissue.</p>
                <p>The administration of alcohol is to be regulated partly by the temperature and
                    partly by the condition of the nervous system. Usually if the heat of the blood
                    (as taken at the axilla) is above 103°, and always if it is above 105°, there is
                    a necessity for it. Again, if there is great prostration of strength, or tremor
                    of the hands, or quivering in the voice and respiration, if there is low
                    muttering delirium when the patient is left quiet, it is required.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Green-sickness,</hi> or anaemia, is characterized by the rapid
                    disappearance of the red particles which float in the blood. To what a strange
                    extent this goes may be seen by looking at the insides of the lips, which
                    naturally hold such a quantity of the fluid as to be quite scarlet, but which
                    now are pale like those of a corpse. It is calculated that the loss of material
                    in marked cases of green-sickness may amount to three pounds of this important
                    constituent of the blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of remedies, notably iron, the appetite can be so regulated as to enjoy meat in
                    excess of the immediate wants of the body, that meat is converted into
                    haematine, and the healthy hue returns to the cheeks as quickly as it left. Wine
                    is useful at meals on account of the stimulus it gives to ths appetite; it is
                    injurious between meals by spoiling it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute rheumatism</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acute gout</hi> are
                    best treated on an opposite principle. A nutrient nitrogenous diet, which the
                    patient assimilates only too readily, retards recovery, and will even bring on a
                    relapse during convalescence. If meat in any form, solid or liquid, be eaten, it
                    seems to turn into acid, which is already in excess in the blood. The power of
                    fully converting it into living flesh is wanting, and until this power is
                    regained a semi-conversion into an organic acid takes place. The redder and more
                    muscular the meat is, the more it disagrees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chronic gout</hi> is indubitably due to good cheer indulged in,
                    either by the sufferer or his ancestors. When a man day after day swallows more
                    nitrogenous food than is wanted for the repair of his tissues, the following
                    results may be expected, with variations dependent upon his original
                    constitution. If the digestive solvents are weak and scanty, the excess passes
                    through the canal in an undigested state, and is partially decomposed there.
                    Thereon ensue all sorts of abdominal derangements, which, however, have the
                    advantage of getting rid of the offending matters. If, on the other hand, the
                    stomach secretes vigorously on being stimulated, then indeed the excess is
                    digested and absorbed, and is subject to the future changes consequent on
                    assimilation. An active out-of-door life neutralizes this in some measure by
                    augmenting oxidation; much of the albumen goes to form glycogen, and acts as a
                    fuel for the maintenance of muscular force. The balance is wasted in an
                    unexplained way, and does not necessarily injure a hardy frame. The violent
                    muscular exertion and high training needful for oxidation being inconsistent
                    with the habits of intellectual society, a man in the prime of life who puts too
                    much meat into a good stomach habitually retains in his blood an excess of uric
                    acid, into which the nitrogenous waste converts itself. Uric acid in the blood
                    has been distinctly traced as the essence of gout. Perhaps this imaginary first
                    offender develops the full consequences; and that is the best thing that can
                    happen, inducing greater carefulness in future.</p>
                <p>These views can suggest but one line of preventive treatment. The children of
                    gouty families should be brought up to a life of strict abstemiousness and
                    muscular activity. From the earliest years vegetables and “meagre” soups should
                    form a considerable portion of their dietary.</p>
                <p>Gouty adults require meat but once in twenty-four hours. The bill of fare should
                    be varied from day to day, but as simple as possible at each meal. Rich sauces
                    are to be eschewed, and a lemon, an infusion of herbs and pepper, bread-sauce,
                    or a purée of vegetables, adopted in their place. Sugar at the end of meals
                    generates an excess of organic acid, and is to be avoided; if cheese is eaten it
                    should be new, and is best toasted and creamed.</p>
                <p>Dilute alkaline waters containing soda, such as Apollinaris or the weaker Vichy,
                    are a rational drink during meals; but it is probably best to keep to pure
                    water. Those who live idle lives require no alcohol; and it should not be an
                    habitual accompaniment to meals.</p>

                    Bright’s disease is closely associated with increased arterial tension, alcohol

                <p>For the cure of these diseases, independent of the nutrition of the rest of the
                    body, a milk diet has been proposed, and it seems to offer a fair prospect, if
                    the patients can be persuaded to persist in it. How safely a milk diet may be
                    adopted in middle life is shown by the example of Dr Cheyne, a Bath physician of
                    the last century, who at about fifty-five restricted himself entirely to milk
                    and biscuits, and yet was able to fulfil the duties of his laborious profession.
                    He took at first of the former six pints, of the latter twelve ounces; but he
                    shortly diminished the quantity to half, and after sixteen years’ experience
                    found it fully sufficient, and indeed capable of further reduction in

                    of the imperfection lies in a deficiency in the supply of nerve power to the
                    stomach, so that it both secretes its solvent fluid and also rotates its
                    contents too slowly; and the more it is loaded the slower it goes. Of the
                    medicinal means of curing such a state this is not the place to speak; but none
                    of them will avail without the aid of a rational dietary. Time must be given to
                    the oppressed organ wherein to empty itself of every complete meal, and such a
                    period of rest given as will allow of the recovery of force; or if the meals are
                    frequent they must be very sparing. The observations of Busch (Virchow’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Archiv.</hi> xiv.) show that a period of five hours elapses in
                    the healthy subject before a fully filled stomach can empty itself, and in the
                    dyspeptic the process is still longer. Whenever, therefore, the organ is loaded
                    as healthy people rightly load it, a man should allow at least seven or eight
                    hours to elapse before sitting down to another meal. And he must never eat till
                    the need for food is announced by appetite. Perhaps a more generally applicable
                    and easier obeyed law is not to make full meals at all, but to stop short àt the
                    feeling of repletion, and, when that has gone off, again to take in the supply
                    allowed by circumstances. Three moderate meals are usually sufficient to keep up
                    the strength.</p>
                <p>Meat should be once cooked. Mutton, feathered fowl, venison, lamb, and beef are
                    digestible in the order they here are placed in. The more difficult dishes
                    should have the longest time allowed to them. Of the farinaceous articles of
                    diet, bread and biscuits are the most easily penetrated by the gastric juices,
                    and all their preparations are safe. The best bread is the “aerated,” which is
                    free from decomposing yeast. Macaroni is good if soaked till quite macerated.
                    Pastry is difficult of solution. Vegetables are very necessary; cauliflowers,
                    Jerusalem artichokes, beetroot, French beans, soft peas, stewed celery,
                    turnip-tops, spinach, are the most readily disposed of.</p>
                <p>When the usual mixture of meat and vegetables is found to induce flatulence, it
                    is a good expedient to eat vegetables only at one meal and meat and bread only
                    at another. The principle on which this plan is based is that starchy food is
                    dissolved mainly by the alkaline saliva, whereas meat is dissolved by the acid
                    gastric juice. In a vigorous person both these are copious enough to render
                    immaterial their mutual neutralization, but when they are scanty, their separate
                    employment is a physiological economy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Consumption</hi> is a disease whose treatment is almost wholly
                    dietetic. The children of a mother whose pedigree exhibits proof of a
                    consumptive tendency may with propriety be put to a healthy wet nurse
                    immediately on birth, and, on being weaned, be fed from a Channel Island cow.
                    The milk should be boiled and then cooled down to tepidity. A small tea-spoonful
                    of “saccharated solution of lime” may be advantageously added to each quart of
                    milk when the coming tèeth require the elements of their nutrition to be added
                    to the diet. The rules already given for the healthy management of the young
                    should be adhered to with unusual strictness, and any departure from them should
                    be made only to provide for some peculiar necessity of the case according to
                    medical advice.</p>
                <p>In cases of consumption it is difficult to say that drugs are useless, but
                    certainly those that come nearest to aliments have most evidence in their
                    favour, such as iron, cod-liver oil, and the phosphates of lime. Their effect on
                    the appetite must be sedulously watched, and the end must not be sacrificed to
                    the means; that is to say, if they spoil the appetite, they must be left off.
                    The reason for administering oil is to afford an easily assimilated basis of
                    renewed organic growth, to take the place of the abnormal tendency to form
                    tubercular matter. If anything prevents its easy assimilation it is obviously
                    useless. The use of climate in the treatment of phthisis may be tested by its
                    dietetic action; if it improves the appetite, it is doing good; if it injures
                    the appetite, it is doing harm.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Scurvy</hi> is a notable example of a disease of which, more
                    than any other, the prevention depends on the adoption of a suitable diet. Its
                    symptoms so far resemble those of general starvation that from the earliest time
                    of its appearance in history it has been suspected that it is due to a dietary
                    defective in some necessary ingredient; and practical observation soon showed
                    that this was fresh vegetables. It was found on every long voyage that the crew
                    suffered from scurvy in proportion to the length of time they were restricted to
                    dry food, and that they recovered rapidly as soon as they got access to a supply
                    of succulent plants. This requisite for health is obviously the most difficult
                    of all things to procure aboard ship, and efforts were made to find a substitute
                    capable of marine transport. From the time of Hawkins<note anchored="true"

                    downwards the opinion has been expressed by all the most intelligent travellers
                    that a substitute is to be found in the juice of fruits of the orange tribes,
                    such as oranges, lemons, &amp;c. But in its natural state this is expensive and
                    troublesome to carry, so that skippers and owners for a couple of centuries
                    found it expedient to be sceptical. The pictures of scurvy as it appeared during
                    the 18th century ⅛re horrible in the extreme. But the statute of 1795, passed
                    through the exertions of Captain Cook and Sir Gilbert Blane, has enforced the
                    carrying of lime-juice. This invaluable preventive has shown its influence all
                    the more decidedly by the disease still appearing occasionally under strong
                    promoting circumstances, and to a certain extent in spite of the antidote; but
                    it is so modified as to be usually more of the nature of a warning or
                    demonstration than of a serious invasion. Some indeed have questioned and even
                    denied altogether the blessings derived from the enforced use of lime-juice. But
                    they make a very scanty show when weighed with those whom they undertake to
                    oppose; and it is superfluous here to enter into the arguments and results of
                    observation constituting the ponderous <hi rend="italic">Report of the Committee

                    seems to settle for ever the preventive powers against scurvy of the use of
                    lime-juice.</p>
                <p>The committee alluded to was appointed in. consequence of one of those
                    exceptional outbreaks of scurvy induced by exceptional circumstances. The ships
                    sent on the exploring expedition of 1875 were amply provided with lime-juice,
                    and with printed expositions of its value. During the voyage out and in the long
                    inaction of the winter the men’s health was so well preserved by general
                    attention to <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0225-0208"/> hygiene that no cases of even mild scurvy
                    were detected; the pallor and languor and depression of spirits of some among
                    the sailors were attributed to the want of sunlight for 142 days, and it was
                    expected that a few days sledge travelling in the open air would reinvigorate
                    them. There was plenty of lime-juice aboard: but it seems that it is not the
                    custom to add to the weight of provisions, which Polar sledging parties have to
                    propel, by including the preservative amongst them. Sir George Nares, the
                    commander of the expedition, cites the names of 10 admirals, 10 doctors, and 15
                    captains who have conducted land explorations in this fashion without it; and
                    they returned unscathed to any serious extent. But on this recent occasion the
                    crews seem to have been peculiarly predisposed to illnesses of scorbutic nature
                    by the more than ordinary scarcity of fresh meat in their dietary, arising out
                    of the deficiency of game in the extremely high latitude where they wintered.
                    With few exceptions the whole of the crews of the “Alert” and the “Discovery”
                    were employed in sledging, and the consequence was, that of the 122 officers and
                    men, 59 were more or less incapacitated by scurvy, and 4 died.</p>
                <p>The real reason for not carrying lime-juice in such expeditions is its
                    cumbersomeness. Including bottles, though in truth they are not wanted in a hard
                    frost, it may be said that lib a week for each man would have to be added to the
                        baggage,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In merchant

                            examined seems to agree that the quantity is not sufficient, and advise

                    with a view of remedying the inconvenience, medical men have long sought to
                    discover to what constituent of the complicated mixture afforded by nature it is
                    that it owes its efficacy. In a contribution to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Medico-Chirurgical Review</hi> for 1848, Dr Parkes examined exhaustively
                    the evidence concerning the various deficiencies in ship food as compared with
                    fresh food which might be filled up by one or other of the components of
                    lime-juice; and by exclusion he is led to the conclusion that the cause of
                    scurvy is to be found in deficiency of salts whose acids form carbonates in the
                    system, viz., citric, tartaric, acetic, lactic, and malic acids.</p>
                <p>Though not so good as when in their natural form, because less digestible and
                    pleasant, yet a supply of citrates, tartrates, lactates, and malates of potash
                    might be packed in small bulk, and, under circumstances where weight is of
                    importance, might take the place of lime-juice. Or bolo-lozenges might.be made
                    of lime-juice freed from its aqueous portion and preserved with sugar. Three or
                    four of these a day might be easily swallowed without stopping work.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the subject of maritime scurvy, it may be suggested how useful it
                    would be if those who sail in desolate regions were to carry seeds of
                    antiscorbutic vegetables, which, strewn broadcast in uninhabited places, would
                    form a flora capable of saving the lives of many a wrecked or weather-bound
                    crew.</p>
                <p>Scurvy, as landsmen see it in time of peace, amounts to little more than anaemia
                    with a softening and bleeding condition of the gums. But it indicates the use of
                    exactly the same preventives and remedies as the more severe complaint.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Starvation</hi> is a disease which it is a platitude to say may
                    be prevented by diet; nevertheless there are connected with it a few
                    peculiarities of scientific and practical interest which may not be unworthy of
                    notice. “Inedia,” as it is called in the nomenclature of diseases by the London
                    College of Physicians, is of two kinds, arising from <hi rend="italic">want of
                        food</hi> and from <hi rend="italic">want of water.</hi></p>
                <p>When entirely deprived of nutriment the human body is capable of supporting life
                    under ordinary circumstances for little more than a week. In the spring of 1869
                    this was tried on the person of a “fasting girl” in South Wales. The parents
                    made a show of their child, decking her out like a bride on a bed, and asserting
                    that she had eaten no food for two years. Some reckless enthusiasts for truth
                    set four trustworthy hospital nurses to watch her; the Celtic obstinacy of the
                    parents was roused, and in defence of their imposture they allowed death to take
                    place in eighζ days. Their trial and conviction for manslaughter may be found in
                    the daily periodicals of the date; but, strange to say, the experimental
                    physiologists and nurses escaped scot-free. There is no doubt that in this
                    instance the unnatural quietude, the grave-like silence, and the dim religious
                    light in which the victim was kept contributed to defer death.</p>
                <p>One thing which remarkably prolongs life is a supply of water. Dogs furnished
                    with as much as they wished to drink were found by Μ. Chossat <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Sur</hi><hi rend="italic">VInanition,</hi> Paris, 1843) to live three
                    times as long as those who were deprived of solids and liquids at the same time.
                    Even wetting the skin with sea-water has been found useful by shipwrecked
                    sailors. Four men and a boy of fourteen who got shut in the Tynewydd mine near
                    Forth, in South Wales, in the winter of 1876-7 for ten days without food, were
                    not only alive when released, but several of them were able to walk, and all
                    subsequently recovered. The thorough saturation of the narrow space with aqueous
                    vapour, and the presence of drain water in the cutting, were probably their
                    chief preservatives,—assisted by the high even temperature always found in the
                    deeper headings of coal mines, and by the enormous compression of the confined
                    air. This doubtless prevented evaporation, and retarded vital processes
                    dependent upon oxidation. The accumulation of carbonic acid in the breathed air
                    would also have a similar arrestive power over destructive assimilation. These
                    prisoners do not seem to have felt any of the severer pangs of hunger, for they
                    were not tempted to eat their candles. With the instinctive feeling that
                    darkness adds a horror to death, they preferred to use them for light.</p>
                <p>It is a paradoxical fact, that the supply of the stomach even from the substance
                    of the starving individual’s body should tend to prolong life. In April 1874, a
                    case was recorded of exposure in an open boat for 32 days of three men and two
                    boys, with only ten days provisions, exclusive of old boots and jelly-fish. They
                    had a fight in their delirium, aud one was severely wounded. As the blood gushed
                    out he lapped it up; and instead of suffering the fatal weakness which might
                    have been expected from the hemorrhage, he seems to have done well. Experiments
                    have been performed by a French physiologist, Μ. Anselmier <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Archives</hi><hi rend="italic">Gén. de Médecine,</hi> 1860, vol. i. p.
                    169), with the object of trying to preserve the lives of dogs by what he calls
                    “artificial autophagy.” He fed them on the blood taken from their own veins
                    daily, depriving them of all other food, and he found that the fatal cooling
                    incident to starvation was thus postponed, and existence prolonged. Life lasted
                    till the emaciation had proceeded to six-tenths of the animal’s weight, as in
                    Chossat’s experiments, extending to the fourteenth day, instead of ending on the
                    tenth day, as was the case with other dogs which were not bled.</p>
                <p>These instances of the application of the art of dietetics to the treatment of
                    disease are sufficient to show the principles which should be kept in sight. The
                    pathology of the ailment should be considered first, then its bearing upon the
                    digestive organs, and lastly the bearing of the digestive organs upon it.</p>
                <p>And before quitting the subject of health as affected by diet, the common-sense
                    hint may be given to those who are in good sanitary condition, that they cannot
                    do better than let well alone. The most trustworthy security for future health

                <p><hi rend="italic">Pleasure as an object of Dietetics.</hi></p>
                <p>The social importance of gratifying the palate has certainly never been denied in
                    practice by any of the human race. Feasting has been adopted from the earliest
                    times as the most natural expression of joy, and the readiest means of creating
                    joy. If ascetics have seemed to put the pleasure away from them, they have done
                    so in the hope of purchasing by their sacrifice something greater and nobler,
                    and have thus tacitly conceded, if not exaggerated, its real value. Experience
                    shows that its indulgence, unregulated by the natural laws which govern our
                    progress in civilization, leads to unutterable degradation and meanness,
                    brutalizes the mind, and deadens its perception of the repulsiveness of vice and
                    crime. But that is no cause why this powerful motive power, governed by right
                    reason, should not be made subservient to the highest purposes.</p>
                <p>The times of meals must be regulated with a regard to the disposal of the
                    remainder of the day, whether that depends on choice or on necessity. Violent
                    exertion of either mind or body retards digestion; and therefore, when this is
                    practised, food is not called for so soon as on a day of rest. The heaviest meal
                    should be postponed till the day’s work is done; it is then that social home
                    joys give the requisite repose to the body and mind. Light eaters may dine as
                    late as they please, but those of larger appetite should lengthen the interval
                    between their repast and bed-time. After the night’s sleep and the long fast
                    which has emptied the digestive canal of its nutritive contents, a breakfast
                    should be taken before any of the real business of life be begun. It is no proof
                    of health or vigour to forego it without inconvenience; but it is proof of
                    health and vigour to be able to lay in then a solid foundation for the day’s
                    labour. Not less than four and not more than six hours should elapse before the
                    store is again replenished. A light farinaceous lunch with vegetables and fruit
                    may be made most appetizing, and is followed by a cheerful afternoon, whereas a
                    ponderous meat and wine meal entails heaviness of spirit.</p>

                    thus far, that the mixed fare, which has met the approval of so many generations
                    of men, is that which is most in accordance with reason. But there are
                    physiologists who argue that our teeth resemble those of the vegetable-feeding
                    apes more than those of any other class of animal, and that therefore our most
                    appropriate food must be of the fruits of the earth.<note anchored="true"

                    to fit food for digestion by cookery, it is probable no diet would suit us
                    better. But our reason must not be left out of account, and it is surely quite
                    as natural for a man to cook and eat every thing that contains in a convenient
                    form starch, fat, albumen, fibre, and phosphorus, as it is for a monkey to eat
                    nuts or an ox grass. The human race is naturally omnivorous.</p>
                <p>Moreover, man is able not only to develop his highest faculties and perform all
                    his duties on any form of digestible aliment, but he is able also very much to
                    diminish the requisite quantities by a due admixture. The diet which supplies
                    the demand most accurately will be the most economical in the highest sense. And
                    that this diet is a mixed one can be shown by the following method of
                    calculation. We can measure by experiment the ultimate elements of all that is
                    thrown off from the body as the result of vital decomposition, the ashes, the
                    smoke, and the gases which the fire of life produces; and thus we can lay down a
                    rule for the minimum quantity of those elements which the daily food must
                    contain to keep up the standard weight. If the diet be such as to make it
                    necessary to eat too much of one element in order to secure a sufficient amount
                    of another, there is a waste, and the digestive viscera are burdened with a
                    useless load. But there is no single article procurable for the food of the
                    adult population which presents the exact proportion of elements required by an
                    adult, and therefore no single article alone can supply human wants without
                    waste.</p>
                <p>As an example, apply this reckoning to the elements carbon and nitrogen, which
                    constitute the main bulk of the solids in our food and in our bodies. Suppose a
                    gang of 100 healthy prisoners to excrete, in the shape of breathed air and
                    evacuations, 71¾ tt&gt; of carbon and 4¾ lb of nitrogen (which is pretty nearly
                    the actual amount of those elements in the dried solids of the secreta, as
                    estimated by current physiological works). Both nitrogen and carbon to that
                    extent must of course be supplied in the food. Now, if you fed them on bread
                    only, there would be wanted daily at least 380 lb of it to sustain them alive
                    long, for it takes that weight to yield the 4¾ ⅛ of nitrogen daily excreted;
                    while, in the 380 lb of bread there are 128∣ lb of carbon, which is 57 lb above
                    the needful quantity of that substance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    would have to be found 354 lb of lean meat in order to give the 71 ⅛ lb of
                    carbon; and thus there would be wasted 105 lb of nitrogen contained in the meat,
                    over and above the 4⅛ lb really required to prevent emaciation.<note

                <p>When work is undertaken, much more is actually wanted. According to Mr Vizetelly,
                    the labourer in a Spanish vineyard consumes daily between 8 and 9 lb of
                    vegetable food, consisting of bread, onion-porridge, and grapes.<note

                    in our dealings with social economy. Mr Joule of Manchester analyzed, about
                    thirty years ago, the relation which the heat, used as a source of power in
                    machinery, bore to the force of motion thus made active. He'showed that raising
                    the temperature of 1 ſh of water 1° Fahr, was equivalent to raising 772 lb to
                    the height of 1 foot; and conversely, that the fall of 772 fi&gt; might be so
                    applied as to heat 1 lb of water l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> Fahr. Thus,
                    the mechanical work represented in lifting 772 lb 1 foot, or 1 lb 772 feet,
                    forms the “dynamic equivalent,” the measure of the possible strength of T of
                    temperature as marked by the thermometer in 1 lb of water. Physiologists seized
                    eagerly on the opportunity which Joule’s demonstration seemed to afford them of
                    estimating in actual numerals the relation of living bodies to the work they
                    have to do. So much earth raised on an embankment represents so much heat
                    developed in the machinery, be it living or dead. The fully digested food,
                    converted through several stages into gaseous, liquid, and solid excretory
                    matters, produces by its chemical changes a definite amount of heat, of which a
                    definite amount escapes and a definite amount is employed in working the
                    involuntary machinery of the body, and the rest is available for conversion at
                    will into voluntary muscular actions.</p>
                <p>It may be reckoned that the daily expenditure of force in working the machinery
                    of the body—in raising the diaphragm about 1 <hi rend="italic">5</hi> times and
                    contracting the heart about 60 times a minute, in continuously rolling the wave
                    of the intestinal canal, and in various other involuntary movements, without
                    anything to be fairly called work,—it may be reckoned that the expenditure of
                    force in doing this is equal to that which would raise a man of 10 stone 10,000
                    feet.</p>
                <p>There are several reasons for believing that in assigning their physiological
                    functions to the several sorts of food, nearly all the business of begetting
                    force should be ascribed to the solid hydrocarbons, starch and oil, by their
                    conversion into carbonic acid and water, just as there are good grounds for
                    thinking that it is the conversion of the solid hydrocarbon of coal into the
                    same substances which drives a locomotive. To the nitrogenous aliments seems
                    allotted primarily the task of continuously replacing the wear and tear of the
                    nitrogenous tissues, while any excess of them assists the starch and oil in
                    keeping up the animal heat.</p>
                <p>One of the most cogent of the reasons for this view is that the chief nitrogenous
                    excretion, the urea, is not increased in amount in proportion to the work done,
                    as shown by the experiments of Messrs Fink and Wiscelenus; whereas the excretion
                    of carbonic acid in a decided manner follows the amount of muscular exertion.
                    Now, it is very clear that if the supply of power to do work depended on the
                    decomposition and renewal of the muscles by flesh food, the urea must be exactly
                    proportioned to the exertion, which is not the case.</p>
                <p>To give an example of the mode of working out a problem by this theory. Professor
                    Frankland, in a series of'experiments made in 18fi6 at the Royal Institution,
                    and published in the <hi rend="italic">London Philosophical Magazine,</hi> vol.
                    xxxii. p. 182, ascertains with the “calorimeter” (which reckons the <hi
                        rend="italic">amount</hi> of heat evolved as a thermometer does its <hi
                        rend="italic">degree)</hi> the quantity of energy or force evolved under the
                    form of heat during the oxidation of a given weight of alimentary substance. It
                    has been explained that heat and mechanical work, being convertible into one
                    another, bear a constant proportion to one another; so that a definite
                    production of so much heat invariably represents the potentiality of so much
                    motion, used or wasted according to circumstances. From the reading of the
                    calorimeter therefore may be calculated how many extra pounds ought to be raised
                    a foot high by a man who has eaten an extra pound of the food in question; how
                    many steps a foot high he ought to raise a weight of ten stone (say himself)
                    before he has worked out the value of his victuals. Professor Frankland has thus
                    estimated the comparative value of foods as bases of muscular exertion, and he
                    has made out a table of the weight and cost of various articles that would
                    require to be consumed daily to enable a man to support life, the equivalent of
                    which has been already reckoned as the muscular force in action which would
                    raise a man of 10 stone 10,000 feet.</p>

                <p>After the supply of sufficient albuminoid matters in the food to provide for the
                    necessary renewal of the tissues, the best materials for the production of
                    internal and external work are non-nitrogenous matters, such as oil, fat, sugar,
                    starch, gum, &amp;c. When the work is increased, not so much extra meat as
                    vegetable food, or its dietetic equivalent, fat, is demanded.</p>
                <p>In comparing the cost of a daily sufficiency of the various foods to produce the
                    required force, we must not forget the inconveniences which many of them entail.
                    These inconveniences must be added to the cost. For example, suppose a man to
                    have been living upon potatoes only, just supporting life with 5 lb a day, and
                    then to get work which enabled him and required him to take a double supply of
                    non-nitrogenous food, he would act unwisely if he were to swallow it in the form
                    of 12 lb of cabbage. He would be knocked up by the shear labour of carrying 12
                    lb extra in a vessel so ill-adapted to sustain heavy loads as the stomach. A
                    similar objection would lie against milk, or veal, or apples, however cheap
                    accident might make them; and a more serious objection still would hold against
                    nine bottles of ale, or seven of stout. On the other hand, the
                    over-concentration of cheese, beef dripping, and lump sugar, makes them nauseous
                    when in large quantity or monotonously persisted in, though when introduced as a
                    variety they are appetizing and digestible. There is no saving in using that
                    against which the stomach is set, or which the absorbents refuse to
                    assimilate.</p>
                <p>Reverting to the illustration of the gang of a hundred prisoners, and supposing
                    it were requisite to put them on hard labour equivalent to half “Frankland’s

                    as carrying up ladders, altogether 1⅜ mile high, three tons of stone daily—
                    calculation would show that to add this amount of labour to the outgoings caused
                    by the functioning of physiological life, would involve the addition to their
                    spare diet of at least 117 S&gt; of bread, or of 58 Bb of bread with 44 Bb of
                    lean meat and 63 lb of potatoes. The slightest imperfection or indigestion of
                    any of this would cause a loss of bodily weight, and cases of illness would be
                    culpably frequent. Were a draught of milk, or a cup of cocoa and sugar, or some
                    oatmeal porridge and treacle, or even a little dripping or butter or bacon
                    given, the danger would probably be averted.</p>
                <p>The most conspicuous fault in the dietary of the working classes is want of
                    variety. Many of the articles which combine ample nutritiousness with small cost
                    are habitually neglected, because when used exclusively they are disagreeable
                    and unwholesome. From never being eaten they become absolutely unknown. There

                    enable us by another route to arrive at an estimate of what amount of solid
                    victuals is required by an adult living by bodily labour to preserve his health
                    under various circumstances. The circumstances which chiefly affect the question
                    can be classified thus :—(1) bare existence; (2) moderate exercise; (3) active
                    work; and (4) hard work.</p>
                <p>1. The first is calculated from the mean of sundry prison dietaries, of the
                    convalescents’ diet at hospitals, that of London needlewomen, and of that
                    supplied during the Lancashire cotton-famine, as reported by Mr Simon. The
                    result is that, in a condition of low health, without activity, 2¾ ounces of
                    nitrogenous food, 1 ounce of fat, 12 ounces of starch, and ¾ of an ounce of
                    mineral matters a day are necessary. The amount of carbon in this is equal to
                    7'44 ounces. In other words, a man’s life will be shortened or burdened by
                    disease in the future, or he will die of gradual starvation, unless his
                    provision for a week is equivalent to 3 Bb of meat with 1 lb of fat on it, or
                    with the same quantity of butter or lard, two quartern loaves of bread, and
                    about an ounce of salt and other condiments. If he cannot get meat, he must
                    supply its place with at least two extra quartern loaves, or about a stone and a
                    half of potatoes, or between 5 and 6 lb of oatmeal,—unless he is, indeed, so
                    fortunate as to be able to get skim milk, of which 5 pints a week will replace
                    the meat.</p>
                <p>A person reduced to bare existence diet can undertake no habitual toil, mental or
                    bodily, under the penalty of breaking down.</p>
                <p>“Bare existence” diet is that which requires to be estimated for administration
                    to certain classes of the community who have a claim on their fellow-countrymen
                    that their lives and health shall be preserved <hi rend="italic">in statu
                        quo,</hi> but nothing further. Such are prisoners, paupers, or the members
                    of a temporarily famine-stricken community.</p>
                <p>It would be obviously unjust to apply the same scale of quantity and quality to
                    all persons under varying circumstances of constitution and outward
                    surroundings; and to attempt to feed in the same way all these people for short
                    or long periods, idle or employed, with light work or hard work, in hot or in
                    cold weather, excited by hope or depressed by failure, involves an error of
                    either excess or defect, or both at once. The dietaries recommended by the Home
                    Office for prisoners very properly take all these circumstances into
                    consideration. They allot “bare existence” diet only to those sentenced for
                    short terms withoutlabour. And they recognize the fact that a man’s health is
                    not injured (perhaps sometimes it is improved) by a few days of such abstinence
                    as would in the long run be deleterious to him. Under a sentence of seven days a
                    prisoner gets daily 1 lb of bread, and a quart of gruel containing 4 oz. of
                    oatmeal. For more than seven and under twenty-one days he has an extra ∣Bb of
                    bread. For longer terms it is advised to add potatoes and meat.</p>
                <p>The nutritive value of the first named diet is thus calculated by Dr Pavy <hi

                <p>In the convict establishments prisoners are all under long sentence, and are
                    classified for dietetic purposes according to their occupation.</p>
                <p>The sparest of all is called “punishment diet,” and is administered for offences
                    against the internal discipline of the prison. It is equivalent to corporeal
                    chastisement, being designed to make the stomach a source of direct pain. It is
                    limited to a period of three days, and fully answers its proposed end as a
                    deterrent by causing the solar plexus to experience the greatest amount of
                    distress it is capable of; for after the expiration of that period sensation
                    becomes blunted. It consists of 1 lb of bread and as much water as the prisoner
                    chooses to drink. This last-named concession is not an unimportant one; for it
                    has been already remarked that a supply of fluid enables starvation, and by
                    implication abstinence, to be longer borne. At the same time it probably
                    postpones the anaesthesia, and therefore makes the intended suffering more real.
                    “Punishment diet” contains, in Dr Pavy’s estimate,—</p>

                <p>This is about half of what an average man requires to sustain himself without
                    work, and under its discipline he would probably lose 3 or 4 ounces of his
                    weight daily till his bodily substance was reduced by six-tenths, at which
                    period, according to Chossat’s experiments, he would die.</p>
                <p>“Penal diet” is that which is apportioned for more protracted punishment. It may
                    be continued for three months. It consists of 20 oz. of bread, 8 oz. of oatmeal,
                    20 oz. of milk, and 16 oz. of potatoes daily. Its chemical constituents are as

                <p>Upon this diet a fair amount of work may be done. The combustion of the
                    carbohydrates evolves sufficient force to raise a ton 4193 feet; and thus the
                    effete muscular substance may be worn off by destructive assimilation, making
                    place for new muscle derived from the nitrogenous matter of which a bare
                    sufficiency, but yet probably a sufficiency, is supplied. A man of strong
                    constitution is usually found at the end of it to be in good health and of
                    normal weight; <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0229-0212"/> yet he has never probably experienced the
                    content which arises from a /«.ms-consumption of food. It is intended to deny
                    him the normal pleasure of the accumulation of reserve-force in the gastric
                    region. This pleasurable sensation under ordinary circumstances much promotes
                    digestion, so that the whole of the ingesta are made the best use of; aud
                    therefore in “penal diet,” as above quoted, it has been found expedient to
                    introduce the slight excess to be noticed above what is needful to accomplish
                    the required woik in “foot-tons” (see before). The penalty of the regimen
                    involves a certain degree of waste.</p>
                <p>A close imitation of “penal diet” is that which the duty of a responsible
                    Government demands should be served out during a temporary famine, that is, one
                    calculated not to last above three months. It is more economical to introduce
                    the elements of variety in the diet than to be too monotonous,—that is, to save
                    in the daily issue and to be occasionally liberal, to feast froth time to time
                    as a break in the regular fast. The expense of the excess is more than replaced
                    by the diminished habitual ration, and that powerful preservative of life,
                    anticipation of pleasure, is brought into play. A reduction of the allowance
                    below what experience has indicated as “bare existence diet,” made during the
                    famine in Madras in the beginning of 1877, was attended with disastrous
                    results.</p>
                <p>By dint of mixing and varying his diet and making it consist of very nutritious
                    articles, such as bread, meat, yolk of eggs, and soup, Signor Cornaro (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Cornaro)</hi> succeeded in reducing the quantity he daily
                    consumed to as little as 12 oz. (Venetian). But then he made the solids go much
                    further by taking 14 oz. of good wine. And the probability is that this
                    geutlemen had a peculiar constitution, for, in spite of his many readers, he has
                    had no imitators of the experiment on their own persons.</p>
                <p>2. The appropriate food of the sécond class may be fairly represented by the
                    dietaries of European soldiers in time of peace. The English soldier on home
                    service, according to Dr Parkes, receives from Government 5¾ lb of meat and 7 5)
                    of bread weekly, and buys additional bread, vegetables, milk, and groceries out
                    of his pay. Such a diet is sufficient for anybody under ordinary circumstances
                    of regular light occupation; but should extra demands be made upon mind or body,
                    weight is lost, and if the demands continue to be made the health will suffer.
                    Mr F. Buckland, surgeon in the Guards, remarks <hi rend="italic">(Soc. of Arts
                        Journal,</hi> 1863, quoted by Dr Playfair) that though the sergeants in the
                    Guards fatten upon their rations, the quantity is not enough for recruits during
                    their drill.</p>
                <p>The Prussian soldier during peace gets weekly from his canteen 11 lb 1 oz. of rye
                    bread, and not quite 2⅜ tt&gt; of meat. This is obviously insufficient, but
                    under the conscription system it is reckoned that he will be able to make up the
                    deficiency out of his own private means, or obtain charitable contributions from
                    his friends. Dr Hildesheim <hi rend="italic">(Die Normal-Diät,</hi> Berlin,
                    1856, ρ. 60) states that asthenic diseases are very common in the army, which
                    leads to the inference that the chance assistance on which the authorities lean
                    is not trustworthy. As the legal ration in these two services does not profess
                    to be a man’s full food, it is needless to analyze it. In the French infantry of
                    the line each man during peace gets weekly 15 ſh of bread, 3 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜∙ lb of meat, 2 J lb of haricot beans or other
                    vegetables, with salt and pepper, and l¾ oz. of brandy. This seems to be enough
                    to support a man under light employment. Its analysis gives—</p>

                <p>The “moderate exercise” of brain and muscle combined in the above classes is
                    fairly represented in the convict scale by “light labour” (such as
                    oakum-picking), and by “industrial employment” (such as tailoring, cobbling,
                    Roman mosaic and mat making, basket weaving, &amp;c). The dietary for prisoners
                    thus engaged is nearly identical, except that the artisans using their brains
                    are supplied with about an ounce extra daily.</p>
                <p>The “industrial employment diet” for a week is thus analyzed by Dr Pavy :—</p>

                <p>This is probably a fair model for the most economical dietary on which an artisan
                    or labourer on light work can thrive. It may be observed that the principle of
                    variety is very conspicuous, and in private life it is possible to introduce
                    still more variety by cookery (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cookery.)</hi> In the
                    English and Prussian armies the introduction of variety is left to be attained
                    by forcing the soldier to purchase some portion of his food out of his own
                    pocket; in the French scale it is managed by issuing spices and various
                    vegetables, and trusting to the innate genius of the Gaulish warrior for
                    cooking. The issue of an occasional glass of brandy on holidays makes an
                    agreeable change and benefits digestion; but if wine could be obtained it would
                    be better, and not extravagant. The Austrian bill of fare is sadly monotonous.
                    The Russian ration may be noticed as particularly liberal of accessory and
                    antiscorbutic food, from which civil as well as military dieticians might take
                    an useful hint.</p>

                <p>Vinegar and other vegetable acids are too much neglected by our handicraftsmen
                    and soldiers. The Carthaginians are stated by Aristotle to have used vinegar as
                    a substitute for wine during their campaigns; and the recipes given by Cato for
                    flavouring vinegar with fruits show that it was in use among the labouring
                    population in Italy.</p>
                <p>3. “Active” labourers are those who get through such an amount of work daily,
                    exclusive of Sundays, as may be represented by a walk of 20 miles. In this class
                    are soldiers during a campaign, letter carriers, and engineers employed on field
                    work or as artisans. These habitually consume on the average about a fifth more
                    nitrogenous food and twice as much fat as the last class, while the quantity of
                    vegetable hydrocarbons is not augmented, except in the Royal Engineers.</p>
                <p>The “hard labour diet” of convict prisons fairly represents what the authorities
                    consider the minimum. It is the same as that already described as “industrial
                    employment diet,” with the following additions :—barley, 1 oz.; bread, 20 oz.;
                    shins for soup, 8 oz.: carrots, 1 oz.; onions, ⅜ oz.; turnips, 1 oz. It
                    contains, however, 14 oz. less milk, and 1 oz. less “meat.”</p>
                <p>The nutritive value of the additions may be seen by Dr Pavy’s alimentary
                    analysis, which is as follows :—</p>

                <p>The same food is given summer and winter, though the demand must be greater to
                    provide for the extra quantity of heat required to be produced in cold weather.
                    But then the amount of work is diminished at the latter season by l¾ hours,
                    which is equivalent to an augmentation of the diet The additions are more
                    judicious than those made by the classes above mentioned who partly furnish
                    their own food; for bread and vegetables constitute a large portion of the
                    convict ration, and the extra quantity of soup replaces the lost milk, without
                    risk of the waste in cooking common when the uneducated deal with solid
                    meat.</p>
                <p>4. “Hard work” is that got through by English navvies, hard-worked weavers, and
                    blacksmiths, &amp;c. which is more earnest and intense than the enforced “hard
                    labour” of the convict. It is difficult to obtain accurate information, but it
                    would appear from Dr Playfair’s estimates that the customary addition to the
                    diet is entirely in nitrogenous constituents. The higher their wages the more
                    meat the men eat.</p>
                <p>The neglect of vegetables by the last two classes is in a physiological point of
                    view imprudent, and possibly may be a contributing cause of an inordinate thirst
                    for alcohol which impoverishes and degrades many among them. To satisfy their
                    instinctive craving for a hydrocarbon, they take one convenient indeed in some
                    respects, but of which any excess is unwholesome. The discovery already
                    mentioned of the production of force from the assimilation of starch leads to a
                    knowledge, opposed to old prejudices but supported by experience, that the
                    raising of the energies to their full height of usefulness may be effected by
                    vegetable food quite as well as by the more stimulating and more expensive
                    animal nutriment, or by the more rapidly absorbed alcohol.</p>
                <p>With regard to the tables quoted above in which ultimate analyses are used as
                    data for dietetic rules, it must be noticed that their authors deprecate
                    arguments being founded on any but the very broadest characters of the articles
                    analyzed, Specimens, even when of the highest quality, differ strangely from one
                    another. Season, soil, modes of culture, the variations of species, and many
                    other little known influences come into play and prevent our taking the market
                    names of eatables as representatives of a definite chemical constitution. And it
                    may be added that ample scope should be allowed for the peculiarities of the
                    individual and of his life-history. In the application of general rules some one
                    must be trusted to relax or strain them when circumstances require, or failures
                    of α fatal character may occasionally result, and more often a galling
                    perversion of justice.</p>
                <p>Estimates for the thrifty management of food-supply have usually reference to the
                    feeding of others rather than to the calculation of a man’s own dietary. Enough
                    has been said on that point under the head of the influence of diet upon health,
                    and if a person really wants to bring down the expense of feeding himself to the
                    lowest point, he can readily rate himself under one of the classes enumerated
                    above, and act accordingly. It may, however, be doubted whether it is wise to
                    reduce the diet to the minimum which the work requires. The certain evils of an
                    accidental deficiency or of a miscalculation are so serious that the danger
                    outweighs the possible inconvenience of a slight excess. It were an unthrifty
                    thrift indeed which imperilled vigour of mind and body to effect a pecuniary
                    saving; for there is no investment so remunerative as high health. A man need
                    not consider that he is wasteful when he spends money upon making his bill of
                    fare palatable and provocative of indulgence to the extent of moderate
                    superfluity. Pleasure and prudence here walk hand in hand. (τ. κ. <hi
