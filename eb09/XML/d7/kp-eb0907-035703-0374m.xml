                    educated at the London university and at Trinity College, Cambridge, of which
                    college he was afterwards elected a fellow. He graduated in the year 1834, being
                    placed in the second class of the mathematical tripos, and second in the
                    classical tripos, when G. J. Kennedy was senior, and W. Forsyth, the author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Hortensius,</hi> third classic. After his degree he devoted
                    himself with unremitting energy to classical philology, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">New Cratylus,</hi> which appeared five years later, is not only a
                    work of wonderful erudition for so young a man, but forms a landmark in the
                    history of philology in England. In 1841 he was elected to the head-mastership
                    of King Edward’s school at Bury St Edmunds, a position which he held for over
                    ten years. On resigning this post he returned to Cambridge, where his time was
                    divided between literary work and private tuition. At the time of his death,
                    which was accelerated by over-study, he was engaged in the preparation of a
                    Greek lexicon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">New Gratylus,</hi> the work on which Dr Donaldson’s fame
                    mainly rests, is an attempt to apply the general principles of comparative
                    philology to the Greek language. The book consists of two parts—a general
                    introduction, in which the philosophy of language and the ethnographical
                    affinities of the ancient Greeks are discussed, and a treatise on the
                    grammatical structure and etymology of Greek. It is mainly founded on the
                    comparative grammar of Bopp, but a large part of it is original, and it is but
                    just to the English philologist to observe that the great German’s grammar was
                    not completed till ten years after the first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cratylus.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Varronianus,</hi> which followed in
                    1844, the same method is applied to the classification and analysis of Latin and
                    the other Italian dialects. It includes a critical commentary on the remains of
                    old Latin, Umbrian, and Oscan. If we consider the recent birth and rapid strides
                    of philology it is not wonderful that these early essays should have been
                    superseded by the riper labours of such men as Curtius, Schleicher, and Mommsen.
                    Distinguished as Donaldson’s works are by wide and varied learning, much
                    ingenuity, and independence of thought, they are deficient in soberness of
                    judgment, and, most of all, in the ability to distinguish between certain
                    inference and uncertain conjecture. More especially are these defects apparent
                    in the ethnographical theories of the <hi rend="italic">Varronianus.</hi> To
                    take a single instance, the origin and affinities of the Etruscan language,
                    problems which have yet to be solved, are stated no less confidently than those
                    of modern French.</p>

                <p>Before discussing his other works it is necessary to mention an unfortunate
                    controversy which this book provoked. A charge of plagiarism was brought against
                    the author by the late Professor Key, and a war of pamphlets followed as violent
                    as those which were common in the days of Bentley and Porson. Without attempting
                    to decide on the merits of this dispute, it is enough to state that though the
                    obligations of Donaldson to Key ought in the first instance to have been more
                    explicitly acknowledged, yet the strictures of the latter were needlessly
                    sweeping and aggressive.</p>
                <p>We pass on to Donaldson s work as a biblical critic. In 1854 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Jashar, or Fragments of original Hebrew songs inserted in the
                    Masoretic text of the Old Testament.</hi> The book was written in Latin, as an
                    appeal <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">clerum,</hi> to the learned
                    world in general, and especially to German theologians. It is an attempt to
                    reconstitute the lost book of Jashar from the remains of old songs and
                    historical records, which, according to the author, are incorporated in the
                    existing text of the Old Testament. Here, too, we notice the same merits and
                    defects as in the <hi rend="italic">Cratylus,</hi> the same ingenuity and
                    learning, the same rash and overconfident speculation. The bold views of the
                    author on the nature of inspiration, and the free handling of the sacred text,
                    provoked a storm of theological odium, but the only one of his numerous
                    assailants who deserves mention is Dr Perowne. A full analysis of the book will
                    be found in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Biblical Dictionary, s. v.</hi>
                    “Jashar.”</p>
                <p>Of his numerous other works the most important are <hi rend="italic">The Theatre
                    of the Greeks, The History of the Literature of Ancient Greece</hi> (a
                    completion of K. O. Müller’s work), an edition of <hi rend="italic">Pindar,</hi>
                    and a Hebrew, a Greek, and a Latin Grammar. Among his occasional writings the
                    article “Philology” in the 8th edition of this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia</hi> is the most important. Though much of what he wrote has
                    already become obsolete, Donaldson will long be remembered as one of the
                    pioneers of philology in England.</p>
