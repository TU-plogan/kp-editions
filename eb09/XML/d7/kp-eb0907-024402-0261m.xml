                    Roman empire, or more properly the portion of a province ruled by a propraetor.
                    Thus Cicero had, besides Cilicia, three “dioceses” in Asia. Bingham (lib. ix. c.
                    1) says that the division of the empire into clerical dioceses was in the time
                    of Constantine, whereas the division into provinces was much anterior. He goes
                    on to show that the primitive church followed exactly the example of the empire
                    in her territorial arrangements. As in every metropolis of each province there w
                    as a magistrate with authority over the magistrates of each city, so in every
                    metropolis there was a bishop, whose authority extended over the entire
                    province, who was thence called “metropolitan,” or “primate,” as being the first
                    or principal bishop of the province. And everywhere the episcopal sees were
                    under the authority of the bishop of the civil metropolis, except in Africa,
                    where the primate was usually the senior bishop of the province. The term ‘‘
                    diocese,” however, was sometimes used in the more comprehensive, and the term
                    province in the less comprehensive sense, as appears from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notitia dignitatum</hi><hi rend="italic">Imperii,</hi> drawn up, as it would
                    seem, in the time of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius (see Bingham, <hi
                    rend="italic">loc. citſt</hi> The territorial division, however, as given in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Notitia,</hi> was purely civil. But Bingham tells us that,
                    though we have no equally ancient account of the ecclesiastical division of the
                    empire, yet if we compare the fragmentary bits of information which may be
                    picked out of the acts of and subscriptions to the earlier councils with later
                    notices, it will be seen that the ecclesiastical very exactly followed the civil
                    distribution.</p>
                <p>It may be mentioned that, before the 4th century, the term “parish”—τrαρoικiα—was
                    often used indiscriminately with the word “diocese,” a circumstance which has
                    caused ecclesiastical antiquarians to expend much erudition in showing that,
                    despite the confusion of terms, the thing intended corresponded to our idea of a
                    diocese, and not to our idea of a parish.</p>
                <p>The uncertainty with regard to the number and circumscription of the English
                    ecclesiastical dioceses under the Romans is great, and the information
                    attainable fragmentary. At the council of Arles, held in the year 314, the
                    bishop of York, the bishop of London, and the bishop “de colonia Lindi,”
                    probably Lincoln, are recorded to have been present. But the changes in the
                    number and territorial circumscription following the Saxon invasion—and not yet
                    finally completed—were so great that volumes of minute antiquarian investigation
                    would be needed to trace —in so far as it may be still possible to trace—the
                    progress of nomenclature and delimitation of the various dioceses of Britain
                    from the first establishment of them to the present day.</p>
                <p>The division of dioceses found to be too large to be conveniently administered by
                    one bishop was practised from very early times, as may be seen by the decrees of
                    a council held in Portugal about the middle of the 6th century. Another reason
                    for dividing a diocese, and establishing a new see, has been recognized by the
                    church as duly existing “if the sovereign should think fit to endow some
                    principal village or town with the rank and privileges of a city” (Bingham, lib.
                    xvii. c. 5). But there are canons for the punishment of such as might induce the
                    sovereign so to erect any town into a city, solely with the view of becoming
                    bishop thereof. Nor could any diocese be divided without the consent of the
                    primate.</p>
                <p>In the countries more immediately subjected to the Roman pontiff the
                    multiplication of dioceses has been excessive, the number of them in the
                    apostolic dominions being no less than 68, while the Roman Church reckons in the
                    wſliole of Europe (exclusive of the English, but inclusive of the Irish sees)
                    578 sees.</p>
