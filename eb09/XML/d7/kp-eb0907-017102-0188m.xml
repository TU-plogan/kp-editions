                    After receiving some instruction from Kent, the organist of Winchester
                    Cathedral, he went to London at the age of fifteen. In the following year his
                    first work, an operetta entitled <hi rend="italic">The Shepherd’s Artifice,</hi>
                    with words and music by himself, was produced at Co vent Garden Theatre. This
                    proved successful, and was followed by other works, his reputation being firmly
                    established by the music to the play of <hi rend="italic">The Padlock,</hi>
                    which was produced at Drury Lane under Garrick’s management in 1768, the
                    composer himself taking the part of Mungo. He continued for some years to be
                    connected with Drury Lane, both as composer and as actor, and produced during
                    this period two of his best known works, <hi rend="italic">The Waterman</hi>
                    (1774) and <hi rend="italic">The Quaker</hi> (1775). A quarrel with Garrick led
                    to the termination of his engagement, and in 1782 he became joint manager of the
                    Royal Circus, afterwards known as the Surrey Theatre. In three years he lost
                    this position owing to a quarrel with his partner. In 1788 he sailed for the
                    East Indies on the invitation of a sailor brother (the “Tom Bowling” of his
                    famous song); but, the vessel having put in to Torbay in stress of weather, he
                    changed his mind and returned to London. A series of mono-dramatic
                    entertainments which he gave at his theatre, <hi rend="italic">Sans Souci,</hi>
                    in Leicester Square, brought his songs, music, and recitations more prominently
                    into notice, and permanently established his fame as a lyric poet. It was at
                    these entertainments that he first introduced many of those sea songs which so
                    powerfully influenced the national spirit. The words breathed the simple loyalty
                    and dauntless courage that are the cardinal virtues of the British sailor, and
                    the music was appropriate and naturally melodious. Their effect in stimulating
                    and ennobling the spirit of the navy during the war with France was so marked as
                    to call for special acknowledgment. On retiring from publie life, in 1805,
                    Dibdin was rewarded by Government with a pension of £200 a year, of which he was
                    only for a time deprived under the administration of Lord Grenville. Dibdin died
                    of paralysis in 1814. Besides his <hi rend="italic">Musical Tour through
                    England</hi> (1788), his <hi rend="italic">Professional Life,tíu</hi>

                    and about 30 dramatic pieces. He also wrote one or two novels which are now
                    forgotten. An edition of his songs by G. Hogarth (1843) contains a memoir of his
                    life. The edition prepared by his sou Thomas is referred to below</p>
