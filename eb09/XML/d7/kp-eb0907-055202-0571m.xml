                    Puimisson, sometimes written Puimoisson, a small town in the diocese of Beziers,
                    in Languedoc, whence he is sometimes described as a native of Provence. He
                    studied law under Bernardus of Parma, in the university of Bologna, where he was
                    promoted to the degree of doctor. He shortly afterwards migrated to the
                    university of Modena, where he became so famous by his lectures on the canon law
                    that he attracted the notice of Pope Clement I V., who appointed him auditor of
                    the palace, and subsequently subdeacon and chaplain. In 1274 he accompanied Pope
                    Gregory X. as his secretary to the Council of Lyons, which is reckoned as the
                    fourteenth general council, and under the pontificates of several subsequent
                    popes filled many highly responsible offices. He was appointed in 1277 spiritual
                    and temporal legate of the patrimony of St Peter under Pope Nicholas III., and
                    in 1278 took possession, in the name of the same Pope, of the provinces of
                    Bologna and Romagna. In 1281 Pope Martin IV. named him vicar spiritual, and in
                    1283 governor of the temporalities of the two provinces, in which office he had
                    the direction of the war against the rebellious province of Romagna. The town of
                    Castrum Riparum Urbanatium having been burnt down during the war, he rebuilt it,
                    and renamed it Castrum Durantis. Pope Urban VIII. subsequently gave to this town
                    the name of Urbania, which it bears in the present day. Pope Honorius IV.
                    retained Durandus in the same offices until the end of 1286, when his election
                    to the bishopric of Meude, in Languedoc, was the occasion of his retiring for a
                    short time from the conduct of civil affairs. Duraudus, however, appears to have
                    remained in Italy, and to have revised at this time several of his works. He
                    refused in 1295 the archbishopric of Ravenna, which was offered to him by Pope
                    Boniface VIII., and accepted in preference the more arduous office of governor
                    of the province of Romagna and of the march of Ancona. The party of the
                    Ghibellines, however, carried on hostilities against the Holy See with so much
                    vigour that he found his strength unequal to the exigencies of government; and,
                    having resigned his office, he retired to Rome, where he died on 1st November
                    1296.</p>
                <p>Durandus was the author of several very learned rvorks. The most famous of them
                    is his <hi rend="italic">Speαdum</hi><hi rend="italic">Judiciale.</hi> This work
                    is entitled in the juin ted copies, the earliest of which was published at home
                    in folio in 1474, as <hi rend="italic">Speculum Juris</hi>; but all the MSS.
                    have the title of <hi rend="italic">Speadum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Judiciale</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Durandus himself, in his epistle
                    dedicatory to Cardinal Ottobonus Fiesco, afterwards Pope Adrian V., describes it
                    under this latter title. It is a practical treatise on civil and canon law, and
                    it earned for its author, when young, the surname of the Father of Practice.
                    Durandus is said to have completed it in 1271, at the age of thirty-four, and he
                    revised it some time between 1287 and 1291. It has since his death acquired much
                    celebrity as one of the best sources of the dogmatic history of law, and the
                    canonists are accustomed to cite Durandus under the bye-name of “the
                    Speculator.” The original work has been enriched by additions from the pen of
                    John Andreae in 1346, and by further additions from the pen of Baldus. An
                    alphabetic table of its contents (Inventorium) was drawn up by Cardinal Beranger
                    in 1306, and the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> passed through thirty-eight
                    editions between 1474 and 1678. The next important work of Durandus is his <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertorium</hi><hi rend="italic">Aureum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breviarium,</hi> which is dedicated to Cardinal Matthaeus; Durandus himself in
                    his preface designates this work by the name of Breviarium, but it is described
                    by him in the Preface to the <hi rend="italic">Specιdum</hi> by the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertorium</hi><hi rend="italic">Aureum,</hi> under which title
                    it is more generally known. It is supposed to have been composed by Durandus in
                    the interval between the first completion and the revision of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in Concilium</hi><hi rend="italic">Lugdunense</hi> is a work of
                    much interest, as Durandus himself drew up the Decretals, which after his death
                    were inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Sextus.</hi> Durandus also wrote a
                    commentary on the decretals of Pope Nicholas 111., which is only known to us
                    from the epitaph on his tomb, as preserved by Sarti, and which enumerates all
                    his chief writings, amongst which may be mentioned his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum Legatorum,</hi> inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Specιdum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Judiciale,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Rationale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Divinorum Officiorum,</hi> which has passed through many editions,
                    the earliest of which was printed at Mayence in 1459, and a copy of which is
                    stated by the Abbé Pascal to ha·ve been sold for 2700 francs. A manuscript of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Pontificale</hi><hi rend="italic">Patrum,</hi> being a
                    treatise on the duties of bishops, is preserved in the National Library of
                    Paris. Durandus the Speculator is sometimes confounded with Durandus of Santo
                    Porciano, bishop of Meaux, who died in 1332, and was the author of two
                    treatises, De <hi rend="italic">Jurisdictioni</hi> and De <hi rend="italic"
                    >Legebus,</hi> and·withWilhelmus Durandus, his own nephew, who was the author of
                    a work entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">modo celebrandi
                    Consilii,</hi> and who died in Cyprus in 1328.</p>
