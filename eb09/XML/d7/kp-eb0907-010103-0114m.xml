                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0115-0102"/> on the 15th of August 1785. He was the fifth
                    child in a family of eight (four sons and four daughters), of whom three died
                    young. His father, descended from a Norman family, was an opulent merchant, who
                    lived much abroad, partly to look after his foreign engagements, but mainly from
                    considerations of health; he died of pul monary consumption in the thirty-ninth
                    year of his age, leaving his wife and six children a clear income of £1600 a
                    year. The widow, a woman of exceptional talent, secured to her family the
                    enjoyment of those social and educational advantages which their position and
                    means afforded. Thomas was from infancy a shy, sensitive child, with a
                    constitutional tendency to dreaming by night and by day; and, under the
                    influence of an elder brother, a lad “whose genius for mischief amounted to
                    inspiration,” who died in his sixteenth year, he spent much of his boyhood in
                    imaginary worlds of their own creating. The amusements and occupations of the
                    whole family, indeed, seem to have been mainly intellectual; and in De Quincey’s
                    case, emphatically, “the child was father to the man.” “My life has been,” he
                    affirms in the <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> “on the whole the life of a
                    philosopher; from my birth I was made an intellectual creature, and intellectual
                    in the highest sense my pursuits and pleasures have been.” From boyhood he was
                    more or less in contact with a polished circle; his education, easy to one of
                    such native aptitude, was sedulously attended to. When he was in his twelfth
                    year the family removed to Bath, where he was sent to the grammar school, at
                    which he remained for about two years; and for a year more he attended another
                    public school at Winkfield, Wiltshire. At both his proficiency was the marvel of
                    his masters. At thirteen he wrote Greek with ease; at fifteen he not only
                    composed Greek verses in lyric measures, but could converse in Greek fluently
                    and without embarrassment; one of his masters said of him, “that boy could
                    harangue an Athenian mob better than you or I could address an English one.”
                    Towards the close of his fifteenth year he visited Ireland, with a companion of
                    his own age, Lord Westport, the son of Lord Altamont, an Irish peer, and spent
                    there in residence and travel some months of the summer and autumn of the year
                    1800,—being a spectator at Dublin of “the final ratification of the bill which
                    united Ireland to Great Britain.” On his return to England, his mother having
                    now settled at St John’s Priory, a residence near Chester, De Quincey was sent
                    to the Manchester grammar school, mainly that it might be easier for him to get
                    thence to Oxford through his obtaining one of the school exhibitions.</p>
                <p>Discontented with the mode in which his guardians conducted his education, and
                    with some view apparently of forcing them to send him earlier to college, he
                    left this school after less than a year’s residence—ran away, in short, to his
                    mother’s house. There one of his guardians made an arrangement for him to have a
                    weekly allowance, on which he might reside at some country place in Wales, and
                    pursue his studies, presumably till he could go to college. From Wales, however,
                    after brief trial, “suffering grievously from want of books,” he went off as he
                    had done from school, and hid himself from guardians and friends in the world of
                    London. And now, as he says, commenced “that episode, or impassioned parenthesis
                    of my life, which is comprehended in <hi rend="italic">The Confessions
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">au</hi><hi rend="italic">English Opium Eater</hi> This
                    London episode extended over a year or more; at the end of it the lad was
                    reconciled to his guardians, and in 1803 went to Oxford, being by this time
                    about nineteen. It was in the coarse of his second year at Oxford that he first
                    tasted opium,—having taken it to allay neuralgic pains.</p>
                <p>After finishing his career of five years at college in 1808, he ultimately
                    settled in 1812 to the life of a student on the borders of Grasmere, drawn
                    thither partly by neighbourhood to Wordsworth, whom he early appreciated,—
                    having been, he says, the only man in all Europe who quoted Wordsworth so early
                    as 1802. Here also he enjoyed the society and friendship of Coleridge, Wilson,
                    and Southey, as in London he had of Charles Lamb and his select circle. Here he
                    continued his classical and other studies, especially exploring the at that time
                    almost unknown region of German literature, and indicating its riches to English
                    readers. Here also, in 1816, he married the “dear Μ ,” of whom a charming
                    glimpse is ac corded to the reader of the <hi rend="italic">Confessions;</hi>
                    his family came to be five sons and three daughters. For a year he edited, at
                    Kendal, the <hi rend="italic">Westmoreland Gazette.</hi> He resided till the end
                    of 1820 at Grasmere, afterwards in London, and latterly at Lasswade near
                    Edinburgh, or in Edinburgh. He died in that city December 8, 1859, aged
                    seventy-four, and is buried in the West Churchyard.</p>
                <p>During nearly fifty years De Quincey lived mainly by his pen. His patrimony seems
                    never to have been entirely exhausted, and his habits and tastes were simple and
                    inexpensive; but he was careless to recklessness in the use of money, and debts
                    and pecuniary difficulties of all sorts hung about him through the greater part
                    of his life. There was, indeed, his associates affirm, an element of romance
                    even in his impecuniosity, as there was in everything about him; and the
                    diplomatic and other devices by which he contrived to keep clear of clamant
                    creditors, while scrupulously fulfilling many obligations, often disarmed
                    animosity, and converted annoyance into amusement. The famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions of an English Opium Eater,</hi> having first appeared in <hi
                    rend="italic">The London Magazine,</hi> were published in a small volume in
                    1820, and attracted a very remarkable degree of attention, not simply from their
                    disclosures as to his excessive use of the drug, and its effects, but also by
                    the marvellous beauty of the style of the work, its romantic episodes, and
                    extraordinary power of dream-painting. All De Quincey’s other writings appeared
                    in periodicals— <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine, Tait's Magazine, Hogg's
                    Instructor,</hi> &amp;c. No other literary man of his time, it has been
                    remarked, achieved so high and universal a reputation from such merely fugitive
                    efforts. Since his works were brought together, that reputation has been not
                    merely maintained, but extended. The American edition of twelve volumes was
                    reprinted in this country in 1853, under the author’s own supervision, and
                    expanded to fourteen volumes; upon his death two more volumes were made up of
                    previously uncollected material. For range of thought and topic, within the
                    limits of pure literature, no like amount of material of such equality of merit
                    has proceeded from any eminent writer of our day. However profuse and
                    discursive, De Quincey is always polished, and generally exact—a scholar, a wit,
                    a man of the world, and a philosopher, as well as a genius. He looked upon
                    letters as a noble and responsible calling; in his essay on Oliver Goldsmith he
                    claims for literature the rank not only of a fine art, but of the highest and
                    most potent of fine arts; and as such he himself regarded and practised it. He
                    drew a broad distinction between “the literature of <hi rend="italic"
                    >knowledge</hi> and the literature of <hi rend="italic">power</hi>,” asserting
                    that the function of the first is to <hi rend="italic">teach,</hi> the function
                    of the second to <hi rend="italic">move,—</hi> maintaining that the meanest of
                    authors who moves has pre-eminence over all who merely teach, that the
                    literature of knowledge must perish by supersession, while the literature of
                    power is “triumphant for ever as long as the language exists in which it
                    speaks.” It is to this class of motive literature that De Quincey’s own works
                    essentially belong; it is by virtue of that vital element of power that they
                    have emerged from the rapid oblivion of periodicalism, and live in the minds of
                    a second generation <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0116-0103"/> of readers and admirers, as they are safe to do
                    in those of a third and fourth. The risk of their not reaching on through
                    succeeding time arises from their diffuseness—their power is weakened by their
                    volume.</p>
                <p>De Quincey has fully defined his own position and claim to distinction in the
                    preface to his collected works. These he divides into three classes :—“<hi
                    rend="italic">first,</hi> that class which proposes primarily to amuse the
                    reader,” such as the <hi rend="italic">Narratives, Autobiographic Sketches,</hi>
                    &lt;tc.; <hi rend="italic">“second,</hi> papers which address themselves purely
                    to the understanding as an insulated faculty, or do so primarily,” such as the
                    essays on Essenism, the Caesars, Cicero, &amp;c.; and finally, as a <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> class, “and, in virtue of their aim, as a far higher
                    class of compositions,” he ranks those “modes of impassioned prose ranging under
                    no precedents that I am aware of in any literature,” such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Suspiria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Profundis.</hi> The high claim here
                    asserted has been so far questioned; and short and isolated examples of eloquent
                    apostrophe, and highly-wrought imaginative description, have been cited from
                    Rousseau and other masters of style; but De Quincey’s power of sustaining a
                    fascinating and elevated strain of “impassioned prose” is allowed to be entirely
                    his own. In this his genius most emphatically asserts itself; if it be not
                    admitted that in that dread circle <hi rend="italic">none</hi> durst walk but
                    he, it will be without hesitation conceded that there he moves supreme. Nor, in
                    regard to his writings as a whole, will a minor general claim which he makes be
                    disallowed, namely, that he “does not write without a thoughtful consideration
                    of his subject,” and also with novelty and freshness of view. “Generally,” he
                    says, “I claim (not arrogantly, but with firmness) the merit of rectification
                    applied to absolute errors» or to injurious limitations of the truth.” Another
                    obvious quality of all his genius is its overflowing fulness of allusion and
                    illustration, recalling his own description of a great philosopher or
                    scholar—“Not one who depends simply on an infinite memory, but also on an
                    infinite and electrical power of combination, bringing together from the four
                    winds, like the angel of the resurrection, what else were dust from dead men’s
                    bones into the unity of breathing life.” It is useless to complain of his having
                    lavished and diffused his talents and acquirements over so vast a variety of
                    often comparatively trivial and passing topics, instead of concentrating them on
                    one or two great subjects. The world must accept gifts from men of genius as
                    they offer them; circumstance and the hour often rule their form. Those
                    influences, no less than the idiosyncrasy of the man, determined De Quincey to
                    the illumination of such matter for speculation as seemed to lie before him; he
                    was not careful to search out recondite or occult themes, though these he did
                    not neglect,—a student, a scholar, and a recluse, he was yet at the same time a
                    man of the world, keenly interested in the movements of men and in the page of
                    history that unrolled itself before him day by day. To the discussion of things
                    new, as readily as of things old, aided by a capacious, retentive, and ready
                    memory, which dispensed with reference to printed pages, he brought also the
                    exquisite keenness and subtlety of his highly analytic and imaginative
                    intellect, the illustrative stores of his vast and varied erudition, and that
                    large infusion of common sense which preserved him from becoming at any time a
                    mere <hi rend="italic">doctrinaire,</hi> or visionary. If he did not throw
                    himself into any of the great popular controversies or agitations of the day, it
                    was not from any want of sympathy with the struggles of humanity or the progress
                    of the race, but rather because his vocation was to apply to such incidents of
                    his own time, as to like incidents of all history, great philosophical
                    principles and tests of truth and power. In politics, in the party sense of that
                    term, he would probably have been classed as a Liberal Conservative or
                    Conservative Liberal—at one period of his life perhaps the former, and at a
                    later the latter. Originally, as we have seen, his surroundings were somewhat
                    aristocratic, in his middle life his associates, notably Wordsworth, Southey,
                    and Wilson, were all Tories; but he seems never to have held the extreme and
                    narrow views of that circle. Though a flavour of high breeding runs through his
                    writings, he has no vulgar sneers at the vulgar. As he advanced in years his
                    views became more and more decidedly liberal, but he was always as far removed
                    from Radicalism as from Toryism, and may be described as a philosophical
                    politician, capable of classification under no definite party name or colour. Of
                    political economy he had been an early and earnest student, and projected, if he
                    did not so far proceed with, an elaborate and systematic treatise on the
                    science, of which all that appears, however, are his fragmentary <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> on the system of Ricardo, which John Ramsay M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Culloch pronounces “unequalled for brevity, pungency,
                    and force.” But political and economic problems largely exercised his thoughts,
                    and his historical sketches show that he is constantly alive to their
                    interpenetrating influence. The same may be said of his biographies, notably of
                    his remarkable sketch of Dr Parr. Neither politics nor economics, however,
                    exercised au absorbing influence on his mind,—they were simply provinces in the
                    vast domain of universal speculation through which he ranged “with unconfined
                    wings.” How wide and varied was the region he traversed a glance at the titles
                    of the papers which make up his collected—or more properly selected—works (for
                    there was much matter of evanescent interest not reprinted) sufficiently shows.
                    He was equally at home in all provinces, though never exerting his great powers
                    so as to make himself paramount in any. Surprising as his literary achievements
                    are, his capabilities were still greater; and the general survey leaves the
                    impression of regret that, doing so much so well, he did not do more, or did not
                    less better. Some things in his own line he has done perfectly; he has written
                    many pages of magnificently mixed argument, irony, humour, and eloquence, which,
                    for sustained brilliancy, richness, subtle force, and purity of style and effect
                    have simply no parallels; and he is without peer the prince of dreamers. The use
                    of opium no doubt stimulated this remarkable faculty of reproducing in skilfully
                    selected phrase the grotesque and shifting forms of that “cloudland, gorgeous
                    land,” which opens to the sleep-closed eye; but the faculty itself was a
                    speciality of his constitution, coloured by the quality of his genius, and
                    enriched by the acquisitions of his intellect.</p>
                <p>To the appreciation of De Quincey the reader must bring an imaginative faculty
                    somewhat akin to his own—a certain general culture, and large knowledge of
                    books, and men, and things. Otherwise much of that slight and delicate allusion
                    that gives point and colour and charm to his writings will be missed; and on
                    this account the full enjoyment and comprehension of De Quincey must always
                    remain a luxury of the literary and intellectual. But his skill in narration,
                    his rare pathos, his wide sympathies, the pomp of his dream-descriptions, the
                    exquisite playfulness of his lighter dissertations, and his abounding though
                    delicate and subtle humour, commend him to a larger class. Though far from being
                    a professed humourist—a character he would have shrunk from—there is no more
                    expert worker in a sort of half-veiled and elaborate humour and irony than De
                    Quincey; but he employs those resources for the most part secondarily. Only in
                    one instance has he given himself up to them unreservedly and of set purpose,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0117-0104"/> logician by instinct and culture, a student by
                    choice, a scholar by right of conquest of the stores of many minds, a writer of
                    English of the first quality by dint of native command of language and life-long
                    study and practice. His style, full and flexible, pure and polished, is
                    peculiarly his own; yet it is not the style of a mannerist,—its charm is, so to
                    speak, latent; the form never obtrudes; the secret is only discoverable by
                    analysis and study. It consists simply in the reader’s assurance of the writer’s
                    complete mastery over all the infinite applicability and resources of the
                    English language. Hence involutions and parentheses, “cycle on epicyle,” evolve
                    themselves into a stately clearness and harmony; and sentences and paragraphs,
                    loaded with suggestion, roll on smoothly and musically, without either fatiguing
                    or cloying—rather, indeed, to the surprise as well as delight of the reader; for
                    De Quincey is always ready to indulge in feats of style, witching the world with
                    that sort of noble horsemanship which is as graceful as it is daring.</p>
                <p>It has been complained that, in spite of the apparently full confidences of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Autobiographic
                    Sketches,</hi> readers are left in comparative ignorance, biographically
                    speaking, of the man De Quincey. Two passages in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions</hi> afford sufficient clues to this mystery. In one he describes
                    himself “as framed for love and all gentle affections,” and in another confesses
                    to the “besetting infirmity” of being “too much of an eudae-monist.” “I hanker,”
                    he says, “too much after a state of happiness, both for myself and others; I
                    cannot face misery, whether my own or not, with an eye of sufficient firmness,
                    and am little capable of surmounting present pain for the sake of any
                    recessionary benefit.” His sensitive disposition dictated the ignoring in his
                    writings of traits merely personal to himself, as well as his ever-recurrent
                    resort to opium as a doorway of escape from present ill; and prompted those
                    habits of seclusion, and that apparently capricious abstraction of himself from
                    the society not only of his friends, but of his own family, in which he from
                    time to time persisted. He confessed to occasional accesses of an almost
                    irresistible impulse to flee to the labyrinthine shelter of some great city like
                    London or Paris,—there to dwell solitary amid a multitude, buried by day in the
                    cloister-like recesses of mighty libraries, and stealing away by night to some
                    obscure lodging. Long indulgence in seclusion, and in habits of study the most
                    lawless possible in respect of regular hours or any considerations of health or
                    comfort,—the habit of working as pleased himself without regard to the divisions
                    of night or day, of times of sleeping or waking, even of the slow procession of
                    the seasons, had latterly so disinclined him to the restraints, however slight,
                    of ordinary social intercourse, that he very seldom submitted to them. On such
                    rare occasions, however, as he did appear, perhaps at some simple meal with a
                    favoured friend, or in later years in his own small but refined domestic circle,
                    he was the most charming of guests, hosts, or companions. A short and fragile,
                    but well-proportioned frame; a shapely and compact head; a face beaming with
                    intellectual light, with rare, almost feminine beauty of feature and complexion;
                    a fascinating courtesy of manner; and a fulness, swiftness, and elegance of
                    silvery speech,—such was the irresistible “mortal mixture of earth’s mould” that
                    men named De Quincey. He possessed in a high degree what the American poet
                    Lowell calls “the grace of perfect breeding, everywhere persuasive, and nowhere
                    emphatic;” and his whole aspect and manner exercised an undefinable attraction
                    over every one, gentle or simple, who came within its influence; for shy as he
                    was, he was never rudely shy, making goo 1 his boast that he had always made it
                    his “pride to converse familiarly <hi rend="italic">more socratico</hi> with all
                    human beings—man, woman, and child ”—looking on himself as a catholic creature
                    standing in an equal relation to high and low, to educated and uneducated. He
                    would converse with a peasant lad or a servant girl in phrase as choice, and
                    sentences as sweetly turned, as if his interlocutor were his equal both in
                    position and intelligence; yet without a suspicion of pedantry, and with such
                    complete adaptation of style and topic that his talk charmed the humblest as it
                    did the highest that listened to it. His conversation was not a monologue; if he
                    had the larger share, it was simply because his hearers were only too glad that
                    it should be so; he would listen with something like deference to very ordinary
                    talk, as if the mere fact of the speaker being one of the same company entitled
                    him to all consideration and respect. The natural bent of his mind and
                    disposition, and his life-long devotion to letters, to say nothing of his opium
                    eating, rendered him, it must be allowed, regardless of ordinary obligations in
                    life—domestic and pecuniary—to a degree that would have been not only culpable,
                    but very highly so, in any less singularly constituted mind. It was impossible
                    to deal with or judge De Quincey by ordinary standards—not even his publishers
                    did so. Much no doubt was forgiven him, but all that needed forgiveness—and,
                    after all, his sins were rather of omission than commission, trivial rather than
                    heinous, trying rather than deadly—will soon be covered by the kindly oblivious
                    veil of lapsing time, while his merits as a master in English literature will
                    remain to be gratefully acknowledged.</p>
