                    from the mouth of the Boyne, and 31⅜ miles north of Dublin by rail. Though
                    situated on the borders of Louth and Meath, it belongs to neither, as the town
                    and surrounding district constitute a county of a city, with an area of 9 square
                    miles, or 5780 acres. It occupies both banks of the river; but the northern
                    division is the larger of the two, and has received greater attention in modem
                    times. The ancient fortifications, still extant in the beginning of the century,
                    have almost completely disappeared; but of the four gateways, one named after St
                    Lawrence remains comparatively perfect, and there are considerable ruins of
                    another. Great improvements have been effected in the town since 1840, under the
                    encouragement bestowed by Benjamin Whitworth, M.P., who built a townhall at his
                    own expense in 1865, and furnished half the funds necessary for the construction
                    of the water-works which now supply 800,000 gals, daily. Among the public
                    buildings are a mansion-house or mayoralty, with a suite of assembly rooms
                    attached; the “Tholsel,” a square building with a cupola; a corn-market,the old
                    linen-hall, an infirmary, a workhouse, and a prison; five Protestant churches,
                    five Roman Catholic chapels, three friaries, and four nunneries. St Peter’s
                    Chapel formerly served as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic archbishopric of
                    Armagh; and in the abbey of the Dominican nuns there is still preserved the head
                    of Oliver Plunkett, the archbishop who was executed at Tyburn in 1681 on an
                    unfounded charge of treason. There was at one time an archiepiscopal palace in
                    the town, built by Archbishop Hampton about 1620; and the Dominicans, the
                    Franciscans, the Augustinians, the Carmelites, and the knights of St John had
                    monastic establishments. Of the Dominican buildings there still exists the
                    stately Magdalen tower; the Franciscan friary is a striking ruin; and there are
                    traces more or less distinct of the Augustinian priory, the priory of St
                    Lawrence, and the hospital of St Mary. At the head of the educational
                    institutions is a classical school endowed by Erasmus Smith; and among the
                    public charities are an almshouse for twenty-four aged widows, and a foundation
                    providing houses and annuities for thirty-six clergymen’s widows. There is also
                    a blue-coat school, founded about <pb break="no"

                    present building was erected by T. P. Cairnes in 1870. The industrial
                    establishments comprise a large cotton factory, erected by Mr Whitworth in 1864,
                    four extensive sawmills, three flax-mills, six flour-mills, eight tanneries,
                    five salt-works, four soap works, two extensive breweries, two newspaper
                    offices, chemical manure works, and a large engineering factory for the making
                    of steam-engines, iron - bridges, Ac. A brisk trade is carried on, especially
                    with Liverpool (which is distant 133 miles due east), and with Glasgow. The
                    harbour has been greatly improved by the commissioners, and vessels of 400 tons
                    can discharge at the quays. In 1873, 707, with a burden of 115,673 tons, entered
                    the port; and the harbour receipts in 1871 were £3627. The tide reaches 2∣ miles
                    above the town to Oldbridge; and barges of 50 tons burden can proceed 19 miles
                    inland to Na van. The river is crossed by a bridge for ordinary traffic, and by
                    a splendid railway viaduct. Assizes, quarter sessions, and petty sessions are
                    held in the town; the parliamentary borough returns one member to Parliament;
                    and the municipal borough is governed by a mayor, 6 aidermen, and 18
                    councillors. The population of the municipal borough (area, 454 acres) was
                    17,365 in 1831, 16,845 in 1851, 14,740 in 1861, and 13,510 in 1871. The whole
                    population, with the exception of about 1100, are Roman Catholics. The
                    inhabitants of the parliamentary burgh, which has an area of 5785 acres, numbers
                    16,165.</p>
                <p>In the earliest notices the town of Drogheda is called Inver-Colpa or the Port of
                    Colpa; the present name signifies “The Bridge over the Ford.” In 1152 the place
                    is mentioned as the seat of a synod convened by the papal legate, Cardinal
                    Paparo; in 1224 it was chosen by Lucas de Netterville, archbishop of Armagh, for
                    the foundation of a Dominican friary; and in 1228 the two divisions of the town
                    received separate incorporation from Henry III. But there grew up a strong
                    feeling of hostility between Drogheda <hi rend="italic">versus Uriel,</hi> and
                    Drogheda <hi rend="italic">versus Midiam,</hi> in consequence of trading vessels
                    landing their cargoes in the latter or southern town, to avoid the pontage duty
                    levied in the former or northern town. At length, after much blood had been shed
                    in the dispute, Philip Bennett, a monk residing in the town, succeeded by his
                    eloquence, on the festival of Corpus Christi, 1412, in persuading the
                    authorities of the two corporations to send to Henry IV. for a new charter
                    sanctioning their combination.</p>
                <p>Drogheda has always been considered by the English a place of much importance. In
                    the reign of Edward III. it was classed along with Dublin, Waterford, and
                    Kilkenny, as one of the four staple towns of Ireland. Richard II. received in
                    its Dominican monastery the submissions of O’Neal, O’Donnell, and other
                    chieftains of Uls ter and Leinster. The right of coining money was bestowed on
                    the town, and parliaments were several times held within its walls. In the reign
                    of Edward IV. the mayor received a sword of state, and an annuity of £20, in
                    recognition of the services rendered by the inhabitants at Malpus Bridge against
                    O’Reilly; the still greater honour of having a university with the same
                    privileges as that of Oxford remained a mere paper distinction, owing to the
                    poverty of the town and the unsettled state of the country; and an attempt made
                    by the corporation in modern times to resuscitate their rights proved
                    unsuccessful'. In 1495 Poyning’s laws were enacted by a parliament held in the
                    town. In the civil wars of 1641 the place was besieged by O’Neal and the
                    Northern Irish forces; but it was gallantly defended by Sir Henry Tichboume, and
                    after a long blockade was relieved by the Marquis of Ormond. The same nobleman
                    relieved it a second time, when it was invested by the Parliamentary army under
                    Colonel Jones. In 1649 it was captured by Cromwell, after a short though
                    spirited defence; and nearly every individual within its walls, without
                    distinction of age or sex, was put to the sword. Thirty only escaped, who were
                    afterwards transported as slaves to Barbados. In 1690 it was garrisoned by King
                    James’s army; but after the decisive battle of the Boyne,—the site of which,
                    about 2⅛ miles to the west, is marked by an obelisk 150 high,—it surrendered to
                    the conqueror without a struggle, in consequence of a threat that quarter would
                    not be granted if the town were taken by storm. Its subsequent history is purely
                    of local interest.</p>
