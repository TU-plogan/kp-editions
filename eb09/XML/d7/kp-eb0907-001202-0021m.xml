                <p><label type="entry">DEÁK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Franz</hi></label> (1803-1876), an
                    Hungarian statesman, was born on October 17, 1803, at Kehida, in the comitat of
                    Szalad. He sprang from an old noble fanſily, of which he was the last
                    descendant. Having studied law at the academy of Raab, he practised as an
                    advocate in Szalad, and soon became a prominent figure at the meetings of the
                    comitat. He represented Szalad in the Diet which met at Presburg in 1832 and
                    lasted till 1836. By his earnestness and practical sagacity he made so deep an
                    impression that he was in a short time recognized as leader of the opposition.
                    The object of his policy was, on the one hand, to resist the encroachments of
                    the central Government at Vienna on the rights of his country, and, on the
                    other, to remote abuses which then made Hungary one of the most backward nations
                    in Europe. He again sat for Szalad in the Diet of 1839-40, and by skilful
                    management effected a temporary reconciliation between the Imperial Government
                    and the Reform party, of which he was the head. He gave deep offence, however,
                    by the vigour with which he denounced the exemption of Hungarian nobles from
                    taxation, as well as other injurious survivals of the Middle Ages; and when
                    elected in 1843 he received such definite instructions from the constituency to
                    vote in a reactionary sense that he declined to accept his seat. At a second
                    election the Liberals exerted themselves so energetically that he was again
                    appointed; but, on the ground that violence had been used in connection with his
                    candidature, he once more refused to enter the Diet. For some years he lived as
                    a private citizen; but he was everywhere regarded as the most influential
                    Hungarian politician, and his party took no important step without consulting
                    him. A project for a penal code which he drew up about this time was admitted in
                    Germany, France, and England to be one of the most enlightened ever conceived.
                    The excitement of 1843 caused the first symptoms of the disease of the heart of
                    which he ultimately died; and during the rest of his life he always suffered
                    more or less from ill health. On this account he could not enter the Diet of
                    1847; but next year, when revolutionary forces threatened to break up the
                    empire, he was persuaded to take a seat vacated for him by one of the members
                    for Szalad.</p>
                <p>The emperor, alarmed by the dangers which surrounded him on every side, conceded
                    in a number of measures, afterwards known as “the laws of 1848,” every important
                    demand Deák had ever made. The first independent Hungarian Cabinet, with Count
                    Batthyanyi as president, was formed, and the ministry of justice was intrusted
                    to Deák. In this office, during the few months he held it, he worked
                    indefatigably; and he intended completely to reorganize legal administration.
                    His plans, however, were <pb break="no"

                    the centre, and which aimed at changes of a more extreme character than he
                    approved. He desired to maintain the relations of Austria and Hungary, and
                    exercised his whole influence in favour of a good understanding between the two
                    countries. Events decided against him, for Kossuth rose to power and began the
                    war in the course of which the Hapsburg dynasty was formally deposed. Deák
                    resigned his portfolio, and appeared in connection with the subsequent struggle
                    only as one of the deputation which, on the approach of the Austrian army to
                    Buda-Pesth, went to negotiate with Prince Windischgrätz. When the war was over,
                    Deák was offered the post of Judex Curiae; but he insisted that the laws of 1848
                    were still in force, and would have nothing to do with any system of government
                    in which they were ignored. On the other hand, he discountenanced violent
                    proposals, urging that the legal rights of the land could be secured only by
                    legal means</p>
                <p>Hungary suffered deeply from the reaction which followed the revolutionary
                    period, and it was clear that she only awaited a favourable opportunity to throw
                    off the imperial yoke. The disasters sustained by Austria in the Italian war of
                    1859 suggested to the emperor the necessity of a change of policy; and the
                    result was that in 1861 the Diet again met. This time Deák appeared as member
                    for Pesth, which henceforth returned him at every election till his death. The
                    Moderate party rallied round him, and after much discussion the address to the
                    emperor drawn up by him was adopted. In this the Diet took its stand on the laws
                    of 1848, and demanded the appointment of a Hungarian ministry; but at Vienna
                    they were not prepared to give way so far. The imperial rescript was very
                    hostile in tone, and the Diet was speedily dissolved. In 1865 fresh negotiations
                    were begun, and they were powerfully promoted by a series of letters in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pesti</hi><hi rend="italic">N^aplo,</hi> setting forth Deák’s
                    ideas as to the proper bases of reconciliation. Towards the end of 1865 the Diet
                    was opened by the emperor in person. About six months afterwards it was hastily
                    closed because of the approaching war between Austria and Prussia; but it
                    reassembled on November 19, 1866, when Austria had been utterly defeated and
                    seemed on the brink of ruin. The Radical party wished to take advantage of the
                    general confusion by exacting terms to which the Austrian Government would,
                    never before have consented; but Deák maintained his former position, desiring
                    no more than that the system which he considered the only legal one should been
                    forced. His influence over the Diet and the nation prevailed; and he had the
                    satisfaction of seeing Count Andrassy appointed president of an Hungarian
                    cabinet and the emperor and empress crowned as king and queen of Hungary. The
                    establishment of the dual system, which enabled the Austro-Hungarian monarchy to
                    enter upon a new career after terrible humiliations and losses, was due to the
                    efforts of Deák more than to any other cause, and the fact was gratefully
                    acknowledged both by the mass of his countrymen and by the emperor.</p>
                <p>For some years the Deák party continued the most powerful in the Diet; but the
                    state of his health rendered it impossible for him to do much more than deliver
                    an occasional speech on subjects of unusual interest. His last speech, in the
                    summer of 1873, was on the relations of church and state; and he proclaimed
                    himself in favour of the American system—“a free church in a free state.” Before
                    his death his party lost its hold over the nation; and in 1875 Tisza, a man of
                    more advanced opinions, was called to the head of the Government. Deák died on
                    January 29, 1876, at Buda-Pesth, after a long and painful illness. His death was
                    regarded as a national calamity, and he was buried at the cost of the state amid
                    manifestations of universal grief.</p>
                <p>Hungary has produced no other statesman of equal distinction. He approached
                    closely to the type which is supposed to be peculiarly English, holding fast
                    vital principles, but always ready to accede to a compromise on matters of
                    secondary moment. Intensely opposed to revolution, he was absolutely fearless
                    when sure that he was standing on lawful ground, and pursued the political ideal
                    he had formed with a persistence which has been rarely equalled. In youth his
                    style as an orator <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> was passionate and florid; but
                    he ultimately became calm and deliberate, carrying conviction by command of
                    facts, logical arrangement of ideas, and lucid statement. At all periods of his
                    career he conveyed the impression of absolute sincerity and devotion to high and
                    unselfish aims. He was of a genial disposition, remarkably fond of children, and
                    with a gift of ready humour which made him as great a favourite in society as in
                    parliament. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> si.)</p>
