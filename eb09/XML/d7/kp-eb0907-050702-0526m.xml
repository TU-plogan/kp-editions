                    the world as the second, if not the greatest, of French novelists, by her
                    assumed name of George »Sand, was born at Paris 5th July 1804, and died 8th June
                    1876. Her life is as fantastic and eventful as any of her fictions, and the main
                    secret of her success has been her power to clothe in artistic form her varied
                    experiences of men and places.</p>
                <p>It is no easy task to set down in a short space the outward events of her life,
                    and to trace the development of her genius, not only because of the abundance of
                    materials she has left behind her, but still more from the subtle way in which
                    she has interwoven fact and fiction. In the <hi rend="italic">History of her
                    Life,</hi> which covers half a century, the omissions are no less surprising
                    than the revelations, and though she never indulges in the self-illusions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit,</hi> which perplex or mystify the
                    biographers of Goethe, yet she wisely refuses to satisfy the curiosity of the
                    public on the most delicate episodes of her life. If, to fill up the blanks, we
                    turn to her novels, George Sand justly warns us that in trying to raise the mask
                    and identify her with any one of her characters, we shall not only lose our
                    pains, but show that we mistake the fundamental conditions of art. Yet by the
                    help of critics to supply the missing clue (and no writer of this century has so
                    provoked criticism), it is possible to decipher the chief lineaments of the most
                    remarkable woman of this age, and the greatest authoress in the world’s
                    history.</p>
                <p>Aurore was the daughter of Lieutenant Dupin and of his newly-married mistress
                    Sophie Delaborde, the daughter of a Paris bird-fancier. Her paternal grandfather
                    was M. Dupin de Francueil, a farmer-general of the revenue, who had married
                    Mdlle. Rinteau, widow of Count Horn (a natural son of Louis XV.), and natural
                    daughter of Marshal Saxe, the most famous of the many illegitimate children of
                    Augustus the Strong by the lovely countess of Königsmarck. This strange pedigree
                    has been traced in detail by George Sand, and she recognizes it as one of the
                    elements which went to mould her character. She boasts of the royal blood which
                    she inherited through her father, and, disregarding the bar sinister, claims
                    relationship with Charles X, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0527-0508"/> and Louis XVIΠ., and she proclaims herself as
                    frankly a daughter of the people, endowed by nature with the instincts of her
                    class. Her birth itself was romantic. Her father was playing a country dance at
                    the house of a fellow officer, the future husband of Sophie’s sister, when he
                    was told that his wife, who had not long left the room, had borne him a
                    daughter. “She will be fortunate,” said the aunt, “she was born among the roses
                    to the sound of music.”</p>
                <p>Passing by her infantine recollections, which go back further than even those of
                    Dickens, we find her at the age of three crossing the Pyrennees to join her
                    father who was on Murat’s staff, occupying with her parents a suite of rooms in
                    the royal palace, adopted as the child of the regiment, nursed by rough old
                    sergeants, and dressed in a complete suit of uniform to please the general.</p>
                <p>For the next ten years she lived at Nohant, near Le Châtre in Berri, the country
                    house of her grandmother. Here her character was shaped; here she imbibed that
                    passionate love of country scenes and country life which neither absence,
                    politics, nor dissipation could uproot; here she learnt to understand the ways
                    and thoughts of the peasants, and laid up that rich store of scenes and
                    characters which a marvellously retentive memory enabled her to draw upon at
                    will. The progress of her mind during these early years well deserves to be
                    recorded. Education, in the strict sense of the word, she had none. A few months
                    after her return from Spain her father was killed by a fall from his horse. He
                    was a man of remarkable literary gifts as well as a good soldier, and his
                    letters, which are included in her life, show in a less degree the vivid force
                    of description and clear insight into character which he bequeathed to his
                    daughter. “Character,” says George Sand, “is in a great measure hereditary: if
                    my readers wish to know me they must know my father.” On his death the mother
                    resigned, though not without a struggle, the care of Aurore to her grandmother,
                    Mme. Dupin de Francueil, a good representative of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ancien</hi><hi rend="italic">regime.</hi> Though her husband was a patron of
                    Rousseau, she herself had narrowly escaped the guillotine, and had only half
                    imbibed the ideas of the Revolution. In her son’s lifetime she had, for his
                    sake, condoned the <hi rend="italic">mésalliance,</hi> but it was impossible for
                    the stately châtelaine and her low-born daughter-in-law to live in peace under
                    the same roof. She was jealous as a lover of the child’s affection, and the
                    struggle beween the mother and grandmother was one of the bitterest of Aurore’s
                    childish troubles.</p>
                <p>Next to the grandmother, the most important person in the household at Nohant was
                    Deschatre. He was an ex-abbé who had shown his devotion to his mistress when her
                    life was threatened, and henceforward was installed at Nohant as factotum. He
                    was maire of the village, he managed the estate, doctored the neighbourhood,
                    played picquet with Madame, was tutor to Aurore’s half-brother, and, in addition
                    to his other duties, undertook the education of the girl. The tutor was no more
                    eager to teach than the pupil to leam. He, too, was a disciple of Rousseau,
                    believed in the education of nature, and allowed his Émile to wander at her own
                    sweet will. At odd hours of lessons she picked up a smattering of Latin, music,
                    and natural science, but most days were holidays and spent in country rambles
                    and games with village children. Yet even then, though she passed for an
                    ordinary child, somewhat more wayward and less instructed than the average, her
                    special powers had begun to show themselves. Her favourite books were Tasso, <hi
                    rend="italic">Atala,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie.</hi> A simple
                    refrain of a childish song or the monotonous chaunt of the ploughman touched a
                    hidden chord and thrilled her to tears. Like Blake she fell into involuntary
                    trances, saw visions and heard voices, though, unlike Blakθ, she never mistook
                    her day-dreams for realities. She invented a deity of her own, a mysterious
                    Corambé, half pagan and half Christian and like Goethe erected to him a rustic
                    altar of the greenest grass, the softest moss, and the brightest pebbles.</p>
                <p>From the free out-door life at Nohant she passed at thirteen to the convent of
                    the English Augustinians at Paris, where for the first two years she never went
                    outside the walls. Nothing better shows the plasticity of her character than the
                    ease with which she adapted herself to this sudden change. The volume which
                    describes her conventual life is as graphic as Miss Bronte’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Villette,</hi> but we can only dwell on one passage of it. Tired of mad pranks,
                    in a fit of home-sickness, she found herself one evening in the convent chapel.
                    In a strange reverie she sat through vespers. Time passed unnoticed, the prayers
                    were over, the chapel was being closed.</p>
                <p>“I had forgotten all; I knew not what was passing in me; with my soul rather than
                    my senses, I breathed an air of .ineffable sweetness. All at once a sudden shock
                    passed through my whole being, my eyes swam, and 1 seemed wrapped in a dazzling
                    white mist. I heard a voice murmur in my ear, ‘ <hi rend="italic">Tolle,
                    lege.’</hi> I turned round thinking that it was one of the sisters talking to
                    me—I was alone. I indulged in no vain illusion; I believed in no miracle; 1 was
                    quite sensible of the sort of hallucination into which I had fallen; I neither
                    sought to intensify it nor to escape from it. Only I felt that faith was laying
                    hold of me—by the. heart, as I had wished it. I was so filled with gratitude and
                    joy that the tears rolled down my cheeks. 1 felt as before that 1 loved God,
                    that my mind embraced and accepted that ideal of justice, tenderness, and
                    holiness which I had never doubted, but with which I had never held direct
                    communion, and now at last 1 felt that this communion was consummated, as though
                    an invincible barrier had been broken down between the source of infinite light
                    and the smouldering fire of my heart. An endless vista stretched before me, and
                    I panted to start upon my way. There was no more doubt or lukewarmness. That I
                    should repent on the morrow and rally myself on my over-wrought ecstasy never
                    once entered my thoughts. I ¼ ’ as like one who never casts a look behind, who
                    hesitates before some Rubicon to be crossed, but having touched the further bank
                    sees no more the shore he has jnst left.”</p>
                <p>Such is the story of her conversion as told by herself. It reads more like a
                    chapter from the life of Ste Thérèse or Madame Guyon than of the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lelie.</hi> Yet no one can doubt the sincerity of her narrative,
                    or even the permanence of her religious feelings under all her many phases of
                    faith and aberrations of conduct. A recent critic has sought in religion the
                    clue to her character and the mainspring of her genius. But, except we take
                    religion in the vague sense of the vision and the faculty divine, this is a
                    one-sided view. “Half poet and half mystic” is the verdict she pronounces on
                    herself, and we may add that her element of mysticism was always subordinate to
                    the poetic. “Je fus toujours tourmentée des choses divines,” ever stirred and
                    stimulated, but never possessed by things divine.</p>
                <p>Again in 1820 Aurore exchanged the restraint of a convent for freedom, being
                    recalled to Nohant by Mme. de Francueil, who had no intention of letting her
                    granddaughter grow up a <hi rend="italic">devote.</hi> She rode across country
                    with heι brother, she went out shooting with Deschatre, she sat by the cottage
                    doors on the long summer evenings and heard the flax-dressers tell their tales
                    of witches and warlocks. She read widely though unsystematically Aristotle,
                    Leibnitz, Locke, Condillac, and fed her imagination with <hi rend="italic"
                    >René</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold.</hi> Her confessor lent her the
                    <hi rend="italic">Genius of Christianity,</hi> and to this book she ascribes the
                    first change in her religious views. She renounced once for all the asceticism
                    and isolation of the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Imitatione</hi>
                    for the more genial and sympathetic Christianity of Chateaubriand. Yet she still
                    clung to old associations, and on her grandmother’s death was about to return to
                    her convent, but was dissuaded by her friends, who found her a husband in the
                    person of Μ. Dudevant, a retired officer who had turned farmer. About her
                    husband and her married life George Sand is discreetly reticent. It was a
                    marriage, if not of love, yet <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n528/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0528-0509"/> of inclination, and the first years of her
                    married life, during which her son and daughter, Maurice and Solange, were born,
                    were at least calm and peaceful. Soon differences arose. Her husband seems to
                    have been neither better nor worse than the Berrichon squires around him; but
                    she found herself mated, if not to a clown, yet to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >hobereau</hi> whose heart was in his farm and cattle. After nine years of
                    passive endurance she determined to put an end to a connection which had grown
                    intolerable, and in 1831 an amicable separation was agreed upon. Nohant was
                    surrendered to the husband, and, taking her daughter with her, she went to seek
                    her fortune in Paris with no provision but an allowance of £60 a year. After
                    vain attempts to support herself by some of those expedients to which reduced
                    gentlewomen are driven, as a last resource she tried literature. At this period
                    she was living in a garret, often unable to afford the luxury of a fire.
                    Repulsed by Balzac and Kératry, she found an employer in Delatouche, the editor
                    of <hi rend="italic">Figaro,</hi> and, like herself, a native of Berri. In her
                    life she has done full justice to the rough honesty and jealous affection of her
                    first critic, who treated her much as Dr Johnson treated Fanny Burney. George
                    Sand had neither the wit nor the piquancy to succeed as a writer in <hi
                    rend="italic">Figaro,</hi> and at the end of a month her earnings amounted to
                    fifteen francs. But there was on the same staff a young law student already
                    known to her as a visitor at Nohant. With Jules Sandeau she entered into
                    literary partnership, and under the name of Jules Sand there appeared a novel,
                    their joint work, called <hi rend="italic">Rose et Blanche.</hi> Her second
                    novel was written independently, and the famous pseudonym, George Sand, was a
                    compromise between Madame Dudevant, who wished to preserve the joint authorship,
                    and Jules Sandeau, who disclaimed any share in the work. Nothing like <hi
                    rend="italic">Indiana</hi> had appeared before in French fiction. The public
                    were wearied with the unreality of the fashionable historical novel, and the
                    realistic humour of Paul de Kock. Balzac’s earliest novels gave little promise
                    of his future greatness. In the unknown writer they found one who combined the
                    absorbing passion of Rousseau, the delicate picturesqueness of St Pierre, and
                    the wild grandeur of Chateaubriand, in a living picture of present times and
                    manners. Like Byron she awoke one morning and found herself famous. Delatouche
                    was the first to throw himself at her feet and bid her forget all the hard
                    things he had said of her. Sainte-Beuve expressed the approval of the learned,
                    and the public eagerly canvassed the secret of her name, sex, and history. <hi
                    rend="italic">Valeniine,</hi> which appeared two months afterwards, proved that
                    <hi rend="italic">Indiana</hi> was not, like so many first novels, a graphic
                    rescript merely of the author’s own emotions, but the beginning of an
                    inexhaustible series, in which experience was the raw material woven by
                    imagination and coloured by fancy. In <hi rend="italic">Valentine,</hi> written
                    during a visit to Nohant, she draws her inspiration from her native soil, and
                    nowhere has she better described the quiet beauty and pastoral melancholy of the
                    Vallée Noire and the banks of the Indre. Her Bohemian life at Paris—her <hi
                    rend="italic">vie de gamin,</hi> as she calls it—in which she adopted not only
                    the dress but the life of a college student, and made the acquaintance of the
                    whole Paris world between the artist and the artisan, is sketched by her in an
                    allegory which is worth quoting if only as a specimen of the simple perfection
                    of her style.</p>
                <p>“I care little about growing old; I care far more not to grow old alone, but I
                    Wave never met the being with whom I could have chosen to live and die, or if I
                    ever met him I knew not how to keep him. Listen to a story and weep. There was a
                    good artist called Watelet, the best acquafortis engraver of his day. He loved
                    Marguerite Lecomte, and taught her to engrave as well as himself. She left
                    husband and home to go and live with him. The world condemned them; then, as
                    they were poor and modest, it forgot them. Forty years afterwards their retreat
                    was discovered. In a cottage in the environs of Paris called <hi rend="italic"
                    >le moulin</hi><hi rend="italic">joli,</hi> there sat at the same table an old
                    man engraving and an old woman whom he called his <hi rend="italic"
                    >meunière</hi> also engraving. The last design they were at woιk upon

                    one here has seen. For a year the person who gave me this portrait sat with me
                    every night at a little table and lived by the same work. At daybreak we
                    consulted together on our work for the day, and at night we supped at the same
                    little table, chatting the while on art, on sentiment, on the future. The future
                    broke faith with us. Pray for me, 0 Marguerite Lecomte !”</p>
                <p>Her third novel, <hi rend="italic">Lelie,</hi> marks the climax of her rebellion
                    against society. It was written in a fit of deep depression, religious and
                    political, and is a wild dithyramb, the passionate wail of a woman whose
                    affections have been blighted, and whose jaundiced eyes see nothing but a
                    lifeless, loveless, godless world. But like Goethe in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther</hi> she “rid her bosom of that perilous stuff,” and, though once and
                    again she inveighed against society, she never more lost faith in the moral
                    government of the world.</p>
                <p>Of her unfortunate relations with A. de Musset, and her voyage to Italy in his
                    company, which followed the publication of <hi rend="italic">Lelie,</hi> nothing
                    need be said except as they affected her literary career. As the motives of <hi
                    rend="italic">Indiana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Valentine</hi> are an unhappy
                    marriage, so the novels of this period (1833-1835), <hi rend="italic">Jacques,
                    Andre,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leone Leoni,</hi> are the outcome of an
                    unhappy liaison. Her creed, the opposite of Shakespeare’s, is, that love must
                    alter as it alteration finds, and that no ties are binding but the mutual
                    passion of the hour. <hi rend="italic">File</hi><hi rend="italic">et lui</hi> is
                    a woman’s version of the quarrel between a man and woman, and if true it ought
                    never to have been told. The moral of the tale is worth giving in George Sand’s
                    own words, “God makes certain men of genius to wander in the tempest and to
                    create in pain. I studied you in your light and in your darkness, and know that
                    you are not to be weighed in the balance like other men.” The measure she here
                    metes to De Musset we may fairly measure to her again.</p>
                <p>To this Italian journey we owe some of her most charming pictures of scenery.
                    Venice was the only town she loved for itself, and it exercised over her the
                    same fascination as over Byron, Shelley, and Goethe. The opening scenes of <hi
                    rend="italic">Consτιelo</hi> are worthy to take rank with “Otway, Radcliffe,
                    Schiller, Shakespeare’s Art,” with the 4th canto of <hi rend="italic">ChUde
                    Harold,</hi> Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Lyrics,</hi> and Goethe’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Venetian Epigrams.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'un Voyageur</hi> mark the calm which succeeded this Sturm und
                    Drang period. They are specially valuable to the student of George Sand, as they
                    give her views of men and things, not refracted and distorted by the exigencies
                    of a novel. In <hi rend="italic">Michel de Bourges</hi> (the “Edouard” of the
                    letters) we make the acquaintance of another of those celebrated men who
                    influenced for a time her life and writings. He conducted the suit which ended
                    in a judicial separation from her husband (1836), and sought to convert her to
                    the extreme republicanism of which he was the foremost advocate and defender.
                    This Lovelace of politics laid siege to her intellect as persistently as
                    Richardson’s hero (for nine mortal hours he declaimed to her, pacing to and fro
                    before her hotel at Bourges, and at Paris he locked her into her own room that
                    she might reflect at leisure on his suit), but though she coquetted with his
                    communistic theories, her artist nature rebelled against his extravagant
                    radicalism. She sought safety in flight, but <hi rend="italic">Mauprat,</hi>
                    which she published this year, bears marks of his influence. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">Marcie,</hi>
                    of 1837, are a tribute to the broad and noble Catholicism of Lamennais, and an
                    eloquent exposition of the doctrine of Christian resignation; but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Spiridion</hi> (1838) she returns to her proper creed, a
                    philosophical theism founded on sentiment and unfettered by dogma. <hi
                    rend="italic">Consuelo</hi> (1844) and <hi rend="italic">Lucretia Floriani</hi>
                    (1847) were inspired by Chopin, whose declining health she tended for more than
                    six years with motherly care. <hi rend="italic">Le Compagnon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Tour de France</hi> (1840) and <hi rend="italic">Le

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0529-0510"/><hi rend="italic">d'Angibault</hi> (1845) are
                    echoes of the socialism of Pierre Leroux. She threw herself heart and soul into
                    the republican struggle of 1848, composed manifestoes for her friends, addressed
                    letters to the people, and even started a newspaper. But her political ardour
                    was short-lived; she cared little about forms of government, and, when the days
                    of June dashed to the ground her hopes of social regeneration, she quitted once
                    for all the field of politics and returned to her quiet country ways and her
                    true vocation as an interpreter of nature, a spiritualizer of the commonest
                    sights of earth and the homeliest household affections. In 1849 she writes from
                    Berri to a political friend,—“You thought that Ί was drinking blood from the
                    skulls of aristocrats. No, I am studying Virgil and learning Latin !”</p>
                <p>To a youth of storm and stress succeeded an old age so calm and happy that it has
                    no history. For more than a quarter of a century she continued year by year to
                    gladden the world by some new creation, and the last of her works, the
                    posthumous <hi rend="italic">Contes Tune</hi><hi rend="italic">GranTmère,</hi>
                    is as fresh and vigorous and far more beautiful than <hi rend="italic"
                    >Indiana.</hi> Only once was the serenity of her life troubled. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of a Traveller during the War</hi> will be quoted by
                    future historians not only as a record of that agonizing crisis through which
                    the French nation passed, but also as a prophecy of its recovery, which, by the
                    indomitable spirit it expressed, brought its own fulfilment.</p>
                <p>In writing the life of Madame Dudevant we have glanced at some of the most
                    important of her works. To chronicle the titles only of all her novels would
                    require an Homeric catalogue. It is only possible to give a general estimate of
                    her style and of her place in French literature. But first we must call
                    attention to her latest group of novels, which we omitted in the life as
                    deserving a separate notice. With <hi rend="italic">Jeanne</hi> (1852) began
                    that series of pastorals, or stories of village life, by which George Sand is
                    best known to the English public, and by which, we believe, she will be longest
                    remembered. No description is needed of works so weil known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >La petite</hi><hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic">adelte,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">La mare au diable, Les Maîtres Sonneurs, Le meunier
                    TAngibault,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nanon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">François le
                    Champi.</hi> With these may be classed the fairystories which she wrote for her
                    grandchildren in the last years of her life, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">geant Yeous,</hi><hi rend="italic">La reine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Coax,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le nuage</hi><hi rend="italic">rose,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Les ailes</hi><hi rend="italic">de courage.</hi> They are too
                    recent to be much known in England, but we may safely predict that they will be
                    as familiar to our grandchildren as <hi rend="italic">La petite Fadette</hi> is
                    to us. Without attempting to analyze, we may shortly indicate the peculiar charm
                    and originality of her idyllic novels.</p>
                <p>1. Like Wordsworth, with the inward eye she sees into the life of things; she
                    seizes with her pencil the visionary gleam; she shows the mystical influences
                    which emanate from the world of sense, the witchery of the sky, the quiet soul
                    of the river, the beauty born of murmuring sound, the grey <hi rend="italic"
                    >landes</hi> stretching far away to the blue horizon, the deep-meadowed
                    champaigns with orchard lawns and bowery hollows.</p>
                <p>2. Like Wordsworth, too, she had found love in huts where poor men dwell, and
                    like him she is “a leader in that greatest movement of modern times, care for
                    our humbler brethren,—her part being to make us reverence them for what they
                    are, what they have in common with us, or in greater measure than
                    ourselves.”</p>
                <p>3. To interpret for her readers these pictures of primitive life she has invented
                    a style of her own,—not that, like Fontenelle, she makes her shepherds talk the
                    language of the court, but she expresses the feelings of peasants in words so
                    simple that a peasant might have used them, and yet so pure that they would pass
                    muster with the Académie. Like Courier she is archaic, but her archaisms are not
                    extracted from books, but relics of classical French which still lingered on in
                    the quiet nooks of central France.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, a few words must be said of her style, though much of its delicate
                    harmony must elude a foreign critic, for it is by her style that she will
                    chiefly live. It is simple and unaffected, yet full of subtle turns and
                    picturesque expressions. Her dialogue is sparkling, her narrative clear and
                    flowing, her descriptions exact, and her eloquence grandiose yet never
                    meretricious. Topin is reminded of “the language of Rousseau, with something
                    more of ease and finesse, the grace of Bernadin St Pierre, without his
                    over-refinement, the warmth and eloquence of our greatest orators, and that
                    without effort or straining.” Nisard pronounces George Sand the master of French
                    prose writers. To Thackeray her diction recalled the sound of country bells
                    falling sweetly and sadly on the ear; it stirred the nerves of Mill like a
                    symphony of Haydn or Mozart.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest of English novelists seems by the name she has adopted to
                    provoke comparison with George Sand. In psychological analysis and insight into
                    the problems of modern life, she is at least her equal; in her range of
                    knowledge, in self-control, and in practical common sense she is greatly her
                    superior; but in unity of design, in harmony of treatment, in that purity and
                    simplicity of language so felicitous aud yet so unstudied, in all those
                    qualities which make the best of George Sand’s novels master pieces of art, she
                    is as much her inferior. George Eliot is a great moralist, a great teacher;
                    George Sand, whatever we may think of her doctrine and her morality, is by
                    universal consent a supreme artist.</p>
                <p>She has stayed in many camps, and lent her pen to many causes, she has had many
                    friends and many lovers, but to one cause only has she remained constant·—the
                    cause of human progress; and the only master in whose service she has never
                    wearied is art. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. s.)</hi></p>
