                    Friesland, and well known as a bitter opponent of the house of Orange, which had
                    gradually acquired almost regal functions. William IL, prince of Orange, died in
                    1650; and as his son, afterwards William III. of England, was an infant, the
                    Republican party easily won predominance. De Witt was made pensionary of Dort,
                    and in that position so distinguished himself by his eloquence, firmness, and
                    sagacity, that in 1652, although only twenty-seven years of age, he became grand
                    pensionary of Holland. He held this position for about twenty years, during
                    which he controlled the policy of the United Provinces. He inherited his
                    father’s intense jealousy of the Orange family, and steadily laboured to prevent
                    it from ever again rising to power. When he became grand pensionary the United
                    Provinces were at war with England. He had always disapproved of this conflict,
                    and in 1654 succeeded in bringing about peace, conceding to Cromwell his demands
                    with respect to the honours due to the English flag. The treaty included a
                    secret article providing that no member of the house of Orange should in future
                    be elected stadtholder or grand admiral De Witt was afterwards accused of having
                    suggested this condition to Cromwell; but the latter was also opposed to the
                    claims of a family which was nearly allied to the Stuarts.</p>
                <p>After the restoration of Charles II., who had been exposed to many affronts
                    during his residence in Holland, De Witt cultivated the friendship of France;
                    and in 1661 a treaty was concluded by which that country and the United
                    Provinces granted to each other freedom of commerce in their respective
                    ports.—the Dutch guaranteeing to the French the possession of Dunkirk, and the
                    French guaranteeing to the Dutch the right of fishing off the coasts of Great
                    Britain and Ireland. The latter provision caused much irritation in England; and
                    it was increased by the incessant quarrels of English and Dutch merchants on the
                    Guinea Coast, each desiring to have a monopoly in the trade of slaves and gold
                    dust. War was declared in 1665; and in a battle off Lowestoft the Dutch fleet
                    was defeated, the remnant taking shelter in the Texel. Antwerp was the only port
                    at which it could be refitted, and the most experienced pilots decided that it
                    was impossible the vessels could be removed thither. De Witt himself, however,
                    with splendid courage, undertook the task, and not only accomplished it, but in
                    a very short time had the fleet once more ready for action. After two more
                    battles, in which the Dutch well sustained their fame for skill and bravery, De
                    Witt entered upon negotiations which resulted in the Peace of Breda in 1667.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, by dint of severe labour, he introduced order into the financial
                    system of the country; and in 1667 the chief object of his life seemed to be
                    attained, for owing to his efforts a Perpetual Edict was passed proclaiming the
                    office of stadtholder for ever abolished. At this time, however, a great danger
                    threatened the Republic. In 1667 Louis XIV. invaded the Spanish Netherlands; and
                    it was clear that if the war ended in the annexation of that country to France
                    it would be difficult to maintain the independence of the United Provinces. De
                    Witt made secret but rapid preparations for resistance, and appealed to England
                    to support Holland in curbing French ambition. Notwithstanding the prejudices of
                    Charles IL, Sir William Temple was sent to propose an alliance between England,
                    Holland, and Sweden. De Witt entered so heartily into this scheme that in the
                    spring of 1668 the Triple Alliance was concluded. Louis XIV. saw that for the
                    time his plans were foiled, and with as good a grace as possible signed the
                    Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. At heart, however, he bitterly resented the course
                    which the States General, guided by De Witt, had taken, and slowly prepared for
                    revenge. By artful diplomacy England and Sweden were detached from the alliance,
                    and several German princes were persuaded to promise that they would join France
                    in an attack on Holland in order to restore certain towns which, it was
                    pretended, properly belonged to the empire.</p>
                <p>While Louis was maturing his plans the power of De Witt was being steadily
                    undermined. The Calvinist clergy, who had always been his enemies, excited their
                    congregations against him and his party; and, as the Prince of Orange approached
                    manhood, the people recalled the obliga <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> tions of
                    the country to his ancestors, and freely expressed doubts whether his rule would
                    not be preferable to that of nobles and wealthy burgesses. The state of public
                    feeling rendered it impossible for De Witt to make ready for the approaching
                    peril. When, therefore, France, England, and the German allies of France
                    proclaimed war against the United Provinces in 1672, and it was found that no
                    effectual resistance could be offered to their attack, popular indignation
                    turned against the grand pensionary. The Prince of Orange was appointed captain
                    and admiral general; and De Witt could only secure that a council of eight
                    deputies of the States General should be associated with the military and naval
                    commanders, one to go with De Ruyter, the other seven with Prince William. This
                    plan added to the confusion, and in a few months after the declaration of war a
                    large part of the country was overrun, and the French were within five leagues
                    of Amsterdam. To save themselves the humiliation of surrender, the towns of
                    Holland and Brabant broke the dykes and laid the sur rounding land under
                    water.</p>

                <p>The Orange party so profited by these disasters that the Perpetual Edict was
                    revoked, and Prince William assumed the office of stadtholder. De Witt’s policy
                    was thus finally defeated, and he himself became an object of general and
                    intense hatred. All sorts of monstrous charges were brought against him, and
                    believed; and his brother Cornelius was falsely accused of conspiring against
                    the life of the stadtholder. Brought to the Hague, Cornelius was there, on July
                    24, 1672, tortured and condemned to perpetual banishment. In the same town De
                    Witt was assaulted by a band of assassins, who left him lying on the ground
                    under the impression that he was dead. Summoned by a pretended message from
                    Cornelius, De Witt went to visit him in prison, when a mob assembled and
                    murdered the brothers amid circumstänces of revolting cruelty.</p>
                <p>De Witt is one of the greatest figures of Dutch history. His action in connection
                    with the Triple Alliance proves that he thoroughly understood the central
                    tendencies of European politics; and, whether he is to be praised or blamed for
                    his life-long opposition to the house of Orange, there can be no doubt as to the
                    greatness and purity of his motives. As an administrator he displayed
                    extraordinary energy and resource; and personally he was a man of steady,
                    upright character, loyal and fearless. His <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> were
                    published at the Hague in 1667; and in 1725, at Amsterdam, appeared <hi
