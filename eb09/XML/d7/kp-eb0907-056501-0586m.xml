                    proper there are numerous open grounds and public squares, which prevent the
                    regularity of its plan degenerating into monotony: the market-place, with the
                    colossal bronze statute of the electoral prince Johann Wilhelm, the parade, the
                    Allée Strasse, the King’s Alley, and the King’s Platz may be specially
                    mentioned. Of the ten churches the most noticeable are—St Andrew’s, formerly the
                    Jesuit or court church, with frescoes by Hübner, Deger, and Mucke, and the
                    embalmed bodies of several of the electors; St Lambert’s, with a tower 180 feet
                    high, and containing monuments in honour of Duke William IV. and Voetius; and
                    Maximilian’s, with frescoes by Settegast and ethers. Besides the old ducal
                    palace, laid in ruins by the French in 1794, but restored in 1846, the secular
                    buildings comprise the former Jesuit college, now occupied by the administrative
                    offices, a town-house dating from 1567, a penitentiary, a lunatic asylum,
                    several hospitals and infirmaries, a theatre completed in 1875, a music hall, a
                    gymnasium, and a polytechnical school. The town also possesses a library of
                    50,000 volumes, and is the seat of a great number of commercial and intellectual
                    associations; but to nothing is it more indebted for its celebrity than to the
                    Academy of Painting. This famous institution, originally founded by the
                    electoral prince Charles Theodore in 1767, was reorganized by King Frederick
                    William in 1822, and has since attained a high degree of prosperity as a centre
                    of artistic culture. From 1822 till 1826 it was under the direction of
                    Cornelius, a native of the town, from 1826 to 1859 under Schadow, and from 1859
                    to 1864 under Bendemann. From Bendemann’s resignation it continued in the hands
                    of a body of curators till 1873, when Wiscelinus of Weimar was chosen director.
                    The noble collection of paintings which formerly adorned the Düsseldorf gallery
                    was removed to Munich in 1805, and has not since been restored; but there is no
                    lack of artistic treasures in the town. The academy possesses 14,000 original
                    drawings and sketches by the great masters, 24,000 engravings, and 248
                    water-colour copies of Italian originals; the municipal gallery contains
                    valuable specimens of the local school: and the same is the case with the
                    Schulte collection. The principal names are Cornelius, Lessing, Achenbach, Baur,
                    Tidemann, and Knaus. An annual exhibition is held under the auspices of the Art
                    Union; and the members of the Artist’s Society, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malkasten,</hi> as they are called, annually celebrate festivities and
                    masquerades of a remarkable description. Not only is Düsseldorf situated in the
                    greatest manufacturing province of Prussia, but it is itself the seat of various
                    important industries,— cotton and carpet weaving, iron-founding, wire-drawing,
                    sugar-refining, brewing, distillation, and the making of pianos and carriages.
                    The surrounding country is largely devoted to market-gardening, and the
                    Düsseldorf mustard is in special repute. A very extensive trade is carried on
                    both by river and by rail; the port was declared free in 1829, and is
                    consequently one of the most frequented on the Rhine. The Düsseldorf Steam-boat
                    Company maintains regular communication with Mayence on the one hand and
                    Rotterdam on the other. A little to the north of the town lies the village of
                    Düsselthal, with Count Recke Volmarstein’s establishment for homeless children
                    in the former Trappist monastery and in the suburban village of Pempelfort is
                    the <hi rend="italic">JiBjeτhof,</hi> the residence at one time of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0587-0566"/> Prince Frederick of Prussia, and afterwards of
                    the prince of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen. In 1780 the number of inhabitants was
                    about 8000; by 1831 it was over 23,000. The census of 1861 gave 41,290 (of which
                    3376 were military); that of 1871, 69,348.</p>
                <p>Düsseldorf, as the form of the name—the village on the Diissel —clearly
                    indicates, was long a place of small consideration. In 1288 it was raised to the
                    rank of a town by Count Adolf of Berg; from his successors it obtained various
                    privileges, and in 1385 was chosen as their residence. After it had suffered
                    greatly in the Thirty Years’ War and the war of the Spanish succession, it
                    recovered its prosperity under the patronage of the electoral prince John
                    William of the Palatinate, who dwelt in the castle till the restoration of
                    Heidelberg. In 1794 the town was violently bombarded by the French; and after
                    the peace of Luneville it was deprived of its fortifications. In 1805 it became
                    the capital of the Napoleonic duchy of Berg; andin 1815 it passed with the duchy
                    into Prussian possession. Among its celebrities are George and Friedrich
                    Heinrich Jakobi, Schenk, Heine, Varnhagen, Cornelius, Camphausen, and H. von
                    Sybel.</p>
