                    nth power.</p>

                    and if the sum of the indices of these variables is <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    the term is said to be of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> dimensions with respect to

                <p>If all the variables of a system with respect to which the equation is
                    homogeneous are increased in the same ratio, the equation will still be
                    true.</p>
                <p>The general equations occurring in the application of mathematics to natural
                    phenomena are equally true whatever units we employ for the measurement of the
                    different quantities which enter into them, provided we employ the same units
                    throughout the equation. Hence such equations must be homogeneous with respect
                    to any system of variables which is referred to the same unit, and all
                    quantities essentially numerical, such as exponents and exponentials,
                    logarithms, angles, and circular and elliptic functions, must be of zero
                    dimensions.</p>
                <p>There are two methods of interpreting the equations relating to geometry and
                    other concrete sciences.</p>
                <p>We may regard the symbols which occur in the equation as of themselves denoting
                    lines, masses, times, &lt;fcc.; or we may consider each symbol as denoting only
                    the numerical value of the corresponding quantity, the concrete unit to which it
                    is referred being tacitly understood.</p>
                <p>If we adopt the first method we shall often have difficulty in interpretiug terms
                    which make their appearance during the calculations. We shall therefore consider
                    all the written symbols as mere numerical quantities, and therefore subject to
                    all the operations of arithmetic during the process of calculation. But in the
                    original equations and the final equations, in which every term has to be
                    interpreted in a physical sense, we must convert every numerical expression into
                    à concrete quantity by multiplying it by the unit of that kind of quantity.</p>
                <p>Thus if we write [L] for the unit of length, that is to say, the actual concrete
                    centimetre or foot, and if <hi rend="italic">x</hi> denotes the numerical value
                    of a certain line, then the complete expression for the line is <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> [L]; and if <hi rend="italic">y, z,</hi> &amp;c,, are the
                    numerical values of other lines, then the complete expression for the quantity
                    whose numerical value is <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    a</hi><hi rend="italic">y^z</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> γ</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> β</hi><hi rend="italic">sh[sh</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> a+β+</hi><hi rend="italic">^,</hi> and this quantity
                    is said to be of <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">+ β</hi> + γ
                    dimensions with respect to [L], the unit of length.</p>
                <p>There must be as many different units as there are different kinds of quantities
                    to be measured, but in all dynamical sciences it is possible to define these
                    units in terms of the three fundamental units of length, time, and mass. We
                    therefore suppose these three fundamental units to be given, and deduce all the
                    others from these by the simplest attainable definitions.</p>
                <p>The equations at which we arrive must be such that a person of any nation, by
                    substituting for the different symbols the numerical values of the quantities as
                    measured by his own national units, would obtain a true result.</p>
                <p>This can only be the case if the equation is homogeneous with respect to each of
                    the fundamental units. To ascertain if it is so we must count the dimensions of
                    every term, and for this purpose we must know the dimensions of any derived
                    units which enter into the equation. The theory of the dimensions of physical
                    quantities were first stated by Fourier, <hi rend="italic">Théorie de
                    Chaleur,</hi> sec. 160.</p>
                <p>By knowing the dimensions of any quantity we are able at once to deduce its
                    numerical value as expressed in terms of one system of units from its numerical
                    value as given in terms of another system.</p>
                <p>Thus, magnetic measurements have been made according to the British system, in
                    which the foot, the grain, and the second of mean time are the fundamental
                    units. Other magnetic measurements have been made according to systems derived
                    from the French metric system, using the metre, centimetre, or millimetre as
                    unit of length, the kilogramme, gramme, or milligramme as unit of mass, and the
                    second as unit of time. In recent times an effort has been made to procure the
                    adoption for all scientific measurements of a system in which the centimetre,
                    gramme, and second are the units. This is sometimes referred to as the C. G. S.
                    system, and a copious list of examples of the measurement of physical quantities
                    on this system, of its comparison with other systems, and of the dimensions of
                    quantities occurring in all branches of physics, has been prepared by Dr
                    Everett, and published by the Physical Society of London and by Taylor and
                    Francis, under the title <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">G. S. System of Units.</hi></p>
                <p>The three fundamental units may be selected each independently of the others, in
                    an entirely arbitrary manner. It is possible, however, by taking advantage of
                    the permanence of the properties of natural substances, so to define the units
                    that one or more of them may be reproduced without reference to any material
                    standard at present existing.</p>
                <p>Thus, if the density of a standard substance in a standard state, such as water
                    when at its maximum density under the pressure of its own vapour, is defined as
                    the unit of density, then the unit of mass may be derived from the unit of
                    length, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> In this system, therefore, the
                    dimensions of mass in terms of length are L <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, or
                    of length in terms of mass, M∙^</p>
                <p>We may define the three fundamental units without reference to any actual body,
                    but by means of a natural substance such as water. For if the solid, liquid, and
                    gaseous states of pure water are in equilibrium in a vessel containing no other
                    fluid, the pressure and temperature of the system are determinate. We may
                    therefore define the unit of density in terms of the density of the liquid water
                    under these conditions, and the unit of pressure in terms of the pressure in the
                    vessel. We may deduce the third unit from the law of gravitation, and define the
                    unit of time in terms of the time of revolution of a satellite about a sphere
                    having the unit density at a distance equal to the radius. This time must be
                    calculated from the results of experiments on attraction. Having thus obtained a
                    density, a pressure, and a time, the magnitudes of which are the same under all
                    circumstances, we can derive from them standards of length and mass. For the
                    dimensions of the unit of density [D] are [ML ’], and those of the unit of
                    pressure [F] are [ML <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> T^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>], so that the dimensions of [L] are [P’ D ⅛ τj, and those of [Μ] are [P
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> D^*T <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>].</p>
                <p>This method of defining the three fundamental units is suggested, not as being at
                    all comparable in point of accuracy with the usual methods, but as being an
                    example of a method independent of the preservation of any material standards,
                    whether artificial, as those 1 ept by Government, or natural, as the earth, and
                    its time of revolution. (j. c. Μ.)</p>
