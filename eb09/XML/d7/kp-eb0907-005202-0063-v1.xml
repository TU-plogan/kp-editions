                    ancient Greece in the territory of Phocis, famous as the seat of the most
                    important temple and oracle of Apollo. It was situated about six miles inland
                    from the shores of the Corinthian Gulf, in a rugged and romantic glen, closed on
                    the N. by the steep wall-like under-cliffs of Mount Parnassus known as the
                    Phaedriades, or Shining Rocks, on the E. and W. by two minor ridges or spurs,
                    and on the S. by the irregular heights of Mount Cirphis. Between the two
                    mountains the Pleistus flowed from east to west, and opposite the town received
                    the brooklet of the Castalian fountain, which rose in a deep gorge in the centre
                    of the Parnassian cliff. The site of the ancient town is now occupied by the
                    village of Castri, and the natural features of the scene have been somewhat
                    altered by the earthquake of 1870; but the main points of interest can still be
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>The principal building of Delphi was the temple of Apollo, which stood
                    immediately under the shelter of the northern cliff. It appears to have been of
                    the Doric order outside, and of the Ionic within. The front was built of Parian
                    marble, and the sculptural decorations were extremely rich. One pediment was
                    adorned with representations of Latona, Diana, Apollo, and the Setting Sun, and
                    the other with Dionysus and the Thyiades; the eastern architrave was hung with
                    gilded shields presented <pb break="no"

                    and the western with similar trophies taken -by the Aetolians from the Gauls;
                    while among the subjects of the metopes are mentioned Hercules slaying the
                    Lernean Hydra, Bellerophon and the Chimaera, Zeus and Mimas, Pallas and
                    Enceladus, and Dionysus and a Giant. In the <hi rend="italic">pronaos</hi> were
                    inscribed the maxims of the Seven Sages of Greece; in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >cdla</hi> was the sacred hearth with a perpetιral fire and the
                    &lt;5∕x&lt;∕&gt;αλoς, or navel-stone, which was supposed to mark the centre of
                    the world; and in the <hi rend="italic">adytum</hi> was the sacred tripod and
                    the subterranean chamber from which the vapour of prophecy ascended. Of less
                    important buildings may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Lesdιe,</hi> or
                    public hall, the walls of which were adorned with the works of Polygnotus and
                    other master-pieces of ancient art; the theatre, where the musical contests
                    connected with the Pythian games were held; the <hi rend="italic">Stadium,</hi>
                    of which there are still considerable remains; and, in the suburb of the same
                    name, the <hi rend="italic">Pylaea,</hi> or assembly hall of the Amphictyonie
                    Council. The town was entered from the east by a road from Baeotia known as the
                    Schiste, or Cloven Way, and from the west by the great Crissean road, which was
                    used by the pilgrims who came from the Corinthian Gulf, and by another which
                    βtretched north-west to Amphissa. These roads were regarded almost as the
                    property of the temple, and shared in its sacredness; and each Amphictyonie
                    state was bound to keep them in repair within its own boundaries. About seven
                    miles to the north of the town, on the side of Mount Parnassus, was the famous
                    Corycian cave, a large grotto in the limestone rock, which afforded the people
                    of Delphi a refuge during the Persian invasion. It is now called in the district
                    the Sarånt’ Aulai, or Forty Courts, and is said to be capable of holding 3000
                    people.</p>
                <p>Of the origin of the Delphian oracle nothing is known. One legend told how the
                    prophetic virtues of the site were discovered by a shepherd whose goats began to
                    frisk about under the influence of the subterranean vapour; and another related
                    how Apollo, after he had slain the great serpent Pytho on the spot, boarded a
                    Cretan ship in the neighbouring gulf, and consecrated the crew to his service.
                    It seems almost certain that the place was the seat of a religious establishment
                    previous to its connection with the worship of Apollo; but its whole historic
                    importance—which can hardly be over-estimated—is entirely due to this
                    connection. The first temple of stone was reputed to have been built by the
                    semi-mythical personages Trophonius and Agamedes. It was burned down in 548
                    B.c.,but was soon after replaced by the building which has already been
                    described. The contract for the work was taken by the Athenian family of the
                    Alcmaeonids,who were at that time in exile from the tyranny of Hippias. They
                    employed the architect Spintharus, and acquired great credit for the
                    disinterested liberality with which they accomplished their task. The principal
                    facts in the history of Delphi have already been narrated in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Amphictyony</hi> (vol. i. p. 772), where the reader will
                    also find an account of the relation in which the temple stood to the states of
                    Greece. It only remains to tell how the sanctuary and its treasures, which had
                    been miraculously saved from the Persians and the Gauls, were put under
                    contribution by Sulla for the payment of his soldiers; how Nero removed no fewer
                    than 500 brazen images from the sacred precincts; and how Constantine the Great
                    enriched his new city by the sacred tripods, the statues of the Heliconian
                    Muses, the Apollo, and the celebrated Pan dedicated by the Greek cities after
                    the conclusion of the war with the Medes. Julian afterwards sent Oribasius to
                    restore the temple; but the oracle responded to the emperor’s enthusiasm with
                    nothing but a wail over the glory that had departed.</p>
