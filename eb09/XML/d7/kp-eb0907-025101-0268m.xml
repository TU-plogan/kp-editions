                <p><label type="entry">DIPLOMACY</label> is the art of conducting the intercourse of
                    nations with each other. The word obviously owes its origin to the source
                    subsequently explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Diplomatics.</hi> It
                    is singular that a term of so much practical importance in politics and history
                    should be so recent in its adoption that it is not to be found in Johnson’s
                    dictionary. There has, indeed, ever been a reluctance in the English nature to
                    acknowledge the art of transacting international business as a pursuit worthy of
                    a British statesman, or as one entitling its adepts to honourable fame. It is
                    popularly looked on as the art of carrying into the business of nations a
                    morality condemned in the intercourse of men with each other, and as a means of
                    employing subtlety where force is insufficient to accomplish some statesman’s
                    object. Hence the term has been colloquially used to express a modified degree
                    of cunning; and conduct which is wily and subtle, without being directly false
                    or fraudulent, is styled “diplomatic.” The subject has been usually treated
                    under the head of the Law of Nations, or, as it is now more properly termed,
                    international law. But a little examination will show that diplomacy, though
                    closely associated with international law, is a separate sphere of intellectual
                    exertion. The diplomatist undoubtedly requires to be acquainted with
                    international law, and to observe its general injunctions. He often finds it
                    necessary to appeal to the rules, or supposed rules, of that code; but it would
                    be a confusion of terms to count him an officer engaged in the execution of
                    international law. He has to accomplish objects which are not achievable through
                    any law real or fictitious, but are achieved solely through the art of
                    diplomacy. Questions in which private rights and obligations are concerned are a
                    perpetual source of diplomatic exertion. In England, and to some extent in the
                    other states called the great powers, the administration of justice is pursued
                    on rules so absolute that there is no chance of their being relinquished to
                    favour a friendly or to injure a hostile nation. Further, diplomacy, besides the
                    larger operations connected with great treaties or alliances, keeps a vigilant
                    eye on the ordinary details of international law, for the purpose of seeing that
                    it is equitably administered. In this sense the diplomatist is like a law-agent,
                    whose duty it is to see that his client receives justice at the hands of other
                    nations under this code.</p>
                <p>Diplomacy, as a science, has arisen out of the development of the European
                    powers, and their rise on the ruins of the Roman empire. As a uniform system,
                    following principles nearly as well established as those of many codes of law,
                    it exists solely among the European powers, partly embracing those nations, such
                    as Turkey and Persia, which have been brought into close association with them.
                    The difficulty, however, of getting those Eastern states to understand and obey
                    the laws of diplomacy, and submit to its restraints, has ever been an object of
                    anxious comment to Wickefort and the other systematic writers on diplomacy. To
                    submit to be bound in the moment of power by a theoretical system not enforced
                    by the strong hand of any judge, spiritual or temporal, is not consistent with
                    the Oriental mind; and the great civilized powers, in dealing with the Eastern
                    states, as in their intercourse with barbarous tribes, have relied on their own
                    strength, exercised with cruelty or with mildness as the case might be.
                    Alliances and leagues, declarations of war and treaties of peace, have taken
                    place, it is true, among those states, but it would be an historical absurdity
                    to suppose diplomatic relations connecting together China, Burmah, and Japan, as
                    they connect the great European powers.</p>
                <p>In the same manner the ancient world had its treaties and leagues, but no
                    systematic diplomatic relations. The pretensions of Rome during the empire,
                    indeed, superseded every kind of international engagement, since she would
                    permit of no relation between the empire and any other state, save that of
                    predominance on her part and subjection on the other. Yet it is evidently from
                    this system of centralization that the diplomatic relations of the European
                    states arose. Freed from the temporal jurisdiction of the empire, and no longer
                    mere dependencies, the European states were still subject in a modified shape to
                    an influence radiating from the old centre of imperial authority. The bishop of
                    Rome, in claiming a spiritual authority at least co-extensive with the
                    geographical area of the temporal authority of the departed emperors of Rome,
                    created a sanction, though an imperfect one, for the execution of justice among
                    nations, and acted in some measure as a controlling influence over their
                    diplomatic operations. A memorable instance of the influence of the Pope is
                    found in the relations between John of England and Philip of France. The
                    semi-judicial authority of the court of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n269/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0269-0252"/> Rome was cited in support of the English conαuest
                    cf Ireland, and was appealed to by both parties in the Scottish War of
                    Independence. Little as the Papal authority was respected by even the most
                    Catholic monarchs when they were at the head of large and well-found armies, yet
                    in matters of dubious equilibrium the authority of the Pope had some weight; and
                    as his was a power not limited to any particular state or cluster of states, but
                    ever present throughout all the transactions of Christian realms with each
                    other, it had, beyond doubt, an influence gradual and continuous in giving
                    modern diplomacy the amount of specific character which it had obtained at the
                    period of the Reformation. Under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance of
                    Power,</hi> the evils arising from the absence of a supreme power to judge
                    between states, as the courts of law decide questions between individual
                    citizens, will be found discussed. It suffices here to say, that much of the
                    deficiency is filled up by the fortunate train of events which have created,
                    throughout the civilized world, a traditional system of diplomatic practice.</p>
                <p>The representatives of great nations, following up the traditions of the science
                    of diplomacy, have often sought by similar acts to do what they considered their
                    duty to their country by taking advantage of every opportunity of aggrandizing
                    it. But modern political philosophy and morality teach us that this is not the
                    manner in which great nations are to be supported or aggrandized, and that for
                    their diplomatic servants there is spread out a far nobler field of exertion. It
                    is founded on the consciousness that the real power of states must come from
                    within—from the sound condition of the people, physically, industrially, and
                    morally—from well-poised political institutions and good government. If these
                    are absent no diplomatic skill can make up for them; if they be present it
                    cannot enhance the real power of the state which possesses them. But to the
                    diplomatic representatives of states both powerful and honest a function of a
                    higher character still than mere national aggrandizement belongs, in the
                    capacity, by able, temperate, and honourable negotiation, to keep feeble states
                    from being crushed by their potent neighbours, to preserve peace in the world so
                    long as it can honourably be preserved, and to see generally that international
                    justice is observed among mankind. The true functions of the great powers are in
                    some measure embodied in the well-known lines of Virgil:</p>
                <p>“Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento; Hae tibi erunt artes; pacisque
                    imponere morem, Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.”</p>
                <p>The historical events, and the industrial and commercial progress which have
                    during the past hundred years so aggrandized the power of Britain among European
                    nations, have, in this view of the uses of our diplomacy, become a great boon to
                    the smaller states, and even to the citizens of the greater. The parliamentary
                    responsibility, and the perpetual public scrutiny and discussion to which the
                    acts of our statesmen are subjected, are not only checks on our own diplomatic
                    acts, but on those of every other civilized state. It was a boast attributed to
                    one of the great fabricators of British diplomacy, the elder Pitt, that not a
                    gun should be fired throughout the world without Britain knowing why. If Britain
                    could make good this boast, it would extend in some measure to mankind at large
                    the blessings enjoyed at home from living under a responsible government. As it
                    is even at present, the continuous liability of having whatever he does called
                    before Parliament and the public, must be an ever present and influencing motive
                    with every British diplomatist. Hence he not only dare not countenance any act
                    of national rapacity, tyranny, or fraud, but he is, as the representative of a
                    nation which has great power and no secrets, a check upon the diplomatic honesty
                    of all the world.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the old opinions which attributed the power and prosperity of
                    nations to diplomatic ability, overlooking the substantial sources of material
                    progress, a political sect has appeared in recent times who denounce the
                    diplomatic system as foolish or wicked, and proclaim the doctrine of
                    non-intervention in the affairs of other nations. It is practically clear,
                    however, that whatever degree of perfection the world may reach in time, the
                    first great power which avows this opinion will become the immediate victim of
                    its rivals; and thus, should Britain withdraw herself from the diplomacy of
                    Europe, the despotic states would soon become strong enough to shut up the
                    commerce of the world, and cast the world two centuries back in
                    civilization.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps scarcely necessary to mention that the source of the diplomatic
                    organization in any nation is its supreme power; but it is useful to keep in
                    view that, for the rapid movements of this department of politics, nations the
                    most jealous of their constitutional rights have been obliged to place at least
                    provisional power in the hands of individual rulers. Thus in Britain the
                    sovereign, independently of Parliament, has technically the power to make
                    treaties and to declare peace and war; and an authority not much less extensive
                    is committed to the president of the United States. The guidance of a great
                    state’s relations with foreign countries is generally committed to one
                    department of the Government—with us it is the function of the foreign
                    secretary. How far he is bound to consult his colleagues in his intercourse with
                    foreign states has sometimes been matter of acrimonious discussion. The
                    representatives of the Government at foreign courts, though the dignified
                    character of their missions sometimes gives them a rank much higher than that of
                    their instructor, must obey the directions of the foreign minister. In the
                    negotiation of treaties there is an old-standing dispute among publicists, how
                    far nations can be bound if their ambassadors exceed the instructions given to
                    them, which are generally kept secret. When, therefore, an important
                    international act, such as a treaty, is undertaken, there are many sanctions and
                    ceremonials to be accomplished before it is held to be completed. While matters
                    are in a vague condition, many briefly expressed fundamental suggestions will
                    have passed among the negotiators in the form of notes. When the matter becomes
                    more ripe for adjustment, it assumes the shape of a protocol, or draft of the
                    conditions. The ambassadors, when all is adjusted, sign the articles of the
                    treaty; but still it is generally deemed essential that the several Governments
                    should ratify it, or, admitting that their representatives have not exceeded
                    their instructions, engage to fulfil the bargain they have made. In this
                    country, whenever treaties affect the private rights of the citizen, they must
                    be ratified by Act of Parliament. In addition to notes and substantive treaties,
                    the most important documents in diplomacy may be considered the manifestoes, in
                    which, paying homage to public opinion and the established rules of diplomacy,
                    Governments profess to justify their conduct. When any vile act of oppression or
                    injustice is perpetrated, it is generally followed by an able manifesto, and the
                    ingenuity of the accomplished diplomatist is taxed to make the deed appear just,
                    rational, and necessary.</p>
                <p>The nature and functions of the large body of officers who chiefly conduct the
                    diplomacy of the world having been described under the heading <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ambassador,</hi> it only remains to notice the incidental
                    circumstance that custom has for some time established the French language as
                    the language of diplomacy. In the 16th and during a great part of the 17th
                    century, Latin was employed. In Ludlow’s memoirs there is, under the year 1656,
                    a curious notice to the effect that the Swedish ambassador “com <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0270-0253"/> plained of the delays in his business, and that,
                    when he desired to have the articles of this treaty put into Latin according to
                    the custom of treaties, it was fourteen days they made him stay for that
                    translation, and sent it to <hi rend="italic">one Mr Milton, a blind man,</hi>
                    to put them into Latin, who, he said must use an amanuensis to read it to him,
                    and that amanuensis might publish the matter of the articles as he pleased, and
                    that it seemed strange to him there should be none but a blind man capable of
                    putting a few articles into Latin.” In turning over the pages of the great
                    collection of treaties by Dumont and Rousset, one may observe how gradually,
                    during the ascendency of Richelieu, and the subsequent reign of Louis XIV., the
                    use of the French language radiates from the immediate’ diplomatic transactions
                    of France over those of Europe at large. Probably its propagation was originally
                    connected with the visions of that universal French empire to which Louis XIV.
                    seemed to be marching before he encountered the combinations of William of
                    Orange. At the present day it can only be pronounced a fortunate thing that
                    diplomatists have agreed to use one language, and that the best adapted for
                    their peculiar functions.</p>
