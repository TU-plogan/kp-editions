                    respect thereof, depend partly on old ecclesiastical law and partly on recent
                    Acts of Parliament. Questions as to dilapidations usually arise in respect of
                    the residence house and other buildings belonging to the living. Inclosures,
                    hedges, ditches, and the like are included in things “of which the beneficed
                    person hath the burden and charge of reparation.” In a leading case (Ross <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Adcock, 37 <hi rend="italic">Law Journal,</hi> C.P. 290)
                    it was said that the court was acquainted with no precedent or decision
                    extending the liability of the executors of a deceased incumbent to any species
                    of waste beyond dilapidation of the house, chancel, or other buildings or fences
                    of the benefice. And it has been held that the mere mismanagement or
                    miscultivation of the ecclesiastical lands will not give rise to an action for
                    dilapidations. To place the law relating to dilapidations on a more satisfactory
                    footing, the Act 34 and 35 Vict. c. 43 was passed. The buildings to which the
                    Act applies are defined to be such houses of residence, chancels, walls, fences,
                    and other buildings and things as the incumbent of the benefice is by law and
                    custom bound to maintain in repair. In each diocese a surveyor is to be
                    appointed by the archdeacons and rural deans subject to the approval of the
                    bishop; and such surveyor shall by the direction of the bishop examine the
                    buildings on the following occasions—viz., 1, when the benefice is sequestrated;
                    2, when it is vacant; 3, at the request of the incumbent or on complaint by the
                    archdeacon, rural dean, or patron. The surveyor is to specify the works
                    required, and to give an estimate of their probable cost. In the case of a
                    vacant benefice, the new incumbent and the old incumbent or his representatives
                    may lodge objections to the surveyor’s report on any grounds of fact or law, and
                    the bishop, after consideration, may make an order for the repairs and their
                    cost, for which the late incumbent or his representatives ate liable. The sum so
                    stated shall be a debt due from the late incumbent or his representatives to the
                    new incumbent, who shall pay over the money when recovered to the governors of
                    Queen Anne’s Bounty. The governors pay for the works on execution on receipt of
                    a certificate from the surveyor; and the surveyor, when the works have been
                    completed to his satisfaction, shall give a certificate to that effect, the
                    effect of which, so far as regards the incumbent, will be to protect him from
                    liability for dilapidations for the next five years. Unnecessary buildings
                    belonging to a residence house may, by the authority of the bishop and with the
                    consent of the patron, be removed. An amending statute (35 and 36 Vict. c. 96)
                    relates chiefly to advances by the governors of Queen Anne’s Bounty for the
                    purposes of the Act.</p>
