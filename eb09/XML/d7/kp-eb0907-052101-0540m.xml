                    Louise Dumas, a black woman of St Domingo. Long after, his grandson was to
                    excite the laughter of Paris by claiming this title, and assuming the family
                    arms. The general had an insubordinate temper, and excited the dislike and
                    suspicion of Napoleon, who sent him back from Egypt to languish in obscurity,
                    and die of disappointment at Villers-Cotterets in the year 1806.</p>
                <p>Alexandre Dumas was born on July 4, 1802, at Villers-Cotterets, where he was
                    brought up under the care of an affectionate and pious mother. Some of the most
                    graceful passages of autobiography are to be found in those pages of his memoirs
                    which are devoted to an account of his boyhood, and which present an excellent
                    picture of French country town life. He seems to have been an idle and a
                    troublesome youth, and, though places were found for him with notaries and other
                    functionaries, he could not settle to business. The family means were slender.
                    They were soon almost reduced to poverty; and in the year 1823 Alexandre set off
                    for Paris to seek his fortune, where he was to make such good use of his slender
                    opportunities, that within five years his name became famous. Within a few days
                    of his arrival, an old friend of his father’s, General Fυy, obtained a clerk’s
                    place for him in the duke of Orleans’s establishment, worth only £50 a year, but
                    it seemed a fortune. A friend, De Leuven, and he now joined their talents in a
                    light farce called <hi rend="italic">Le Chasse</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">VAmour</hi> (produced September 22, 1825). This was succeeded by a
                    αramatic piece, written with the assistance of one of his friends, and called
                    <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Noce et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi><hi rend="italic">Enterrement</hi> (November 21, 1826), known in England
                    as the amusing <hi rend="italic">Illustrious Stranger.</hi> Meanwhile the visit
                    of Macready and other English players to Paris had introduced him to
                    Shakespeare, and had set him to work on a grand romantic and historical drama
                    which he called <hi rend="italic">Christine.</hi> The young clerk had the
                    boldness to look forward to having it presented on the boards of the first
                    theatre in France, and, with an energy and spirit that should encourage every
                    friendless aspirant, set every resource he could command at work. Charles Nodier
                    introduced him to Baron Taylor, the literary director of the theatre, who, if we
                    are to credit Dumas, was so enchanted with the work that he accepted it and
                    submitted it to the company at once. It is more probable that, from the rather
                    corrupt fashion which then regulated such matters, the privilege was secured by
                    the influence of the duke of Orleans. But it happened that another <hi
                    rend="italic">Christine</hi> was supported by even greater influence, and
                    Dumas’s had to be withdrawn. In a short time he had written <hi rend="italic"
                    >Henri III.</hi> which was produced (February 11, 1829) with the most
                    extraordinary results. This piece was important as being the first success of
                    the well known “Romantic school.” <hi rend="italic">Henri III.,</hi> it is said,
                    brought its author about £2000. But the revolution of July now broke out and
                    interrupted every literary scheme.</p>
                <p>It was, however, welcomed by the creole’s son, who flung himself with ardour into
                    the struggle. And here begins that double interest in his life, which was as
                    adventurous as that of some of his own heroes, and suggests the career of
                    Benvenuto Cellini. He has, of course, made his own share in the exciting scenes
                    of the Three Days as conspicuous as possible; and his expedition to Soissons,
                    and almost single-handed capture of a powder magazine, a general, and officers
                    were heartily laughed at and wholly dis believed. Allowing, however, for
                    embellishment, it is due to him to say that his narrative seems to be true in
                    the main. He was, however, unlucky enough to have cast his lot with the more
                    violent party, which found itself opposed to the Orleans family, and never
                    recovered their favour; and King Louis Philippe always treated him with a good·
                    humoured contempt.</p>
                <p>He now returned to his dramatic labours, and produced <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antony</hi> (1831), one of the earliest of those gross outrages on public
                    morality which have helped to make conjugal infidelity the favourite theme of
                    the French drama. But by this time he had found that the slow production of
                    dramas scarcely offered a profitable field for his talents. The successful
                    founding of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> tempted him into
                    trying his skill on historical romances, professedly in imitation of Sir Walter
                    Scott. And this would seem to be the first opening of that seam which was to be
                    worked later with such extraordinary profit. Here he introduced that daring
                    system of working up the ideas of others, which he had already carried out in
                    his dramatic labours, his successful pieces of <hi rend="italic">Henri III.</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Christine</hi> proving to consist of whole scenes stolen
                    from Schiller and other writers almost without changing a word, though the
                    arrangement of the plot and situations are masterly and original. A piece of
                    his, called the <hi rend="italic">Tour de Nesle</hi> (produced in 1832), which
                    caused a perfect furore in Paris, led, however, to a more serious charge of
                    plagiarism. In consequence of a duel he was directed to leave France for a time,
                    and set off—in July 1832—on a tour through <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0541-0522"/> Switzerland, which suggested to him a series of
                    those odd books of travels made up of long extracts from old memoirs,
                    guide-books, imaginary dialogues, and adventures.</p>
                <p>In 1842 he married an actress named Ida Ferrier, who had performed in his plays;
                    but the union was not a happy one, and, after a rather extravagant career, the
                    lady retired to Florence, where she died in the year 1859. Hitherto his success,
                    though remarkable, could not be called European, and he was not to be
                    distinguished from the crowd of French professional <hi rend="italic"
                    >litterateurs.</hi> But in 1844 the famous <hi rend="italic">Monte Christo</hi>
                    appeared, which may be said to have excited more universal interest than any
                    romance since <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Waver
                    ley.</hi> The extraordinary colour, the never-flagging spirit, the endless
                    surprises, and the air of nature which was cast over even the most extravagant
                    situations, make this work worthy of the popularity it enjoyed in almost every
                    country of the world. It was followed by the no less famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Three Musketeers.</hi> These productions were the more remarkable as they were
                    written from day to day for the readers of a newspaper, and thus firmly
                    established the <hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi> as a necessary element of
                    French literature. In this, as in other departments where he was successful,
                    Dumas was not original, and only took up the idea of a successful predecessor,
                    Eugène Sue, whose <hi rend="italic">Juif</hi><hi rend="italic">Errant</hi> had
                    enjoyed much popularity in this shape.</p>
                <p>This triumph made him, as it were, irresponsible in the literary world, and
                    suggested to him a series of wholesale operations for supplying the public with
                    books, the history of which makes an extraordinary chapter in literature. He
                    contracted for innumerable stories, each of great length, and to be published at
                    the same time, almost any one of which would be beyond the powers of a single
                    writer. In a single year, 1844, he issued some forty volumes, and later on he
                    engaged himself even more deeply to meet these heavy demands. He began by
                    employing one or two assistants, with whose aid he furnished his two great
                    stories; and it may be said that, with his constant supervision and inspiration,
                    his daily direction, suggestion of incidents, manipulation of the ideas of
                    others, consultations, &lt;fcc., he might almost fairly claim the credit of
                    having written <hi rend="italic">Monte Christo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Three Musketeers.</hi> His most valuable assistant was Maquet. Indeed, the
                    chief credit of Dumas’s most important stories has been claimed for him; but as
                    he afterwards often tried his powers alone, and with but poor success, it seems
                    probable that his share in Dumas’s works was no more than what has been
                    described. But presently the popular writer found that even this form of
                    partnership was too great a tax upon his time, and he began to proceed upon the
                    simpler process of ordering works from clever young writers, to whom he
                    suggested a subject and perhaps a simple outline of treatment—and then issuing
                    their work with his name. Some care in the selection was at first exercised, but
                    later he accepted any stuff that was brought to him—travels, essays, stories—and
                    endorsed them with his name. Indeed a volume could be filled with the odd
                    details and complicated ramifications of this system, which was exposed in the
                    most unsparing fashion by Granier de Cassagnac, Jacquet <hi rend="italic"
                    >alias</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> il</hi> De Mirecourt,” and Quérard.
                    Dumas justified his system of appropriating from dead and living authors by a
                    theory of what he called “conquests.” “All human phenomena,” he says, “are
                    public property. The man of genius does not steal, he only conquers. Every one
                    arrives in his turn and at his hour, seizes what his ancestors have left, and
                    puts it into new shapes and combinations.”</p>
                <p>In the meantime he was earning vast sums. Leaving the work of composition to his
                    journeymen, he now entered on a new and reckless course, with a view of dazzling
                    his countrymen and gratifying his own Eastern taste. In this view he built a
                    vast theatre for the production of his own works, and a gorgeous castle at St
                    Germain, on the model of a palace in a fairy tale, on which he lavished every
                    adornment. While these follies were in progress, he succeeded in getting himself
                    attached to the suite of the young duke of Montpensier, then (1846) setting out
                    for Madrid to be married, and received besides a sort of commission from the
                    Government to visit Algeria, with a view to making it popular by a lively
                    account from his pen. He was granted a passage to Oran on board one of the
                    Government mail boats, but, through an awkward misconception, was allowed to
                    divert this vessel from her regular service, and used her for visiting Carthage,
                    Tunis, and other places. On his return there was much scandal, and the ministry
                    was very severely interrogated as to the irregularity of allowing “a contractor
                    for stories” to make so free with public property. It was explained that this
                    was entirely owing to a misrepresentation of the popular writer’s. Another
                    rebuff, too, was waiting him; for, having completely neglected his engagements
                    to the various newspapers while making this agreeable tour, he found himself
                    engaged in heavy law-suits with no less than seven journals, including the <hi
                    rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Presse.</hi> After
                    defending himself in person, a performance that was the entertainment of all
                    Paris, he was cast in damages. This was the beginning of his disasters. His
                    theatre, after opening with one of his pieces which took two nights to perform,
                    fell on evil days, and the revolution of 1848 plunged it into difficulties. In
                    these new scenes he was by no means popular, being suspected from his assiduous
                    attendance on the Orleans family. By this time all his best works had been
                    written; and he was now only to attract attention by some extravagant literary
                    somersault or impudent attempt at “humbugging” the public. He attempted
                    newspapers like the <hi rend="italic">Mousque</hi><hi rend="italic">taire,</hi>
                    of which he would grow tired after a few numbers, but to every article in which
                    he was ready to attach his name. His next escapade was joining Garibaldi (1860),
                    whose messenger and lieutenant he constitutedhimself; and, in reward for some
                    trifling service, he claimed the appointment of “director of the museum and
                    explorations” at Naples, an office he was presently forced to resign. After this
                    he was reduced to all manner of devices to maintain himself, always borrowing
                    and obtaining money by shifts and pretences which in another could not be called
                    honest. It becomes, indeed, painful to follow the stages in this rapid decay,—to
                    find him reduced to writing “puffs” for tradesmen, to exhibiting himself in shop
                    windows, and to introducing grand schemes to the public which it is impossible
                    to read without hearty laughter. A scandalous infatuation, too, was to be
                    associated with his old age, which last excited the contempt pity of all who
                    knew him. To the last he was full of schemes, devised with the fertility and
                    roseate imagination of a Micawber · and to the last, unfortunately, he was
                    devoted to pleasure. The result was a breaking up of his health, and even a
                    decay of his faculties. When the war of 1870 broke out he was removed from Paris
                    to Puys, near Dieppe, and there affectionately attended by his son and daughter.
                    He died on the 5th of December in the same year. He was even poorer than when he
                    began the world; and the brilliant novelist, who had earned more than £10,000 a
                    year, had hardly a sou left. On the 16th April 1872, when the war was over, his
                    remains were removed to Villers-Cotterets, and interred in presence of the
                    leading <hi rend="italic">littérateurs</hi> of Paris.</p>
                <p>The works that bear Dumas’s name are said to amount to some 1200 volumes. His
                    dialogue is entirely his own, full of spirit and.dramatic propriety—and this,
                    too, in spite of the temptation, to a man paid by the line, to “spin out” his
                    matter to the utmost extent. He left about sixty dramas, of which not more than
                    three or four will be remembered; but two, the <hi rend="italic">Mariage</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sous</hi><hi rend="italic">Louis</hi><hi rend="italic">X V.</hi>

                    will always be listened to with delight. His most popular stories have been
                    mentioned, but even now their undue expansion and interminable development,
                    owing to the necessities of the <hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi> system, are
                    found to be serious obstacles to their popularity.</p>
                <p>He left a daughter, Madame Petel, who has written a few romances, and a son, the
                    well-known “Alexandre Fils,” who, unlike his father, has been distinguished by
                    slow and careful work. He is best known by his romance <hi rend="italic">La

                    language in which romances are written, and by a number of dramas which deal

                    second empire. <hi rend="smallcaps">(p. f.)</hi></p>
