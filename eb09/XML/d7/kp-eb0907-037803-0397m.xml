                    (1794-C. 1837), a French traveller born at Hambye, in the department of Manche,
                    whose asserted discoveries in Africa have in large measure been relegated to the
                    region of romance. At an early period his imagination seems to have been fired
                    by narratives of travel and adventure; and accordingly, when he fell heir to a
                    wealthy relation, he at once proceeded to gratify his desire for personal
                    acquaintance with foreign lands. He certainly wandered far and wide; and,
                    according to his own profession, he visited India, Kashmir, Khorassan, Persia,
                    Asia Minor, and many parts of Europe. After spending some time in Paris, and
                    being admitted a member of the Société de Géographie, he proceeded in 1826 to
                    Brazil, with the intention apparently of carrying on scientific explorations:
                    from this purpose, however, he was diverted by the political circumstances of
                    the country; and to replenish his funds he started business at Montevideo in
                    partnership with a Μ. Laboissière. Towards the close of the following year,
                    probably in October, after a short residence at Rio Janeiro, he left Brazil for
                    the Portuguese possessions on the west coast of Africa, where his presence in
                    March 1828 is proved by the mention made of him in certain letters of Castillo
                    Branco, the governor-general of Loanda. In May 1831 he reappeared in France,
                    claiming to have pushed his explorations into the very heart of Africa, as far
                    as the 27th degree of longitude E. of Greenwich, or, in other words, into what
                    is now known as the great equatorial lake region. His story was readily accepted
                    by the Société de Géographie at Paris, which hastened to recognize his services
                    by assigning him the great gold medal, and appointing him their secretary for
                    the year 1832. On the publication of his narrative <hi rend="italic">—

                    four large volumes, and was accompanied by an elaborate atlas, the public
                    enthusiasm might well run high. In company with his wife (a sister of his old
                    Montevidean partner), and attended by about 400 native porters, the happy
                    traveller had advanced from kingdom to kingdom rather like a monarch making a
                    progress through his tributary states, distributing largesses and receiving
                    homage, than like a humble adventurer defraying his expenses from his private
                    purse. Everything went smooth for a time; the interior of Africa was described
                    in text books and depicted in maps according to the discoveries of Douville; but
                    in the August number of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> for
                    1832 the most sweeping charges of ignorance and fraud were launched against the
                    author, and this attack wað followed up in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux
                    Mondes</hi> for November, by Thomas Lacordaire, who asserted that, during part
                    of the time which he claimed to have spent in Africa, Douville had been a
                    familiar object in the streets of Rio Janeiro. The tide of popular favour
                    turned; and, in spite of the explanations furnished by Douville in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ma defence,</hi> 1832, and <hi rend="italic">Trente mois de ma
                    vie, ou quinze mois avant et quinze mois après mon voyage au Congo,</hi> 1833,
                    the general decision was openly against him. Mlle. Audrun, a lady to whom he was
                    about to be married, committed suicide from grief at the disgrace; and, after
                    vainly attempting to obtain satisfaction from Lacordaire by duel, the poor
                    adventurer himself withdrew in 1833 to Brazil, and proceeded to make
                    explorations in the valley of the Amazon. According to Dr Gardner, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in the Interior of Brazil,</hi> he was murdered in 1837 on
                    the banks of the São Francisco for charging too high for his medical assistance.
                    His Brazilian manuscripts fell into the hands of Μ. S. Rang, by whom they were
                    transmitted to Μ. Ferdinand Denis. While modern exploration has done nothing to
                    support the wider pretensions of Douville, no less an authority than Captain
                    Burton asserts that his descriptions of the country of the Congo are life-like

                    anthropology, ceremonies, customs, and maladies of the people are remarkably
                    accurate; and that even the native words inserted into the text of his narrative
                    “are for the most part given with unusual correctness.”</p>
