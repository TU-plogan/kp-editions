                <p><label type="entry">DE LOUTHERBOURG, <hi rend="smallcaps">Philip
                    James</hi></label> (1740-1812), an artist of remarkably versatile ability and
                    interesting personality. He was born at Strasburg, 31st October 1740, where his
                    father, the representative of a noble Polish family, practised miniature
                    painting in a semi-amateur manner; but he spent the greater part of his life in
                    London, where he was naturalized, and exerted a considerable influence on the
                    scenery of the English stage, as well as on the artists of the following
                    generation, Turner, Martin, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Young De Loutherbourg was intended for the Lutheran ministry, and was educated at
                    the university of Strasburg. As the calling, however, was foreign to his nature,
                    he insisted on being a painter, and placed himself under Vanloo in Paris. The
                    result was the inåmediate and precocious development of extraordinary powers.
                    Besides this triumph, and independently of it, he became a figure in the
                    fashionable society of that day, and the friend of such men as Diderot, who had
                    just then mainly contributed to make Gesner celebrated. He was elected into the
                    French Academy below the age required by the law of the institution, and painted
                    landscapes, sea-storms, battles, all of which had a celebrity above those of the
                    specialists then working in Paris. By temperament whatever was extraordinary and
                    sensational was attractive to him, and the <hi rend="italic">bizarre</hi>
                    appeared in all he did. His <hi rend="italic">début</hi> was made by the
                    exhibition of twelve pictures, including Storm at Sunset, Night, Morning after
                    Rain; and when he painted common things, as a group of asses, he gave the
                    picture such a fantastic title as—Father and Mother, Ijittle Fanfan, Aunt and
                    Uncle à la Bretagne, Cousin Germain, and the Perruquier of all the Family. In
                    the next stage of his life we find him travelling in Switzerland, Germany, and
                    Italy, distinguishing himself as much by mechanic inventions as by painting. One
                    of these, constructed at his native city, was the wonder of the day, showing
                    quite new effects produced in a model theatre. The exhibition of lights behind
                    canvas representing the moon and stars, the illusory appearance of running water
                    produced by clear blue sheets of metal and gauze, with loose threads of silver,
                    and so on, were his devices. Charles Blanc says one of these curious models,
                    called “Le Séraphin,” still existed in the Palais Royal at the date of
                    publication of his work, <hi rend="italic">École Française.</hi> Having repaired
                    to London, De Loutherbourg was employed by Garrick, who offered him £500 a year
                    to apply his mechanisms to Drury Lane, and to superintend the scene-painting,
                    which he did with complete success, making a new era in the adjuncts of the
                    stage. Garrick’s own piece, the <hi rend="italic">Christmas Tale,</hi> and the
                    pantomime, 1781-2, introduced the novelties to the public, and the delight not
                    only of the masses, but of Reynolds and the artists, was unbounded. The green
                    trees gradually became russet, the moon rose and lit the edges of passing
                    clouds, and all the world was captivated by effects we now take little notice
                    of. A still greater triumph awaited him on his opening an entertainment he
                    called the “Eidophusicon,” which showed the rise, progress, and result of a
                    storm at sea—that which destroyed the great Indiaman, the “Halsewell,”—and the
                    Fallen Angels raising the Palace of Pandemonium. De Loutherbourg has been called
                    the inventor of the panorama, but this honour does not belong to him, although
                    it first appeared about the same time as the eidophusicon. The first panorama
                    was painted and exhibited by Barker the elder.</p>
                <p>All this mechanism did not in the least prevent De Loutherbourg from painting.
                    Lord Howe’s Victory off Ushant, 1794, and other large naval pictures, were
                    commissioned for Greenwich Hospital Gallery, where they still remain. His
                    grandest work, the Destruction of the Armada, is one of the finest sea-fights
                    ever realized on canvas. He painted also the Great Fire of London, anj severaI
                    historical works, one of these being the Attack of the Combined Armies on
                    Valenciennes, 1793. He was made R.A., in addition to other distinctions, in
                    1781, shortly after which date we find an entirely new mental impulse taking
                    possession of him. He joined Balsamo, Comte de Cagliostro, and travelled about
                    with this extraordinary person,—happily leaving him, however, before the priests
                    in Rome condemned him to death. We do not hear that Mesmer had attracted De
                    Loutherbourg, or that the Revolution carried him away, nor do we find an exact
                    record of his connection with Cagliostro; but there exists a pamphlet published
                    in 1789, <hi rend="italic">A List of a few Cures performed by Mr and Mrs De
                    Loutherbourg without Medicine,</hi> which relates some very remarkable examples
                    of such cures. Cagliostro had led him to seek the philosopher’s stone, but his
                    success was frustrated by a female relative breaking in on his nocturnal
                    experiments and destroying the crucible at the very moment of projection. He
                    died 11th March 1812. His publications are few,—some sets of etchings, and <hi
                    rend="italic">English Scenery,</hi> 1805. His colour is hot and brown, which has
                    injured his fame as a painter.</p>
