                <p><label type="entry">DIALLING</label>, sometimes called gnomonics, is a branch of
                    applied mathematics which treats of the construction of sun-dials, that is, of
                    those instruments, either fixed or portable, which determine the divisions of
                    the day by the motion of the shadow of some object on which the sun’s rays
                    fall.</p>
                <p>It must have been one of the earliest applications of a knowledge of the apparent
                    motion of the sun; though for a long time men would probably be satisfied with
                    the division into morning and afternoon as marked by sun-rise, sun-set, and the
                    greatest elevation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The earliest mention of a sun-dial is found in
                    Isaiah xxxviii. 8: “Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which
                    is gone down in the <hi rend="italic">sun-dial</hi> of Ahaz ten degrees
                    backward.” The date of this would be about 700 years before the Christian era,
                    but we know nothing of the character or construction of the instrument.</p>
                <p>The earliest of all sun-dials of which we have any certain knowledge was the
                    hemicycle, or hemisphere, of the Chaldean astronomer Berosus, who probably lived
                    about 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It consisted of a hollow hemisphere
                    placed with its rim perfectly horizontal, and having a bead, or globule, fixed
                    in any way at the centre. So long as the sun remained above the horizon the
                    shadow of the bead would fall on the inside of the hemisphere, and the path of
                    the shadow during the day would be approximately a circular arc. This arc,
                    divided Into twelve equal parts, determined twelve equal intervals of time for
                    that day. Now, supposing this were done at the time of the solstices and
                    equinoxes, and on as many intermediate days as might be considered sufficient,
                    and then curve lines drawn through the corresponding points of division of the
                    different arcs, the shadow of the bead falling on one of these curve lines would
                    mark a division of time for that day, and thus we should have a sun-dial which
                    would divide each period of daylight into twelve equal parts.</p>
                <p>These equal parts were called <hi rend="italic">temporary hours;</hi> and, since
                    the duration of daylight varies from day to day, the temporary hours of one day
                    would differ from those of another; but this inequality would probably be
                    disregarded at that time, and especially in countries where the variation
                    between the longest summer day and the shortest winter day is much less than in
                    our climates.</p>
                <p>The dial of Berosus remained in use for centuries. The Arabians, as appears from
                    the work of Albategnius, still followed the same construction about the year 900
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Four of these dials have in modern times been
                    found in Italy. One, discovered at Tivoli in 1746, is supposed to have belonged
                    to Cicero, who, in one of his letters, says that he had sent a dial of this kind
                    to his villa near Tusculum. The second and third were found in 1751— one at
                    Castel-Nuovo, and the other at Rignano; and a fourth was found in 1762 at
                    Pompeii. G. H. Martini, the author of a dissertation in German on the dials of
                    the ancients, says that this dial was made for the latitude of Memphis; it may
                    therefore be the work of Egyptians, perhaps constructed in the school of
                    Alexandria.</p>
                <p>It is curious that no sun-dial has been found among the antiquities of Egypt, and
                    their sculptures give no indication of any having existed. It has, however, been
                    supposed that the numerous obelisks found everywhere were erected in honour of
                    the sun and employed as gnomons.</p>
                <p>Herodotus has recorded that the Greeks derived from the Babylonians the use of
                    the gnomon, but the great progress’ made by the Greeks in geometry enabled them
                    in later times to construct dials of great complexity, some of which remain to
                    us, and are proofs, not only of extensive knowledge, but also of great
                    ingenuity.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy’s <hi rend="italic">Syntaxis</hi> treats of the construction of dials by
                    means of his <hi rend="italic">analemma,</hi> an instrument which solved a
                    variety of astronomical problems. The constructions given by him were sufficient
                    for regular dials, that is, horizontal dials, or vertical dials facing east,
                    west, north, or south, and these are the only ones he treats of. It is certain,
                    however, that the ancients were able to construct declining dials, as is shown
                    by that most interesting monument of ancient gnomonics—the Tower of the
                    Winds—which is still in existence at Athens. This is a regular octagon, on the
                    faces of which the eight principal winds are represented, and over them eight
                    different dials—four facing the cardinal points and the other four facing the
                    intermediate directions. The date of the dials is long subsequent to that of the
                    tower; for Vitruvius, who describes the tower in the sixth chapter of his first
                    book, says nothing about the dials, and as he has described all the dials known
                    in his time, we must believe that the dials of the tower did not then exist. The
                    tower and its dials are described by Stuart in his <hi rend="italic">Antiquities
                    of Athens.</hi> The hours are still the temporary hours, or, as the Greeks
                    called them, <hi rend="italic">hectemoria.</hi></p>
                <p>As already stated, the learning and ingenuity of the Greeks enabled them to
                    construct dials of various forms— among others, dials of suspension intended for
                    travellers; but these are only spoken of and not explained; they may have been
                    like our ring-dials.</p>
                <p>The Romans were neither geometers nor astronomers, and the science of gnomonics
                    did not flourish among them. The first sun-dial erected at Rome was in the year
                    290 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> and this Papirius Cursor had taken from the
                    Samnites. A dial which Valerius Messala had brought from Catania, the latitude
                    of which is five degrees less than that of Rome, was placedin the forum in the
                    year 261 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The first dial actually constructed at
                    Rome was in the year 164 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> by order of Q. Marcius
                    Philippus, but, as no other Roman has written on gnomonics, this was perhaps the
                    work of a foreign artist. If, too, we remember that the dial found at Pompeii
                    was made for the latitude of Memphis, and consequently less adapted to its
                    position than that of Catania to Rome, we may infer that mathematical knowledge
                    was not cultivated in Italy.</p>
                <p>The Arabians were much more successful. They attached great importance to
                    gnomonics, the principles of which they had learned from the Greeks, but they
                    greatly simplified and diversified the Greek constructions. One of their
                    writers, Abul-Hassan, who lived about the beginning of the 13 th century, taught
                    them how to trace dials on cylindrical, conical, and other surfaces. He even
                    introduced <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">equinoctial
                    hours,</hi> but the idea was not supported, and the temporary hours alone
                    continued in use.</p>
                <p>Where or when the great and important step already conceived by Abul-Hassan, and
                    perhaps by others, of reckoning by <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> hours was
                    generally adopted cannot now be determined. The history of gnomonics from the
                    13th to the beginning of the 16th century is almost a blank, and during that
                    time the change took place. We <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0171-0154"/> can see, however, that the change would
                    necessarily follow the introduction of clocks and other mechanical methods of
                    measuring time; for, however imperfect these were, the hours they marked would
                    be of the same length in summer and in winter, and the discrepancy between these
                    equal hours and the temporary hours of the sun-dial would soon be too important
                    to be overlooked. Now, we know that a balance clock was put up in the palace of
                    Charles V. of France about the year 1370, and we may reasonably suppose that the
                    new sun-dials came into general use during the 14th and 15th centuries.</p>
                <p>Among the earliest of the modem writers on gnomonics must be named Sebastian
                    Munster, a cordelier who published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >HorologiographiaeΛ&gt;</hi> Basel in 1531. He gives a number of correct rules,
                    but without demonstrations. Among his inventions was a moon-dial,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In one of the Courts of
                    Queen’s College, Cambridge, there is an elaborate sun-dial dating from the end
                    of the 17th or beginning of the 18th century, and around it a series of numbers
                    whic.h make it available as a moon-dial when the moon’s age is known.</p></note>
                    but this does not admit of much accuracy.</p>
                <p>During the 17th century dialling was discussed at great length by all writers on
                    astronomy. Clavius devotes a quarto volume of 800 pages entirely to the subject.
                    This was published in 1612, and may be considered to contain all that was known
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>In the 18th century clocks and watches began to supersede sun-dials, and these
                    have gradually fallen into disuse except as an additional ornament to a garden,
                    or in remote country districts where the old dial on the church tower still
                    serves as an occasional check on the modern clock by its side. The art of
                    constructing dials may now be looked upon as little more than a mathematical
                    recreation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Principles.—</hi> The diurnal and the annual motions of
                    the earth are the elementary astronomical facts on which dialling is founded.
                    That the earth turns upon its axis uniformly from west to east in 24 hours, and
                    that it is carried round the sun in one year at a nearly uniform rate, is, we
                    know, the correct way of expressing these facts. But the effect will be
                    precisely the same, and it will suit our purpose better, and make our
                    explanations easier, if we adopt the ideas of the ancients, of which our senses
                    furnish apparent confirmation, and assume the earth to be fixed. Then, the sun
                    and stars revolve round the earth’s axis uniformly from east to west once a
                    day,—the sun lagging a little behind the stars, making its day some 4 minutes
                    longer, so that at the end of the year it finds itself again in the same place,
                    having made a complete revolution of the heavens relatively to the stars from
                    west to east.</p>
                <p>The fixed axis about which all these bodies revolve daily is a line through the
                    earth’s centre; but the radius of the earth is so small, compared with the
                    enormous distance of the sun, that, if we draw a parallel axis through any point
                    of the earth’s surface, we may safely look on that as being the axis of the
                    celestial motions. The error in the case of the sun would not, at its maximum,
                    that is, at 6 A. Μ. and 6 p.M., exceed half a second of time, and at noon would
                    vanish.</p>
                <p>An axis so drawn is in the plane of the meridian, and points, as we know, to the
                    pole,—its elevation being equal to the latitude of the place.</p>
                <p>The diurnal motion of the stars is strictly uniform, and so would that of the sun
                    be if the daily retardation of about 4 minutes, spoken of above, were always the
                    same. But this is constantly altering, so that the time, as measured by the
                    sun’s motion, and also consequently as measured by a sun-dial, does not move on
                    at a strictly uniform pace. This irregularity, which is slight, would be of
                    little consequence in the ordinary affairs of life, but clocks and watches being
                    mechanical measures of time could not, except by extreme complication, be made
                    to follow this irregularity, even if desirable, which is not the case.</p>
                <p>The clock is constructed to mark uniform time in such wise that the length of the
                    clock day shall be the average of all the solar days in the year. Four times a
                    year the clock and the sun-dial agree exactly; but the sun-dial, now going a
                    little slower, now a little faster, will be sometimes behind, sometimes before
                    the clock—the greatest accumulated difference being about 16 minutes for a few
                    days in November, but on the average much less. The four days on which the two
                    agree are April 15, June 15, September 1, and December 24.</p>
                <p>Clock-time is called <hi rend="italic">mean time,</hi> that marked by the sundial
                    is called <hi rend="italic">apparent time,</hi> and the difference between them
                    is the <hi rend="italic">equation of time.</hi> It is given in most calendars
                    and almanacs, frequently under the heading “clock slow,” “clock fast.” When the
                    time by the sun-dial is known, the equation of time will at once enable us to
                    obtain the corresponding clock time, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>Atmospheric refraction introduces another error, by altering the apparent
                    position of the sun; but the effect is too small to need consideration in the
                    construction of an instrument which, with the best workmanship, does not after
                    all admit of very great accuracy.</p>
                <p>The general principles of dialling will now be readily understood. The problem
                    before us is the following :— A rod, or <hi rend="italic">style,</hi> as it is
                    called, being firmly fixed in a direction parallel to the earth’s axis, we have
                    to find how and where points or lines of reference must be traced on some fixed
                    surface behind the style, so that when the shadow of the style falls on a
                    certain one of these lines we may know that at that moment it is solar
                    noon,—that is, that the plane through the style and through the sun then
                    coincides with the meridian; again, that when the shadow reaches the next line
                    of reference, it is 1 o’clock by solar time, or, which comes to the same thing,
                    that the above plane through the style and through the sun has just turned
                    through the twenty-fourth part of a complete revolution; and so on for the
                    subsequent hours,—the hours before noon being indicated in a similar manner. The
                    style and the surface on which these lines are traced together constitute the
                    dial.</p>
                <p>The position of an intended sun-dial having been selected —whether on church
                    tower, south front of farm-stead, or garden wall—the surface must be prepared,
                    if necessary, to receive the hour-lines.</p>
                <p>The chief, and in fact the only practical difficulty will be the accurate fixing
                    of the style, for on its accuracy the value of the instrument depends.</p>
                <p>It must be in the meridian plane, and must make an angle with the horizon equal
                    to the latitude of the place. The latter condition will offer no difficulty, but
                    the exact determination of the meridian plane which passes through the point
                    where the style is fixed to the surface is not so simple. We shall, further on,
                    show how this may be done; and, in the meantime, we shall assume that we have
                    found the true position, and have firmly fixed the style to the dial and secured
                    it there by cross wires, or by other means. The style itself will be usually a
                    strong metal wire whose thickness may vary with circumstances; and when we speak
                    of the shadow cast by the style it must always be understood that the middle
                    line of the thin band of shade is meant.</p>
                <p>The point where the style meets the dial is called the centre of the dial. It is
                    the centre from which all the hour-lines radiate.</p>
                <p>The position of the xn o’clock line is the most important to determine
                    accurately, since all the others are usually made to depend on this one. We
                    cannot trace it correctly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n172/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0172-0155"/> on the dial until the style has been itself
                    accurately fixed in its proper place, as will be explained hereafter. When that
                    is done the xιι o’clock line will be found by the intersection of the dial
                    surface with the vertical plane which contains the style; and the most simple
                    way of drawing it on the dial will be by suspending a plummet from some point of
                    the style whence it may hang freely, and waiting until the shadows of both style
                    and plumb line coincide on the dial. This single shadow will be the xιι o’clock
                    line.</p>
                <p>In one class of dials, namely, all the vertical ones, the XII o’clock line is
                    simply the vertical line from the centre; it can, therefore, at once be traced
                    on the dial face by using a fine plumb line.</p>
                <p>The XII o’clock line being traced, the easiest and most accurate method of
                    tracing the other hour lines would at the present day when good watches are
                    common, be by marking where the shadow of the style falls when 1, 2, 3,
                    &lt;fcc., hours have elapsed since noon, and the next morning by the same means
                    the forenoon hour lines could be traced; and in the same manner the hours might
                    be subdivided into halves and quarters, or even into minutes.</p>
                <p>But formerly, when watches were not, the tracing of the I, II, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">hi,</hi> &amp;c. o’clock lines was done by calculating the
                    angle which each of these lines would make with the xιι o’clock line. Now,
                    except in the simple cases of a horizontal dial or of a vertical dial facing a
                    cardinal point, this would require long and intricate calculations, or elaborate
                    geometrical constructions, implying considerable mathematical knowledge, but
                    also introducing increased chances of error. The chief source of error would lie
                    in the uncertainty of the data; for the position of the dial-plane would have to
                    be found before the calculations began,— that is, it would be necessary to know
                    exactly by how many degrees it declined from the south towards the east or west,
                    and by how many degrees it inclined from the vertical. The ancients, with the
                    means at their disposal, could obtain these results only very roughly.</p>
                <p>Dials received different names according to their position :—</p>

                    rend="italic">Vertical dials,</hi> when on a vertical plane facing one of the

                    distinguished as <hi rend="italic">reclining</hi> when leaning backwards from an
                    observer, <hi rend="italic">proclining</hi> when leaning forwards); <hi

                    earth’s axis, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We shall limit ourselves to an investigation of the simplest and most usual of
                    these cases, referring the reader, for further details, to the later works given
                    at the end of this article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dial Construction.—</hi> A very correct view of the problem of
                    dial construction may be obtained as follows :—</p>
                <p>Conceive a transparent cylinder (fig. 1) having an axis AB I&gt;arallel to the
                    axis of the earth. On the surface of the cylinder et equidistant generating
                    lines be traced 15’ apart, one of them XU.. xn being in the meridian plane
                    through AB, and the others ι...l, ∏...∏, &amp;c., following in the order of the
                    sun’s motion.</p>
                <p>Then the shadow of the line AB will obviously fall on the line XII...XU at
                    apparent noon, on the line ι...ι at one hour afternoon, on Ii...II at two hours
                    after noon, and so on. If now the cylinder be cut by any plane MN representing
                    the plane on which the dial is to be traced, the shadow of AB will be
                    intercepted by this plane, and fall on the lines Axil, Aι, An, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The construction of the dial consists in determining the angles made by Ai, Au,
                    &amp;c. with Axn; the line Axιι itself, being in the vertical plane through AB,
                    may be supposed known.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of actual calculation, perhaps a trans parent sphere will, with
                    advantage, replace the cylinder, and we shall here apply it to calculate the
                    angles mιde by the hour line with the xιι o’clock line in the two cases of a
                    horizontal dial and of a vertical south dial <hi rend="italic">Horizontal
                    Dial.—</hi> Let PE7&gt; (fig. 2), the axis of the supposed transparent sphere,
                    be directed towards the north and south poles of the heavens. Draw the two great
                    circles, HMA, QMα, the former horizontal, the other perpendicular to the axis
                    Pp, and therefore coinciding with the plane of the equator. Let EZ be vertical,
                    then the circle QZP will be the meridian, and by its intersection A with the
                    horizontal will determine the xu o’clock line EA. Next divide the equatorial
                    circle QMα into 24 equal parts <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">be,
                    cd,</hi> &amp;c. . . . of 15 <hi rend="superscript"> %</hi> each, beginning from
                    the meridian Pα, and through the various points of division and the poles draw
                    the great circles P⅛p, <hi rend="italic">Vcp,</hi> &amp;c. . . . These will
                    exactly correspond to the equidistant generating lines on the cylinder in the
                    previous construction, and the shadow of the style will fall on these circles
                    after successive intervals of 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. hours from noon. If they meet the
                    horizontal in the points B, C, D, &amp;c., then EB, EC, ED, &amp;c. . . . will
                    be the I, π, in, &amp;c., hour lines required; and the problem of the horizontal
                    dial consists in calculating the angles which these lines make with the xιι
                    o’clock line EA, whose position is known. The spherical triangles PAB, PAC,
                    &amp;c., enable us to do this readily. They are all right-angled at A, the side
                    PA is the latitude of the place, and the angles APB, APC, &amp;c., are
                    respectively 15°, 30°, &amp;c., then tan. AB = tan. 15 <hi rend="superscript">

                    required.</p>
                <p>For examples, let us find the angles made by the I o’clock line at the following
                    places—Madras, London, Edinburgh, and Hammerfest (Norway).</p>

                <p>Thus the i o’clock hour line EB must make an angle on a Madras dial of only 3°
                    28' with the meridian EA, ll <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 51' on a London
                    dial, 12° 31' at Edinburgh, and 14° 25' at Hammerfest. In the same way may be
                    found the angles made by the other hour lines.</p>
                <p>The calculations of these angles must extend throughout one quadrant from noon to
                    vι o’clock, but need not be carried further, because all the other hour-lines
                    can at once be deduced from these. —In the first place the dial is symmetrically
                    divided by the meridian, and therefore two times equidistant from noon will have
                    their hour lines equidistant from the meridian; thus the xι o’clock line and the
                    I o’clock line must make the same angles with it, the xi o’clock the came as the
                    II o’clock, and so on. And next, the 24 great circles, which were drawn to
                    determine these lines, are in reality only 12; for clearly the great circle
                    which gives i o’clock after midnight, and that which gives I o’clock after noon,
                    are one and the same, and so also for the other hours. Therefore the hour lines
                    between vι in the evening and VI the next morning are the prolongations of the
                    remaining twelve.</p>
                <p>Let us now remove the imaginary sphere with all its circles, and retain only the
                    style EP and the plane HMA with the lines traced on it, and we shall have the
                    horizontal dial.</p>
                <p>On the longest day in London the sun rises a little after 4 o’clock, and sets a
                    little before 8 o’clock; there is therefore no necessity for extending a London
                    dial beyond those hours. At Edinburgh the limits will be a little longer, while
                    at Hammerfest, which is within the Arctic circle, the whole circuit will be
                    required.</p>
                <p>Instead of a wire style it is often more convenient to use a metal plate from one
                    quarter to half an inch in thickness. This plate, which is sometimes in the form
                    of a right-angled triangle, must have an acute angle equal to the latitude of
                    the place, and, when properly fixed in a vertical position on the dial, its two
                    faces must coincide with the meridian plane, and the sloping edges formed by the
                    thickness of the plate must point to the pole and form two parallel styles.
                    Since there are two styles, there must be two dials, or rather two half dials,
                    because a little consideration will show that, owing to the thickness of the
                    plate, these styles will only one at a time cast a shadow. Thus the eastern edge
                    will give the shadow for all hours before 6 o’clock in the morning. From 6
                    o’clock until noon the western edge will be used. At noon, it will change again
                    to the eastern edge until 6 o’clock in the evening, and finally the western edge
                    for the remaining hours of daylight.</p>
                <p>The centres of the two dials will be at the points where the styles meet the dial
                    face; but, in drawing the hour-lines, we must be careful to draw only those
                    lines for which the corresponding style is able to give a shadow as explained
                    above. The dial will thus have the appearance of a single dial plate, and there
                    will be no confusion (see fig· 3).</p>
                <p>The line of demarcation between the shadow and the light will be better defined
                    than when a wire style is used; but the indications by this double dial will
                    always be one minute too fast in the morning and one minute too slow in the
                    afternoon. This is owing to the magnitude of the sun, whose angular breadth is
                    half a degree. The well-defined shadows are given, not by the centre of the sun,
                    as we should require them, but by the forward limb in the morning and by the
                    backward one in the afternoon; and the sun takes just about a minute to advance
                    through a space equal to its half-breadth.</p>
                <p>Dials of this description are frequently met with in the country. Placed on an
                    ornamental pedestal some 4 feet high, they form a pleasing and useful addition
                    to a lawn or to a garden terrace. The dial plate is of metal as well as the
                    vertical piece upon it, and they may be purchased ready for placing on the
                    pedestal,—the dial with all the hour-lines traced on it, and the style-plate
                    firmly fastened in its proper position, if not even cast in the same piece with
                    the dial-plate.</p>
                <p>When placing it on the pedestal care must be taken that the dial be perfectly
                    horizontal and accurately oriented. The levelling will be done with a
                    spirit-level, and the orientation will be best effected either in the forenoon
                    or in the afternoon, by turning the dial-plate till the time given by the shadow
                    (making the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> minute correction mentioned above) agrees
                    with a good watch whose error on solar time is known. It is, however, important
                    to bear in mind that a dial, so built up beforehand, will have the angle at the
                    base equal to the latitude of some selected place, such as London, and the
                    hour-lines will be drawn in directions calculated for the same latitude. Such a
                    dial can therefore not be used near Edinburgh or Glasgow, although it would,
                    without appreciable error, be adapted to any place whose latitude did not differ
                    more than 20 or 30 miles from that of London, and it would be safe to employ it
                    in Essex, Kent, or Wiltshire.·</p>
                <p>If a series of such dials were constructed, differing by 30 miles in latitude,
                    then an intending purchaser could select one adapted to a place whose latitude
                    was within 15 miles of his own, and the error of time would never exceed a small
                    fraction of a minute. The following table will enable us to check the accuracy
                    of the hour-lines and of the angle of the style,—all angles on the dial being
                    readily measured with an ordinary protractor. It extends from 50° lat. to 59¾°
                    lat., and therefore includes the whole of Great Britain and Ireland :—</p>

                    transparent sphere QZPA (fig. 4), whose axis PEp is parallel to the earth’s
                    axis. Let Z be the zenith, and consequently, the great circle QZP the meridian.
                    Through E, the centre of the sphere, draw a vertical plane facing south. This
                    will cut the sphere in the great circle ZMA which, beinσ vertical, will pass
                    through the zenith, and, facing south, will be at right angles to the meridian.
                    Let QMα be the equatorial circle, obtained by drawing a plane through E at right
                    angles to the axis PEp. The lower portion Ep of the axis will be the style, the

                    a plane cutting the sphere in 24 equidistant great circles. As the sun revolves
                    round the axis the shadow of the axis will successively fall on these circles at
                    intervals of one hour, and if these circles cross the vertical circle ZMA in the
                    points A, B, C, &amp;c., the shadow of the lower portion Ep of the axis will
                    fall on the lines EA, EB, EC, &amp;c., which will therefore be the required hour

                <p>There is no necessity for going beyond the vi o’clock hour-line on each side of
                    noon; for, in the winter months the sun sets earlier than 6 o’clock, and in the
                    summer months it passes behind the plane of the dial before that time, and is no
                    longer available.</p>
                <p>It remains to show how the angles AEB, AEC, &amp;c., may be calculated.</p>
                <p>The spherical triangles pAB, pAC, &amp;c., will give us a simple rule. These

                    the calculation of these cases. Our imaginary sphere being, as before supposed,
                    constructed with its centre at the centre of the dial, and all the hour-circles
                    traced upon it, the intersection of these hour-circles with the plane of the
                    dial will determine the hour-lines just as in the previous cases; but the
                    triangles will no longer be right-angled, and the simplicity of the calculation
                    will be lost, the chances of error being greatly increased by the difficulty of
                    drawing the dial-plane in its true position on the sphere, since that true
                    position will have to be found from observations which can be only roughly
                    performed.</p>
                <p>In all these cases, and in cases where the dial surface is not a plane, and the
                    hour-lines, consequently, are not straight lines, the only safe practical way is
                    to mark rapidly on the dial a few points (one is sufficient when the dial face
                    is plane) of the shadow at the moment when a good watch shows that the hour has
                    arrived, and afterwards connect these points with the centre by a continuous
                    line. Of course the style must have been accurately fixed in its true position

                    whose plane is at right angles to the style, and therefore parallel to the
                    equator. It is the simplest of all dials. A circle (fig. 5) divided into 24
                    equal arcs is placed at right angles to the style, and hour divisions are marked
                    upon it. Then if care be taken that the style point accurately to the pole, and
                    that the noon division coincide with the meridian plane, the shadow of the style
                    will fall on the other divisions, each at its proper time. The divisions must be
                    marked on both sides of the dial, because the sun will shine on opposite sides
                    in the summer and in the winter months, changing at each equinox.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To find the Meridian Plane.—</hi> We have, so far, assumed the
                    meridian plane to be accurately known; we shall proceed to describe some of the
                    methods by which it may be found.</p>
                <p>The mariner’s compass may be employed as a first rough approximation. It is well
                    known that the needle of the compass, when free to move horizontally, oscillates
                    upon its pivot and settles in a direction termed the magnetic meridian. This
                    does not coincide with the true north and south line, but the difference between
                    them is generally known with tolerable accuracy, and is called the variation of
                    the compass. The variation differs widely at different parts of the surface of
                    the earth, being now about 20° W. in London, 7° W. in New York, and 17* E. in
                    San Francisco. Nor is the variation at any place stationary, though the change
                    is slow. We said that norøthe variation in London is about 20° W.; in 1837 it
                    was about 24° W.; and there is even a small daily oscillation which takes place
                    about the mean position, but too small to need notice here.</p>
                <p>Withall these elements of uncertainty, it is obvious that the compass can only
                    give a rough approximation to the position of the meridian, but it will serve to
                    fix the style so that only a small further alteration will be necessary when a
                    more perfect determination has been made.</p>
                <p>A very simple practical method is the following :—</p>
                <p>Place a table (fig. 6), or other plane surface, in such a position that it may
                    receive the sun’s rays both in the morning and in the afternoon. Then carefully
                    level the surface by means of a spirit-level. This must be done very accurately,
                    and the table in that position made perfectly secure, so that there be no danger
                    of its shifting during the day.</p>
                <p>Next, suspend a plummet SH from a point S, which must be rigidly fixed. The
                    extremity H, where the plummet just meets the surface, should be somewhere near
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n175/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0175-0158"/> middle of one end of the table. With H for
                    centre, describe any number of concentric arcs of circle», AB, CD, EF,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A bead P, kept in its place by friction, is threaded on the plummet line at some
                    convenient height above H.</p>
                <p>Every thing being thus prepared, let us follow the shadow of the bead P as it
                    moves along the surface of the table during the day. It will be found to
                    describe a curve ACE .... FDB, approaching the point H as the sun advances
                    towards noon, and receding from it afterwards. (The curve is a conic section—an
                    hyperbola in these regions.) At the moment when it crosses the arc AB, mark the
                    point A; AP is then the direction of the sun, and, as AH is horizontal, the
                    angle PAH is the altitude of the sun. In the afternoon mark the point B where it
                    crosses the same arc; then the angle PBH is the altitude. But the right-angled
                    triangles PH A, PHB are obviously equal; and the sun has therefore the same
                    altitudes at those two instants, the one before, the other after noon. It
                    follows that, <hi rend="italic">if the sun has not changed its declination</hi>
                    during the interval, the two positions will be symmetrically placed one on each
                    side of the meridian. Therefore, drawing the chord AB, and bisecting it in Μ, HM
                    will be the meridian line.</p>
                <p>Each of the other concentric arcs, CD, EF, &amp;c., will furnish its meridian
                    line. Of course these should all coincide, but if not, the mean of the positions
                    thus found must be taken.</p>
                <p>The proviso mentioned above, that the sun has not changed its declination, is
                    scarcely ever realized; but the change is slight, and may be neglected, except
                    perhaps about the time of the equinoxes, at the end of March and at the end of
                    September. Throughout the remainder of the year the change of declination is so
                    slow that we may safely neglect it. The most favourable times are at the end of
                    June and at the end of December, when the sun’s declination is almost
                    stationary. If the line HM be produced both ways to the edges of the table, then
                    the two points on the ground vertically below those on the edges may be found by
                    a plummet, and, if permanent marks be made there, the meridian plane, which is
                    the vertical plane passing through these two points, will have its position
                    perfectly secured.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To place the Style of a Dial in its True Position.—</hi> Before
                    giving any other method of finding the meridian plane, we shall complete the
                    construction of the dial, by showing how the style may now be accurately placed
                    ih its true position. The angle which the style makes with a hanging plumb-line,
                    being the co-latitude of the place, is known, and the north and south direction
                    is also roughly given by the mariner’s compass. The style may therefore be
                    already adjusted approximately—correctly, indeed, as to its inclination—but
                    probably requiring a little horizontal motion east or west. Suspend a fine
                    plumb-line from some point of the style, then the style will be properly
                    adjusted if, at the very instant of noon, its shadow falls exactly on the
                    plumb-line,—or, which is the same thing, if both shadows coincide on the
                    dial.</p>
                <p>This instant of noon will be given very simply by the meridian plane, whose
                    position we have secured, by the two permanent marks on the ground. Stretch a
                    cord from the one mark to the other. This will not generally be horizontal, but
                    the cord will be wholly in the meridian plane, and that is the only necessary
                    condition. Next, suspend a plummet over the mark which is nearer to the sun,
                    and, when the shadow of the plumb-line falls on the stretched cord, it is noon.
                    A signal from the observer there to the observer at the dial enables the latter
                    to adjust the style as directed above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Other Methods of finding the Meridian Plane.—</hi> We have
                    dwelt at some length on these practical operations because they are simple and
                    tolerably accurate, and because they want neither watch, nor sextant, nor
                    telescope—nothing more, in fact, than the careful observation of shadow
                    lines.</p>
                <p>The polar star may also be employed for finding the meridian plane without other
                    apparatus than plumb-lines. This star is now only about l <hi rend="superscript"
                    > β</hi> 2Γ from the pole <hi rend="italic">; if</hi> therefore a plumb-line be
                    suspended at a few feet from the observer, and if he shift his position till the
                    star is exactly hidden by the line, then the plane through his eye and the
                    plumb-line will never be far from the meridian plane. Twice in the course of the
                    24 hours the planes would be strictly coincident. This would be when the star
                    crosses the meridian above the pole, and again when it crosses it below. If we
                    wished to employ the method of determining the meridian, the times of the stars
                    crossing would have to be calculated from the data in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nautical Almanac,</hi> and a watch would be necessary to know when the instant
                    arrived. The watch need not, however, be very accurate, because the motion of
                    the star is so slow that an error of ten minutes in the time would not give an
                    error of one-eighth of a degree in the azimuth.</p>
                <p>The following accidental circumstance enables us to dispense with both
                    calculation and watch. The right ascension of the star <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi><hi rend="italic">Ursae</hi><hi rend="italic">Majoris,</hi> that star in
                    the tail of the Great Bear which is farthest from the “pointers,” happens to
                    differ by a little more than 12 hours from the right ascension of the polar
                    star. The great circle which joins the two stars passes therefore close to the
                    pole. When the polar star, at a distance of about l¾ <hi rend="superscript">
                    β</hi> from the pole, is crossing the meridian above the pole, the star <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">Ursae</hi><hi rend="italic">Majoris,</hi>
                    whose polar distance is about 40’, has not yet reached the meridian below the
                    pole.</p>
                <p>When <hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">Ursae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Majoris</hi> reaches the meridian, which will be within half an hour later, the
                    polar star will have left the meridian; but its slow motion will have carried it
                    only a very little distance away. Now at some instant between these two
                    times—much nearer the latter than the former— the great circle joining the two
                    stars will be exactly vertical; and at this instant, which the observer
                    determines by seeing that the plumb-line hides the two stars simultaneously,

                <p>In all these cases it will be convenient, instead of fixing the plane by means of
                    the eye and one fixed plummet, to have a second plummet at a short distance in
                    front of the eye; this second plummet, being suspended so as to allow of lateral
                    shifting, must be moved so as always to ba <pb break="no"

                    meridian plane will be secured by placing two permanent marks on the ground, one
                    under each plummet.</p>
                <p>This method, by means of the two stars, is only available for the upper transit

                    would pass close to or beyond the zenith, and the observation could not be made.
                    Also the stars will not be. visible when the upper transit takes place in the
                    day-time, so that one-half of the year is lost to this method.</p>
                <p>Neither could it be employed in lower latitudes than 40° N., for there the star
                    would, be below the horizon at its lower transit;—we may even say not lower than
                    45° N., for the star must be at least 5° above the horizon before it becomes
                    distinctly visible.</p>
                <p>There -are other pairs of stars which could be similarly employed, but none so
                    convenient as these two, on account of <hi rend="italic">Polaris</hi> with its
                    very slow motion being one of the pair.</p>

                    determination of the Meridian Plane.—</hi> The various methods given above for
                    finding the meridian plane have for ultimate object the determination of the
                    plane, not on its own account, but as an element for fixing the instant of noon,
                    whereby the style may be properly placed.</p>
                <p>We shall dispense, therefore, with all this preliminary work if we determine noon
                    by astronomical observation. For this we shall want a good watch, or pocket
                    chronometer, and a sextant or other instrument for taking altitudes. The local
                    time at any moment may be determined in a variety of ways by observation of the
                    celestial bodies. The simplest and most practically useful methods will be found
                    described and investigated in any good educational work on astronomy.</p>
                <p>For our present purpose a single altitude of the sun taken in the forenoon will
                    be most suitable. At some time in the morning, when the sun is high enough to be
                    free from the mists and uncertain refractions of the horizon—but to insure
                    accuracy, while the rate of increase of the altitude is still tolerably rapid,
                    and, therefore, not later than 10 o’clock—take an altitude of the sun, an
                    assistant, at the same moment, marking the time shown by the watch. The altitude
                    so observed being properly corrected for refraction, parallax, &amp;c., will,
                    together with the latitude of the place, and the sun’s declination, taken from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> enable us to calculate the time.
                    This will be the εolar or apparent time, that is, the very time we require; and
                    we must carefully abstain from applying the equation of time. Comparing the time
                    so found with the time shown by the watch, we see at once by how much the watch
                    is fast or slow of solar time; we know, therefore, exactly what time the watch
                    must mark when solar noon arrives, and waiting for that instant we can fix the
                    style in its proper position as explained before.</p>
                <p>We can dispense with the sextant and with all calculation and observation if, by
                    means of the pocket chronometer, we bring the time from some observatory where
                    the work is done; and, allowing for the change of longitude, and also for the
                    equation of time, if the time we have brought is clock time, we shall have the
                    exact instant of solar noon as in the previous case.</p>
                <p>In remote country districts a dial will always be of use to check and even to
                    correct the village clock; and the description and directions here given will,
                    we think, enable any ingenious artisan to construct one.</p>
                <p>In former times the fancy of dialists seems to have run riot in devising
                    elaborate surfaces on which the dial was to be traced. Sometimes the shadow was
                    received on a cone, sometimes on a cylinder, or on a sphere, or on a combination
                    of these. A universal dial was constructed of a figure in the shape of a cross;
                    another universal dial showed the hours by a globe and by several gnomons. These
                    universal dials required adjusting before use, and for this a mariner’s compass
                    and a spirit-level were necessary. But it would be tedious and useless to
                    enumerate the various forms designed, and, as a rule, the more complex the less
                    accurate.</p>
                <p>Another class of useless dials consisted of those with variable centres. They
                    were drawn on fixed horizontal planes, and each day the style had to be shifted
                    to a new position. Instead of hour√⅛es they had hour-y&gt;o⅛is; and the style,
                    instead of being parallel to the axis of the earth, might make any chosen angle
                    with the horizon. There was no practical advantage in their use, but rather the
                    reverse; and they can only be considered as furnishing material for new
                    mathematical problems.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Portable Dials.—</hi> The dials so far described have been
                    fixed dials, for even the fanciful ones to which reference was just now made
                    were to be fixed before using. There were, however, other dials, made generally
                    of a small size, so as to be carried in the pocket; and these, so long as the
                    sun shone, roughly answered the purpose of a watch.</p>
                <p>The description of the portable dial has generally been mixed up with that of the
                    fixed dial, as if it had been merely a special case, and the same principle had
                    been the basis of both; whereas there are essential points of difference between
                    them, besides those which are at once apparent.</p>
                <p>In the fixed dial the result depends on the <hi rend="italic">uniform</hi>
                    angular motion of the sun round the fixed style; and a small error in the
                    assumed position of the sun, whether due to the imperfection of the instrument,
                    or to some small neglected correction, has only a trifling effect on the time.
                    This is owing to the angular displacement of the sun being so rapid—a quarter of
                    a degree every minute—that for the ordinary affairs of life greater accuracy is
                    not required, as a displacement of a quarter of a degree, or at any rate of one
                    degree, can be readily seen by nearly every person. But with a portable dial
                    this is no longer the case. The uniform angular motion is not now available,
                    because we have no determined fixed plane to which we may refer it. In the new
                    position, to which the observer has gone, the zenith is the only point of the
                    heavens he can at once practically find; and the basis for the determination of
                    the time is the constantly but <hi rend="italic">very irregularly</hi> varying
                    zenith distance of the sun.</p>
                <p>At sea the observation of the altitude of a celestial body is the only method
                    available for finding local time; but the perfection which has been attained in
                    the construction of the sextant (chiefly by the introduction of telescopes)
                    enables the sailor to reckon on an accuracy of seconds instead of minutes.
                    Certain precautions have, however, to be taken. The observations must not be
                    made within a couple of hours of noon, on account of the slow rate of change at
                    that time, nor too near the horizon, on account of the uncertain refractions
                    there; and the same restrictions must be observed in using a portable dial.</p>
                <p>To compare roughly the value (as to accuracy) of the fixed and the portable
                    dials, let us take a mean position in Great Britain, say 54° lat., and a mean
                    declination when the sun is in the equator. It will rise at 6 o’clock, and at
                    noon have an altitude of 36°,—that is, the portable dial will indicate an
                    average change of one-tenth of a degree in each minute, or two and half times
                    slower than the fixed dial. The vertical motion of the sun increases, however,
                    nearer the horizon, but even there it will be only one-eighth of a degree each
                    minute, or half the rate of the fixed dial, which goes on at nearly the same
                    speed throughout the day.</p>
                <p>Portable dials are also much more restricted in the range of latitude for which
                    they are available, and they should <pb break="no"

                    of the place for which they were constructed.</p>
                <p>We shall briefly describe two portable dials which were in actual use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dial on a Cylinder.—</hi> A hollow cylinder of metal (fig. 7),
                    4 or 5 inches high, and about an inch in diameter, has a lid which admits of
                    tolerably easy rotation. A hole in the lid receives the style, shaped somewhat
                    like a bayonet; and the straight part of the style, which, on account of the two
                    bends, is lower than the lid, projects horizontally out from the cylinder to a
                    distance of 1 or l† inches. When not in use the style would be taken out and
                    placed inside the cylinder.</p>
                <p>A horizontal circle is traced on the cylinder opposite the projecting style, and
                    this circle is divided into 36 approximately equidistant intervals.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strict equality is not
                    necessary, as the observations made are on the vertical line through each
                    division-point, without reference to the others. It is not even requisite that
                    the divisions should go completely aud exactly round the cylinder, although they
                    were always so drawn, and both these conditions were insisted upon in the
                    directions for the construction.</p></note> These intervals represent spaces of
                    time, and to each division is assigned a date, so that each month has three
                    dates marked as follows :—January 10, 20, 31; February 10, 20, 28; March 10, 20,
                    31; April 10, 20, 30, and so on,—always the 10th, the 20th, and the last day of
                    each month.</p>
                <p>Through each point of division a vertical line parallel to the axis of the
                    cylinder is drawn from top to bottom. Now it will be readily understood that if,
                    upon one of these days, the lid be turned so as to bring the style exactly
                    opposite the date, and if the dial be then placed on a horizontal table so as to
                    receive sun-light, and turned round <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi> until the
                    shadow of the style falls exactly on the vertical line below it, the shadow will
                    terminate at some definite point of this line, the position of which point will
                    depend on the length of the style—that is, the distance of its end from the
                    surface of the cylinder—and on the altitude of the sun at that instant. Suppose
                    that the observations are continued all day, the cylinder being very gradually
                    turned so that the style may always face the sun, and suppose that marks are
                    made on the vertical line to show the extremity of the shadow at each exact hour
                    from sunrise to sunset—these times being taken from a good fixed sun dial,—then
                    it is obvious that the next year, on the <hi rend="italic">same date,</hi> the
                    sun’s declination being about the same, and the observer in about the same
                    latitude, the marks made the previous year will serve to tell the time all that
                    day.</p>
                <p>What we have said above was merely to make the principle of the instrument clear,
                    for it is evident that this mode of marking, which would require a whole year’s
                    sunshine and hourly observation, cannot be the method employed.</p>
                <p>The positions of the marks are, in fact, obtained by calculation. Corresponding
                    to a given date, the declination of the sun is taken from the almanac, and this,
                    together with the latitude of the place and the length of the style, will
                    constitute the necessary data for computing the length of the shadow, that is,
                    the distance of the mark below the style for each successive hour.</p>
                <p>We have assumed above that the declination of the sun is the same at the same
                    date in different years. This is not quite correct, but, if the dates be taken
                    for the second year after leap year, the results will be sufficiently
                    approximate. The actual calculations will offer no difficulty.</p>
                <p>When all the hour marks have been placed opposite to their respective dates, then
                    a continuous curve, joining the corresponding hour-points, will serve to find
                    the time for a day intermediate to those set down, the lid being turned till the
                    style occupy a proper position between the two divisions. The horizontality of
                    the surface on which the instrument rests is a very necessary condition,
                    especially in summer, when, the shadow of the style being long, the extreme end
                    will shift rapidly for a small deviation from the vertical, and render the
                    reading uncertain. The dial can also be used by holding it up by a small ring in
                    the top of the lid, and probably the verticality is better ensured in that
                    way.</p>

                    rend="italic">sun-line.</hi> Make a fine open slit c <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    right through the card and extending from the hinge to a short distance on the
                    door,—the centre line of this slit coinciding accurately with the <hi
                    rend="italic">sun-line.</hi> Now, cut the door completely through the card;
                    except, of course, along the hinge, which, when the card is thick, should be
                    partly cut through at the back, to facilitate the opening. Cut the card right
                    through along the line FDG, and pass a thread carrying a little j duτnmet W and
                    a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> small bead P; the bead having sufficient friction
                    with the thread to retain any position when acted on only by its own weight, but
                    sliding easily along the thread when moved by the hand. At the back of the card
                    the thread terminates in a knot to hinder it from being drawn through; or
                    better, because giving more friction and abetter hold, it passes through the
                    centre of a small disc of card—a fraction of an inch in diameter—and, by a knot,
                    is made fast at the back of the disc.</p>
                <p>To complete the construction,—with the centres F and G, and radii FA and GA, draw
                    the two arcs AY and AZ which will limit the hour lines; for in an observation
                    the bead will always be found between them. The forenoon and afternoon hours may
                    then be marked as indicated in the figure. The dial does not of itself
                    discriminate between forenoon and afternoon; but extraneous circumstances, as,
                    for instance, whether the sun is rising or falling, will settle that point,
                    except when close to noon, where it will always be uncertain.</p>
                <p>To <hi rend="italic">rectify</hi> the dial (using the old expression, which means
                    to prepare the dial for an observation),—open the small door, by turiíing it
                    about its hinge, till it stands well out in front. Next, set the thread in the
                    line FG opposite the day of the month, and stretching it over the point A, slide
                    the bead P along till it exactly coincide with A.</p>
                <p>To find the hour of the day,—hold the dial in a vertical position in such a way
                    that its plane may pass through the sun. The verticality is ensured by seeing
                    that the bead rests against the card without pressing. Now giadually tilt the
                    dial (without altering its vertical plane), until the central line of sunshine,
                    passing through the open slit of the door, just falls along the sun-line. The
                    hour line against which the bead P then rests indicates the time.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sun-line</hi> drawn above has always, so far as we know,
                    been used as a <hi rend="italic">shadow-line.</hi> The upper edge of the
                    rectangular door was the prolongation of the line, and, the door being opened,
                    the dial was gradually tilted until the shadow cast by the upper edge exactly
                    coincided with it. But this shadow tilts the card one-quarter of a degree more
                    than the sun-line, because it is given by that portion of the sun which just
                    appears above the edge, that is, by the upper limb of the sun, which is
                    one-quarter of a degree higher than the centre. Now, even at some distance from
                    noon, the sun will sometimes take a considerable time to rise one-quarter of a
                    degree, and by so much time will the indication of the dial be in error.</p>
                <p>The central line of light which comes through the open slit will be free from
                    this error, because it is given by light from the centre of the sun.</p>
                <p>The card-dial deserves to be looked upon as something more than a mere toy. Its
                    ingenuity and scientific accuracy give it an educational value which is not to
                    be measured by the roughness of the results obtained, and the following
                    demonstration of its correctness will, it is hoped, usefully close what we have
                    to say on this subject.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Demonstration.—</hi> Let H (fig. 9) be the point of suspension
                    of the plummet at the time of observation, so that the angle DAH is the north
                    declination of the sun,—P, the bead, resting against the hour-</p>
                <p>line VX. Join OX, then the angle ACX is the hour angle from noon given by the
                    bead, and we have to prove that this hour-angle is the correct one corresponding
                    to a north latitude DAG, a north declination AH and an altitude equal to the
                    angle which the <hi rend="italic">sun-line,</hi> or its parallel AC, makes with
                    the horizontal. The angle PHQ will be eqſial to the altitude, if HQ be drawn
                    parallel to DC, for the pair of lines HQ, HP will be respectively at right
                    angles to the sun-line and the horizontal.</p>
                <p>Draw PQ and HM parallel to AC, and let them meet DCE in NI and N
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>Let HP and its equal HA be represented by <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Then the
                    follow-ine values will be rc'adilv deduced from the figure :—</p>
