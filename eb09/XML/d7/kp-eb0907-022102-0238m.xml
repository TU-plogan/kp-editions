                    converting that portion of the food which is digestible into chyle, so that it
                    may be absorbed and applied to the nourishment of the body; and of transmitting
                    that which is indigestible onwards to be excreted.</p>
                <p>In the Protozoa there is no special digestive apparatus, but the particles of
                    food are introduced into the general substance of the body, where they undergo
                    digestion and assimilation. But in animals generally there is a definite
                    digestive cavity or stomach, which communicates with the surface by a distinct
                    opening or mouth, through which the food is introduced into the stomach. As a
                    rule a second opening, or anus, is also in communication with the stomach, at
                    which the indigestible parts of the food are excreted. As animals increase in
                    structural complexity the digestive apparatus has additional parts superadded to
                    it. In man and all the more highly organized animals it consists of an elongated
                    tube, the Alimentary Canal, divided into various compartments, into which
                    numerous Glands pour their secretions to be used in the digestive process. In
                    most vertebrates, the great class of birds being excepted, the compartment of
                    the canal called the mouth, or oral cavity, contains a hard masticatory
                    apparatus, the Teeth, which play an important part in breaking down the
                    food.</p>
                <p>As the digestive organs in the <hi rend="italic">human body</hi> are so
                    constructed as to illustrate one of the most perfect forms of an alimentary
                    apparatus, they will form the special subject of description in this
                    article.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Alimentary Canal</hi> is a tube about 28 feet long,
                    which traverses almost the entire length of the axial part of the body. In man
                    and all other vertebrates, it lies in relation to the ventral surface of the
                    bodies of the vertebrae. It commences on the face at the orifice of the mouth,
                    and terminates on the surface of the lower part of the trunk at the orifice of
                    the anus. It is divided into a series of segments, or compartments, which
                    communicate with each other, from above downwards, in the longitudinal axis of
                    the canal. These compartments are named mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach,
                    small intestine (subdivided into duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), and large
                    intestine (subdivided into caecum, colon, and rectum). The canal is lined by a
                    mucous membrane, called the alimentary mucous membrane, which is continuous with
                    the nasal mucous membrane, with the respiratory mucous membrane, and at the anal
                    and oral orifices with the integument, Outside this mucous membrane is the
                    submucous coat, and external to it is the muscular wall of the canal. By the
                    contraction of the muscular wall the food is propelled along the canal from
                    above downwards. Opening on the surface of the mucous membrane are the orifices
                    of the ducts of numerous glands, the secretions of which, mingling with the
                    food, act chemically on it, so as to render it soluble and capable of being
                    absorbed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mouth, Oral Cavity,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Buccal
                    Cavity,</hi> is the dilated commencement of the alimentary canal, in which the
                    food is masticated and mingled with the secretion of the salivary and mucous
                    glands. It is situated in the face, and extends from the lips in front to the
                    pharynx behind. It is bounded above by the hard and soft palate, with the uvula;
                    below by the lower jaw, the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, and the
                    tongue; on each side by the cheek; and in front by the lips, between which is
                    the aperture of communication with the surface of the face. Behind it freely
                    communicates with the pharynx through the isthmus faucium. The muscles situated
                    in the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, tongue, and soft palate enter into the
                    formation of the walls of the mouth.</p>
                <p>The mouth is lined by a red-coloured mucous membrane, which becomes continuous
                    posteriorly with that of the pharynx, and at the margins of the lips with the
                    skin of the face. The mucous membrane covering the alveolar portions of the
                    jaws, and surrounding the necks of the teeth, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gum.</hi> From the outer surface of each jaw it is reflected to the inner
                    surface of the cheeks and lips. From the inner surface of the lower jaw the
                    mucous membrane is reflected to the floor of the mouth, and a broad band, <pb

                    of the tongue.</p>
                <p>In its structure the mucous lining of the mouth consists of a stratified pavement
                    epithelium, and a sub-epithelial fibro-vascular corium, possessing numerous
                    vascular papillae. The mucous membrane of the gum is characterized by its
                    density and toughness, due to the numerous strongly developed bundles of
                    connective tissue in the corium, many of which are continued into the fibrous
                    tissue of the periosteum, which covers the alveolar surface of the jaw. The free
                    surface of the corium of the gum possesses numerous broad papillae, and is
                    covered by a stratified pavement epithelium similar to that in the lips and
                    cheeks. The mucous membrane of the hard palate is also tense and tough, though
                    not so much so as the gum; and the fibrous fasciculi of its corium blend with
                    the connective tissue of the subjacent periosteum. The mucous lining of the
                    mouth is a sensitive membrane, and receives its nervous supply from the fifth
                    cranial nerve.</p>
                <p>The mucous membrane of the mouth is specially modified on the dorsum of the
                    tongue, in the interval between the circumvallate papillae and the epiglottis,
                    and in the substance of the tonsils, by the development of collections of
                    lymphoid tissue in the sub-epithelial connective tissue.</p>
                <p>Thé <hi rend="italic">Tonsils</hi> are two almond-shaped bodies, situated, one on
                    each side of the posterior orifice of the mouth, in the fossa between the
                    anterior and posterior pillars of the soft palate. Their normal size is not
                    bigger than a hazel nut, but they are very apt to enlarge, grow inwards across
                    the posterior aperture of the mouth, and diminish the size of that opening. The
                    free surface is marked by several rounded holes, leading into shallow pits or
                    crypts, which may be either simple or branched, in the substance of the tonsil.
                    The pits are lined by the epithelial covering of the mucous membrane, into which
                    minute papiIlae project. In the subepithelial connective tissue of the walls of
                    the crypts numerous follicles of lymphoid tissue are situated, and lymph cells
                    are infiltrated in great numbers in the connective tissue between the follicles.
                    Interspersed amidst the crypts are small racemose mucous glands. The tonsils are
                    very vascular, and capillary blood-vessels are distributed in connection w ith
                    the papillae, the lymphoid tissue, and the racemose glands The tonsillar veins
                    form a plexus in relation to the attached surface of the tonsil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mucous and Salivary Glands of the Mouth.—</hi> The ducts of
                    numerous glands, engaged in secreting mucus and saliva, open on the free surface
                    of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Their secretion not only keeps the mouth
                    moist, and aids therefore in articulation, but by mingling with the food assists
                    in mastication, deglutition, and the digestive process. Each gland is
                    characterized by being divided into small lobules, and by possessing a duct or
                    ducts, which branch off in an arborescent manner in the substance of the gland,
                    and finally end in the minute lobules. They all belong to the compound racemose
                    group of glands.</p>
                <p>The mucous glands of the mouth are situated beneath its mucous lining in the
                    following localities :—(a) <hi rend="italic">labial</hi> glands, in the upper

                    on the oral surface of the hard palate, in the uvula, on both surfaces of the
                    soft palate, and in the tonsils; <hi rend="italic">(sh)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >molar</hi> glands, close to the last lower molar tooth on each side; (e) <hi
                    rend="italic">lingual</hi> glands, extending backwards from the tip of the
                    tongue along its margin, and also on its dorsum between the circumvallate
                    papillae and epiglottis. The ducts of these mucous glands consist of a delicate
                    membrane lined by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells. The terminal
                    branches of the ducts which enter the lobules end in a series of saccular
                    dilatations, the <hi rend="italic">acini, alveoli,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gland-vesicles,</hi> which contain rounded or polygonal secreting cells. A
                    collection of such vesicles forms a lobule. The lobules are bound together by
                    intermediate connective tissue, in which the blood-vessels divide into a
                    capillary network, that ramifies on the outer surface of the delicate membrane
                    forming the wall of the glandvesicles.</p>
                <p>The salivary glands of the mouth are the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual
                    glands. The <hi rend="italic">parotid gland</hi> is the largest salivary gland,
                    and occupies the parotid hollow between the lower jaw and the external ear. Its
                    anterior border overlaps the masseter muscle, and the excretory duct emerges out
                    of this border. A prolongation of gland substance, the <hi rend="italic">socia
                    parotidis,</hi> frequently accompanies the duct for a short distance. The

                    duct is between 2 and 3 inches long, and about the thickness of a crow-quill.
                    The <hi rend="italic">submaxillary gland</hi> is situated immediately below the
                    lower jaw. The excretory duct of the gland, called <hi rend="italic">Wharton's
                    duct,</hi> runs forwards and opens on the floor of the mouth by the side of the
                    fraenum linguae. The <hi rend="italic">sublingual</hi> is the smallest of the
                    salivary glands, and lies under the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth,
                    close to the fraenum linguae. It possesses from ten to twenty small excretory
                    ducts, the <hi rend="italic">ducts of Rivinus,</hi> some of which join Wharton’s
                    duct, though the greater number open directly on the floor of the mouth near the

                    contain the secreting cells.</p>
                <p>The blood-vessels are distributed in the interlobular connective tissue, and form
                    a capillary network on the wall of the gland-ducts, and on the wall of the gland

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pharynx</hi> is an irregularly dilated canal, which forms a
                    common passage, connecting the mouth with the oesophagus, and the nose with the
                    larynx, so as to be subservient to the processes both of deglutition and
                    respiration. Its position and connections have been described under the heading
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi></p>
                <p>The wall of the pharynx consists of three coats-—an external muscular and an
                    internal mucous coat, and an intermediate fibrous membrane, which blends with
                    the submucous coat. The <hi rend="italic">muscular coat</hi> consists of three
                    pairs of circularly arranged muscles, the constrictors of the pharynx; and of
                    two pairs of longitudinally-arranged muscles, the stylo-pharyngei and
                    plato-pharyngei, with occasionally a third pair, the salpingo-pharyngei. The
                    constrictor muscles extend from the lateral wall to the middle line of the
                    posterior wall of the pharynx, and are named from below upwards the inferior,

                    mucous membrane lining the Eustachian tubes, nose, mouth, larynx, and
                    oesophagus.</p>
                <p>The epithelium covering the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx is
                    columnar and ciliated over a considerable surface, but elsewhere the pharyngeal
                    epithelium is tesselated and stratified: and in the latter localities, vascular
                    papillae project into the epithelial layers. Small racemose glands lie beneath
                    the mucous membrane, which is pierced by their ducts to open on the surface
                    (fig. 2); they are most numerous in the nasal part of the pharynx. Collections
                    of lymphoid tissue are found in the sub-epithelial connective tissue, more
                    especially in the nasal part of the pharynx, where it forms a mass, extending
                    across the posterior and upper wall, between the openings of the two Eustachian
                    tubes, which Luschka has called the <hi rend="italic">pharyngeal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tonsil.</hi> The arteries of the pharynx are derived from the
                    external carotid or some of its branches. The motor, sensory, and sympathetic
                    nerves unite to form the pharyngeal plexus situated behind the middle
                    constrictor muscle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Soft Palate</hi> forms an inclined plane, which projects,
                    downwards and backwards into the pharynx, from the posterior border of the hard
                    palate. It is less dependent at the sides than in the mesial plane, where it
                    forms an elongated' body, the <hi rend="italic">uvula.</hi> Its anterior or oral
                    surface is smooth, and gives origin on each side to a fold, which curves
                    downwards to the side of the root of the tongue, to form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior pillars of the palate or fauces.</hi> Its posterior or pharyngeal
                    surface, also smooth, gives origin on each side to a fold, which, springing from
                    the base of the uvula, curves downwards and backwards to be lost in the
                    side-walls of the pharynx; this pair of folds forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior pillars of the palate or fauces.</hi> The soft palate is complex in
                    structure, and consists of muscles, mucous membrane, glands, blood and lymph
                    vessels, and nerves. The muscles of the soft palate are arranged in two groups,
                    those which elevate and make it tense, and those which constrict the fauces.</p>
                <p>The mucous membrane of the soft palate is continuous with that of the mouth and
                    pharynx. The epithelium covering the anterior or oral surface is a stratified
                    pavement epithelium. That on the posterior or pharyngeal surface is in infancy a
                    lammated cylindrical and ciliated epithelium, with isolated areas of pavement
                    epithelium, but in adults it is a laminated pavement epithelium. Numerous
                    racemose mucous glands lie beneath the mucous membrane, but much more abundantly
                    on the oral than on the pharyngeal aspect. Collections of lymphoid tissue,
                    similar to those found in the tonsils, are also met with. The arteries are
                    branches of the internal maxillary, facial, and ascending pharyngeal. The veins
                    of the soft palate often assume a dilated character, and are continuous with the
                    pharyngeal veins. Lymphatics are also distributed beneath the mucous
                    membrane.</p>

                    the sixth cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the pharynx. It passes
                    down the lower part of the neck, traverses the cavity of the thorax, pierces the

                    divided into two layers, an external and an internal. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >external</hi> layer is composed of fibres arranged longitudinally in the wall.
                    The <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> layer consists of fibres arranged in a
                    series of rings around the tube, which lie sometimes horizontally, at others
                    obliquely. The muscular coat in the upper fourth of the oesophagus is red, and
                    its fibres are transversely striped; in the second fourth numerous non-striped
                    fibres are mingled with the striped; whilst in the lower half the coat consists
                    exclusively of non-striped fibres. By the contraction of the fibres of the
                    muscular coat the food is propelled downwards into the stomach.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">submucous coat</hi> connects the muscular and mucous coats
                    with each other. It consists of bundles of white fibrous tissue intermingled
                    with elastic fibres, and the nerves and blood-vessels passing to the mucous coat
                    ramify in it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">internal coat</hi> lines
                    the interior of the tube, and is continuous above with the mucous lining of the
                    pharynx, and below with that of the stomach. When the oesophagus is empty it is
                    thrown into longitudinal folds. Its free surface is covered by a thick layer of
                    stratified squamous epithelium, which terminates abruptly at the cardiac orifice
                    of the stomach in an irregular line. Projecting into the epithelium are
                    multitudes of minute conical papillae. Opening on the surface of the membrane
                    are the ducts of numerous small racemose glands similar to those in the pharynx
                    (fig. 2). Collections of lymphoid tissue, forming solitary follicles, are also
                    found in the mucous membrane. The deep surface of the mucous membrane consists
                    of a layer of non-striped muscular tissue, the bundles of which run
                    longitudinally; it forms the muscular layer of the mucous coat, or <hi
                    rend="italic">muscularis</hi><hi rend="italic">mτιcosce.</hi></p>
                <p>The oesophagus is supplied with blood by the inferior thyroid artery, the
                    oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta, and the ascending branch of the
                    coronary artery of the stomach. The nerves are derived from the pneumo-gastrics,
                    which form plexuses containing nerve-cells, not only in the muscular coat, but
                    in the muscularis mucosae. A network of lymphatic vessels also occurs in both
                    the mucous and submucous coats.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abdominal Cavity and Peritoneum.</hi> —As the remaining
                    portions of the alimentary canal are situated in the abdominal cavity, it will
                    be advisable, before describing their anatomy, to give an account of the form
                    and boundaries of that cavity, of its division into regions, and of the general
                    arrangement «f the peritoneum, which constitutes its lining membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Abdominal Cavity, Abdomen,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belly,</hi> is the largest of the three great cavities of the body. It occupies
                    about the lower two-thirds of the trunk, and extends from the diaphragm above to
                    the pelvic floor below. As its walls, except in the pelvic region, are chiefly
                    formed of muscles and of fibrous membrane, they are much more distensible than
                    those of the thorax, and permit considerable modifications to occur in the size
                    of the viscera contained within the cavity. The abdomen is elongated in form;
                    its vertical diameter is greater than either the transverse or the
                    antero-posterior diameter. The superior boundary is formed by the concave vault
                    of the diaphragm, and by the seven lower pairs of ribs and costal cartilages; in
                    this boundary occur the opening through which the oesophagus passes into the
                    abdomen, and also the apertures for the transmission of the great blood-vessels,
                    the nerves, and the thoracic duct. The inferior boundary is formed by the
                    levatores ani and coccygei muscles, and the pelvic fascia; in relation to this
                    boundary are the termination of the rectum and anal orifice, the termination <pb

                    -</hi> the female that of the vagina also. The anterior boundary is formed above
                    by the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall and the fascia transversalis; the
                    linea alba occupies its middle fine, and about the middle of the linea alba is
                    the umbilicus or navel; the anterior wall below is formed by the two pubic bones
                    with the symphysis. The lateral walls, or flanks, arc formed above by the flat
                    muscles of the abdominal wall and the fascia transversalis, and below on each
                    side by the ilium and ischium with the muscles attached to them. The posterior
                    wall is formed by the lumbar spine, sacrum, and coccyx, and by the muscles
                    attached to these bones with their accompanying fasciae. The abdomen is
                    primarily divided into the <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >abdomen proper.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> is subdivided into the
                    <hi rend="italic">false pelvis,</hi> or the part above the pelvic brim, and <hi
                    rend="italic">true pelvis,</hi> or part below the pelvic brim.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Peritoneum</hi> is the largest and most complicated serous
                    membrane in the body. Like the other serous membranes, it not only lines the
                    walls of the cavity in which it is situated, but gives a more or less complete
                    investment to the contained viscera. It is arranged, therefore, so as to form a
                    <hi rend="italic">parietal</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">visceral</hi> part,
                    which are continuous with each other in the various regions where the part
                    lining the wall is reflected as a covering upon the viscera. A space or cavity,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">peritoneal cavity,</hi> is inclosed between the
                    parietal and visceral layers. This cavity, as in other serous membranes, is a
                    closed or shut sac, without any communication externally, except in the female,
                    where the two Fallopian tubes open into it.</p>
                <p>Through these openings the mucous membrane lining the tubes becomes continuous
                    with the serous membrane, and a communication is established between the lumen
                    of each tube and the peritoneal cavity. That surface of both the parietal and
                    visceral portion of the peritoneum which lies next the cavity is free, smooth,
                    covered by an endothelium, and lubricated by a little serous fluid, which under
                    some pathological conditions may be greatly increased in quantity, so as to
                    cause abdominal dropsy. The moistening of the two free surfaces by the serum
                    permits them to glide smoothly on each other, during the movements of the
                    viscera, and the changes which take place in their size and position. The
                    opposite surface of the peritoneum is attached—that of the parietal part to the
                    fasciae situated internal to the abdominal muscles, that of the visceral part to
                    the subjacent coat of the several organs.</p>
                <p>Special names are applied to the folds or duplicatures of the peritoneum, which
                    pass from the wall of the abdomen to the viscera. In the case of the liver,
                    spleen, bladder, and uterus, these folds are named <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligaments,</hi> whilst the corresponding folds which pass to the intestine have
                    received the name of <hi rend="italic">mesenteries.</hi> Folds of peritoneum
                    also pass between certain of the viscera themselves, and these are called <hi
                    rend="italic">omenta.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> is the bag-like dilatation of the alimentary
                    canal, connecting the oesophagus with the duodenum, in which the food is mingled
                    with the gastric juice, and converted into a pulpy substance—the chyme. The
                    stomach is situated in the costal zone of the abdominal cavity; three-fourths of
                    its volume being contained in the left hypochondrium, whilst the remaining
                    fourth extends into the epigastrium. About five-sixths of the organ lies to the
                    left of the mesial plane, and one-sixth to the right. The stomach varies in
                    size, shape, and somewhat in position, according as it is empty or full of food.
                    When moderately full it is about 1 foot in length, whilst its greatest
                    transverse diameter is 4 to 5 inches. Its general shape is pyriform, and it may
                    be described as possessing two extremities, two surfaces, and two borders. The
                    larger extremity, called the <hi rend="italic">fundus, cardiac extremity,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">great cul-de-sac,</hi> is directed upwards so as to be in
                    contact with the under surface of the diaphragm, whilst the smaller end, the <hi
                    rend="italic">pyloric</hi> or <hi rend="italic">duodenal extremity,</hi> is
                    directed downwards, curves to the right, and becomes continuous with the
                    duodenum. The <hi rend="italic">surfaces</hi> form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">posterior walls</hi> of the stomach. When
                    the organ is empty, the walls are flattened, and in apposition with each other
                    by their inner surfaces; but when it is distended they are convex, The <hi
                    rend="italic">borders</hi> of the stomach are curved and unequal in size; one is
                    convex, about three times as long as the other, and is named the <hi
                    rend="italic">greater curvature;</hi> the other is concave, and forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">lesser curvature.</hi> The curvatures are so arranged that the
                    greater has its convexity directed downwards and to the left, where it lies in
                    relation to the transverse colon and the splenic flexure of the colon. The
                    lesser curvature has ks concavity directed upwards and to the right, and the
                    oesophagus opens into the stomach at the upper end of the lesser curvature.
                    Above this orifice the stomach expands into the fundus, which is situated in the
                    highest part of the left hypochondrium, and occupies therefore the summit of the
                    vault of the left half of the diaphragm. At the lower and right end the two
                    curvatures lie almost horizontally in the epigastrium and terminate at the
                    pylorus, where the stomach becomes continuous with the duodenum. The pylorus, or
                    gate of the stomach, is situated in the epigastrium about three fingers’ breadth
                    below the ensiform cartilage, and immediately to the right of the mesial plane.
                    The junction of the stomach with the duodenum is marked by a circular
                    constriction externally, called the <hi rend="italic">pyloric constriction,</hi>
                    and by a valve internally, the <hi rend="italic">pyloric valve.</hi> At its
                    pyloric end the stomach presents a small bulging, the <hi rend="italic">lesser
                    cul-de-sac,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">antrum pylori.</hi></p>
                <p>The stomach is retained in position, partly by its connections with the
                    aesophagus and duodenum, partly by the pressure of the surrounding abdominal
                    walls and viscera, and partly by folds of peritoneum which pass from it to the
                    adjacent structures. These folds are as follows :—The <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastro-phrenic ligament</hi> extends from the diaphragm to the stomach in the
                    angle between the aesophagus and the cardiac extremity; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastro-hepatic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">small omentum</hi> passes from the
                    lesser curvature of the stomach to the lips of the transverse fissure of the
                    liver; the <hi rend="italic">gastrosplenic omentum</hi> from the cardiac end of
                    the stomach to the spleen; the <hi rend="italic">gastro-colic</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">great omentum</hi> descends from the greater curvature of the
                    stomach in front of the coils of the small intestine, and then ascends to
                    inclose the transverse colon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of the Stomach.</hi> —The wall of the stomach
                    consists of four coats, named, from without inwards, serous, muscular,
                    submucous, and mucous coats.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">external</hi> or <hi rend="italic">serous coat</hi> is that
                    part of the peritoneal membrane which incloses the stomach,—one layer covering
                    the anterior, the other the posterior surface. It leaves the stomach at the
                    curvatures, where it forms the great and small omenta, and along these borders
                    the two layers inclose between them the blood-vessels and nerves which supply
                    the organ.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">muscular coat</hi> consists of non-striped fibres arranged
                    in three layers from without inwards. The outer layer consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">longitudinal</hi> fasciculi, which are continuous with the
                    external longitudinal layer of the aesophagus. They form scattered fasciculi
                    extending longitudinally over the surface of the stomach from cardia to pylorus;
                    but along the two curvatures, more especially the lesser, they are collected
                    into stronger bundles, and at the pylorus they become continuous with the
                    longitudinal fibres of the duodenum. The middle layer consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">circular</hi> fasciculi, which form a ring-like arrangement
                    transversely to the long axis of the stomach. These fasciculi are comparatively
                    thin and scattered at the cardiac end, but as they approach the pylorus they
                    become more closely aggregated, so as to form a thick layer, which at the
                    pylorus extends into the pyloric valve, and forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sphincter pylori</hi> muscle. The circular fibres of the stomach are in the
                    same morphological plane as the circular fibres of the aesophagus and duodenum.
                    The inner layer consists of <hi rend="italic">oblique</hi> fasciculi, which are
                    not found over the entire organ; the greater number spring from the left side of
                    the cardiac orifice, and radiate on the anterior and posterior surfaces towards
                    the pylorus and greater curvature. These oblique fibres by their contraction
                    approximate the cardia to the pylorus, the great curvature to the smaller, and
                    the anterior to the posterior wall; they are thus the true grinding muscles of
                    the stomach, and have been compared to the muscular gizzard of the bird. From
                    the relation of the two groups of oblique fibres to the cardiac orifice they
                    probably close that opening during gastric digestion. The longitudinal and
                    circular fibres <pb break="no"

                    constriction of the stomach. By the action of the muscular coat the food is
                    churned about in the stomach, so as to become thoroughly intermingled with the
                    gastric juice. The contraction of the sphincter pylori closes the pyloric
                    orifice, and prevents the passage of the food into the duodenum, before it is
                    converted into chyme.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">submucous coat</hi> consists of the areolar variety of
                    connective tissue, and lies immediately subjacent to the oblique layer of the
                    muscular coat.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">internal coat</hi> lines
                    the cavity of the stomach, and is continuous with the mucous membrane of the
                    oesophagus and duodenum. It is a soft, pulpy membrane, of a pink colour, which
                    becomes redder during digestion, owing to turgescence of the blood-vessels. At
                    the pyloric end it is often stained yellow or green with bile, and in old people
                    it has a brown colour, from formation of pigment. In the empty stomach it is
                    thrown into folds or <hi rend="italic">rugae,</hi> which have usually a
                    longitudinal direction, but when distended the rugae are obliterated, and the
                    surface of the mucous membrane is smooth.. This membrane is commonly said to be
                    thicker at the pyloric end than in the fundus; but Brinton, who had
                    opportunities of examining the stomach of healthy young adults immediately after
                    death, found the cardiac mucous membrane to be more than twice as thick as the
                    pyloric. He ascribes the thinning of the cardiac mucous membrane to the effects
                    of postmortem digestion, owing to the gravitation of the gastric juice, in the
                    recumbent position of the dead body, into the fundus of the stomach.</p>
                <p>If the free surface of the gastric mucous membrane be examined with a pocket lens
                    it will be seen to be pitted with shallow depressions or alveoli, polygonal in
                    form, and varying from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ¾ <hi rend="subscript">

                    pits numerous rounded orifices may be seen, which are the mouths of the gastric
                    secreting glands. If vertical sections be now made through the mucous membrane,
                    these glands will be seen to be tubular in form.</p>
                <p>In the human stomach the tubular glands are, for the most part, simple, almost
                    straight cylinders, and possess an average length of ⅛ffi inch, and a breadth of
                    about - <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-¾ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th inch.
                    They are somewhat dilated at their orifices, and at their closed ends give rise
                    to caecal pouches. For about the upper fourth or fifth of their length the tubes
                    are lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium, continuous with the columnar
                    epithelium covering the free surface of the gastric mucous membrane. In the rest
                    of the gland-tube Brinton found two kinds of cells. The one,'the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">peptic cells,</hi> about - <hi rend="subscript"> t 2</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 00</hi> th inch in diameter, and
                    of an ovoid or somewhat polygonal form, lay next to the wall of the gland. The
                    other kind, somewhat cubical in form, lined the very narrow central canal of the
                    gland, and formed an <hi rend="italic">axial layer,</hi> which was continuous
                    above with the columnar epithelium lining the upper end of the tube.</p>
                <p>It is in the dog and cat, however, that the structure of the gastric mucous
                    membrane has especially been studied, and two kinds of glands have been
                    described. The one, situated especially in the region of the pylorus, consists
                    for the most part of simple tubes, which may, however, branch at their deeper
                    end; they have’ been called the <hi rend="italic">mucus glands.</hi> They are
                    lined by a columnar epithelium, the cells of which at the deeper end of the
                    gland are more cubical in form, and have a clouded granular appearance. The
                    other kind of gland is situated in the remaining part of the gastric mucous
                    membrane, and consists of tubes which divide usually into four branches; they
                    have been named the <hi rend="italic">peptic glands.</hi> The cellular lining of
                    these peptic glands closely corresponds with the dimorphous arrangement in the
                    human stomach already referred to. Heidenhain states that in a fasting dog the
                    glands are shrunken, and the axial cells are transparent, whilst during
                    digestion the peptic glands are swollen out and the cells are clouded and
                    granular.</p>
                <p>The gastric glands are separated from each other by slender prolongations of the
                    muscularis mucosae, and by the vascular inter-glandular connective tissue, which
                    is soft and delicate, and contains a small proportion of lymphoid corpuscles
                    diffused in it. In some localities the lymphoid tissue may be collected into
                    solitary follicles, forming the <hi rend="italic">lenticular</hi> glands of the
                    stomach. Beneath the glands is a well-defined <hi rend="italic"
                    >muscularis</hi><hi rend="italic">mucosae,</hi> arranged in two layers, which
                    gives off bundles that pass between the gastric glands.</p>
                <p>The gastric mucous membrane is highly vascular; small arteries enter it from the
                    submucous coat, and terminate in a capillary plexus, situated in the
                    inter-glandular connective tissue surrounding the gastric glands; a vascular
                    capillary ring surrounds the orifice of each gland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pyloric valve</hi> is the name given to the circular fold,
                    situated at the junction of the stomach and duodenum, which surrounds the
                    pyloric orifice. This fold is covered on its free surface by mucous membrane,
                    which incloses the submucous coat and the circular layer of the muscular coat,
                    but not the longitudinal layer, or the serous coat. That portion of the mucous
                    membrane which covers the gastric surface of the valve possesses the structure
                    of the mucous membrane of the stomach; whilst that which covers the duodenal
                    surface is studded with villi, and possesses the structure of the intestinal
                    mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The arteries of the stomach form arches along the greater and lesser curvatures,
                    and anastomose in the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach. The veins of
                    the stomach are rootlets of the portal vein. The lymphatics are numerous, and
                    form a superficial and a deep set. The nerves of the stomach are derived from
                    the epigastric plexus of the sympathetic and from the pneumogastric nerves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Intestinal Canal, Intestine, Gut,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bowel,</hi> is situated in the abdominal cavity, and extends from the pyloric
                    opening, or gate, of the stomach to the orifice of the anus. In it the chyme
                    becomes mingled with the bile, the pancreatic fluid, and the secretions of the
                    intestinal glands, and is converted into chyle. In it also the absorption of the
                    chyle takes place, and the insoluble part of the food' is passed onwards to be
                    excreted in the form of faeces. The intestine is the longest division of the
                    alimentary canal, and measures on an average about 25 feet. It is primarily
                    divided into two parts, called small intestine and large intestine; the length
                    of the small is about 20 feet, that of the large about 5 feet.</p>
                <p>Φhe <hi rend="italic">Small Intestine</hi> is the upper of the two divisions of
                    the canal, and consists of a convoluted, almost cylindrical tube, which reaches
                    from the pylorus to the caecum, or commencement of the large intestine. It is
                    subdivided into three portions, named duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Duodenum</hi> is the commencement of the small intestine,
                    and has received its name from its length being regarded as about equal to the
                    breadth of twelve fingers. It forms the shortest and widest of the three
                    sub-divisions of the small bowel; it curves, in the form of a horse-shoe, from
                    the pylorus to opposite the left side of the body of <pb break="no"

                    continuous with the jejunum. The duodenum is distinguished from the rest of the
                    small intestine by having the ducts of the liver and pancreas opening into its
                    canal, by containing in its wall a collection of compound racemose glands, named
                    the glands of Brunner, and by being developed from the primitive fore-gut, and
                    not, like the jejunum and ileum, from the primitive middle gut. Like the
                    stomach, it should be regarded as a distinct segment of the alimentary
                    canal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Jejunum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi> form by far
                    the longest part of the small intestine, and are not separated from each other
                    by any sharp line of demarcation —the upper two-fifths being called jejunum, on
                    account of its being usually empty after death, the lower three-fifths being
                    termed ileum, from its convoluted arrangement. They occupy the umbilical,
                    hypogastric, right and left iliac regions of the abdomen, in which they are
                    arranged in a series of coils or convolutions; one or two coils of the ileum
                    sometimes lie in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum. The
                    coils are attached to the posterior wall of the abdomen, along a line from the
                    body of the first lumbar vertebra to the right sacro-iliac joint, by the fold of
                    peritoneum called the <hi rend="italic">mesentery.</hi> Owing to the extent of
                    the mesentery, the coils of the jejunum and ileum can be freely moved about in
                    the abdominal cavity, so that they are apt to be displaced from their natural
                    position, and, when a rupture occurs, to become the most usual contents of the
                    hernial sac. The lower end of the ileum passes into the right iliac fossa, where
                    it becomes continuous with the large intestine, at the junction of the caecum
                    and ascending colon. Though the line of demarcation between jejunum and ileum is
                    an arbitrary one, yet the upper end of the jejunum may be distinguished from the
                    lower end of the ileuπι by being wider, and having a thicker mucous membrane, in
                    which the folds called <hi rend="italic">valvulae conniventes</hi> are larger
                    and more numerous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of the Small Intestine.—</hi> The wall of the small
                    intestine consists in the greater part of its extent of four coats, named, from
                    without inwards, serous, muscular, submucous, and mucous coats.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">serous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">external coat,</hi>
                    derived from the peritoneum, forms a complete investment for the jejunum and
                    ileum, and is continuous with the mesentery along a line of attachment, named
                    the mesenteric border of the intestine; but the serous covering of the duodenum
                    is incomplete.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">muscular coat</hi> consists of non-striped fibres arranged
                    in two layers from without inwards. The outer layer consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">longitudinal</hi> fasciculi, which form a thin layer parallel to
                    the long axis of the intestine. The inner layer consists of <hi rend="italic"
                    >circular</hi> fasciculi arranged around the gut transverse to its long axis;
                    this layer is thicker, stronger, and more highly coloured than the longitudinal
                    layer. By the contraction of the muscular coat, the peristaltie or vermicular
                    movement is produced, which propels the ingested materials along the
                    intestine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">submucous coat</hi> lies immediately subjacent to the
                    circular layer of the muscular coat, and consists of areolar connective tissue;
                    in it the blood-vessels ramify before they pass into the mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">internal coat</hi> is a
                    soft, velvety-looking membrane, which lines the wall of the small intestine, and
                    possesses a complex appearance and structure. The inner surface is not smooth,
                    but is thrown into strongly-marked, transverse folds, the valvulae conniventes,
                    which are not obliterated during distension'of the gut. They are very numerous
                    in the duodenum and jejunum, but then decrease in size and numbers, until at the
                    lower end of the ileum they have disappeared. Each valvula consists of a fold of
                    the mucous membrane with its submucous coat. Owing to their presence, the extent
                    of the mucous surface is much greater than if it were a plane-surfaced
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>In its more minute structure the mucous coat may be regarded as composed of
                    numerous projecting bodies, a glandular layer, and a muscular layer.</p>
                <p>The projecting bodies are the intestinal <hi rend="italic">Villi,</hi> which jut
                    out into the lumen of the intestine from the free surface of the mucous
                    membrane, not only of the valvulae, but of the intermediate surface. They are
                    delicate, minute processes, varying in length from a fourth to half a line, and
                    in number amount to several millions.</p>
                <p>They are best examined when the mucous surface is placed in water or spirit, when
                    they may be seen with the naked eye, or, still better, with a pocket lens; when
                    the chyle-vessels or blood-vessels are injected, they become erected, and stand
                    out more prominently from the surface. They vary in form, being filiform, or
                    cylindrical, or conical, or club-shaped, or leaf-shaped. They are more numerous
                    in the duodenum and jejunum than in the ileum, and to their presence is due the
                    velvety appearance of the mucous surface. They are not found elsewhere than in
                    the small intestine.</p>
                <p>As they are the parts of the mucous membrane directly concerned in the absorption
                    of the chyle, their structure is interesting and important. Each villus is
                    invested by a cap of epithelium continuous with the general epithelial covering
                    of the mucous membrane. The epithelium consists of a single layer of <hi
                    rend="italic">columnar cells,</hi> compactly arranged side by side. Scattered
                    amidst the columnar cells are cells which possess the form of microscopic
                    goblets, and are named <hi rend="italic">goblet cells.</hi> The free end of each
                    goblet cell appears to have an open mouth on the surface of the villus, through
                    which a mucus-like substance exudes. Various opinions have been expressed as to
                    the nature of these goblet cells. Some regard them as special structures engaged
                    either in the absorption of chyle, or the secretion of mucus; others look upon
                    them as merely modifications of the columnar epithelium; whilst others again
                    consider them to be <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> productions, due to the
                    swelling out of the columnar epithelium by the imbibition of fluid. There can be
                    no doubt, however, that they are not specially concerned in the absorption of
                    chyle, as cells of the same character are found in the respiratory mucous
                    membrane, and on other surfaces, where the absorption of chyle does not take
                    place.</p>
                <p>The sub-epithelial tissue of a villus forms its matrix or basis substance, and
                    consists of the sub-epithelial connective tissue of the mucous membrane. When
                    thin sections through a villus are examined, the matrix is seen to be composed
                    of a delicate retiform tissue, which îorms a network, in the meshes of which
                    numbers of colourless lymphoid corpuscles are imbedded. These cells were
                    described and figured by Goodsir, as the absorbing cells or vesicles of the
                    villus. In the axis of the villus one, or perhaps two, minute lacteals or chyle
                    vessels are situated, which serve as rootlets of origin of the lacteal division
                    of the lymph vascular system. The lacteal is a capillary tube, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0244-0227"/> which ends near the apex of the villus, as a
                    dilated microscopic <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac.</hi> By its opposite extremity
                    it becomes continuous with a plexus of lacteals in the submucous coat. In the
                    matrix substance, around the lacteal vessel of the villus, is a layer of
                    non-striped muscular fibre-cells, which is continuous with the general muscular,
                    layer of the mucous coat, and extends as far as the apex of the villus. By the
                    contraction of this layer the chyle during absorption is propelled along the
                    lacteal vessel. The villus also contains blood-vessels; a small artery enters at
                    its attached base, and terminates in a capillary plexus, situated in the
                    peripheral part of the matrix, close to the cap of epithelium; from the plexus a
                    vein arises, which leaves the villus at its base, and joins the veins in the
                    submucous coat.</p>
                <p>Various theories have been put forward to account for the mode of passage of the
                    chyle, during digestion, from the lumen of the intestine into the lacteal
                    vessels of the villi; but the question cannot even yet be regarded as definitely
                    settled. The appearance of a network of minute tubules within the matrix,
                    extending from the epithelial investment to the lacteal, which Letzerich
                    supposed to be the channels along which the chyle flowed, is doubtless produced
                    by the arrangement of the strands of the tetiform tissue. There seems little
                    doubt that both the cells of the epithelial investment and those of the retiform
                    tissue of the matrix become distended with the particles of chyle previous to
                    its passage into the lacteal. The view advanced by Schafer, that the corpuscles
                    in the meshes of the retiform tissue may serve as carriers of the fatty
                    particles of the chyle into the lacteals, is but another mode of expressing the
                    function of these cells advocated thirty years ago by Goodsir.</p>
                <p>The mucous membrane of the small intestine is abundantly provided with secreting
                    glands, named the glands of Brunner and of Lieberkühn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brunner's glands</hi> are confined to the duodenum; they belong
                    to the compound racemose group of glands, and resemble generally in structure
                    the mucous and salivary glands. The minute lobules of these glands lie in the
                    submucous coat, and the excretory duct pierces the mucous membrane to open on
                    the surface. The wall of the duct is formed of connective tissue lined by
                    columnar epithelium. The finest branches of the duct are continuous with the
                    acini or gland-vesicles, and the gland-vesicles contain the secreting cells,
                    which are columnar in form. A plexus of capillary blood-vessels is distributed
                    outside the membrana propria of the gland-vesicles, and lymphatic vessels ' lie
                    around the lobules. Into the duodenum, about the junction of its descending and
                    horizontal portions, the duct of the pancreas, and the bile duct from the liver,
                    open by a common orifice. These glands may be regarded, therefore, as accessory
                    glands to this portion of the small intestine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">glands of Lieberkuhn</hi> are distributed throughout the
                    whole length of the mucous coat of the small intestine. They are simple tubular
                    glands, in shape like test tubes, which lie vertically in the mucous membrane,
                    and form its proper glandular layer (figs. 5 and 6). The tubes are microscopic
                    in size, vary in length from ⅛th to - <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛th of a
                    line, and are sometimes closely set together, but in the localities where the
                    solitary and Peyer’s glands occur they are more widely separated. The glands
                    open on the surface of the mucous membrane between the villi; and the opposite
                    end of the tubes is closed and rounded, and reaches close to the muscular layer
                    of the mucous coat. They are lined by a layer of columnar' epithelium cells,
                    continuous with the epithelial investment of the villi. The glands are separated
                    from each other by retiform connective tissue, in the meshes of which colourless
                    lymphoid corpuscles exist in considerable numbers; the plexus of capillary
                    blood-vessels, which is distributed outside the membrana propria of the gland
                    tube, lies in this connective tissue.</p>
                <p>The connective tissue of the mucous coat is characterized generally by its
                    retiform character, and by the diffusion of colourless lymphoid corpuscles in
                    the meshwork. But in some parts of the mucosa these corpuscles, with their
                    supporting framework of retiform tissue, are collected into distinct masses or
                    follicles, visible to the naked eye, and known as the solitary and Peyer’s
                    glands or follicles.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">solitary glands</hi> are scattered throughout the whole
                    length of the intestinal mucous membrane. They are about the size of millet
                    seeds, and vary in number and distinctness in different individuals. They are
                    globular or ovoid in form, and occasion a slight elevation of the mucous
                    membrane. One pole of the gland lies next the free surface of the mucous
                    membrane, and is in relation to the columnar epithelium covering the mucosa,
                    whilst the opposite pole rests on the submucous coat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peyer's, glands,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">agminated
                    glands,</hi> consist of an aggregation of solitary glands or follicles, which
                    are crowded together, so as to form distinct elongated patches, which may vary
                    in length from ¾ inch to 3 or 4 inches. The long axis of each patch corresponds
                    to the long axis of the intestine, and the patches are placed opposite to the
                    mesenteric attachment of the bowel. Villi either may or may not be situated on
                    the surface of the patch, in the intervals between the individual follicles, but
                    Lieberkühnian glands are always found opening on the surface, and frequently
                    forming a ring of orifices around each follicle. Peyer’s patches are most
                    abundant in the lower end of the <pb break="no"

                <p>These follicles are lymphoid organs, and are composed of lymphoid or adenoid
                    tissue. The solitary and Peyer’s glands, as is the case generally with the
                    lymphoid organs, are more distinct and perfect in structure in infancy and
                    childhood, than in adults or in advanced age.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">muscular layer</hi> of the mucous membrane lies next to the
                    submucous coat, aud consists of non-striped fibres which lie parallel to the

                    around the closed end of the glands of Lieberkühn.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">blood-vessels</hi> of the small intestine, the arteries
                    enter the wall of the jejunum and ileum at its attached or mesenteric border,
                    and are branches from the arcades of the superior mesenteric artery. They run in
                    the sub-serous tissue around the wä,ll of the intestine; then pierce the
                    muscular coat and supply it; they then enter the submucous coat, and a form a
                    network from which branches pass into the mucous coat. The veins accompany the
                    arteries, and form rootlets of the superior mesenteric vein.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lymph-vessels,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lacteals,</hi> may
                    be traced into the wall of the intestine at the mesenteric border; they form a
                    network in the muscular coat, and then enter the submucous coat, where they are
                    very abundant; from this submucous layer offshoots pass through the retiform
                    tissue, which lies between the Lieberkühnian glands, into the villi. Where the
                    solitary and Peyer’s glands are situated, the lacteals, as Frey has pointed out,
                    form a system of anastomosing vessels around the base and mesial part of each
                    follicle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">nerves</hi> are derived from the plexuses of the
                    sympathetic, which accompany the branches of the superior mesenteric artery.
                    They form between the two layers of the muscular coat an important plexus,
                    named, after its discoverer, Auerbach’s plexus, in which large stellate
                    nervecells are intermingled with nerve-fibres, and a similar nervous plexus is
                    found in the muscular coat of the other divisions of the alimentary canal. It
                    supplies and regulates the movements of the muscular coat.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Large Intestine,</hi> though not nearly so long as the
                    small intestine, is of much greater diameter. It reaches from the end of the
                    ileum to the orifice of the anus, and is divided into the caecum with the
                    appendix vermiformis, the colon, and the rectum; whilst the colon is subdivided
                    into the ascending colon, the hepatic flexure, the transverse colon, the splenic
                    flexure, the descending colon, and the sigmoid flexure.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Caecum,</hi> the dilated commencement of the large
                    intestine, lies below the ileum, and occupies the right iliac fossa. It forms a

                    freely above with the ascending colon. Opening on the inner and posterior wall

                    >vermiformis,</hi> which is a slender hollow prolongation of the bowel, varying
                    in length from 3 to 6 inches. It has the calibre of the stem of a common tobacco
                    pipe, and ends in a free closed extremity, so that, like the caecum, it is a <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi> extends from the caecum to the rectum, and forms
                    the longest part of the large intestine. The transverse part of the colon lies
                    immediately below the great curvature of the stomach, but owing to the length of
                    the <hi rend="italic">transverse meso-colon,</hi> which forms its peritoneal
                    attachment, it not unfrequently undergoes some change in its position, and may
                    hang downwards towards the pelvis, or be elevated in front of the stomach, or
                    thrown to the right or left side.</p>
                <p>The sigmoid flexure of the colon is situated in the left iliac fossa, but as the
                    <hi rend="italic">sigmoid meso-colon,</hi> which forms its peritoneal
                    attachment, is of some length, it is freely movable, and not unfrequently hangs
                    into the pelvis, or even extends across into the right iliac fossa.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> is the terminal segment of the large intestine,
                    and extends from the sigmoid flexure to the orifice of the anus. It lies in the
                    cavity of the pelvis. It commences opposite the left sacro-iliac joint, and
                    passes at first obliquely downwards and to the right until it reaches the middle
                    line of the sacrum; secondly, it closely follows the curvature of the sacrum and
                    coccyx, lying in relation to their anterior surface; thirdly, when it reaches
                    the tip of the coccyx its terminal or third part inclines downwards and
                    backwards for about 1 ‡ inch to the anal orifice. The anus opens on the surface
                    of the middle line of the perineum, midway between the two ischial tuberosities,
                    and the skin surrounding the orifice is thin, and wrinkled when the opening is
                    closed. Immediately beneath the skin is the <hi rend="italic">sphincter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ani externus</hi><hi rend="italic">muscle,</hi> which forms a thin
                    layer of fasciculi, arranged in a series of ellipses around the orifice. The
                    sphincter in its normal condition of contraction simply closes the opening, but,
                    under the influence of the will, a more powerful contraction can be induced, so
                    as to resist the entrance of foreign bodies into the rectum.</p>
                <p>The large intestine is arranged in the abdominal cavity in the form of an arch,
                    the summit of which is the transverse colon, whilst the caecum and rectum are
                    the right and left piers. Within the concavity of this arch the coils of the
                    jejunum and ileum are situated. The large intestine is not, except in the
                    rectum, a cylindriform tube, but is dilated into three parallel and longitudinal
                    rows of sacculi, which rows are divided from each other by longitudinal muscular
                    bands, whilst the sacculi in each row are separated externally by intermediate
                    constrictions. In the rectum the sacculi have disappeared, and the intestine
                    assumes a cylindrical form, but at its lower end it dilates into a reservoir, in
                    which the faeces accumulate prior to being excreted.</p>
                <p>At the junction of the large with the small intestine a valvular arrangement,
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">ileo-caecal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ileo-colic
                    valve,</hi> is found. This valve is due to the peculiar manner in which the
                    ileum opens into the large intestine.</p>
                <p>The opening is bounded by two semi-lunar folds, which project into the large
                    bowel. These folds are the two segments of the valve; one situated above the
                    opening is the <hi rend="italic">ileo-colic segment,</hi> the other, below the
                    opening, the <hi rend="italic">ileo-caecdl.</hi> The two segments become
                    continuous with each other at the ends of the elongated opening, and are
                    prolonged for some distance around the inner wall of the large intestine as two
                    prominent ridges, named the <hi rend="italic">fraena</hi> of the valve. The use
                    of the ileo-caecal valve is to impede or prevent the reflux of the contents of
                    the large into the small intestine. When the caecum and colon are distended the
                    fraena of the valve are put on the stretch, and the two segments are
                    approximated, so that the opening is reduced to a mere slit, or even closed, if
                    there is great distension of the bowel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of the Large Intestine.—</hi> The wall of the large
                    intestine consists in the greater part of its extent of four coats, named, from

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">serous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">external coat,</hi>

                    the caecum, or the ascending and descending colon. The second part of the rectum
                    has only a partial serous investment, and the third part has no serous coat.
                    Numerous pedunculated ’processes invested by the serous membrane, and containing

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0246-0229"/> in two layers from without inwards. The outer
                    layer consists of <hi rend="italic">longitudinal</hi> fasciculi, which are not
                    as a rule distributed uniformly in the wall, but in the caecum and colon are
                    collected into three longitudinal bands, which start from the caecum, where it
                    is joined by the appendix vermiformis, and extend along the colon to the rectum.
                    As these bands are not so long as the colon itself, they occasion the puckerings
                    which separate the sacculi, so that when the bands are cut through the sacculi
                    disappear. The colon then becomes more elongated and cylindriform.</p>
                <p>In the appendix vermiformis the longitudinal layer is not collected into bands,
                    but arranged uniformly along the wall. In the rectum, also, the longitudinal
                    layer is spread uniformly along the wall, and forms a well-defined red-coloured
                    layer.</p>
                <p>The inner layer of the muscular coat consists of <hi rend="italic">circular</hi>
                    fasciculi distributed around the wall of the large intestine. In the rectum this
                    layer increases in thickness, and in proximity to the anus forms a circular
                    muscle, the <hi rend="italic">sphincter</hi><hi rend="italic">ani internus,</hi>
                    which is a strong band, about half an inch broad, around the lower end of the
                    rectum. In the large, as in the small intestine, the muscular coat occasions the
                    peristaltic movements, and its increased thickness in the rectum is for the
                    purpose of expelling the faeces.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">submucous coat</hi> has similar relations and Structure to
                    the corresponding coat in the small intestine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">internal coat</hi> is not
                    thrown into valyulae conniventes, but presents a series of well-marked permanent
                    ridges, lying transversely or somewhat obliquely to the long axis of the gut,
                    and corresponding internally to the constrictions, which, on the outer surface
                    of the colon, separate the sacculi from each other. The mucous membrane of the
                    large intestine is covered by a layer of columnar epithelium. It is devoid of
                    villi, and consists of a glandular and a muscular layer. The secreting glands of
                    the glandular layer have the form and structure of the Lieberkühnian glands of
                    the small intestine (fig. 7); they open on the free surface of the mucous coat,
                    and, owing to the absence of villi, their mouths are more closely set together
                    than is the case with the corresponding glands in the small intestine; the
                    tubular glands are separated by a retiform tissue with lymphoid corpuscles.
                    Solitary glands, similar to those in the small intestine, are also present, but
                    no Peyer’s patches. The muscularis mucosae resembles generally that of the small
                    intestine.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">blood-vessels</hi> of the large intestine, the arteries
                    are principally derived from branches of the superior and inferior mesenteric
                    arteries, but the lower end of the rectum receives the haemorrhoidal branches of
                    the internal iliac and the pudic. The veins which correspond to these arteries
                    for the most part join the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, and are
                    consequently rootlets of the portal. But the veins which belong to the middle
                    and inferior haemorrhoidal arteries forma plexus about the anal orifice, which
                    partly joins the superior haemorrhoidal vein, and through it the portal vein,
                    and is partly connected through the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins with
                    the internal iliac vein, and through it with the inferior vena cava. The veins
                    about the anus are very apt to become varicose, and to form the excrescences
                    termed haemorrhoids or piles. The <hi rend="italic">lymph vessels</hi> are
                    arranged as in the small intestine, except that they are not prolonged into
                    villi. Nervous plexuses with ganglion cells are fcund in both the muscular and
                    submucous coats. They proceed from the superior and inferior mesenteric
                    plexuses, but the rectum receives branches from the hypogastric plexus, and from
                    the third and fourth sacral spinal nerves.</p>

                    substance like dextrin, which readily undergoes conversion into sugar. It lies
                    in the costal zone of the abdomen, fills up the greater part of the right
                    hypochondrium, and extends, through the epigastrium, into the left
                    hypochondrium. In its long or transverse diameter it averages about 12 inches,
                    in its antero-posterior diameter about 6 inches, in the vertical diameter of its
                    thickest part about 3 inches. Relatively to the size of the body the liver is
                    bigger and heavier in the foetus than in the adult; soon after birth the
                    relative weight declines, and that of the left lobe diminishes much more rapidly
                    than the right lobe. Frerichs states that the relative weight of the healthy
                    liver fluctuates in adults between √ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th and <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript">

                    food the liver increases both in size and weight, partly from the greater
                    quantity of blood flowing through it, and partly from the new material in the
                    secreting cells; whilst after a long fast it becomes smaller and lighter.</p>

                    Liver.—</hi> The liver is a solid Organ, of a brownish-red colour. It is
                    composed of the ramifications of the portal vein, of the portal capillaries, the
                    hepatic vein, the hepatic artery, the hepatic duct, of secreting cells, nerves,
                    and lymphatics. These several structures are bound together by connective
                    tissue, and the organ is invested by the peritoneum. The liver possesses two
                    coats, a serous and a fibrous.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">serous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">external coat</hi> is a
                    part of the peritoneal membrane, and forms an almost complete investment for the
                    liver. It is reflected from the transverse fissure as the gastro-hepatic
                    omentum, and from the upper surface and the posterior border as the falciform,
                    coronary, and right and left lateral ligaments of the liver.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fibrous coat,</hi> or tunica propria, is immediately
                    subjacent to the serous coat. When carefully raised from the liver delicate
                    processes of areolar tissue may be seen to pass from its deep surface into the
                    substance of the organ. At the transverse fissure it is prolonged into the liver
                    as a very distinct sheath, enveloping the portal vein, hepatic artery, hepatic
                    duct, nerves, and lymphatics. This sheath is named the <hi rend="italic">capsule
                    of Glisson,</hi> and is prolonged throughout the substance of the organ, along
                    the ramifications of the portal vein and the structures that accompany it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lobules of the Liver.—</hi> To the naked eye the substance of
                    the liver doss not present a homogeneous aspect, but is mottled, and mapped out
                    into multitudes of small areas or lobules,—the <hi rend="italic">hepatic
                    lobules</hi> or <hi rend="italic">leaflets.</hi> The lobules of the liver are
                    irregular polygons, and vary in size from ^⅛th to ⅛ths of an inch. In man and
                    the mammalia generally the lobules are imperfectly separated from each other by
                    the interlobular vessels and duct, and a scarcely appreciable quantity of
                    areolar connective tissue. In the pig, camel, and polar bear, each lobule is
                    circumscribed by a definite capsule of connective tissue.</p>
                <p>As a lobule of the liver is a liver in miniature, and as the structure of the
                    entire liver is the sum of the structure of its lobules, it will be necessary to
                    examine with care the constituent parts of a lobule, and the arrangement of the
                    vessels, duct, and nerves which pass to and from it. An hepatic lobule is
                    composed of blood-vessels, secreting cells, and bile-ducts, with perhaps nerves
                    and lymphatics. The blood-vessels will first be considered.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">portal vein</hi> conveys to the liver the venous blood from
                    the stomach, spleen, pancreas, gall bladder, and small and large intestine. It
                    ascends to the transverse fissure, and before it enters the liver divides into
                    two branches, one for the right and one for the left lobe. In its course within
                    the liver, the portal vein divides and subdivides after the manner of an artery.
                    It is closely accompanied by the hepatic artery and duct, and, along with them,
                    is invested by the fibrous sheath, called Glisson’s capsule. The terminal
                    branches of the portal vein run between the lobules, and are named, from their
                    position, the <hi rend="italic">interlobular</hi> branches. The interlobular
                    branches lie around the circumference of a lobule, and anastomose with each
                    other. They partly terminate directly in a capillary network situated within the
                    lobule, and partly give off fine branches, which enter the lobule before they
                    end in the capillary network. The <hi rend="italic">intralobular
                    capillaries</hi> form a close network, and converge from the periphery of the
                    lobule, where they spring from the interlobular branches of the portal vein, to
                    the centre of the lobule, where they terminate in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intralobular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">central vein,</hi> one of the rootlets
                    of the hepatic vein. In man, where the lobules are not separated from each other
                    by a distinct capsule, the capillaries of one lobule to some extent communicate
                    with those of adjacent lobules.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hepatic artery</hi> closely accompanies the portal vein,
                    and divides into two branches, for the right and left lobes. It is the nutrient
                    artery of the liver, and gives off three series of branches :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a) vaginal branches,</hi> which are distributed to the walls of the portal
                    vein, the hepatic duct, and to Glisson’s capsule, probably also to the wall of
                    the hepatic vein; they end in a capillary network in these structures, from
                    which <hi rend="italic">vaginal veins</hi> arise that terminate in the portal
                    vein; (6) <hi rend="italic">capsιdar</hi><hi rend="italic">branches,</hi> which
                    are distributed to the fibrous coat of the liver, and end in a capillary
                    network, from which arise <hi rend="italic">capsular veins</hi> that join the
                    portal vein; (c) <hi rend="italic">interlobιdar</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >branches</hi> of the hepatic artery lie along with the interlobular branches of
                    the portal vein, and end in the capillary network within the lobules.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hepatic vein</hi> arises within the substance of the liver
                    from the intralobular capillaries. In the centre of each lobule is the <hi
                    rend="italic">intralobular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">central vein.</hi> It
                    traverses the axis of the lobule, and leaves it to join a small vein running
                    immediately under the bases of adjacent lobules, which, from its position,is
                    named the <hi rend="italic">sublóbular vein.</hi></p>
                <p>Adjacent sublobular veins then join together, and form larger vessels, which are
                    the <hi rend="italic">trunks</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">hepatic vein,</hi> or
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n248/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0248-0231"/> the <hi rend="italic">hepatic venous canals</hi>
                    These trunks run towards the posterior border of the liver, and open into the
                    inferior vena cava.</p>
                <p>From this description of the vascular arrangements within the liver, it will be
                    seen that the intralobular capillaries are continuous with three vascular
                    trunks,—two which carry blood to them, the portal vein and the hepatic artery,
                    and one which conveys the blood away from them, the hepatic vein. The
                    communication in each case is so free that the capillaries can be artificially
                    injected from any one of these vessels.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">secreting cells</hi> of the liver, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hepatic cells,</hi> form the proper parenchyma of the organ. They are situated
                    within the lobules, and occupy the spaces of the capillary network. The cells
                    vary in diameter from g¾ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th to <hi rend="subscript"
                    > ττ</hi> ¾ <hi rend="subscript"> rσ</hi> th inch; they have the form of
                    irregular polyhedrons, with from four to seven sides, and with the angles
                    sometimes sharp, at other times rounded. They do not appear to possess definite
                    walls, but have a distinct nucleus. The cell protoplasm is granular, and usually
                    contai ns fat drops, and yellow particles, apparently bile pigment. The general
                    arrangement of the cells is in rows or columns, and when sections are made
                    through a lobule, transverse to the long axis of the central vein, the columns
                    of cells are seen to converge from the periphery to the centre of the lobule,
                    and to form a network.</p>
                <p>By many observers the cells are regarded as in contact with the intralobular
                    capillaries, without the intervention of an intermediate membrane. By others,
                    and more especially by Lionel Beale, the secreting cells are regarded as
                    inclosed in a tubular network, the wall of which is formed by a basement
                    membrane. Beale states that the diameter of the network is usually about - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- <hi rend="strikethrough">⅜</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    strikethrough"> 1</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">og</hi> th of an inch in most
                    mammals. According to this view, the cells are not in direct contact with the
                    capillary blood-vessels, but separated from them by the basement membrane. In
                    some parts of the lobule Beale has been able to demonstrate the basement
                    membrane as distinct from the wall of the capillaries, but usually they are
                    incorporated together. At the periphery of the lobule the membrane becomes
                    continuous with the wall of the interlobular duct.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hepatic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bile duct</hi> is the
                    tube that conveys the bile out of the liver. It leaves the transverse fissure as
                    two branches, one from the right, another from the left lobe, which almost
                    immediately unite at an acute angle. It closely accompanies within the liver the
                    ramifications of the portal vein and hepatic artery, and its terminal branches
                    pass between the lobules to form the <hi rend="italic">interlobular
                    branches</hi> of the duct. If the hepatic duct be injected, not only does the
                    injection fill the interlobular ducts, but it flows into a set of excessively
                    minute passages w ithin the lobules themselves. These passages are arranged so
                    as to form a polygonal network, which may appropriately be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">intralobular biliary network.</hi> This network has a most
                    intimate relation to the polyhedral hepatic calls, for the passages lie between
                    the flattened sides of adjacent cells, so that each cell is inclosed in a mesh
                    of the network. The German observers, who first directed attention to these
                    passages, named them <hi rend="italic">bile-capillaries,</hi> but it is probable
                    that they are merely intercellular passages bounded by the protoplasm of the
                    hepatic cells.</p>
                <p>The intralobular biliary network differs from the intralobular blood capillary
                    network, not only in the character of the fluid conveyed, but in other important
                    particulars. The bile passages have a tranverse diameter of about <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛th of that of the blood capillaries; the passages are
                    in relation to the sides of the cells, the blood capillaries to their angles, so
                    that the two systems of networks are not in contact with each other, but are
                    separated by intervening hepatic cell substance; the passages have not, in all
                    probability, an independent wall, such as is possessed by the blood capillaries.
                    As these passages can be injected from the hepatic duct, and as they convey bile
                    from the interior of the lobule into the duct, it is obvious that they must be
                    continuous with the lumen of the interlobular branches of the duct, at the
                    periphery of the lobules.</p>
                <p>The wall of the larger bile ducts is formed of a fibroelastic tissue, with a
                    proportion of non-striped muscular fibre; it is lined by a columnar epithelium.
                    Opening into the larger ducts are numerous orifices, which communicate with
                    branched caecal tubes and follicles, situated within and clustered around the
                    walls of the larger ducts, often in considerable numbers. Some of these
                    appendages to the duct doubtless serve as glands for the secretion of mucus, but
                    others are probably, as Beale supposed, mere diverticula of the duct, in which
                    the bile may be temporarily retained, as in the gall bladder.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lymphatics</hi> of the liver form a superficial and a deep
                    set. The superficial set ramifies beneath the serous coat, where they form a
                    network. The deep lymphatics accompany the portal vein and hepatic artery as far
                    as the intervals between the lobules, where they form <hi rend="italic"
                    >interlobular lymphatics,</hi> which, like the corresponding branches of the
                    portal vein, run around the lobule.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">nerves</hi> of the liver arise from the caeliac plexus of
                    the sympathetic and from the left pneumogastric. They accompany the portal
                    vessels in their distribution, and supply the muscular coats of the vessels.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gall Bladder</hi> is a reservoir for the bile, situated in
                    a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and in a notch in
                    its anterior border (fig. 8). It is pyriform in shape; its larger end, or
                    fundus, projects beyond the anterior border; its opposite end, or neck, gives
                    origin to the <hi rend="italic">cystic duct,</hi> which is directed towards the
                    transverse fissure; after a course of l¾ inch it joins the hepatic duct, and
                    forms the common bile duct, <hi rend="italic">ductus communis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">choledochus.</hi> At its neck, the gall bladder bends on itself in
                    a sigmoid curve. The gall bladder is 3 or 4 inches long, and can hold from one
                    to two ounces of bile. It is attached to the liver partly by areolar tissue, and
                    partly by the peritoneum, which is reflected over its free surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure.—</hi> In addition to its partial <hi rend="italic"
                    >serous coat,</hi> the gall bladder has a fibrous and mucous coat. The <hi
                    rend="italic">fibrous coat</hi> consists of interlacing bands of connective
                    tissue, with which non-striped muscular fibres are sparingly intermingled. The
                    <hi rend="italic">mucous membrane</hi> lining the gall bladder is deeply
                    bile-stained, and presents on its free surface an alveolar appearance, due to
                    the presence of multitudes of minute folds, which form a reticulum with
                    intermediate depressions. The surface is covered by columnar epithelium. The
                    mucous lining of both the neck of the gallbladder and cystic duct is thrown into
                    folds, which in the duct have an oblique direction, and form the spiral valve.
                    Racemose glands, for the secretion of mucus, occur in the wall of the gall
                    bladder, cystic duct, and common bile duct. The gall bladder is supplied with
                    blood by the cystic branch of the hepatic artery. It receives lymphatics and
                    nerves continuous with those which belong to the liver.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">common bile duct,</hi> formed by the junction of the cystic
                    and hepatic ducts, is about 3 inches long, and conveys the bile into the

                    hepatic artery to its left, and the portal vein behind it. It then inclines
                    behind the duodenum to the inner side of its descending part, where it comes
                    into relation with the pancreatic duct. The two ducts then run together in an
                    oblique direction through the wall of the duodenum, and open on the summit of a
                    papilla, by a common orifice, about the junction of the descending and
                    transverse portions of the duodenum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pancreas</hi> is an elongated gland which lies in
                    relation to the posterior wall of the abdomen, in front of the first lumbar
                    vertebra, and extends obliquely from the right lumbar region through the
                    epigastrium into the left hypochondriac region. It is from 6 to 8 inches long,
                    and whilst its dilated right extremity, or <hi rend="italic">head,</hi> occupies
                    the horse-shoe curve of the duodenum, and is attached by areolar tissue to the
                    descending and transverse portions, its attenuated left extremity, or <hi
                    rend="italic">tail,</hi> is in relation to the spleen. A prolongation of the
                    gland, named the <hi rend="italic">accessory</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lesser
                    pancreas,</hi> usually surrounds the superior mesenteric artery at its
                    origin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure.</hi> —The pancreas is one of the compound racemose
                    glands, and resembles generally in structure the mucous and salivary glands of
                    the mouth and the glands of Brunner (fig. 5). It is sometimes called the
                    abdominal salivary gland, and its secretion flows into the duodenum, and assists
                    in the process of chylification. It has a yellowish creamy colour, and is
                    divided into distant lobules by septa of connective tissue. The excretory duct,
                    or <hi rend="italic">duct of Wirsung,</hi> is completely surrounded by the
                    lobules, and extends from the tail to the head of the gland, receiving in its
                    passage the numerous secondary ducts, and increasing gradually in size. It
                    leaves the head of the gland, comes into relation with the common bile duct, and
                    with it pierces obliquely the posterior wall of the descending part of the
                    duodenum, to open by a common orifice about the junction of the descending and
                    transverse portions. Sometimes the duct from the accessory part of the pancreas
                    opens independently into the duodenum, a little above the common
                    hepatico-pancreatic orifice. The finest ducts within the gland terminate in the
                    <hi rend="italic">acini,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gland-vesicles,</hi> of the
                    lobules. These acini contain the secreting cells, which have a somewhat cubical
                    form. The ducts are lined by a columnar epithelium, and mucous glands are
                    situated in the mucous membrane lining the duct of Wirsung. The pancreas
                    receives its supply of blood from the splenic, superior mesenteric, and hepatic
                    arteries. Its veins join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, and through
                    them contribute to the formation of the portal vein. Its blood capillaries are
                    abundantly distributed on the walls of the gland vesicles. Lymph vessels are
                    found in the connective tissue between the lobules. The nerves are derived from
                    £he solar plexus, and accompany the arteries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Teeth.</hi> —The teeth are calcified organs developed in
                    connection with the mucous membrane of the mouth. Their primary use is that of
                    biting and grinding the food; but in man they serve as aids to speech, and in
                    many animals act as instruments of offence and defence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arrangement and Form of the Teeth.—</hi> Teeth are present in
                    the greater number of the Mammalia, in which class they are implanted in sockets
                    in the alveolar arches of the bones of the upper and lower jaws, and form only a
                    single row in each arch. In a few mammals, as the toothed whales and the sloths,
                    only one generation of teeth is produced, and when these drop out they are not
                    replaced by successors; these animals are called Monophyodont. In the majority
                    of the Mammalia, however, there are two generations of teeth,—a temporary or
                    milk set, which are deciduous, and are replaced by a permanent or adult set;
                    these animals are called Diρhyodont. But in speaking of two generations of teeth
                    it is not to be supposed that all the teeth in the adult jaw have had temporary
                    predecessors, for the molar or back teeth have only a single generation. A few
                    mammals, as the toothed whales, have the teeth uniform in size, shape, and
                    structure, and are named Homodont; but, in the majority of the Mammalia, the
                    teeth in the same jaw vary in size, form, and structure, and they are therefore
                    called Heterodont. In every Heterodont mammal, possessing a complete dentition,
                    four groups of teeth are found, which are named incisor, canine, premolar, and
                    molar teeth. Each of these teeth possesses a <hi rend="italic">crown,</hi> which
                    projects into the cavity of the mouth, and a <hi rend="italic">fang</hi> lodged
                    in the socket in the jaw; at the junction of the crown and fang there is usually
                    a constriction named the <hi rend="italic">neck</hi> of the tooth.</p>
                <p>In man the dentition is Diphyodont and Heterodont. The single row of teeth in
                    each alveolar arch of the human jaw is characterized by the crowns of the teeth
                    being of almost equal length, and by the absence of any great interspace, or <hi
                    rend="italic">diastema,</hi> between the different teeth, or of irregularities
                    in the size of the interspaces, so that the teeth form an unbroken series in
                    each jaw. The span of the upper dental arch is slightly bigger than that of the
                    lower, so that the lower incisors fit within the upper, and the lower molars,
                    being inclined obliquely upwards and inwards, are somewhat overlapped by the
                    upper molars. The upper and lower dental arches terminate behind in line with
                    each other, and the teeth are equal in number in the two jaws.</p>
                <p>Man possesses 32 teeth in his permanent dentition, arranged in four groups,
                    viz.—8 incisors, 4 canines, 8 premolars or bicuspids, and 12 molars. The number
                    and arrangement of the permanent teeth in the two jaws is expressed in the

                    upwards. The oblique direction of the upper incisors in the Negroes, Kaffres,

                    many mammals the incisors are greatly modified in form, as for example in the
                    tusks of the elephant. The determination of the incisor teeth does not depend,
                    therefore, on their form, but on their position in the jaws. The name incisor is
                    given to all the teeth situated in the pre-maxillary portion of the upper jaw,
                    and in the anterior end of the lower jaw, whatever their shape may be.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">canine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">unicuspid teeth,</hi> four
                    in number, one on each side of the mesial plane of each jaw, are placed next the
                    lateral incisors. They are bigger than the incisor teeth, and the upper canines,
                    which are sometimes called the eyeteeth, are larger than the lower; the fangs of
                    the upper canines are lodged in deep sockets in the superior maxillae, which
                    extend towards the floor of each orbit. The crowns of these teeth are thick and
                    conical; the fangs are long, single, conical, compressed on the sides where they
                    are marked by a shallow groove. In many ιhammals these teeth are developed into
                    large projecting tusks.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">premolar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bicuspid teeth,</hi>
                    eight in number, two on each side of the mesial plane of each jaw, lie
                    immediately behind the canines, and the upper bicuspids are somewhat larger than
                    the lower. The crown is quadrilateral in form, and convex both on the inner and
                    outer surfaces. It possesses two cusps, of which the outer or labial is larger
                    and more projecting than the inner, palatal, or lingual cusp. The fangs of the
                    upper bicuspids are single and laterally compressed, often bifid at the point
                    into an outer and inner segment; in the lower bicuspids the fangs are rounded,
                    and taper to a single point.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">molar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">multicuspid teeth,</hi>
                    twelve in number, are placed three on each side of the mesial plane of each jaw.
                    They are the most posterior teeth, are the largest of the series, and as a rule
                    decrease in size from the first to the last; the crowns of the lower molars are
                    somewhat bigger than those of the upper molars. The last molar tooth does not
                    erupt until the end of puberty, and is called <hi rend="italic">dens
                    sapientiae,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wisdom tooth.</hi> The crowns are broad,
                    quadrilateral, and convex both on the inner and outer surfaces. The first and
                    second upper molars have four cusps projecting from the angles of the grinding
                    or masticating surface, and an oblique ridge often connects the large anterior
                    internal cusp with the posterior external cusp; in the upper wisdom teeth, the
                    two inner or palatal cusps are frequently conjoined. The first lower molar has
                    five cusps, the fifth being interposed between the two posterior cusps; in the
                    second lower molar the fifth cusp is usually absent, or only rudimentary in
                    size, but in the lower wisdom tooth it is often present. The fangs of the first
                    and second upper molars are three in number, and divergent; two on the outer or
                    buccal side, one on the inner or palatal side; in the upper wisdom the fangs are
                    frequently partially conjoined, though trifid at the point. The fangs of the
                    first and second lower molars are two in number, an anterior and a posterior, of
                    which the anterior is the larger; they usually curve backwards in the jaw; in
                    the lower wisdom the fangs are usually conjoined, but bifid at the point.</p>
                <p>The crowns of all the teeth become more or less flattened by use, so that the
                    incisors lose their sharp cutting edge, and the cusps of the premolars and
                    molars are worn away.</p>
                <p>The temporary or milk teeth are smaller than the permanent teeth. They are more
                    constricted at the neck, where the crown joins the fang, especially in the milk
                    molars, the fangs of which also diverge more widely than in the permanent set.
                    The second temporary molar is bigger than the first. The crown of the first
                    upper molar has three cusps, two buccal, one palatal; that of the second four
                    cusps. The crown of the first lower molar has four cusps; that of the second
                    five, three of which are buccal, two lingual. The temporary teeth lie more
                    vertically in the jaws than the permanent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">alveolus,</hi> or socket for the lodgment of the single
                    fanged teeth, is a single socket; in the multi-fanged teeth, the socket is
                    divided into two or three compartments, according to the number of the fangs.
                    The socket is lined by the <hi rend="italic">alveolo-dental periosteum,</hi>
                    which is continuous at the mouth of the socket with the periosteal covering of
                    the jaw, and with the deeper fibrous tissue of the gum, where it embraces the
                    neck of the tooth. The alveolo-dental periosteum is formed of retiform
                    connective tissue, on the one hand connected with the surface of the cement, on
                    the other with the more fibrous periosteum lining the bony wall of the socket
                    (fig. 15). It is vascular, its vessels being continuous with those of the gum,
                    the pulp-vessels, and the bone. It receives nerves from those going to the pulp.
                    The fang fits accurately in the socket, and through a hole at the tip of the
                    fang the blood-vessels and nerves of the tooth pass into the pulp-cavity of the
                    tooth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of the Teeth.—</hi> Each tooth is composed of the
                    following hard structures—dentine, enamel, and cement or crusta petrosa;
                    occasionally other substances, named osteodentine or vasodentine, are present.
                    In a tooth which has been macerated, an empty space exists in its interior,
                    called the pulp-cavity, which opens externally through the hole at the tip of
                    the fang; but in a living tooth this cavity contains a soft, sensitive substance
                    named the pulp.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dentine,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ivory,</hi> makes up the
                    greater part of each tooth; it is situated both in the crown, where it is
                    covered by the enamel, and in the fang, where it is invested by the crusta
                    petrosa; whilst the pulp cavity in the centre of the tooth is a cavity in the
                    dentine. The dentine is composed of an intimate admixture of earthy and animal
                    matter in the proportion of 28 of the animal to 72 of the earthy. The animal
                    matter is resolved on boiling into gelatine; the earthy matter consists mostly
                    of salts of lime.</p>
                <p>If thin slices through the dentine of a macerated tooth be examined
                    microscopically, it will be seen to consist of a hard, dense, yellowish-white,
                    translucent <hi rend="italic">matrix,</hi> penetrated by minute canals, called
                    <hi rend="italic">dentine tubes.</hi> The dentine tubes commence at the pulp
                    cavity, on the wall of which they open with distinct orifices. They radiate in a
                    sinuous manner from the pulp cavity through the thickness of the dentine, and
                    terminate by dividing into several minute branches; this division takes place in
                    the crown of the tooth immediately under the enamel, and in the fang of the
                    tooth immediately under the crusta petrosa, lu their course the dentine tubes
                    branch more than once in a dichotomous manner, and give off numbers of extremely
                    minute collateral branches. The transverse diameter of the dentine tubes near
                    the pulp cavity is - <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi>
                    th inch, but that of their terminal branches is much more minute.</p>
                <p>If the dentine be examined in a fresh tooth, the tubes will be seen to be
                    occupied by soft, delicate, thread-like prolongations of the pulp. The passage
                    of processes of the pulp into the dentine tubes was first seen by Owen in the
                    examination of the tusk of an elephant; but the soft contents of the dentine
                    tubes have been made the subject of special investigation by J. Tomes in the
                    human and other mammalian teeth, and have been named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dentinal fibrils.</hi></p>
                <p>In sections through the dentine of dried teeth, it is net uncommon to find, near
                    its periphery, irregular, black <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0251-0234"/> spaces containing air. These spaces freely
                    communicate with each other. As the dentine which forms their boundary has not
                    unfrequently the appearance of globular contours, they were named by Czermak the
                    <hi rend="italic">interglobular</hi><hi rend="italic">spaces.</hi> In a fresh
                    tooth they are not empty, but are occupied by a soft part of the matrix, which
                    is traversed in the usual manner by the dentine tubes. This matrix is apparently
                    imperfectly calcified dentine, which shrinks up in a dried tooth, and occasions
                    an air-containing space. A layer of small irregular spaces situated in the
                    peripheral part of the dentine in the fang, immediately under the crusta
                    petrosa, and sometimes named the <hi rend="italic">granular layer,</hi> is
                    apparently of the same nature as the interglobular spaces.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Enamel</hi> is the brilliant white layer which forms a cap
                    on the surface of the crown of a tooth. It is thickest on the cutting edge or
                    grinding surface of the crown, and thins away towards the neck, where it
                    disappears. It is not only the hardest part of a tooth, but the hardest tissue
                    in the body, and consists of 96 ’ 5 per cent, of earthy and of 3 ’ 5 per cent,
                    of animal matter.</p>
                <p>The earthy matter consists almost entirely of salts of lime. The great hardness
                    of the enamel admirably adapts it as a covering for the cutting edge, or
                    grinding surfaces, of the crowns of the teeth.</p>
                <p>The enamel is composed of microscopic rods,—the <hi rend="italic">enamel
                    fibres,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">enamel prisms.</hi> These rods are set side by
                    side in close contact with each other; one end of each rod rests on the surface
                    of the dentine, the other reaches the free surface of the crown. The rods do not
                    all lie parallel to each other, for whilst some are straight, others are
                    sinuous, and the latter seem to decussate with each other. The rods are marked
                    by faint transverse lines, and are solid structures in the fully, formed enamel.
                    When cut across transversely, they are seen to be hexagonal or pentagonal, and
                    about - <hi rend="subscript"> gl</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> jth inch in
                    diameter.</p>
                <p>The free surface of the enamel of an unworn tooth is covered by a thin membrane,
                    named the <hi rend="italic">cuticle of the enamel,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nasmyihſs membrane.</hi> This membrane can be demonstrated by digesting an
                    unworn tooth in a dilute mineral acid, when it separates as a thin flake from
                    the free surface of the crown. It is a horny membrane, which resists the action
                    of acids. Its deep surface is ’pitted for the ends of the enamel rods. As the
                    crown of the tooth comes into use, Nasmyth’s membrane is worn off, and the
                    enamel itself by prolonged use is thinned and worn down. In persons who live on
                    hard food, that requires much mastication, it is not uncommon to find the
                    grinding surface of the crowns of the molar teeth worn down quite flat, and the
                    dentine exposed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cement,</hi><hi rend="italic">Crusta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Petrosa,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tooth Bone,</hi> forms a thin covering for
                    the surface of the fang of a tooth, and extends upwards to the neck. It is of a
                    yellowish colour, and is usually thickest at the point of the fang; though in
                    the multifanged teeth it sometimes forms a thickish mass at the point of
                    convergence of the fangs. It possesses the structure of bone, and consists of a
                    lamellated matrix with perforating fibres, lacunae, and canaliculi. The lacunae
                    are irregular in size and mode of arrangement, and vary also in the number of
                    the canaliculi proceeding from them. Sometimes the canaliculi anastomose with
                    the branched terminations of the dentine tubes. In the thin cement situated near
                    the neck of the tooth the lacunae are usually absent. If the jaw with its
                    contained teeth be softened in acid, and sections be made so as to show the
                    teeth <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> there is no difficulty in recognizing the
                    cellular masses of nucleated protoplasm within the lacunae, which resemble in
                    appearance the corresponding structures in the adjacent bone. Haversian canals
                    are only found in the cement when it acquires unusual thickness. In old teeth he
                    cement thickens at the tip of the fang, and often closes up the orifice into the
                    pulp cavity; the passage of the nerves and vessels into the pulp is thus cut
                    off, and the nutrition of the tooth being at an end, it loosens in its socket
                    and drops out.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Osteo-dentine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vaso-dentine</hi> do
                    not exist as normal structures in human teeth, though they occur in various
                    animals. They may appear, however, as abnormalities in the human teeth, and are
                    found on the inner wall of the pulp cavity. Osteo-dentine consists of dentine
                    structure, intermingled with lacunae and canaliculi. If vascular canals, like
                    the Haversian canals of bòne, are formed in it, then the name vaso-dentine is
                    applied.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pulp</hi> of the tooth is one of its most important
                    constituents. It is a soft substance occupying the cavity in the dentine, or the
                    pulp cavity, and is destroyed in a macerated and dried tooth. It consists of a
                    very delicate gelatinous connective tissue, in which numerous cells are
                    imbedded. Those which lie at the periphery of the pulp are in contact with the
                    dentine wall, and form a layer, named by Kölliker the <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">eboris.</hi> As the cells of this layer play a
                    part in the formation of the dentine similar to that performed by the osteoblast
                    cells in the formation of bone, Waldeyer has named them <hi rend="italic"
                    >odontoblasts.</hi> The odontoblasts are elongated in form, and their protoplasm
                    gives off several slender processes; some enter dentine tubes to form the soft
                    dentinal fibres already described; one passes towards the centre of the pulp, to
                    become connected with more deeply-placed pulp cells; whilst others are given off
                    laterally to join contiguous cells of the odontoblast layer. The pulp contains
                    the nerves and blood-vessels of the tooth, which pass into the pulp, through the
                    foramen at the point of the fang. The vessels form a beautiful plexus of
                    capillaries. The nerves are sensory branches of the fifth cranial nerve. They
                    enter the pulp as medullated fibres, which divide into very fine non-medullated
                    fibres, that form a network in the peripheral portions of the pulp. The pulp of
                    the tooth is the remains of the formative papilla, out of which the dentine or
                    ivory has been produced. In adult teeth changes that lead to the production of
                    osteo-dentine and vaso-dentine may take place in it. Through the dentinal fibres
                    an organic connection is preserved between the dentine and the puip, and <pb

                    some states of a tooth is not necessarily due to the passage of nerves into it,
                    but to its connection with the sensitive dentine pulp.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development of the Teeth.—</hi> In studying the development of
                    the teeth, not only has the mode of formation of the individual teeth to be
                    examined, but the order of succession of the different teeth both in the
                    temporary and permanent series.</p>
                <p>The teeth are developed in the mucous membrane or gum, which covers the edges of
                    the jaws of the young embryo, and their formation is due to a special
                    differentiation in the arrangement and structure of portions of the epithelial
                    and sub-epithelial tissues of that membrane. The enamel is produced from the
                    epithelium, and the dentine, pulp, and cement from the sub-epithelial connective

                    consideied. If a vertical section be made th rough the mouth of a young human
                    embryo about the sixth or seventh week, its cavity may be seen to be lined by a
                    stratified epithelium, continuous with the layer of stratified epiblast forming
                    the cuticle of the face. Along the edge of the gum, corresponding in position to
                    that of the future jaws, the epithelium is of some thickness, and an involution
                    of the epithelium into the subjacent connective tissue has taken place. Owing to
                    this involution a narrow furrow or groove in the connective tissue is produced,
                    which constitutes the <hi rend="italic">primitive dental groove</hi> of Goodsir.
                    This groove is not, however, an empty furrow, but is occupied by the involuted
                    epithelium. The sub-epithelial connective tissue is soft and gelatinous, and
                    abounds in corpuscles, which are especially abundant in the connective tissue at
                    the bottom of the groove, where the <hi rend="italic">dental papillae</hi> are
                    produced. These papillae are formed, at the bottom of the groove, by an
                    increased development and growth of the corpuscles óf the subjacent connective
                    tissue. The base of each papilla is continuous with the-subjacent connective
                    tissue, and the apex projects into the deeper parts of the involuted epithelium.
                    As a papilla increases in breadth and length the groove widens an&lt;f deepens,
                    and the involuted epithelium, increasing in quantity, expands over the apex and
                    sides of the papilla, so as to form a hood-like covering or cap for it. The cap
                    of epithelium constitutes the <hi rend="italic">enamel organ,</hi> whilst the
                    papilla is the <hi rend="italic">formative pulp</hi> for the dentine and
                    permanent pulp. Whilst these changes are taking place in the epithelium and the
                    connective tissue at the bottom of the groove, no commensurate widening occurs
                    at its upper part, which remains for a time relatively narrow, but retains
                    within it a narrow string of epithelial cells, continuous on the one hand with
                    the epithelial lining of the mouth, and on the other with the enamel organ. This
                    epithelial string forms the <hi rend="italic">nedc of the enamel organ.</hi>
                    After a time, however, the growth of the connective tissue forming the lips of
                    the primitive groove causes the neck of the enamel organ to atrophy, so that all
                    communication between the enamel organ and the superficial epithelium is cut
                    off; and the embryo tooth, being now completely inclosed in a cavity or sac,
                    formed by the gelatinous connective tissue of the gum, has entered on what
                    Goodsir termed its <hi rend="italic">saccular</hi> stage of development.</p>
                <p>When inclosed in its sac the embryo tooth, though perfectly soft, acquires a
                    shape which enables one to recognize to what group of teeth it belongs. After a
                    time it begins to harden and to exhibit the characteristic tooth structure.</p>
                <p>The dental papilla is more vascular than the surrounding connective tissue, from
                    the blood-vessels of which its vessels are derived. The papilla abounds in
                    cells, which are, in the first instance, rounded and ovoid in shape. Changes
                    then take place in the cells situated at its periphery, which become elongated
                    and branched, and form layers of cells (odontoblasts). Calcification of the
                    protoplasm of these odontoblasts then oc curs, and the peripheral layer of the
                    dentine is produced. In contact with the inner surface of the thin film of
                    dentine, a second layer of odontoblast cells is then arranged, which in their
                    turn calcify, and as the process goes on in successive layers of odontoblasts,
                    the entire thickness of the matrix of the dentine and the dentinal sheaths are
                    produced. But the process of calcification does not apparently take place
                    throughout the whole thickness of the protoplasm of the odontoblasts, for, as
                    Waldeyer pointed out, the axial part of the cells remains undifferentiated as
                    the soft dentinal fibrils of the dentine tubes. As these changes are going on in
                    the peripheral layers of the odontoblasts, the central part of the dental
                    papilla increases in quantity, apparently by a proliferation of its cells; nerve
                    fibres are developed in it, and it persists as the soft pulp of the tooth. The
                    papilla of the tooth has essentially, therefore, the same relation to the
                    formation of dentine that the cellulo-vascular contents of the medullary spaces,
                    in intra-cartilaginous ossification, have to the formation of bone. In both
                    instances the hard matrix is due to a special differentiation of the protoplasm
                    of the formative cells; the dentinal fibrils are the equivalent structures to
                    the soft contents of the lacunae and canaliculi, and the persistent pulp is
                    equivalent to the cellulo-vascular contents of the Haversian canals.</p>
                <p>Prior to the embryo tooth becoming sacculated, changes had taken place in the
                    enamel organ. Those cells of the enamel organ which lie next the dental papilla
                    are continuous, through the neck of.the enamel organ, with the deepest layer of
                    cells of the oral epithelium, which cells are elongated columns set
                    perpendicularly to the surface on which they rest. Similarly the cells of the
                    deepest layer of the enamel organ are columns set perpendicularly to the surface
                    of the dental papilla. They undergo a greater elongation, and form six-sided
                    prismatic cells, which Kölliker has named the <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">enamel epithelium.</hi> The cells of the most superficial
                    layer of the enamel organ lie in contact with the vascular connective tissue
                    which encloses the embryo tooth. They form the <hi rend="italic">external
                    epithelium</hi> of the enamel organ, and slender papillary prolongations of the
                    connective tissue frequently project into this epithelial layer. The cells of
                    the enamel organ, situated between its external and its internal epithelium,
                    become stellate, and form with each other an anastomosing network of cells like
                    those sometimes seen in the gelatinous connective tissue.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n253/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0253-0236"/>
                <p>After the tooth has become sacculated, and coincident with the transformation of
                    the odontoblast cells of the dental papilla into dentine, calcification begins
                    in the elongated prismatic cells of the internal or enamel epithelium; their
                    protoplasm becomes calcified, and they become the rods or prisms of the enamel.
                    As the hardening takes place from the periphery to the centre of each cell, the
                    axial portion may, as Tomes pointed out, remain soft for some time in the axis
                    of the enamel rod. With the increase in length, and with the calcification of
                    the cells of the enamel epithelium, the stellate gelatinous cells disappear, and
                    the outer ends of the enamel rods come in contact with the cells of the external
                    enamel epithelium. By some observers the external epithelium is supposed to
                    disappear without undergoing any special differentiation, but by others it is
                    believed to undergo conversion into Nasmyth’s membrane.</p>
                <p>In this manner the crown of a tooth is formed, and it is lodged in a membranous
                    sac formed by the differentiation into a fibro-vascular membrane of the
                    surrounding connective tissue. Whilst within its sac, the crown of the tooth
                    possesses the characteristic form of the group of teeth to which it belongs.
                    After the calcification of the enamel rods is completed, it can undergo no
                    further change either in shape or in increase of size.</p>
                <p>Whilst the crown of the tooth is being formed, ossification of the jaws has been
                    going on, and the tooth, with its membranous sac, has become lodged in an
                    alveolus or socket in the jaw, which alveolus is closed in by the gum.</p>
                <p>In order that the crown of the tooth may come into use as a masticatory organ, it
                    has to be elevated to the level of the gum, which is absorbed by the pressure,
                    and the crown then erupts into the cavity of the mouth. The process of eruption
                    is due to the development of the fang, which, as it grows in length, elevates
                    the crown of the tooth and forces it outward. The dentine of the fang is
                    developed from the odontoblast cells of the pulp in a manner similar to that
                    already described for the development of the dentine of the crown. The cement or
                    crusta petrosa is developed from the connective tissue lining the alveolus,
                    which forms the alveolo-dental periosteum. It is therefore an ossification in
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>As the temporary or milk teeth precede the permanent teeth, their papillae are
                    naturally the first to form. The series of milk-papillae are not, however,,
                    simultaneously produced. From the observations of Goodsir, it has been shown
                    that the milk-papilla of the anterior molar in the upper jaw appears about the
                    seventh week; then the canine papilla, the two incisor papillae, and the
                    posterior molar papilla are sucessively formed, the last making its appearance
                    about the end of the tenth week. The dental papillae in the upper jaw
                    immediately precede the papillae of the corresponding teeth in the lower
                    jaw.</p>
                <p>The eruption of the milk teeth into the mouth does not begin to take place until
                    the latter half of the first year of extra-uterine life, and is not completed
                    until betweeen the second and third year. Though variations occur in the date of
                    eruption of each tooth in different children, it may be stated that the incisors
                    usually appear from the seventh to the ninth month, the anterior molars from the
                    twelfth to the sixteenth month, the canines during the seventeenth or eighteenth
                    month, the posterior milk molars from two to two and a half years. The milk
                    teeth begin to be shed about the sixth year by the dropping out of the incisors.
                    The last to be shed are the canines, which do not fall out till the tenth or
                    eleventh year. The shedding of the milk teeth is preceded by the absorption of
                    the fangs. This is effected, as was satisfactorily shown by J.</p>
                <p>Tomes, by the agency of a group of cells situated at the bottom of the sockets.
                    As these cells occasion absorption of the tooth tissue, similar to that
                    occurring in the bone tissue from the action of the large multi-nucleated
                    osteo-klast cells, they may appropriately be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >odonto-klasts.</hi></p>
                <p>The development of the <hi rend="italic">permanent teeth</hi> will now be
                    considered. In the description of the arrangement of the teeth it has been
                    pointed out that the number of teeth in the permanent set exceeds that of the
                    temporary set. The permanent incisors and canines come into the place of the
                    temporary incisors and canines, and the permanent bicuspids succeed the
                    temporary molars, but the permanent molars have no milk predecessors, and are
                    superadded at the back of the dental series.</p>
                <p>The development of the <hi rend="italic">successional permanent teeth,</hi> which
                    are the ten anterior teeth in each jaw, will first be examined. Prior to the
                    period when the lips of the primitive dental groove meet, to produce the
                    saccular stage of dentition of the severa’ temporary teeth, an indentation, or
                    furrow, takes place in the connective tissue adjoining the string of epithelial
                    cells which form the neck of the enamel organ. This furrow constitutes what
                    Goodsir termed the <hi rend="italic">cavity of reserve,</hi> and it is filled up
                    by epithelial cells continuous with the epithelium of the neck of the enamel
                    organ. As a cavity of reserve is formed immediately behind (t'.β., on the
                    lingual side of) each milk tooth, they are ten in number in each jaw, and,
                    except that for the anterior molar, are formed successively from before
                    backwards.</p>
                <p>The cavities of reserve are concerned in the production of the permanent
                    successional teeth, and each temporary tooth is replaced by the permanent tooth
                    formed in connection with the cavity of reserve situated immediately behind it
                    (fig 21).. The cavities of reserve become elongated, and widened, and pass above
                    the temporary teeth in the upper jaw, and below those in the lower jaw. At the
                    bottom of each a dental papilla forms, the apex of which indentates and becomes
                    covered by the epithelium contained in the cavity, which forms a cap for the
                    papilla, and constitutes the enamel organ for the permanent tooth. The cavity
                    becomes completely closed by the growth of the surrounding connective tissue,
                    and the embryo permanent tooth becomes sacculated. The process of calcification
                    then goes on, in both the enamel organ and dental papilla, in a manner similar
                    to that already described in the temporary teeth. The permanent teeth then
                    become lodged in sockets in the jaw distinct from those of the temporary teeth.
                    The sac of each permanent tooth remains connected with the fibrous tissue of the
                    gum by a slender fibrous band, or <hi rend="italic">gubernaculum,</hi> which
                    passes through a hole in the jaw immediately behind the corresponding milk
                    tooth. Before the successional permanent tooth erupts, not only should the
                    temporary tooth be shed, but the bony partition between their respective sockets
                    must be absorbed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">supeτadded,</hi><hi rend="italic">permanent teeth,</hi> or
                    permanent molars, three in number on each side, lie behind the successional
                    teeth. Their mode of origin is similar to that of the temporary teeth. The
                    primitive groove, occupied by an involution of the epithelial covering of the
                    gum, is prolonged backwards. Three dental papillae successively appear at the
                    bottom of this groove, and the epithelium covering each papilla forms its enamel
                    organ. Legros and Magitot, however, state that the second permanent molar arises
                    in connection with a diverticulum (cavity of reserve) proceeding from the
                    epithelial string of the enamel organ of the first permanent molar, and that the
                    wisdom tooth is formed in connection with a similar diverticulum from the second
                    permanent molar. The embryo tooth becomes sacculated, and goes through the
                    process of calcification similar to what has been described in the other teeth
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0254-0237"/> The germ of the first permanent molar appears
                    about the sixteenth week of embryo life; that of the second permanent molar not
                    until about the seventh month after birth; Whilst that of the wisdom tooth is
                    not formed until about the sixth year The crown of the first molar is the first
                    of the permanent teeth to erupt into the mouth, which it usually does in the
                    sixth year. The incisors appear when the child is seven or eight; the bicuspids
                    when it is nine or ten; the canines about twelve; the second molars about
                    thirteen; and the wisdom teeth from seventeen to twenty five.</p>
                <p>In his dentition man is diphyodont as regards his incisor, canine, and premolar
                    teeth, but monophyodont in the molar series.</p>
                <p>From the description of the development of the teeth, it will have been seen that
                    a tooth is made up of three hard tissues—enamel, dentine, and· cement—and of the
                    soft vascular and nervous pulp. These tissues are not developed from one layer
                    only of the blastoderm. The enamel is of epiblast origin, whilst the dentine,
                    cement, and pulp are derived from the mesoblast. A tooth in its fundamental
                    development, as was long ago pointed out by Goodsir, must be referred to the
                    same class of organs as the hairs and feathers. The enamel of the tooth, like
                    the hair, is produced by a differentiation of the involuted epithelium of the
                    epiblast, whilst the dentine and pulp resemble the papilla of the hair, in
                    proceeding from the mesóblast. The tooth-sac, like the hair-follicle, is also of
                    mesoblast origin. Whether the cement, as Robin and Magitot have described, be
                    developed by means of a special <hi rend="italic">cement organ,</hi> in the
                    interior of the tooth-sac, or be formed, as has been stated in this description,
                    by the alveolo-dental periosteum, it is on either view derived from the
                    mesoblast. As to the origin of Nasmyth’s membrane, there is a difference of
                    opinion; some regard it as a special cornification of the external cells of the
                    enamel organ, in which case it would be from the epiblast; whilst others
                    consider it to be continuous with though structurally different from, the
                    cement—homologous, therefore, with the layer of cement, which in the horse,
                    ruminants, and some other mammals covers the surface of the crowns of the
                    teeth.</p>
                <p>The tissues of a tooth have not all the same importance in the structure of a
                    tooth. The dentine is apparently always present, but the enamel, or the enamel
                    and cement, may be absent in the teeth of some animals. For example, the tusks
                    of the elephant and narwhal, and the teeth of the Edentata, are without enamel,
                    and in the Rodentia enamel is present on only the anterior surface of the
                    incisors. But though the enamel is not developed, or forms only an imperfect
                    covering for the crowns of these teeth, yet an enamel organ is formed in the
                    embryo jaws. In 1872 W. Turner described a structure homologous with the enamel
                    organ in relation with each of the dental papillae in the lower jaw of a foetal
                    narwhal; but this organ did not exhibit a differentiation into the three
                    epithelial layers, such as occurs in those teeth in which enamel is developed.
                    Since then C. S. Tomes has seen an enamel organ in the embryo armadillo, and has
                    also pointed out that, in teeth generally, enamel organs exist, quite
                    irrespective of whether enamel subsequently does or does not form.</p>
                <p>But further, the involution of the oral epithelium, and the coincident formation
                    of a primitive groove, take place not only where the teeth subsequently arise,
                    but along the whole curvature of the future jaws; whilst the production of
                    dental papillae is restricted to the spots where the teeth are formed. Hence it
                    would seem that the inflection of the oral epithelium is not so essential to the
                    development of a tooth as the formation of a papilla. The inflected epithelium
                    marks only a preliminary stage, and it may or may not be transformed into tooth
                    structure. But that which is essential to the formation of a tooth is the
                    production of the papilla which appears at the bottom of the primitive groove.
