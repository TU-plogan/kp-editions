                    derived from the Greek δeκα, ten; and whether the term was first used among the

                    “Decurius” may be found in early writers used to signify the same thing as
                    “decanus,” which shows that the word and the idea signified by it were
                    originally borrowed from the old Roman military system.</p>

                <p>The earliest mention which occurs of an “archipresbyter” seems to be in the 4th
                    epistle of St Jerome to Rusticus, in which he says that a cathedral church
                    should possess one bishop, one archipresbyter, and one archdeacon. Liberatus
                    also <hi rend="italic">(Breviar.</hi> c. xiv.) speaks of the office of
                    archipresbyter in a manner which, as Bingham says, enables one to understand
                    what the nature of his duties and position was. And he thinks that those are
                    right who hold that the archipresbyters were the same as the deans of our
                    cathedral churches. Stillingfleet <hi rend="italic">(Irenic.</hi> part ii. c. 7)
                    says of the archipresbyters that “the memory of them is preserved still in
                    cathedral churches, in the chapters there, where the dean was nothing else but
                    the archipresbyter; and both dean and prebendaries were to be assistant to the
                    bishop in the regulating the church affairs belonging to the city, while the
                    churches were contained therein.” Bingham, however, following Liberatus,
                    describes the office of the archipresbyter to have been next to that of the
                    bishop, the head of the presbyteral college, and the functions to have consisted
                    in administering all matters pertaining to the church in the absence of the
                    bishop. But this does not describe accurately the office of dean in an English
                    cathedral church. The dean is indeed second to the bishop in rank and dignity,
                    and he is the head of the presbyteral college or chapter; but his functions in
                    no wise consist in administering any affairs in the absence of the bishop. There
                    may be some matters connected with the ordering of the internal arrangements of
                    our cathedral churches, respecting which it may be considered a doubtful point
                    whether the authority of the bishop or that of the dean is supreme. But the
                    consideration of any such question leads at once to the due theoretical
                    distinction between the two. With regard to matters spiritual, properly and
                    strictly so called, the bishop is supreme in the cathedral as far as—and no
                    farther than—he is supreme in his diocese generally. With regard to matters
                    material and temporal, as concerning the fabric of the cathedral, the
                    arrangement and conduct of the services, and the management of the property of
                    the chapter, &amp;c., the dean (not excluding the due authority of the other
                    members of the chapter, but speaking with reference to the bishop) is supreme.
                    And the cases in which a doubt might arise on the point are those in which the
                    material arrangements of the fabric or of the services may be thought to involve
                    doctrinal considerations.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic writers on the subject say that there are two sorts of deans
                    in the church—the deans of cathedral churches, and the rural deans—as has
                    continued to be the case in the English Church. And the probability would seem
                    to be that the former were the successors and representatives of the monastic
                    decurions, the latter of the inspectors of “ten” parishes jn the primitive
                    secular church. It is thought by some that the rural dean is the lineal
                    successor of the <hi rend="italic">chorepiscopus,</hi> who in the early church
                    was the assistant of the bishop, discharging most, if not all, episcopal
                    functions in the rural districts of the diocese. But upon the whole the
                    probability is otherwise. Beveridge, Cave, Bingham, and Basnage all hold that
                    the <hi rend="italic">chorepiscopi</hi> were true bishops, though Romanist
                    theologians for the most part have maintained that they were simple priests. But
                    if the <hi rend="italic">chorepiscopus</hi> has any representative in the church
                    of the present day, it seems more likely that the archdeacon is such rather than
                    the dean.</p>
                <p>The ordinary use of the term dean, as regards secular bodies of persons, would
                    lead to the belief that the oldest member of a chapter had, as a matter of
                    right, or at least of usage, become the dean thereof. But Bingham (lib. ii. ch.
                    18) very conclusively shows that such was at no time the case; as is also
                    further indicated by the maxim to the effect that the dean must be selected from
                    the body of the chapter—“<hi rend="italic">Unus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gremio tantum</hi><hi rend="italic">potest</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eligi et promoveri ad decanatus</hi><hi rend="italic">dignitatem.”</hi> The
                    duties of the dean in a Roman Catholic cathedral are to preside over the
                    chapter, to declare the decisions to which the chapter may have in its debates
                    arrived by plurality of voices, to exercise inspection over the choir, over the
                    conduct of the capitular body, and over the discipline and regulations of the
                    church; and to celebrate divine service on occasion of the greater festivals of
                    the church in the absence, or inability, of the bishop. With the exception of
                    the last clause the same statement may be made as to the duties and functions of
                    the deans of our cathedral churches.</p>
                <p>Deans had also a place in the judicial system of the Lombard kings in the 8th,
                    9th, and 10th centuries. But the office indicated by that term, so used, seems
                    to have been a very subordinate one; and the name was in all probability adopted
                    with immediate reference to the etymological meaning of the word,—a person
                    having authority over ten (in this case apparently) families. Muratori, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Italian Antiquities,</hi> speaks of the resemblance between
                    the <hi rend="italic">saltarii</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sylvani</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">decani,</hi> and shows that the former had authority in the
                    rural districts, and the latter in towns, or at least in places where the
                    population was sufficiently close for them to have authority over ten families.
                    Nevertheless, a document cited by Muratori from the archives of the canons of
                    Modena, and dated in the year 813, recites the names of several “deaneries” <hi
                    rend="italic">(decania),</hi> and thus shows that the authority of the dean
                    extended over a certain circumscription of territory.</p>
                <p>In the case of the “dean of the sacred college,” the connection between the
                    application of the term and the etymology of it is not so evident as in the
                    foregoing instances of its use; nor is it by any means clear how and when the
                    idea of seniority was first attached to the word. This office is held by the
                    oldest cardinal— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> he who has been longest in the
                    enjoyment of the purple, not he who is oldest in years—who is usually, but not
                    necessarily or always, the bishop of Ostia and Velletri. Perhaps the use of the
                    word “dean,” as signifying simply the eldest member of any corporation or body
                    of men, may have been first adopted from its application to that high dignitary.
                    The dean of the sacred college is in the ecclesiastical hierarchy second to the
                    Pope alone. His privileges and special functions are very many; a compendious
                    account of the principal of them may be found in the work of Moroni, vol. xix.
                    p. 168.</p>
                <p>There are four sorts of deans of whom the law of England takes notice. 1. The
                    dean and chapter are a council subordinate to the bishop, assistant to him in
                    matters spiritual relating to religion, and in matters temporal relating to the
                    temporalities of the bishopric. The dean and chapter are a corporation, and the
                    dean himself is a corporation sole. Deans are said to be either of the old or of
                    the new foundation—the latter being those created and regulated after the
                    dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII The deans of the old foundation
                    before 3 and 4 Vict. c. 113 were elected by the chapter on the king’s <hi
                    rend="italic">congé</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >elire</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the deans of the new foundation (and,
                    since the Act, of the old foundation also) are appointed by the king’s letters
                    patent. It was at one time held that a layman might be dean; but by 13 and 14
                    Charles II. c. 4, priest’s orders are a necessary qualification. Deaneries are
                    sinecures in the old sense, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they are without cure
                    of souls. The chapter formerly consisted of canons and prebendaries, the dean
                    being the head and an integral part of the corporation. By 3 and 4 Vict. c. 113,
                    it is enacted that “all the members of the chapter except the dean, in every
                    collegiate and cathedral church in England, and in the cathedral churches of St
                    David and Llandaff, shall be styled canons.” By the same Act the dean is
                    required to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n24/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0024-0015"/> be in residence eight months, and the canons
                    three months, in every year. The bishop is visitor of the dean and chapter. 2.
                    The dean of peculiars “hath no chapter, yet is presentative, and hath cure of
                    souls; he hath a <hi rend="italic">peculiar,</hi> and is not subject to the
                    visitation of the bishop.” 3. The third dean “hath no cure of souls, but hath a
                    court and a <hi rend="italic">peculiar,</hi> in which he holdeth plea and
                    jurisdiction of all such ecclesiastical matters as come within his peculiar.
                    Such is the Dean of the Arches, who is the judge of the court of the arches, the
                    chief court and consistory of the archbishop of Canterbury, so called of Bow
                    Church, where this court was ever wont to be held.” The parish of Bow and twelve
                    others are within the peculiar jurisdiction of the archbishop in spiritual
                    causes, and exempted out of the bishop of London’s jurisdiction. 4. Rural deans
                    are clergymen whose duty is described as being “to execute the bishop’s
                    processes and to inspect the lives and manners of the clergy and people within
                    their jurisdiction” (see Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    Law).</hi></p>
                <p>In the colleges of the English universities one of the fellows usually holds the
                    office of “dean,” and is specially charged with the discipline, as distinguished
                    from the teaching functions of the tutors.</p>
