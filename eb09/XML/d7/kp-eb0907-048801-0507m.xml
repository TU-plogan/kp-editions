                    name south, and acquired by marriage the estate of Canons Ashby, is said to have
                    known Erasmus, and to have been so proud of the great scholar’s friendship that
                    he gave the name of Erasmus to his eldest son. The name Erasmus was borne by the
                    poet’s father, the third son of Sir Erasmus Dryden. The leanings and connections
                    of the family were Puritan and anti-monarchical. Sir Erasmus Dryden went to
                    prison rather than pay loan money to Charles I.; the poet’s uncle, Sir John
                    Dryden, and his father Erasmus, served on Government commissions during the
                    Commonwealth. His mother’s family, the Pickerings, were still more prominent on
                    the Puritan side. Sir Gilbert Pickering, his cousin, was chamberlain to the
                    Protector, and was made a peer in 1658.</p>
                <p>Dryden’s education was such as became a scion of these respectable families of
                    squires and rectors, among whom the chance contact with Erasmus had left a
                    certain tradition of scholarship. His father, whose own fortune, added to his
                    wife’s, the daughter of the rector of Aidwinkle All Saints, was not large, and
                    whose family, of whom the poet was the eldest, amounted to fourteen, procured
                    him admission to Westminster School as a king’s scholar, under the famous Dr
                    Busby. Some elegiac verses which Dryden wrote there on the death of a young Lord
                    Hastings, in 1649, had the distinction of being published in a volume called <hi
                    rend="italic">Lacrymae</hi><hi rend="italic">Musarum,</hi> among other elegies
                    by “divers persons of nobility and worth” in commemoration of the same event. He
                    appeared soon after again in print, among writers of commendatory verses to a
                    friend of his, John Hoddesdon, who published a little volume of religious poetry
                    in 1650. Dryden’s contribution is signed “John Dryden of Trinity C.,” he having
                    gone up from Westminster to Cambridge in May 1650. He was elected a scholar of
                    Trinity on the Westminster foundation in October of the same year, and took his
                    degree of B.A. in 1654. The only recorded incident of his college residence is
                    some unexplained act of contumacy to the vice-master, for which he was “put out
                    of commons” and “gated” for a fortnight. No inference can be built upon this as
                    to Dryden’s habits at the university. Contumacy to authorities was not a feature
                    in his later life. His father died in 1654, leaving him master of two-thirds of
                    a small estate near Blakesley, worth about £60 a year. The next three years he
                    is said to have spent at Cambridge. It was then probably that he laid the
                    foundation of that habit of learned discussion of literary methods which is so
                    remarkable a feature in the prefaces to his plays and poems. Not content with
                    doing a thing, like writers who are suddenly placed under the necessity of
                    writing, Dryden must always be arguing as to how it ought to be done, pushing on
                    argumentative justification in advance of execution. Whether or not he spent the
                    three years before 1657 at Cambridge, there can be little doubt, judging from
                    internal evidence, that he spent them somewhere in study; for his first
                    considerable poem bears indisputable marks of scholarly habits, as well as of a
                    command of verse that could not have been acquired without practice.</p>
                <p>The middle of 1657 is given as the date of his leaving the university to take up
                    his residence in London. In one of his many subsequent literary quarrels, it was
                    said by Shadwell that he had been clerk to Sir Gilbert Pickering, his cousin,
                    the favourite of Cromwell; and nothing could be more likely than that he
                    obtained some employment under his powerful cousin when he came to London. He
                    first emerged from obscurity with his <hi rend="italic">Heroic Stanzas</hi> to
                    the memory of the Protector, who died September 3, 1658. That these stanzas
                    should have made him a name as a poet does not appear surprising when we compare
                    them with Waller’s verses on the same occasion. Dryden took some time to
                    consider them, and it was impossible that they should not give an impression of
                    his intellectual strength. Donne was his model; it is obvious that both his ear
                    and his imagination were saturated with Donne’s elegiac strains when he wrote;
                    yet when we look beneath the surface, we find unmistakable traces that the pupil
                    was not without decided theories that ran counter to the practice of the master.
                    It is plainly not by accident that each stanza contains one clear-cut brilliant
                    point. The poem is an academic exercise, and it seems to be animated by an
                    undercurrent of strong contumacious protest against the irregularities tolerated
                    by the authorities. Dryden had studied the ancient classics for himself, and
                    their method of uniformity and elaborate finish commended itself to his robust
                    and orderly mind. In itself the poem is a magnificent tribute to the memory of
                    Cromwell. Now that the glittering style of the so-called “metaphysical poets”
                    has gone very far out of fashion, it requires an effort, a deliberate dismissal
                    of prejudice, to enjoy such a poem. A poet writing now on such a man would
                    present his grandeur in a much more direct and simple way. Yet judged in the
                    spirit of its own style, Dryden’s is a noble poem. The recognition of Cromwell’s
                    greatness is full and ample. The thought in each stanza, the inclosing design of
                    each of the parts of the edifice, is massive and imposing, although the
                    massiveness is not presented in its naked simplicity, so as to hold the foremost
                    place in the eye—the gaze being arrested by glittering accidents, so that the
                    essential grandeur of the mass is disguised and diminished. We are not invited
                    to dwell upon the grand outline; we are not called upon to surrender ourselves
                    to its simple impressiveness; but it is there, although the author does not
                    insist upon it, and rather deprecates it, waves it off, and challenges our
                    admiration of some artificial centre of attraction. It is the ornamental centre
                    upon which the art of the poet has laboured, not the effect of the massive
                    whole; still there is loftiness and nobility in the scope of the work, if our
                    prejudices in favour of a less adorned workmanship permit us to feel it.</p>
                <p>From a moral point of view, Dryden’s next appearance as a poet is not creditable.
                    To those who regard the poet as a seer with a sacred mission, and refuse the
                    name altogether to a literary manufacturer to order, it comes with a certain
                    shock to find Dryden, the hereditary Puritan, the panegyrist of Cromwell,
                    hailing the return of King Charles in <hi rend="italic">Âstroea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Redux,</hi> deploring his long absence, and proclaiming the
                    despair with which he had seen “the rebel thrive, the loyal crost.” From a
                    literary point of view also, <hi rend="italic">Àstroea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Redux</hi> is very inferior to the <hi rend="italic">Heroic Stanzas;</hi>
                    Dryden had need of Waller’s clever excuse that it is easier to praise a bad man
                    than a good, because the essence of poetry is fiction. And it was not merely in
                    thus hastening to welcome the coming guest, and recant all praise of his rival,
                    that Dryden showed a shamelessly accommodating spirit, and placed himself in
                    such unpleasant contrast to the greater poet who was waiting his fate in all but
                    friendless blindness. It might have been expected of one with his Puritan
                    connections and scholarly training that, if he purposed making a living by the
                    stage, which was restored with Charles, his literary as well as his moral
                    conscience would have required him to make some effort to raise or at least not
                    to lower its tone. But Dryden seems to have had no higher ambition than to make
                    some money by his pen. He naturally first thought of tragedy,—his own genius, as
                    he has informed ns, inclining him rather to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0508-0489"/> that species of composition; and in the first
                    year of the Restoration he wrote a tragedy on the fate of the duke of Guise. But
                    some friends advised him that its construction was not suited to the
                    requirements of the stage, so he put it aside, and used only one scene of the
                    original play later on, when he again attempted the subject with a more
                    practised hand. Having failed to write a suitable tragedy, he next turned his
                    attention to comedy, although, as he admitted, he had little natural turn for
                    it. He was very frank afterwards in explaining his reasons for writing comedy.
                    “I confess,” he said, in a short essay in his own defence, printed before <hi
                    rend="italic">Tlιe Indian Emperor, “my</hi> chief endeavours are to delight the
                    age in which I live. If the humour of this be for low comedy, small accidents,
                    and raillery, I will force my genius to obey it, though with more reputation I
                    could write in verse. I know I am not so fitted by nature to write comedy; I
                    want that gaiety of humour which is required to it. My conversation is slow and
                    dull; my humour saturnine and reserved; in short, I am none of those who
                    endeavour to break jests in company or make repartees. So that those who decry
                    my comedies do me no injury, except it be in point of profit; reputation in them
                    is the last thing to which I shall pretend.” This, of course, was said by Dryden
                    standing at bay; there was some bravado, but also a great deal of frank truth in
                    it. He was really as well as ostentatiously a playwright; the age demanded
                    comedies, and he endeavoured to supply the kind of comedy that the age demanded.
                    His first attempt was unsuccessful. Bustle, intrigue, and coarsely humorous
                    dialogue seemed to him to be part of the popular demand; and, looking about for
                    a plot, he found something to suit him in a Spanish source, and wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">The Wild Gallant.</hi> The play was acted in February 1C63, by
                    Killigrew’s company in, Vere Street. It was not a success, although the most
                    farcical incident received a certain interest and probability from a story which
                    was current at the time. That a student, fresh from his library, trying to hit
                    the taste of the groundlings with ribald farce, should make the ingredients too
                    strong even for their palates, was but natural. Pepys showed good judgment in
                    pronouncing the play “so poor a thing as ever I saw in my life.” That such a
                    play should be written by Dryden, and acted in by one of the daughters of
                    Stephen Marshall, must have been a bitter thought for Puritanism at the time.
                    Dryden never learned moderation in his humour; there is a student’s clumsiness
                    and extravagance in his indecency; the plays of Etherege, a man of the world,
                    have not the uncouth riotousness of Dryden’s. Of this he seems to have been
                    conscious, for when the play was revived, in 1667, he complained in the epilogue
                    of the difficulty of comic wit, and admitted the right of a common audience to
                    judge of the wit’s success. Dryden, indeed, took a lesson from the failure of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Wild Gallant;</hi> his next comedy, <hi rend="italic">The
                    liival Ladies,</hi> also founded on a Spanish plot, produced before the end of
                    1663, was correctly described by Pepys as “a very innocent and most pretty witty
                    play,” though there was much in it which the taste of our time would consider
                    indelicate. But he never quite conquered his tendency to extravagance. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Wild Gallant</hi> was not the only victim. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Assignation, or Love in a Nunnery,</hi> produced in 1673, shared the same
                    fate; and even as late as 1680, when he had had twenty years’ experience to
                    guide him, <hi rend="italic">Limberham, or the. Kind Keeper,</hi> was
                    prohibited, after three representations, as being too indecent for the stage.
                    Dislike to indecency we are apt to think a somewhat ludicrous pretext to be made
                    by Restoration playgoers, and probably there was some other reason for the
                    sacrifice of <hi rend="italic">Limberham;</hi> still there is a certain
                    savageness in the spirit of Dryden’s indecency which we do not find in his most
                    licentious contemporaries. The undisciplined force of the man carried him to an
                    excess from which more dexterous writers held back.</p>
                <p>After the production of <hi rend="italic">The Rival Ladies</hi> in 1663, Dryden
                    assisted Sir Robert Howard in the composition of a tragedy in heroic verse, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Indian Queen,</hi> produced with great splendour in January
                    1664. It was probably through this collaboration that Dryden made the
                    acquaintance of Lady Elizabeth Howard, Sir Robert’s sister, whom he married on
                    the 1st of December 1663. Lady Elizabeth’s reputation was somewhat compromised
                    before this union, and, though she brought some small addition to the poet’s
                    income, she does not seem to have added to his happiness. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Indian Queen</hi> was a great success, one of the greatest since the reopening
                    of the theatres. This was in all likelihood due much less to the heroic verse
                    and the exclusion of comic scenes from the tragedy than to the magnificent
                    scenic accessories—the battles and sacrifices on the stage, the aerial demons
                    singing in the air, and the god of dreams ascending through a trap. The novelty
                    of these Indian spectacles, as well as of the Indian characters, with the
                    splendid Queen Zempoalla, acted by Mrs Marshall in a real Indian dress of
                    feathers presented to her by Mrs Aphra Behn, as the centre of the play, was the
                    chief secret of the success of <hi rend="italic">The Indian Queen.</hi> These
                    melodramatic properties were so marked a novelty that they could not fail to
                    draw the town. The heroic verse formed but a small ingredient in the play;
                    still, being also a novelty which had just been introduced by Davenant in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Siege of Rhodes,</hi> it interested the scholarly part of the
                    audience, and so helped to consolidate the success of the stage carpenter.
                    Dryden was tempted to return to tragedy: he followed up <hi rend="italic">The
                    Indian Queen</hi> with <hi rend="italic">The Indian Emperor,</hi> which was
                    acted in 1665, and also proved a success.</p>
                <p>But Dryden was not content with writing tragedies in rhymed verse. Taking it up
                    with enthusiasm as the only thing which the Elizabethan dramatists had left for
                    their successors to excel in, he propounded the propriety of rhyme in serious
                    plays as a thesis for discussion, and made it the prominent question of the day
                    among men of letters. He took up the question immediately after the success of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Indian Queen,</hi> in the preface to an edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Rival Ladies.</hi> In that first statement of his case, he
                    considered the chief objection to the use of rhyme, and urged his chief argument
                    in its favour. Rhyme was not natural, some people had said; to which he answers
                    that it is as natural as blank verse, and that much of its unnaturalness is not
                    the fault of the rhyme but of the writer, who has not sufficient command of
                    language to rhyme easily. In favour of rhyme he has to say that it at once
                    stimulates the imagination, and prevents it from being too discursive in its
                    flights. During the Great Plague, when the theatres were closed, and Dryden was
                    living in the country at the house of his father-in-law, the earl of Berkshire,
                    he occupied a considerable part of his time in thinking over the principles of
                    dramatic composition, and threw his meditations and conclusions into the form of
                    a dialogue, which he called an <hi rend="italic">Essay of Dramatic Poetry,</hi>
                    and published in 1668. One of the main topics of the essay was the admissibility
                    of rhyme in serious plays, Dryden making Neander, the interlocutor who
                    represents himself, repeat with fresh illustrations all that he had said in its
                    favour. By this time, however, Sir R. Howard, his brother-in-law, whom he had
                    joined in writing the rhymed <hi rend="italic">Indian Queen,</hi> had changed
                    his mind about the heroic couplet, and made some offensive comments on Dryden’s
                    essay in a hoity-toity preface to <hi rend="italic">The Duke of Lerma.</hi>
                    Dryden at once replied to his brother-in-law in a master-piece of sarcastic
                    retort and vigorous reasoning, publishing his reply as a preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Indian Emperor.</hi> It is the ablest and most complete
                    statement of his views about the employment of rhymed couplets in tragedy.</p>

                <p>Before his return to town at the end of 1666, when the theatres were reopened,
                    Dryden wrote a poem on the Dutch war and the Great Fire, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Annus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirabilis.</hi> The poem is in
                    quatrains, the metre of his <hi rend="italic">Heroic Stanzas</hi> in praise of
                    Cromwell, which Dryden chose, he tells us, “because he had ever judged it more
                    noble and of greater dignity both for the sound and number than any other verse
                    in use amongst us.” The preface to the poem contains an interesting discussion
                    of what he calls “wit-writing,” introduced by the remark that “the composition
                    of all poems is or ought to be of wit.” His description of the Fire is a famous
                    specimen of this wit-writing, much more careless and daring, and much more
                    difficult to sympathize with, than the graver conceits in his panegyric of the
                    Protector. In <hi rend="italic">Annus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirabilis</hi> the
                    poet apostrophizes the newly founded Royal Society, of which he had been elected
                    a member in 1662, more probably through personal connection than on the ground
                    of scientific attainments.</p>
                <p>From the reopening of the theatres in 1666, till November 1681, the date of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel,</hi> Dryden produced nothing but
                    plays. The stage was his chief source of income. <hi rend="italic">Secret Love,
                    or the Maiden Queen,</hi> a tragicomedy, produced in March 1667, does not come
                    up to our expectations as the first-fruit of the author’s rest from composition
                    and prolonged study of dramatic art. The prologue claims that it is written with
                    pains and thought, by the exactest rules, with strict observance of the unities,
                    and “a mingled chime of Jonson’s humour and of Corneille’s rhyme;” but it owed
                    its success chiefly to the charm of Nell Gwynne’s acting in the part of
                    Florimel. It is noticeable that only the more passionate parts of the dialogue
                    are rhymed, Dryden’s theory apparently being that rhyme is then demanded for the
                    elevation of the style. His next play, <hi rend="italic">Sir Martin Marall,</hi>
                    an adaptation from Molière’s <hi rend="italic">H Etourdi,</hi> was produced at
                    the Duke’s Theatre, in the name of the duke of Newcastle. It was about this time
                    that Dryden became a retained writer under contract for the King’s Theatre,
                    receiving from it £300 or £400 a year, till it was burnt down in 1672, and about
                    £200 for six years more till the beginning of 1678 If <hi rend="italic">Sir
                    Martin Μarall</hi> was written but not produced before this contract was entered
                    into, one can understand -why it was announced as the duke of Newcastle’s. His
                    co-operation with Davenant in a new version of Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tempest—</hi> for his share in which Dryden can hardly be pardoned on the
                    ground that the chief alterations were happy thoughts of Davenant’s, seeing that
                    he affirms he never worked at anything with more delight—must also be supposed
                    to be anterior to the completion of his contract with the Theatre Royal. The
                    existence of the contract came to light from Dryden’s non-fulfilment of its
                    terms. He was engaged to write three plays a year, and he contributed only ten
                    plays during the ten years of his engagement, finally exhausting the patience of
                    his partners by joining in the composition of a play for the rival house. In
                    adapting <hi rend="italic">H Etourdi,</hi> Dryden did not catch Molière’s
                    lightness of touch; his alterations go towards making the comedy into a farce.
                    Perhaps all the more on this account <hi rend="italic">Sir Martin Μarall</hi>
                    had a great run at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. As we have said, there
                    is always a certain coarseness in Dryden’s humour, apart from the coarseness of
                    his age,—a certain forcible roughness of touch which belongs to the character of
                    the man. His <hi rend="italic">An Evening’s Love, or the Mock Astrologer,</hi>
                    an adaptation from the younger Corneille, produced at the King’s Theatre in
                    1668, seemed to Pepys “very smutty, and nothing so good as <hi rend="italic">The
                    Maiden Queen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Indian Emperor</hi> of Dryden’s
                    making.” Evelyn thought it foolish and profane, and was grieved “to see how the
                    stage was degenerated and polluted by the licentious times.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ladies</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la Mode,</hi> another of
                    Dryden’s contract comedies, produced in 1668, was so mean a thing,” Pepys says,
                    that it was only once acted, and Dryden never published it. Of his other
                    comedies, <hi rend="italic">Marnage à</hi><hi rend="italic">la Mode</hi>
                    (produced 1672), <hi rend="italic">Lσve in a Nunnery</hi> (1672), <hi
                    rend="italic">Limberham, or the Kind Keeper,</hi> only the first was moderately
                    successful. The failure was not due to want of ribaldry.</p>
                <p>While Dryden met with such indifferent success in his willing efforts to supply
                    the demand of the age for low comedy, he struck upon a really popular and
                    profitable vein in heroic tragedy. <hi rend="italic">Tyrannic Love, or the Royal
                    Martyr,</hi> a Roman play, in which St Catherine is introduced, and with her
                    some striking supernatural machinery, was produced in 1669. It is in rhymed
                    couplets, but the author again did not trust solely for success to them; for,
                    besides the magic incantations, the singing angels, and the Hew of Paradise, he
                    made Nell Gwynne, w ho had stabbed herself as Valeria, start to life again as
                    she was being carried off the stage, and speak a riotously funny epilogue, in
                    violent contrast to the serious character of the play. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almanzor and Almahide, or the Conquest of Granada,</hi> a tragedy in two parts,
                    appeared in 1670. It seems to have given the crowning touch of provocation to
                    the wits, who had never ceased to ridicule the popular taste for these
                    extravagant heroic plays. Dryden almost invited burlesque in his epilogue to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Conquest of Granada,</hi> in which he charged the comedy of
                    the Elizabethan age with coarseness and mechanical humour, and its conceptions
                    of love and honour with meanness, and claimed for his own time and his own plays
                    an advance in these respects. <hi rend="italic">The Rehearsal,</hi> written by
                    the duke of Buckingham, with the assistance, it was said, of Clifford, Sprat,
                    and others, and produced in 1671, was a severe and just punishment for this
                    boast. Dryden is here unmercifully ridiculed under the name of Bayes, he having
                    obtained the laureateship from the king (with a pension of £300 a year and a
                    butt of canary wine) in 1670. It is said that <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rehearsal</hi> was begun in 1663 and ready for representation before the Plague.
                    But this probably only means that Buckingham and his friends were so tickled
                    with the absurdities of Davenant’s operatic heroes in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Siege of Rhodes,</hi> and the extravagant heroics of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Indian Queen,</hi> that they resolved to burlesque them. Materials accumulated
                    upon them as the fashion continued, and by the time Dryden had produced his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tyrannic Love,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Conquest of
                    Granada,</hi> he had so established himself as the chief offender as to
                    naturally become the centre of the burlesque. It is commonly said that Dryden
                    passed over the attack on himself without reply, either because he admitted its
                    justice or because he feared to offend the king’s favourite. But this is not
                    strictly so; his reply is contained in the dedication and preface to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Conquest of Granada;</hi> and his prose defence of the epilogue
                    was published in 1672, in which, so far from laughing with his censors, he
                    addresses them from the eminence of success, saying that “with the common good
                    fortune of prosperous gamesters he can be content to sit quietly.” Heroic verse,
                    he assures them, is so established that few tragedies are likely henceforward to
                    be written in any other metre, and he retorts upon their exposure of
                    improbabilities in his plays, by criticizing the ridiculous incoherent stories
                    and mean writing of Shakespeare and Jonson. Dignified reassertion of his
                    positions was Dryden’s way of meeting the ridicule of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rehearsal.</hi> In the course of a year or two, <hi rend="italic">The Conquest
                    of Granada</hi> being attacked also by Settle, a rival playwright who had
                    obtained considerable success, he had an opportunity of taking revenge in a
                    style more suited to his sharp temper and power of severe writing.</p>
                <p>Dryden’s reply to <hi rend="italic">The Rehearsal</hi> was lofty and firm. But
                    though he put a bold face on a practice which it is but fair to suppose that he
                    adopted only to supply a popular <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0510-0491"/> demand, he did not write many more heroic plays
                    in rhyme. Perhaps the ridicule of <hi rend="italic">The Rehearsal</hi> had
                    destroyed their popularity. His next tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Amboyna,</hi> an
                    exhibition of certain atrocities committed by the Dutch on English merchants in
                    the East Indies, put on the stage to inflame the public mind in view of the
                    Dutch war, was written, •with the exception of a few passages, in prose, and
                    those passages in blank verse. An opera which he wrote in rhymed couplets,
                    called <hi rend="italic">The State of Innocence, or the Fall of Man,</hi> an
                    attempt to turn part of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> into rhyme, as a
                    proof of its superiority to blank verse, was prefaced by an apology for heroic
                    poetry and poetic licence, and published in 1674, but it was never acted. The
                    redeeming circumstance about the performance is the admiration professed by the
                    adapter fôr his original, which he pronounces “undoubtedly one of the greatest,
                    most noble, and most sublime poems which either this age or nation has
                    produced.” Dryden is said to have had the elder poet’s leave “to tag his
                    verses.” <hi rend="italic">Aurengzebe</hi> was Dryden’s last rhymed tragedy. In
                    the prologue he confessed that he had grown weary of his long-loved mistress
                    rhyme. But the stings of <hi rend="italic">The Rehearsal</hi> had stimulated him
                    to do his utmost to justify his devotion to his mistress. He claims that <hi
                    rend="italic">Aurengzebe</hi> is “the most correct” of his plays, and it is
                    certainly superior, both in versification and in moderation of language, to its
                    predecessors. It was acted in 1675, and published in the following year.</p>
                <p>If Dryden had died in 1676, at the age of forty-five, he would have left a very
                    inconsiderable name behind him. The fray between him and Settle might have been
                    looked upon as a passage at arms between equals. After the production of <hi
                    rend="italic">Aurengzebe</hi> he seems to have rested for an interval from
                    writing, enabled to do so, probably, by an additional pension of £100 granted to
                    him by the king. During this interval he would seem to have reconsidered the
                    principles of dramatic composition, and to have made a particular study of the
                    works of Shakespeare. The fruits of this appeared in <hi rend="italic">A ll for
                    Love, or the World Well Lost,</hi> a version of the story of Antony and
                    Cleopatra, produced in 1678, which must be regarded as a new departure in his
                    dramatic career, a very remarkable departure for a man of his age, and a
                    wonderful proof of undiminished openness and plasticity of mind. In his previous
                    writings on dramatic theory, Dryden, while admiring the rhyme of the French
                    dramatists as an advance in art, did not give the same praise to the regularity
                    of their plots; he was disposed to give the preference to the irregular
                    structure of the Elizabethan dramatists, as being more favourable to variety
                    both of action and of character. But now he abandoned rhyme, and, if we might
                    judge from <hi rend="italic">All for Love,</hi> and the precepts laid down in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Grounds of Criticism in Tragedy,</hi> the chief point in
                    which he aimed at excelling the Elizabethans was in giving greater unity to his
                    plot. He upheld still the superiority of Shakespeare to the French dramatists in
                    the delineation of character, but he thought that the scope of the action might
                    be restricted, and the parts bound more closely together with advantage. <hi
                    rend="italic">All for Love</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>
                    are two excellent plays for the comparison of the two methods. Dryden gave all
                    his strength to <hi rend="italic">All for Love,</hi> writing the play for
                    himself, as he said, and not for the public. Carrying out the idea expressed in
                    the title, he represents the two lovers as being more entirely under the
                    dominion of love than Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra. Shakespeare’s Antony
                    is moved by other impulses than the passion for Cleopatra; it is his master
                    motive, but it has to maintain a struggle for supremacy; “Roman thoughts” strike
                    in upon him even in the very height of the enjoyment of his mistress’s love, he
                    chafes under the yoke, and breaks away from her of his own impulse at the call
                    of spontaneo <hi rend="superscript"> ι,ol</hi> v reawakened ambition. Dryden’s
                    Antony is so deeply sunk in love that no other impulse has power to stir him; it
                    takes much persuasion and skilful artifice to detach him from Cleopatra even in
                    thought, and his soul returns to her violently before the rupture has been
                    completed. On the other hand, Dryden’s Cleopatra is so completely enslaved by
                    love for Antony that she is incapable of using the calculated caprices and
                    meretricious coquetries which Shakespeare’s Cleopatra deliberately practises as
                    the highest art of love, the surest way of maintaining her empire over her great
                    captain’s heart. It is with difficulty that Dryden’s Cleopatra will agree, on
                    the earnest solicitation of a wily counsellor, to feign a liking for Dolabella
                    to excite Antony’s jealousy, and she cannot keep up the pretence through a few
                    sentences. The characters of the two lovers are thus very much contracted,
                    indeed almost overwhelmed, beneath the pressure of the one ruling motive. And as
                    Dryden thus introduces a greater regularity of character into the drama, so he
                    also very much contracts the action, in order to give probability to this
                    temporary subjugation of individual character. The action of Dryden s play takes
                    place wholly in Alexandria, within the compass of a few days; it does not, like
                    Shakespeare’s, extend over several years, and present incessant changes of
                    scene. Dryden chooses, as it were, a fragment of an historical action, a single
                    moment during which motives play within a narrow ciιcle, the culminating point
                    in the relations between his two personages. He devotes his whole play, also, to
                    those relations; only what bears upon them is admitted. In Shakespeare’s play we
                    get a certain historical perspective, in which the love of Antony and Cleopatra
                    appears in its true proportions beneath the firmament that overhangs human
                    affairs. In Dryden’s play this love is our universe; all the other concerns of
                    the world retire into a shadowy, indistinct background. If we rise from a
                    comparison of the plays with an impression that the Elizabethan drama is a
                    higher type of drama, taking Dryden’s own definition of the word as “a just and
                    lively image of human nature,” we rise also with an impression of Dryden’s power
                    such as we get from nothing else that he had written since his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heroic Stanzas,</hi> twenty years before.</p>
                <p>It was twelve years before Dryden produced another tragedy worthy of the power
                    shown in <hi rend="italic">All for Love. Don Sebastian</hi> was acted and
                    published in 1690. In the interval, to sum up briefly Dryden’s work as a
                    dramatist, lie wrote <hi rend="italic">Oedipus</hi> (1678) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Duke of Guise</hi> (1683) in conjunction with Lee; <hi rend="italic"

                    in the plot, but the dialogue is rewritten throughout, and not for the better.

                    Dryden’s contribution to the joint work, bear marked evidence of his recent
                    study of Shakespeare. The plot of <hi rend="italic">Don Sebastian</hi> is more
                    intricate than that of <hi rend="italic">All far Love.</hi> It has also more of
                    the characteristics of his heroic dramas; the extravagance of sentiment and the
                    suddenness of impulse remind us occasionally of <hi rend="italic">The Indian
                    Emperor;</hi> but the characters are much more elaborately studied than in
                    Dryden’s earlier plays, and the verse is sinewy and powerful. It would be
                    difficult to say whether <hi rend="italic">Don Sebastian</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">All for Love</hi> is his best play; they share the palm between
                    them. Dryden’s subsequent plays are not remarkable. Their titles and dates are—
                    <hi rend="italic">King Arthur,</hi> an opera, 1691; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cleomenes,</hi> 1692; <hi rend="italic">Love Triumphant,</hi> 1694.</p>
                <p>Soon after Dryden’s abandonment of heroic couplets in tragedy, he found new and
                    more congenial work for his favourite instrument in satire. As usual the idea
                    was not original to Dryden, though he struck in with his majestic step and
                    energy divine, and immediately took the lead.</p>

                    >on</hi><hi rend="italic">Satire,</hi> an attack on Rochester and the court,
                    circulated in 1679. Dryden himself was suspected of the authorship, and
                    cudgelled by hired ruffians as the author; but it is not likely that he attacked
                    the king on whom he was dependent for the greater part of his income. In the
                    same year Oldham’s satire on the Jesuits had immense popularity, chiefly owing
                    to the excitement about the Popish plot. Dryden took the field as a satirist
                    towards the close of 1681, on the side of the court, at the moment when
                    Shaftesbury, baffled in his efforts to exclude the duke of York from the throne
                    as a papist, and secure the succession of the duke of Monmouth, was waiting his
                    trial for high treason. <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</hi> produced a
                    great stir. Nine editions were sold in rapid succession in the course of a year.
                    It was a new thing for the public to have the leading men of the day held up to
                    laughter, contempt, and indignation under disguises which a little trouble
                    enabled them to penetrate. There was no compunction in Dryden’s ridicule and
                    invective. Delicate wit was not one of Dryden’s gifts; the motions of his weapon
                    were sweeping, and the blows hard and trenchant. The advantage he had gained by
                    his recent studies of character was fully used in his portraits of Shaftesbury
                    and Buckingham, Achitophel and Zimri. In these portraits he shows considerable
                    art in the introduction of redeeming traits to the general outline of malignity
                    and depravity. Against Buckingham Dryden had old scores to pay off, but he was
                    too practised in the language of eulogy and invective to need any personal
                    stimulus. “Glorious John” had a mind superior to petty hatreds, as well as, it
                    must be admitted, to petty friendships, and it is not impossible that the fact
                    that his pension had not been paid since the beginning of 1680 weighed with him
                    in writing this satire to gain the favour of the court. In a play produced in
                    1681, <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Friar,</hi> he had written on the other
                    side, gratifying the popular feeling by attacking the Papists. Three other
                    satires, with which he followed up <hi rend="italic">A bsalom and
                    Achitophel,</hi> dealt with smaller game than this master-piece, though one of
                    them was hardly inferior in point of literary power. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Medal</hi> was written in ridicule of the medal struck to commemorate
                    Shaftesbury’s acquittal. Then Dryden had to take vengeance on the literary
                    champions of the Whig party, who had opened upon him with all their artillery.
                    Their leader, Shadwell, he essayed to demolish under the nickname of
                    “MacFlecknoe.” Besides a separate poem under that title, he contributed a long
                    passage to a second part of <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel,</hi>
                    written chiefly by Nahum Tate, in which Ferguson, Forbes, Settle, and Shadwell
                    were victims of his strident lash. <hi rend="italic">Religio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Laici,</hi> which came immediately after, in November 1682, though
                    nominally an exposition of a layman’s creed, and deservedly admired as such, was
                    not without a political purpose. It attacked the Papists, but declared the
                    “fanatics” to be still more dangerous, which fitted in with Charles’s policy of
                    conciliating the church by persecuting the Nonconformists.</p>
                <p>Dryden’s next poem in heroic couplets was in a different strain. On the accession
                    of James, in 1685, he became a Roman Catholic. There has been much discussion as
                    to whether this conversion was or was not sincere. It can only be said that the
                    coincidence between his change of faith and his change of patron was suspicious,
                    and that Dryden’s character for consistency is certainly not of a kind to quench
                    suspicion. The force of the coincidence cannot be removed by such pleas as that
                    his wife had been a Roman Catholic for several years, or that he was converted
                    by his son, who was converted at Cambridge, even if there were any evidence for
                    these statements. Scott defended Dryden’s conversion, as Macaulay denounced it,
                    from party motives; on any other grounds, it is not worth discussing. Nothing
                    can be clearer than that Dryden all his life through regarded his literary
                    powers as a means of subsistence, and had little scruple about accepting a brief
                    on any side. <hi rend="italic">The Hind and Panther,</hi> published in 1687, is
                    an ingenious argument for Roman Catholicism, put into the mouth of “a milk-white
                    hind, immortal and unchanged.” There is considerable beauty in the picture of
                    this tender creature, and its enemies in the forest are not spared. One can
                    understand the admiration that the poem received when such allegories were in
                    fashion. It was the chief cause of the veneration with which Dryden was regarded
                    by Pope, who, himself educated in the Roman Catholic faith, was taken as a boy
                    of twelve to see the veteran poet in his chair of honour and authority at Will’s
                    coffee-house. It w as also very open to ridicule, and was treated in this spirit
                    by Prior and Montagu, the future earl of Halifax. Dryden’s other literary
                    services to James were a savage reply to Stillingfleet—who had attacked two
                    papers published by the king immediately after his accession, one said to have
                    been written by his la <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> e brother in advocacy of
                    the Church of Rome, the other by his late wife explaining the reasons for her
                    conversion—and a translation of a life of Xavier in prose. He had written also a
                    panegyric of Charles, and a eulogy of James under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Rediviva,</hi> which it is interesting to
                    compare with his other productions of the same kind.</p>
                <p>Dryden did not abjure his new faith on the Revolution, and so lost his office and
                    pension as laureate and historiographer royal. For this act of constancy he
                    deserves credit, if the new powers would have considered his services worth
                    having after his frequent apostasies. His rival Shadwell reigned in his stead.
                    Dryden was once more thrown mainly upon his pen for support. He turned again to
                    the stage and wrote the plays which we have enumerated. A great feature in the
                    last decade of his life was his translations from the classics. A volume of
                    miscellanies published in 1685 had contained some translations from Virgil,
                    Horace, Lucretius, and Theocritus. He now produced translations more
                    deliberately as a saleable commodity. A volume of miscellanies, which appeared
                    in 1693, contained translations from Homer and Ovid. In the same year he
                    published a translation of the satires of Juvenal and Persius, written with the
                    assistance of his two elder sons. Johnson passes on this work the just criticism
                    that “though, like all other productions of Dryden, it may have shining parts,
                    it seems to have been written merely for wages, in an uniform mediocrity.” When
                    Dryden took his farewell of the stage in 1694, he announced his intention of
                    devoting himself to a translation of the whole of Virgil. On this he seems
                    really to have laboured, and great expectations were formed of it. It was
                    published in 1697, and proved a great success. To judge it by its fidelity as a
                    reproduction of the original would be to apply too high a standard, but it is an
                    interesting rendering of Virgil into the style of Dryden, and as a poem was read
                    with delight in its own age. Soon after its publication, Dryden wrote one of his
                    master-pieces, the second Ode on St Cecilia’s day. His next work was to render
                    some of Chaucer’s and Boccaccio’s tales and Ovid’s metamorphoses into his own
                    verse. These translations appeared a few months before his death, and are known
                    by the title of <hi rend="italic">Fables.</hi> Thus a large portion of the
                    closing years of Dryden’s life were spent in translating for bread. He had a
                    windfall of 500 guineas from Lord Abingdon for a poem on the death of his wife
                    in 1691, but generally he was in considerable pecuniary straits. He is supposed
                    to have received occasional presents from rich and powerful friends, but he
                    never received anything from the court, and he was too proud to make advances.
                    Besides, his three sons held various posts in the service of the Pope at Rome,
                    and he could <pb break="no"

                    However, he was not molested in London by the Government, and in private he was
                    treated with the respect due to his old age and his admitted position as the
                    greatest of living English poets. His death took place on the 1st of May
                    1700.</p>
                <p>Dryden’s conversion to Catholicism had a great indirect influence on the
                    preservation of his fame. It was this which gained him the discipleship and
                    loving imitation of Pope. He thus became by accident, as it were, the literary
                    father and chief model of the greatest poet of the next generation. If his fame
                    had stood simply upon his merits as a poet, he would in all likelihood have been
                    a much less imposing figure in literary history than he is now. The splendid
                    force of his satire must always be admired, but there is surprisingly little of
                    the vast mass of his writings that can be considered woτthy of lasting
                    remembrance. He showed little inventive genius. He was simply a masterly <hi
                    rend="italic">littérateur</hi> of immense intellectual energy, whose one lucky
                    hit was the first splendid application of heroic couplets to satire and
                    religious, moral, and political argument. Upon this lucky hit supervened
                    another, the accidental discipleship of Pope. Dryden lent his gift of verse to
                    the service of politics, and his fame profited by the connection. It would be
                    unjust to say that his fame was due to this, but it was helped by this; apart
                    from the attachment of Pope, he owed to party also something of the favour of
                    Johnson and the personal championship and editorial zeal of Scott.</p>
                <p>The standard edition of Dryden is Scott’s. There is an admirable edition of his
                    poetical works in the Globe series, by Mr W. D. Christie, enriched with an
                    elaborately accurate memoir and painstaking notes. His two best plays, <hi
                    rend="italic">All for Love</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bon Sebastian,</hi> have
                    recently been republished by Mr. J. L. Seton. (W. Μ.)</p>
