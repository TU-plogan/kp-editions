                <p><label type="entry">DUPONT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre</hi></label> (1821—1871),
                    a French song-writer of great popularity, the son of a workman of Provins, was
                    born at Lyons, hie mother’s native city, but brought up from childhood under the
                    care of an elderly cousin who occupied the position of priest of
                    Roche-Taillée-sur-Saône. From the seminary of Largentières, where his education
                    was completed, he passed to the uncongenial drudgery of a lawyer’s and banker’s
                    office; in 1839 found his way to Paris, and got some of his poems inserted in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de France</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quotidienne</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and two years later was saved from
                    the conscription and enabled to publish his first volume— <hi rend="italic">Les
                        deux Anges—</hi> through the exertions of a Provins kinsman and M. Lebrun.
                    The prize founded by M. de Maillé La Tour-Landry was awarded to him in 1842, and
                    he was employed for some time in connection with the Academy’s great dictionary.
                    The thought of trying his fortune as a writer for the stage was taking shape in
                    his mind, when in 1847 the success of his peasant song <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pai</hi><hi rend="italic">deux grands boeufs dans mon étable</hi> opened up
                    another prospect of fame; and from that date to his death he confined himself
                    mainly, though not exclusively, to the cultivation of his lyrical faculty.
                    Accompanied, as they often were, by airs of his own invention, many of his songs
                    became in the widest sense popular, and were equally welcome in the workshop and
                    the drawing-room. His sympathies were much less, however, with the drawing-room
                    than the workshop; and in 1851 he paid the penalty of having become the poet
                    laureate of the socialistic aspirations of the time by being condemned to seven
                    years of exile from France. The sentence was cancelled, and the poet withdrew
                    for a season from participation in politics. He died at Paris in 1871. His
                    lyrical poems may very fairly be arranged according to his own
                    classification—rustic and, as far as the writer is concerned, objective,
                    legendary and subjective, patriotic and contemporaneous. They have appeared in
                    various forms— <hi rend="italic">Chants et Chansons,</hi> 3 vols., with music,
