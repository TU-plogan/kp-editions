                <p><label type="entry">DOVE</label> (Dutch, <hi rend="italic">Dwjve;</hi> Danish,
                    <hi rend="italic">Due;</hi> Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Dufa;</hi> German, <hi
                    rend="italic">Taube),</hi> a name which seems to be most commonly applied to the
                    smaller members of the group of birds by ornithologists usually called Pigeons
                    <hi rend="italic">(Columbae)</hi>; but no sharp distinction can be drawn between
                    Pigeons and Doves, and in general literature the two words are used almost
                    indifferently, while no one species can be pointed out to which the word Dove,
                    taken alone, seems to be absolutely proper. The largest of the group to which
                    the name is applicable is perhaps the Ring-Dove, or Wood-Pigeon, also called in
                    many parts of Britain Cushat and Queest <hi rend="italic">(Columba</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">palumbus,</hi> Linn.), a very common bird throughout these islands
                    and most parts of Europe. It associates in winter in large flocks, the numbers
                    of which (owing partly to the destruction of predacious animals, but still more
                    to the modern system of agriculture, and the growth of plantations in many
                    districts that were before treeless) have of late years increased enormously, so
                    that their depredations are very serious. In former days, when the breadth of
                    land in Britain under green crops was comparatively small, these birds found
                    little food in the dead season, and this scarcity was a natural check on their
                    superabundance. But since the extended cultivation of turnips and plants of
                    similar use the case is altered, and perhaps at no time of the year has
                    provender become more plentiful than in winter. The Ring-Dove may be easily
                    distinguished from other European species by its larger size, and especially by
                    the white spot on either side of its neck, forming a nearly continuous “ring,”
                    whence the bird takes its name, and the large white patches in its wings, which
                    are very conspicuous in flight. It breeds several times in the year, making for
                    its nest a slight platform of sticks on the horizontal bough of a tree, and
                    laying therein two eggs—which, as in all the <hi rend="italic">Columbae,</hi>
                    are white.</p>
                <p>The Stock-Dove <hi rend="italic">(C. aenas</hi> of most authors) is a smaller
                    species, with many of the habits of the former, but breeding by preference in
                    the stocks of hollow trees or in rabbitholes. It is darker in colour than the
                    Ring-Dove, without any white on its neck or wings, and is much less common and
                    more locally distributed.</p>
                <p>The Rock-Dove <hi rend="italic">(C. livia,</hi> Temm.) much resembles the
                    Stock-Dove, but is of a lighter colour, with two black bars on its wings, and a
                    white rump. In its wild state it haunts most of the rocky parts of the coast of
                    Europe, from the Faeroes to the Cyclades, and, seldom going inland, is
                    comparatively rare. Yet, as it is without contradiction the parent-stem of all
                    our domestic Pigeons, its numbers must far exceed those of both the former put
                    together. In Egypt and various parts of Asia it is represented by what Mr Darwin
                    has called “Wild Races,” which are commonly accounted good “species” <hi
                    rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic">schimperi,</hi><hi rend="italic">C.
                    affinis,</hi><hi rend="italic">C. intermedia, C. leuconota,</hi> and so forth),
                    though they differ from one another far less than do nearly all the domestic
                    forms, of which more than 150 kinds that “breed true,” and have been separately
                    named, are known to exist. Very many of these, if found wild, would have
                    unquestionably been ranked by the best ornithologists as distinct “species,” and
                    several of them would as undoubtedly have been placed in different genera. These
                    various breeds arc classified by Mr Darwin<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Race, that of the “Pouters,” having the gullet of great size, barely separated
                    from the crop, and often inflated, the body and legs elongated, and a moderate
                    bill. The most strongly marked subrace, the <hi rend="italic">Improved English
                    Pouter,</hi> is considered to be the most distinct of all domesticated
                    pigeons.</p>

                    :—(1.) “Camers,” with along pointed hill, the eyes surrounded by much bare skin,
                    and the neck and body much elongated; (2.) “Runts,” with a long, massive bill,
                    and the body of great size; and (3.) “Barbs,” with a short, broad bill, much
                    bare skin round the eyes, and the skin over the nostrils swollen. Of the first
                    four and of the second five subraces are distinguished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> III. is confessedly artificial, and to it are
                    assigned <hi rend="italic">five</hi> Races :—(1.) “Fan-tails,” remarkable for
                    the extraordinary development of their tails, which may consist of as many as
                    forty-two rectrices in place of the ordinary twelve; (2.) “Turbits” and “Owls,”
                    with the feathers of the throat diverging, and a short thick bill; (3.)
                    “Tumblers,” possessing the marvellous habit of tumbling backwards during flight
                    or, in some breeds, eyen on the ground, and having a short, conical bill; (4.)
                    “Frill-backs,” in which the feathers are reversed; and (5.) “Jacobins,” with the
                    feathers of the neck forming a hood, and the wings and tail long.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> IV. greatly resembles the normal form, and
                    comprises <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Races :—(1.) Trumpeters,” with a tuft of
                    feathers at the base of the neck curling forward, the face much feathered, and a
                    very peculiar voice, and (2.) Pigeons scarcely differing in structure from the
                    wild stock.</p>
                <p>Besides these some three or four other little-known breeds exist, and the whole
                    number of breeds and sub-breeds <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0399-0380"/> almost defies computation. The difference between
                    them is in many cases far from being superficial, for Mr Darwin has shown that
                    there is scarcely any part of the skeleton which is constant, and the
                    modifications that have been effected in the proportions of the head and sternal
                    apparatus are very remarkable. Yet the proof that all these different birds have
                    descended from one common stock is nearly certain. Here there is no need to
                    point out its bearing upon the “Theory of Natural Selection” which that eminent
                    naturalist and Mr Wallace have rendered so well known. The antiquity of some of
                    these breeds is not the least interesting part of the subject, nor is the use to
                    which one at least of them has long been applied. The Dove from the earliest
                    period in history has been associated with the idea of a messenger (Genesis
                    viii. 8-12), and its employment in that capacity, developed successively by
                    Greeks, Romans, Mussulmans, and Christians, has never been more fully made
                    available than in our own day, as witness the “Pigeon-post” established during
                    the recent siege of Paris.</p>
                <p>Leaving, then, this interesting subject, space does not permit our here dwelling
                    on various foreign species, which, if not truly belonging to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Columba,</hi> are barely separable therefrom. Of these examples
                    may be found in the Indian, Ethiopian, and Neotropical Regions. Still less can
                    we here enter upon the innumerable other forms, though they may be entitled to
                    the name of “Dove,” which are to be found in almost every part of the world, and
                    nowhere more abundantly than in the Australian Region. Mr Wallace <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1865, pp. 365-400) considers that they attain their
                    maximum development in the Papuan Subregion, where, though the land-area is less
                    than one-sixth that of Europe, more than a quarter of all the species (some 300
                    in number) known to exist are found—owing, he suggests, to the absence of
                    forest-haunting and fruit-eating Mammals.</p>
                <p>It would, however, be impossible to conclude this article without noticing a
                    small group of birds to which in some minds the name Dove will seem especially
                    applicable. This is the group containing the Turtle-Doves—the time-honoured
                    emblem of tenderness and conjugal love. The common Turtle-Dove of Europe <hi
                    rend="italic">(Turtur auritus)</hi> is one of those species which is gradually
                    extending its area. In England, not much more than a century ago, it seems to
                    have been chiefly, if not solely, known in the southern and western counties.
                    Though in the character of a straggler only, it now reaches the extreme north of
                    Scotland, and is perhaps nowhere more abundant than in many of the midland and
                    eastern counties of England. On the continent the same thing has been observed,
                    though indeed not so definitely; and this species has within the last twenty
                    years or so appeared as a casual visitor within the Arctic Circle. The probable
                    causes of its extension cannot here be discussed; and there is no need to dwell
                    upon its graceful form and the delicate harmony of its modest colouring, for
                    they are proverbial. The species is migratory, reaching Europe late in April and
                    retiring in September. Another species, and one perhaps better known from being
                    commonly kept in confinement, is that called by many the Collared or Barbary
                    Dove <hi rend="italic">(T.</hi><hi rend="italic">risorius)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> the second English name probably indicating that it was by way of that
                    country that it was brought to us, for it is not an African bird. This is
                    distinguished by its cream-coloured plumage and black necklace. Some uncertainty
                    seems to exist about its original home, but it is found from Constantinople to
                    India, and is abundant in the Holy Land, though there a third species <hi
                    rend="italic">(T. senegalensis)</hi> also occurs, which Canon Tristram thinks is
                    the Turtle-Dove of Scripture. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
