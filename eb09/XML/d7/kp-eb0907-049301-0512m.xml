                <p><label type="entry">DRY ROT</label>, a disease in timber, apparently infectious,
                    which occasions the destruction of its fibres, and reduces it eventually to a
                    mass of dry dust. It is produced most readily in a warm, moist, stagnant
                    atmosphere, while common or wet rot is the result of the exposure of wood to
                    repeated changes of climatic conditions. In both diseases, however, a kind of
                    spontaneous combustion or decomposition goes on in the wood; water, carbonic
                    acid gas, and probably carburetted hydrogen are evolved, and a pulverulent
                    substance, or humus, remains. Though the growth of fungi undoubtedly accelerates
                    the progress of dry rot, it would seem that the true origin of the disease is
                    the incipient decomposition of the sap in wood, and that by virtue of this
                    decomposition the fungi obtain a nidus for their growth. The most formidable of
                    the dry rot fungi is the species <hi rend="italic">Meruliu»</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lacrymans,</hi> which is particularly destructive of coniferous
                    wood; other species are <hi rend="italic">Poly porus hybridus,</hi> which
                    thrives in oak-built ships, and <hi rend="italic">P. destructor</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Thelephora</hi><hi rend="italic">puteana,</hi> found in a variety
                    of wooden structures. The nature of ships’ cargoes has a considerable influence
                    on the duration of their timbers,—hemp, pepper, and cotton being highly
                    favourable, and lime and coal unfavourable, to the development of dry rot. The
                    commonest precaution against the occurrence of that disease is to deprive the
                    wood of its moisture by exposure to the open air, or, in other words, to season
                    it. Charring, steaming, boiling, and smoke-curing are other modes of desiccation
                    which have been resorted to. At one time a Mr Lukin attempted the rapid
                    seasoning of logs of green oak at Woolwich dockyard by heating them in
                    pulverized charcoal; but the process, though it lessened the weight and
                    dimensions of tne wood, started its fibres from one another. He then sought to
                    replace the moisture of heated wood by the products of the distillation of
                    pitch-pine saw-dust; before, however, the operation was judged to be complete,
                    an explosion took place, which proved fatal to eight workmen, and wounded
                    twelve; the experiment, therefore, was not repeated. Davison and Symington’s
                    patent process of artificial drying, which has been found to yield good results,
                    consists in exposing the wood to a current of air moving at the rate of about 48
                    miles an hour, and having a temperature of 110° to 112° Fahr.</p>
                <p>The felling of trees when void of fresh sap, as a means of obviating the rotting
                    of timber, is a practice of very ancient origin. Vitruvius directs (ii. cap. 9)
                    that, to secure good timber, trees should be cut to the pith, so as to allow of
                    the escape of their sap, which by dying in the wood would injure its quality;
                    also that felling should take place only from early autumn until the end of
                    winter. The supposed superior quality of wood cut in winter, and the early
                    practice in England of felling oak timber at that season, may be inferred from a
                    statute of James I., which enacted “that no person or persons shall fell, or
                    cause to be felled, any oaken trees meet to be barked, when bark is worth 2s. a
                    cart-load (timber for the needful building and reparation of houses, ships, or
                    mills only excepted), but between the first day of April and last day of June,
                    not even for the king’s use, out of barking time, except for building or
                    repairing his Majesty’s houses or ships.” In giving testimony before a committee
                    of the House of Commons in March 1771, Mr Barnard of Deptford expressed it as
                    his opinion that to secure durable timber for ship-building, trees should be
                    barked in spring and not felled till the succeeding winter. In France, so long
                    ago as 1669, a royal decree limited the felling of timber from the 1st October
                    to the 15th April; and, in an order issued to the commissioners of forests,
                    Napoleon I. directed that the felling of naval timber should take place only
                    from November 1 to March 15, and during the decrease of the moon, on account of
                    the rapid decay of timber, through the fermentation of its sap, if cut at other
                    seasons. The burying of wood in water, which dissolves out or alters its
                    putrescible constituents, has long been practised as a means of seasoning. The
                    old “Resistance” frigate, which went down in Malta harbour, remained under water
                    for some months, and on being raised was found to be entirely freed from the dry
                    rot fungus that had previously covered her; similarly, in the ship “Eden,” the
                    progress of rot was completely arrested by 18 months’ submergence in Plymouth
                    Sound, so that after remaining a year at home in excellent condition she was
                    sent out to the East Indies. It was an ancient practice in England to place
                    timber for thrashing-floors and oak planks for wainscotting in running water to
                    season them. Whale and other oils have been recommended for the preservation of
                    wood; and in 1737 a patent for the employment of hot oil was taken out by a Mr
                    Emerson. Common salt, but for the attraction of its impurities for moisture,
                    might be advantageously used; indeed the Dutch ship-builders, having observed
                    that the busses in which herrings were stowed away in pickle lasted longer than
                    any other craft, adopted the practice of filling up with salt, not only the
                    vacant spaces between the planks, but also holes bored for its reception in the
                    large timbers.</p>
                <p>Among the many processes for the prevention of dry and wet rot in wood by
                    impregnating it with material capable of precipitating its coagulable
                    constituents in a permanently insoluble and imputrescible form, the following
                    may be enumerated :—Kyan’s (1832), in which, according to Sir Humphry Davy’s
                    suggestion, a solution of corrosive sublimate is employed; Sir W. Burnett’s
                    (1836), M. Breant’s (1837), Margary’s (1837), and Payne’s (1841), which consist
                    respectively in the use of zinc chloride, copperas, copper sulphate, and
                    copperas followed by sodium carbonate; and BethelΓs (1838), for the treatment of
                    the wood with crude creasote or oil of tar. The application of solution of
                    copper sulphate, containing about a quarter of a <pb break="no"

                    according to Margary⅛ patent, has been found very efficacious in the case of
                    timber not liable to the solvent action of water; but of all processes the most
                    satisfactory is Bethell’s. In this the wood is injected with heavy tar-oil in
                    cylinders 6 feet in diameter and 20 to 50 feet in length, at a temperature of
                    120° Fahr., and under a pressure of 150 lb to the square inch, so that ordinary
                    fir timber absorbs on the average 8 to 10 lb of the liquid per cubic foot.
                    Timber thus prepared has been found not only durable, but also exempt from the
                    attacks of insects and other pests.</p>
