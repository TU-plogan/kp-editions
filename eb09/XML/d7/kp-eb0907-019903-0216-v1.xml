                <p><label type="entry">DIET</label> (German, <hi rend="italic">Reichstag),</hi> The
                    origin of the German Diet is to be sought in the national assembly, which was a
                    common institution of the Teutonic race. From the earliest recorded times we
                    find all leading questions first discussed by the chiefs and then referred to
                    the assembly of the clan or tribe, in which every freeman had a voice.</p>
                <p>The earliest Diets of the German or Holy Roman Empire were assemblies in which
                    the monarch deliberated with his subjects on the common interests of the empire.
                    Originally all members were bound by their feudal tenure to be present, and if
                    absent they not only forfeited their vote but were liable to fine. Thus the Diet
                    was a feudal, not a representative, Parliament. As by degrees the feudatories of
                    the emperor turned into independent sovereigns, the Diet became nothing more
                    than a congress of princes. The emperor, instead of presiding in person, was
                    represented by a delegate called principal commissarius, and the princes sent
                    envoys, the right of suffrage being no longer personal, but attached to certain
                    territories or districts.</p>
                <p>At first the emperor was, in theory at least, elected by universal suffrage; a
                    candidate was chosen by the chief men, and their nominee approved by the people.
                    Thus we read that at the election of Conrad II. 50,000, and at that of Lothaire
                    II. 60,000 persons were present. In time this custom of nominating the emperor
                    grew into an established right, which, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >praetaxatian,</hi> was arrogated by the chief princes of the empire. Thus
                    the chief function of the Diet, the choice of an emperor, became the prerogative
                    of a few of its most powerful members, who claimed the right not only of
                    election but of deposition. Thus in 1298 Adolphus of Nassau was deposed, and
                    Albert of Austria chosen in his stead. The right of the electors and the forms
                    and rules of election were defined and settled by the famous instrument of
                    Charles IV. known as the Golden Bull, 1356.</p>
                <p>The Diet consisted of three bodies, who met and voted in separate colleges,—(1)
                    the electoral college, (2) the princes of the empire spiritual and temporal, (3)
                    the free imperial cities.</p>
                <p>1. In a law of Otho IV. (1208), we find the right of electing an emperor vested
                    in the electoral college of seven. These consisted of three spiritual
                    princes—the archbishops of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne,—and four secular electors
                    —the duke of Saxony, the count palatine of the Rhine, the king of Bohemia, and
                    the margrave of Brandenburg. The former sat as recognized heads of the German
                    church. The latter would naturally have been the dukes of Saxony, Franconia,
                    Swabia, and Bavaria; but when Bavaria was united with the county palatine its.
                    right was transferred to Bohemia; that of Swabia was, on the accession of
                    Frederick (who by his election was incapacitated from voting), delegated to
                    Brandenburg, and by it retained; and probably that of Franconia was for similar
                    reason forfeited (see Dunham, <hi rend="italic">Germanic Empire,</hi> i.
                    216).</p>
                <p>2. The princes of the empire had in all other respects, save that of electing an
                    emperor, the same rights as the dukes or electors. They consisted of the
                    archbishop of Salzburg, 20 bishops, 4 abbots, and 2 prebendaries, and of 44
                    temporal princes, though this number was afterwards largely augmented. Of these
                    several, such as the archduke of Austria, and the dukes of Brunswick and
                    Burgundy, were in rank and power more than equals of the electors.</p>

                <p>3. The free imperial cities formed a college divided into two benches,—the
                    Swabian, with 37 cities, and the Rhenish, with 14. They first appear at the Diet
                    under Henry VIL, but their position was not recognized till the peace of
                    Westphalia. The power exercised by this municipal constituent of the Diet was
                    small and strictly limited. Only what had been agreed upon by the electors and
                    princes could be submitted to the college of cities for their sanction. The
                    lower nobility, the knights of the empire, and the commons were
                    unrepresented.</p>
                <p>Each college voted separately; when the three colleges agreed, the decree or <hi
                        rend="italic">recess</hi> of the Diet, as it was called, was submitted to
                    the emperor for his ratification; but the emperor had no power to modify it, and
                    no resolution which affected the general interests of the empire could be passed
                    without the approbation of the Diet.</p>
                <p>Besides extraordinary meetings, the Diet was regularly convened twice a year. At
                    the spring session the general business of the empire was discussed, laws were
                    passed, alliances concluded, rebels proscribed, and grants of fiefs confirmed.
                    The autumn session was occupied with finance and attended only by dukes, counts,
                    and officers of administration. From 1663 the Diet met at Regensburg.</p>
                <p>From the end of the Thirty Years’ War the power of the Diet steadily declined.
                    The Peace of Westphalia, while confirming the rights of the Diet as against the
                    emperor, at the same time, by recognizing the territorial independence of the
                    German princes, so limited the province of the federative assembly that, to
                    quote the words of Frederick the Great, the Diet became “a mere shadow, a
                    congress of publicists more busied with forms than things, like dogs who bay the
                    moon.”</p>
                <p>The most important Diets were the following :—</p>
