                    of 1475; and of his father’s seats the one most likely to have been his
                    birthplace was Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    D. Black in his history of that town (2d ed. p. 287), but no authority for this
                    is quoted.</p></note> Being intended for the church, Douglas studied at the
                    university of St Andrews, where his name appears in the lists of alumni between
                    1489 and 1494. Having entered into holy orders, he was shortly afterwards
                    appointed rector of Hauch, or Prestonkirk, and parson of Linton in East
                    Lothian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The authority

                    Herriot, and by Dr Irving and others, rector of Hawick. His latter designation
                    is found in the MS. of his <hi rend="italic">Translation of Virgil</hi>
                    preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge.— <hi rend="italic">IVorks,</hi> i. p.
                    173.</p></note> In 1501 he was elected dean or provost of the collegiate church
                    of St Giles’s, Edinburgh, an office of dignity and emolument.</p>
                <p>In the battle of Flodden (1513), when James IV. and many of the Scottish nobility
                    and ecclesiastics were killed, the earl of Angus lost his two eldest sons, which
                    so affected him that he retired to St Mains, a religious house in Galloway,
                    where he soon after died. He was succeeded by his grandson, Archibald, a
                    handsome young nobleman, who attracted the attention of the widowed Queen
                    Margaret, sister of Henry VIII. of England, and they were married within eleven
                    months after the death of the king. While this precipitate connection incensed
                    the nobility and caused much jealousy of the Douglas family, it seemed to open
                    up a way for the preferment of Gavin Douglas. By the influence of the queen,
                    Douglas was “postulated” by the Pope to the abbacy of Aberbrothock, or Arbroath.
                    He met with such opposition, however, from a rival claimant, that his
                    appointment was never completed, and he was unable to obtain his abbacy. Douglas
                    was next recommended by the queen to the Pope for the archbishopric of St
                    Andrews, then vacant; and, relying upon the validity of this appointment, he
                    attempted by force to obtain possession of the castle of St Andrews. He was,
                    however, unsuccessful, and ultimately w as passed over in favour of Andrew
                    Forman. At length, by the united influence of the queen and the Pope, he was
                    nominated for the bishopric of Dunkeld, which shortly afterwards became vacant.
                    The people were so indignant at the marriage of the queen with Angus that the
                    Parliament deprived her of the regency of the kingdom and the charge of the
                    young King James V., and appointed the duke of Albany to be regent in her rooìn.
                    One of the first acts of the duke, who came from France to assume the reins of
                    government, was to bring Douglas to trial for intriguing for ecclesiastical
                    benefices with the queen and the pope without the sanction<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n396/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0396-0377"/> of Parliament. He was found guilty, and put in
                    prison in what he calls the “wyndy and richt vnplesant castell and royk of
                    Edinburgh,” where he continued for about a year. This harsh step of the duke of
                    Albany seems to have brought about a feeling of sympathy for Douglas. He was at
                    length set at liberty, and, to make some amends, the duke permitted him to be
                    consecrated bishop of Dunkeld.</p>
                <p>The marriage of the queen with the earl of Angus proved an unhappy one; and, in
                    consequence of his ill-treatment of her, the queen separated from her husband
                    and joined with the regent against the Douglases. Angus fled to the borders for
                    a time; and in 1521 his uncle Gavin was deprived of his bishopric. The bishop
                    then took shelter at the court of Henry VIII., but in 1522 he died of the plague
                    at London, in the forty-eighth year of his age. His remains were interred in the
                    Hospital Church of the Savoy.</p>
                <p>The works of Bishop Douglas, though not numerous, are important. They consist
                    of—(1) <hi rend="italic">The Police of Honour,</hi> a poem written in 1501,—an
                    allegorical description of many gorgeous cavalcades of famous persons trooping
                    to a magnificent palace somewhat like Chaucer’s Temple of Fame, in the execution
                    of which Douglas has displayed much originality of treatment; (2) Another
                    allegorical poem called <hi rend="italic">King Hart,</hi> or the heart of man,
                    descriptive of the progress of life from youth to age; (3) A short poem called
                    <hi rend="italic">Conscience;</hi> and (4) A <hi rend="italic">Translation of
                    the Aeneid of Virgü,</hi> with the supplemental book of Maphaeus Vegius. To each
                    book a short prologue is prefixed, of which the one before the 12 th,</p>
                <p>“Where splendid Douglas paints the blooming May,” is perhaps the finest effort of
                    his muse.</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Translation of Virgil,</hi> by which Douglas is best
                    known, is a work of which Scotland will always be proud, as it was the first
                    metrical translation of a classical author made in Britain, and the precursor of
                    many others. Although it is very diffuse, from the difficulty its author had in
                    adapting the Doric language of his country to the purposes of translation, by
                    the same reason it is a work of considerable philological value in tracing the
                    history of the literary language of Scotland. Although Douglas was the first
                    native writer who applied the name “Scottis” to the language he employed, he has
                    Scotticized many Latin words, and imported many expressions from the French;
                    while his admiration of Chaucer has induced him to avail himself of some of the
                    grammatical forms used by that poet. Still, his translation, written in the
                    broad and widely spread dialect common at an early period to the north of
                    England and Scotland, will always form one of the most important landmarks in
                    Scottish philology. In concluding it Douglas unfortunately took farewell of
                    poetical composition, and entered the arena of political strife, as the
                    following extract shows :—</p>
                <p>“Thus yp my pen and instrumentis full yore On Virgillis post I fix for

                <p>Several early MSS. of Douglas’s <hi rend="italic">Translation of Virgil</hi>
                    exist. One is preserved in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, copied by
                    his amanuensis, Matthew Geddes, from the bishop’s own papers. Two are in the
                    library of the university of Edinburgh, and one in that of the marquis of Bath
                    at Longleat. Of the printed editions one was issued by William Copland at London
                    in 1553, one was printed by Ruddiman at Edinburgh in 1711, and one was presented
                    to the members of the Bannatyne Club in 1839. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palice</hi><hi rend="italic">of Honour</hi> was first printed at London by
                    William Copland, without date, but probably in 1553; and an edition, printed by
                    “Johne Ros for Henrie Charteris,” appeared at Edinburgh in 1579, of which only
                    two copies are known to exist. This rare edition was reprinted for the Bannatyne
                    Club. The poems called <hi rend="italic">King Hart</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conscience</hi> exist in the Maitland MS. in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge.
                    The works of the bishop were first collected and published at Edinburgh in 1874,
                    under the editorship of Mr John Small, with a life prefixed, and a glossary
                    appended. (J. SM.)</p>
