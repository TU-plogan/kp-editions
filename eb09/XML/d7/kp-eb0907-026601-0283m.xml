                <p><label type="entry">DISTRESS</label> is one of the few cases in which the law
                    still permits an injured person to take his remedy into his own hands. Other
                    instances mentioned in the text-books are self-defence in the case of a personal
                    assault, the reseizure of property wrongfully taken away, the abatement of
                    nuisances, &amp;c. Distress differs from these as being a remedy for what is
                    really a breach of contract, and it is the only case of the kind in which such a
                    remedy is given. It is the right which the landlord has of seizing the personal
                    chattels of his tenant for non-payment of rent. Cattle <hi rend="italic">damage
                    feasant</hi> (doing damage or trespassing upon a neighbour’s land) may also be
                    <hi rend="italic">distrained,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> may be detained
                    until satisfaction be rendered for the injury they have done. The cattle or
                    other animals thus distrained are a mere pledge in the hands of the injured
                    person, who has only power to retain them until the owner appear to make
                    satisfaction for the mischief they have done. Distress for rent was also at one
                    time regarded as a mere pledge or security; but the remedy, having been found to
                    be speedy and efficacious, was rendered more perfect by enactments allowing the
                    thing taken to be sold. Blackstone notes that the law of distresses in this
                    respect “has been greatly altered within a few years last past.” The
                    legislature, in fact, converted an ancient right of personal redress into a
                    powerful remedy for the exclusive benefit of a single class of creditors, viz.,
                    landlords. Now that the relation of landlord and tenant in England has come to
                    be regarded as purely a matter of contract, the language of the law-books seems
                    to be singularly inappropriate. The defaulting tenant is a “wrong-doer,” the
                    landlord is the “injured party;” any attempt to defeat the landlord’s remedy by
                    carrying off distrainable goods is denounced as “fraudulent and knavish.” The
                    operation of the law has, as we shall point out, been mitigated in one important
                    respect by a recent Act, but it still remains an almost unique specimen of
                    one-sided legislation.</p>
                <p>At common law distress was said to be incident to <hi rend="italic">rent
                    service,</hi> and by particular reservation to rent charges; but by 4 Geo. II.
                    c. 28 it was extended to <hi rend="italic">rent seek, rents of assize,</hi> and
                    chief rents (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rent.)</hi> It is therefore a general
                    remedy for rent certain in arrear. All personal chattels are distrainable with
                    the following exceptions :—1, things in which there can be no property, as
                    animals <hi rend="italic">ferae naturae;</hi> 2, things in actual use; 3, things
                    delivered to a person following a public trade, as a horse sent to be shoed,
                    &amp;c.; 4, things already in the custody of the law; 5, money, unless placed in
                    a sealed bag; 6, things which cannot be restored in as good a plight as when
                    distrained; 7, fixtures; 8, beasts of the plough and instruments of husbandry;
                    9, instruments of a man’s trade or profession. These exceptions, it will be
                    seen, imply that the thing distrained is to be held as a pledge merely—not to be
                    sold. They also imply that in general any chattels found on the land in question
                    are to be available for the benefit of the landlord, whether they belong to the
                    tenant or not. This principle worked with peculiar harshness in the case of
                    lodgers, whose goods might be seized and sold for the payment of the rent due by
                    their landlord to his superior landlord. Now, however, by the Lodgers’ Goods
                    Protection Act (34 and 35 Vict. c. 79), where a lodger’s goods have been seized
                    by the superior landlord the lodger may serve him with a notice stating that the
                    intermediate landlord has no interest in the property seized, but that it is the
                    property or in the lawful possession of the lodger, and setting forth the amount
                    of the rent due by the lodger to his immediate landlord. On payment or tender of
                    such rent the landlord cannot proceed with the distress against the goods in
                    question. And originally the landlord could only seize things actually on the
                    premises,, so that the remedy might be defeated by the things being taken away.
                    But by 9 Anne c. 14, and 11 Geo. II. c. 19, he may follow things fraudulently or
                    clandestinely removed off the premises within thirty days after their removal,
                    unless they have been in the meantime <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> sold for
                    a valuable consideration.</p>

                <p>The sixth exception mentioned above was held to extend to sheaves of corn; but by
                    2 Will, and Mary c. 5, com, when reaped, as well as hay, was made subject to
                    distress.</p>
                <p>Excessive or disproportionate distress exposes the distrainer to an action, and
                    any irregularity formerly made the proceedings void <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">initio,</hi> so that the remedy was attended with considerable
                    risk. The statute 11 Geo. II. c. 19, before alluded to, in the interests of
                    landlords, protected distresses for <hi rend="italic">rent</hi> from the
                    consequences of irregularity. In all cases of distress for rent, if the owner do
                    not within five days replevy the same with sufficient security, the thing
                    distrained may be sold towards satisfaction of the rent and charges, and the
                    surplus, if any, must be returned to the owner. To “replevy” is when the person
                    distrained upon applies to the proper authority (the registrar of the county
                    court) to have the thing returned to his own possession, on giving security to
                    try the right of taking it in an action of replevin.</p>
                <p>Duties and penalties imposed by Act of Parliament are sometimes enforced by
                    distress.</p>
