                <p><label type="entry">DEER</label><hi rend="italic">(Cervidae),</hi> a family of
                    Ruminant Artiodactyle Mammals, distinguished by the possession of deciduous
                    branching horns or antlers, and by the presence of spots on the young. The
                    antlers are borne by the frontal bone, and generally begin to appear towards the
                    end of spring. At that season there is a marked determination of blood to the
                    head, the vessels surrounding the frontal eminences become temporarily enlarged,
                    and the budding horn grows with marvellous rapidity, the antlers of a full-grown
                    stag being produced in ten weeks. At first the horns are soft, vascular, and
                    highly sensitive, and are covered with a delicate hairy integument known as the
                    “velvet,” amply provided with blood-vessels. On attaining their full growth the
                    “burr,” consisting of a ring of osseous tubercles at the base of the horn, is
                    formed, and this by pressing upon, gradually cuts off the blood-vessels which
                    supply nutriment to the antlers. The velvety covering then begins to shrivel and
                    to peel off, its disappearance being hastened by the deer rubbing its antlers
                    against trees and rocks; while the grooves, which are seen to furrow the now
                    exposed surface, mark the place of the former blood-vessels. With the single
                    exception of the reindeer, antlers are confined to the male sex, and are fully
                    developed at the commencement of the rutting season, when they are brought into
                    use as offensive weapons in the sanguinary fights between the males for
                    possession of the females. When the season of love is over they are shed,
                    reappearing, however, in the following spring, and continuing to grow larger and
                    heavier until the deer attains its full growth. Whether the deer inhabiting the
                    warmer regions of the earth shed their antlers every year has been a matter of
                    considerable dispute, but in a recent work <hi rend="italic">(Highlands of
                    Central India)</hi> Forsyth states that he has convinced himself, from repeated
                    observations, that in Indian deer this operation does not take place annually.
                    In castrated animals the antlers either cease to appear or are merely
                    rudimentary, while any influence whatever which disturbs the general system
                    seems detrimental to their growth, as was observed in a case quoted by Darwin,
                    where the antlers of a Wapiti deer, formed during a voyage from America, were
                    singularly stunted, although the same individual afterwards, when living under
                    normal conditions, produced perfect horns. Spots are common to the young of so
                    many species of deer that their presence may fairly be regarded as a family
                    character. These spots persist through life in such forms as the Axis, or
                    Spotted Deer <hi rend="italic">(Axis</hi><hi rend="italic">maculata),</hi> but
                    in the majority of species they altogether disappear in the adult form. Darwin
                    considers that in all such cases the old have had their colour changed in the
                    course of time, while the young have remained but little altered, and this he
                    holds has been effected “through the principle of inheritance at corresponding
                    ages.” The lachrymal sinus, or “tearpit,” is present in most species of deer.
                    This consists of a cavity beneath each eye, capable of being opened at pleasure,
                    in which a waxy substance of a disagreeable odour is secreted, the purpose of
                    which is not yet clearly-ascertained. “The big round tears” which the
                    contemplative Jacques watched, as they</p>
                <p>“Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase,”</p>
                <p>is Shakespeare’s interpretation of the appearance presented by the motion of the
                    glistening edges of the tearpits in the stag. The deer family comprises 8 genera
                    and 52 species, distributed over all the great regions of the earth except the
                    Ethiopian, and living under the most diverse climatic conditions. Their total
                    absence from Africa south of the Sahara maybe due,as A. R. Wallace <hi
                    rend="italic">(Geographical Distribution of Animals)</hi> contends, to the
                    presence in the past, as now, of a great belt of dry and desert country
                    effectually preventing the immigration from Europe into Africa of such a
                    forest-frequenting group as the deer, while favouring the introduction of
                    antelopes, which attain their greatest development in that region. They are also
                    absent from Australia, although present in the Austro-Malayan region. The
                    following are some of the more remarkable species.</p>
                <p>The Red Deer or Stag <hi rend="italic">(Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >elaphus),</hi> the largest of the British deer, is a native of the temperate
                    regions of Europe and Northern Asia, inhabiting dense forests, or frequenting
                    moors and barren hill-sides as in Scotland. In England, where in feudal times it
                    was protected by forest laws, which set greater value on the life of a stag than
                    on that of a man, it was formerly abundant in all the royal forests. It is now
                    almost extinct in that country, as well as in Ireland, in the wild state. In
                    Scotland considerable herds are still to be found in the Highlands, and in
                    several of the Western Isles, although, owing probably to the diminished extent
                    of their feeding grounds, to the breeding in and in which takes place, and to
                    the anxiety of deerstalkers to secure the finest heads, the species is believed
                    to be degenerating. The finest specimens in this country are found in the deer
                    forests of Sutherlandshire, but these are inferior in size to those still
                    obtained in the east of Europe. The antlers of the Stag are rounded, and bear
                    three “tines,” or branches, and a crown consisting of three or more points. The
                    points increase in number with the age of the creature, and when 12 are present
                    it is known in Scotland as a “royal stag.” This number, however, is sometimes
                    exceeded, as in the case of a pair of antlers, weighing 74 ïb, from a stag
                    killed in Transylvania, which had 45 points. The antlers during the second year
                    consist of a simple unbranched stem, to which a tine or branch is added in each
                    succeeding year, until the normal development is attained, after which their
                    growth is somewhat irregular. The Red Deer is gregarious, the females and calves
                    herding together apart from the males except at' the rutting season, which
                    begins about the end of September and lasts for three weeks. During<pb

                    and are exceedingly fierce and dangerous. The period of gestation extends a few
                    days beyond eight months, and the hind usually produces a single calf. The stag
                    is remarkably shy and wary, and its sense of smell is exceedingly acute. In
                    former times it was hunted with horse, hound, and horn, and such is still the
                    practice in Devonshire and in Ireland, but in Scotland the old method has been
                    superseded by “stalking.” A full grown stag stands about 4 feet high at the
                    shoulders; its fur in summer is of a reddish-brown colour with a yellowish-white
                    patch on the buttocks, in winter the fur is much thicker and of a grayish
                    brown.</p>
                <p>The Wapiti Deer <hi rend="italic">(Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">canadensis)</hi>
                    may be regarded as the representative of the stag in North America. It stands,
                    however, a foot higher, and bears correspondingly heavier antlers. It occurs
                    chiefly in Canada, where it feeds on grass and the young shoots of the willow
                    and poplar. It has gained the reputation of being the most stupid of the cervine
                    family, but this may have partly arisen from the peculiar noise it makes,
                    corresponding to the “belling” of the stag, but in its case resembling very much
                    the braying of an ass. Its flesh is coarse, and is held, in little estimation by
                    the Indians, owing to the excessive hardness of the fat. It thrives well in
                    Britain, and would probably have been introduced had its venison been
                    better.</p>
                <p>The Fallow Deer <hi rend="italic">(Dama</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgaris),</hi> a
                    species semidomesticated in Britain, where it forms a principal ornament in
                    parks, still occurs wild in Western Asia, North Africa, and Sardinia, and in
                    prehistoric times appears to have abounded throughout Northern and Central
                    Europe. It stands 3 feet high at the shoulders, and its antlers, which are
                    cylindrical at the base, become palmated towards the extremity, the palmation
                    showing itself in the third year, and the antlers reaching their full growth in
                    the sixth. The fur is of a yellowish-brown colour (whence the name “fallow ”),
                    marked with white spots; there is, however, a uniformly brown variety found in
                    Britain, and said to have been brought by James I. from Norway on account of its
                    hardiness. The two varieties are said by Darwin to have been long kept together
                    in the Forest of Dean, but have never been known to mingle. The bucks and does
                    live apart except during the pairing season, and the doe produces one or two,
                    and sometimes three fawns at a birth. They are exceedingly fond of music, and a
                    herd of twenty bucks were, it is said, brought from Yorkshire to Hampton Court,
                    led by music from a bagpipe and violin. They feed on herbage, and are
                    particularly fond of horse chestnuts, which the males endeavour to procure by
                    striking at the branches with their antlers.</p>
                <p>The Roe Deer <hi rend="italic">(Capreolus capra)</hi> is the smallest of the
                    British <hi rend="italic">Cervidae,</hi> a full-grown buck standing not more
                    than 26 inches high at the shoulders. The antlers are short, upright, and deeply
                    furrowed, and differ from those of the preceding species in the absence of a
                    basal “tine.” The horns, in this, as well as in the other members of the deer
                    family, are largely employed in the manufacture of handles for cutlery, and the
                    parings from these were formerly used in the preparation of ammonia, hence the
                    name hartshorn still applied to that substance. The Roe Deer inhabits southern
                    and temperate Europe as far east as Syria, where it frequents woods, preferring
                    such as have a large growth of underwood, and are in the neighbourhood of
                    cultivated ground. This it visits in the evening in search of food; and where
                    roes are numerous, the damage done to growing crops is considerable. In going to
                    and from their feeding grounds they invariably follow the same track, and the
                    sportsman takes advantage of this habit to waylay them. In hunting the roe the
                    woods are driven by beaters, and they are shot down, as they speed along the
                    accustomed paths, by the ambushed hunter. The species was until recently
                    supposed to be monogamous, pairing in December, and the period of gestation only
                    extending over five months. This supposition arose from the fact that the foetus
                    in the doe was never found till January, and that then it was but slightly
                    developed, although the sexes were known to seek the society of each other in
                    July and August. From the investigations of Professor Bischoff of Giessen it
                    appears that the true rutting season of the Roe Deer is in July and August; but
                    that the ovum lies dormant until December, when it begins to develop in the
                    normal way; the period of gestation is thus extended to nearly nine months. It
                    was formerly abundant in all the wooded parts of Great Britain, but was
                    gradually driven out, until in Pennant’s time it did not occur south of
                    Perthshire. Since then the increase of plantations has led to its partial
                    restoration in the south of Scotland and north of England. It takes readily to
                    the water, and has been known to swim across lochs more than half a mile in
                    breadth.</p>
                <p>The Elk or Moose Deer <hi rend="italic">(Alces</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >malchis)</hi> is the largest of living <hi rend="italic">Cervidae,</hi> its
                    shoulders being higher than those of the horse. Its head measures 2 feet in
                    length, and its antlers, which are broadly palmated, often weigh from 50 to 60
                    lb; the neck is consequently short and stout. It is covered with a thick coarse
                    fur of a brownish colour, longest on the neck and throat. Its legs are long, and
                    it is thus unable to feed close to the ground—for which reason it browses on the
                    tops of low plants, the leaves of trees, and the tender shoots of the willow and
                    birch. Its antlers attain their full length by the fifth year, but in after
                    years they increase in breadth and in the number of branches, until fourteen of
                    these are produced. Although spending a large part of their lives in forests
                    they do not appear to suffer much inconvenience from the great expanse of their
                    antlers. In making their way among trees, the horns are carried horizontally to
                    prevent entanglement with the branches, and so skilful is the elk that “he will
                    not break or touch a dead twig when walking quietly.” His usual pace, according
                    to Lloyd <hi rend="italic">(Field Sports),</hi> is a shambling trot; but when
                    frightened he goes at a tremendous gallop. The elk is a shy and timorous
                    creature, fleeing at the sight of man This timidity, however, forsakes the male
                    at the rutting season, and he will then attack whatever animal comes in his way.
                    The antlers and hoofs are his principal weapons, and with a single blow from the
                    latter he has been known to kill a wolf. In North America the moose is tormented
                    in the hot season by mosquitoes, and it is when rendered furious by the attacks
                    of those insects that it can be most readily approached. The female seldom gives
                    birth to more than two fawns, and with these she retires into the deepest
                    recesses of the forest, the young remaining with her till their third year. The
                    elk ranges over the whole of Northern Europe and Asia, as far south as East
                    Prussia, the Caucasus, and North China, and over North America from the New
                    England States westward to British Columbia. It was formerly common in the
                    forests of Germany and France, and is still found in some parts of Sweden and
                    Norway, where it is strictly protected. The elk, according to Lloyd, is easily
                    domesticated, and was at one time employed in Sweden in drawing sledges. During
                    winter it is frequently seen alone, but in summer and autumn it may be met with
                    in small herds. In summer also it frequents morasses and low grounds, and takes
                    readily to the water; in winter it retires to the shelter of the forests, where
                    alone it can find suitable sustenance. Its flesh is considered excellent, and
                    its tongue and nose are regarded as delicacies.</p>
                <p>The Reindeer <hi rend="italic">(Tarandus rangifer),</hi> the only domesticated
                    species of deer, has a range somewhat similar to the elk, extending over the

                    north to New <pb break="no"

                    well-marked varieties differing greatly in size, and in the form of the
                    antlers—the largest forms occurring furthest north; while by many writers the
                    American reindeer, which has never been domesticated, is regarded as a distinct
                    species. The antlers, which are long and branching, and considerably palmated,
                    are present in both sexes, although in the female they are more slender and less
                    branched than in the males. In the latter they appear at a much earlier age than
                    in any other species of deer, and Darwin conjectures that in this circumstance a
                    key to their exceptional appearance in th© female may be found. The reindeer has
                    long been domesticated in Scandinavia, and is of indispensable importance to the
                    Lapland race, to whom it serves at once as a substitute for the horse, cow,
                    sheep, and goat. As a beast of burden it is capable of drawing a weight of 300
                    ïb, while its fleetness and endurance are still more remarkable. Harnessed to a
                    sledge it will travel without difficulty 100 miles a day over the frozen snow,
                    its broad and deeply cleft hoofs being admirably adapted for travelling over
                    such a surface. During summer the Lapland reindeer feeds chiefly on the young
                    shoots of the willow and birch; and as at this season migration to the coast
                    seems necessary to the well-being of the species, the Laplander, with his family
                    and herds, sojourns for several months in the neighbourhood of the sea. In
                    winter its food consists chiefly of the reindeer moss and other lichens, which
                    it makes use of its hoofs in seeking for beneath the snow. The wild reindeer
                    grows to a much greater size than the tame breed, but in Northern Europe the
                    former are being gradually reduced through the natives entrapping and
                    domesticating them. The tame breed found in Northern Asia is much larger than
                    the Lapland form, and is there used to ride on. There are two distinct varieties
                    of the American reindeer—the Barren Ground Caribou, and the Woodland Caribou.
                    The former, which is the larger and more widely distributed of the two,
                    frequents in summer the shores of the Arctic Sea, retiring to the woods in
                    autumn to feed on the tree and other lichens. The latter occupies a very limited
                    tract of woodland country, and, unlike the Barren Ground form, migrates
                    southward in spring. The American reindeers travel in great herds, and being
                    both unsuspicious and curious they fall ready victims to the bow and arrow or
                    the cunning snare of the Indian, to whom their carcases form the chief source of
                    food, clothing, tents, and tools. Remains of the reindeer are found in caves and
                    other PostPliocene deposits as far south as the south of France, this boreal
                    species having been enabled to spread over Southern Europe, owing to the access
                    of cold during the glacial period. It appears to have continued to exist in
                    Scotland down even to the 12 th century.</p>
                <p>The Muntjac <hi rend="italic">(Cervulus</hi><hi rend="italic">vaginalis)</hi> has
                    its two pronged horns placed on permanent bony pedestals 3 inches in length, and
                    the male is further furnished with long canines in the upper jaw. It is a native
                    of Java, where it may occasionally be seen in the inclosures of Europeans, but,
                    according to Dr Horsfield, it is impatient of confinement, and not fit for the
                    same degree of domestication as the stag. Its flesh forms excellent venison.
                    There are four species of muntjacs inhabiting the forest districts from India to
                    China, and southward to Java and the Philippine Islands.</p>
                <p>The Musk Deer <hi rend="italic">(Moschus</hi><hi rend="italic">moschiferus)</hi>
                    differs from the true deer in the absence of horns, and in the presence of the
                    musk-bag, and is now usually regarded as the type of a distinct family— <hi
                    rend="italic">Moschidae.</hi> The young, however, are spotted as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cervidae,</hi> and it is doubtful whether the differences already
                    mentioned are sufficient to warrant its separation from the other deer. Canine
                    teeth are present in the upper and lower jaws of both sexes, those in the upper
                    jaw of the male being longest. It is a native of the highlands of Central Asia
                    from the Himalayas to Peking, being found at an elevation of 8000 feet, and in
                    its habit resembling such mountain species as the chamois. It is exceedingly shy
                    and difficult of approach, and is hunted solely for its musk—an unctuous brown
                    secretion, possessing a most penetrating and enduring odour, extremely
                    disagreeable when present in large quantities, but forming a pleasant perfume
                    when used sparingly. The substance is contained in a bag, almost the size of a
                    hen’s egg, situated on the abdomen, and secreted in greatest quantity during the
                    rutting season. The hunters cut off the bag, and close the opening, and after
                    drying, it is ready for sale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fossil Deer.—</hi> Remains of many extinct species of deer
                    belonging to existing genera have been found in PostPliocene and other recent
                    deposits; while the remains of extinct genera occur in both hemispheres, but do
                    not extend further back than the Upper Miocene. The deer family, so far as yet
                    discovered, is thus of comparatively recent origin, and is probably, as Mr
                    Wallace suggests, an Old World group, which during the Miocene period passed to
                    North America and subsequently to the southern continent. The best preserved
                    species of fossil deer is the gigantic Irish Elk <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">megaceros).</hi> It is not a true elk, but is
                    intermediate between the fallow deer and reindeer, and is found in great
                    abundance and perfection in the lake deposits of Ireland. It occurs also in the
                    Isle of Man, in Scotland, and in some of the English caverns. The antlers of a
                    specimen of this species in Dublin weigh about 80 S&gt;, and their span is twice
                    that of the living elk. It appears to have been contemporaneous with the extinct
                    mammoth and rhinoceros, but it is still doubtful whether it co-existed with man.
                    In Kent’s Hole, near Torquay, the base of an antler, partly gnawed, was found;
                    and this, according to Owen, probably belonged to the most gigantic of our
                    English cervine animals. (J. ßi.)</p>
