                    and the strict Calvinists, led by Francis Gomar, his professorial colleague at
                    Leyden; and, in order to decide their disputes, a synodical conference was
                    proposed, but Arminius died before it could be held. At the conference held at
                    the Hague in 1610, the Arminians addressed a remonstrance to the States-general
                    in the form of five articles, which henceforth came to be known as the five
                    points of Arminianism. This conference had no influence in reconciling the
                    opposing parties, and another, held at Delft in the year 1613, was equally
                    unsuccessful. In 1614, at the instance of the Armin Lan party, an edict was
                    passed by the States-general, in which toleration of the opinions of both
                    parties was declared, and further controversy forbidden; but this act only
                    served, by rousing the jealousy of the Calvinists, to fan the controversial
                    flame into greater fury. Gradually the dispute pervaded all classes of society,
                    and in nearly all the towns both parties began to bold large meetings, and to
                    indulge in threatening words and gestures, until finally, in Nov. 1617, Prince
                    Maurice of Orange, in order finally to decide the controversy, called a synod
                    which met at Dort in Nov. 1618 This synod was strictly national—called by the
                    national authority to decide a national dispute, and not intended to have more
                    than a national influence. The foreign deputies were invited to attend, only to
                    assist by their advice in the settlement of a controversy which concerned the
                    Netherland church alone, and which the Netherland church alone could decide. At
                    the fourth sitting it was decided to cite Simon Episcopius and twelve other
                    Remonstrants to appear within 14 days before the synod, to state and justify
                    their doctrines. It was also agreed to allow the Arminian deputies to take part
                    in the deliberations, only on condition that they forbore to consult with, or in
                    any way assist, their cited brethren, but this they refused. During the interval
                    between the citation and the appearance of the accused, the professorial members
                    of the synod were instructed to prepare themselves to be able to coufute the
                    Arminian errors, and the synod occupied itself with deliberations as to a new
                    translation of the Bible, for which a commission was named, made arrangements
                    regarding the teaching of catechisms, and granted permission to the missionaries
                    of the East Indies to baptize such children of heathen parents as were admitted
                    into their families. At the 25th sitting Eρiscoρius and the others cited
                    appeared, when Episcopius surprised the deputies by a bold and outspoken defence
                    of his views, and even went so far as to say that the synod, by excluding the
                    Arminian deputies, could now only be regarded as a schismatic assembly. The
                    Remonstrants were asked to file copious explanations of the five points in
                    dispute, but objecting to the manner in which they were catechized, they were,
                    at the 57th sitting, dismissed from the synod as convicted “liars and
                    deceivers.” The synod then proceeded in their absence to judge them from their
                    published writings, and came to the conclusion that as ecclesiastical rebels and
                    trespassers they should be deprived of all their offices. The synodical decision
                    in regard to the five points, and the sentence against the Remonstrants was, at
                    the 144th sitting, read in Latin before a large audience in the great church.
                    The Remonstrants were required to subscribe the condemnation, and many of them
                    refusing were banished. The synod was concluded on 29th April 1619, by a
                    magnificent banquet given by the chief magistrate of Dort.</p>
