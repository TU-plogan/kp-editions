                    wealth. From Orleans, where he was born, he was taken to Paris about 1521; and
                    after enjoying there the instruction of Nicolas Bérauld, the teacher of Coligni,
                    he proceeded in 1526 to Padua. The death of his friend and master, Simon de
                    Villanova, led him, in 1529, to accept the post of secretary to Jean de Langeac,
                    French ambassador to the republic of Venice; but he managed, in spite of his new
                    occupation, to attend the lectures of the Venetian scholar Battista Egnazio, and
                    to write Latin love poems to some Venetian Elena, who died, however, before he
                    left the city. Returning to France in 1530 he proceeded to Toulouse for the
                    study of law; but there he soon became involved in the violent disputes then
                    raging between the different “nations” of the university, roused the anger of
                    the public authorities by his keen condemnation of some of their measures, was
                    thrown into prison, ran the risk of being assassinated, and was finally banished
                    by a decree of the <hi rend="italic">parlement.</hi> In 1535 he entered the
                    lists against Erasmus in the famous Ciceronian controversy, by publishing,
                    through Sebastian Gryphe at Lyons, a <hi rend="italic">Dialogus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Imitatione Ciceroniana;</hi> and the
                    following year saw the appearance of his two folio volumes <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentariorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Linguae Latina.</hi> In 1537 he obtained
                    from Francis I. a privilege to print during ten years any works in Latin, Greek,
                    Italian, or French which were the product of his owupen or had received his
                    supervision; and accordingly, on his release from an imprisonment occasioned by
                    his justifiable homicide of a painter Campanini, he commenced at Lyons his
                    typographical and editorial labours. That he was not altogether unaware of the
                    dangers to which he was exposed from the bigotry and fierce-lιeartedness of the
                    times is shown not only by the tone of his mottoes— <hi rend="italic">Preserve
                    moi, Seigneur,</hi><hi rend="italic">des calomnies des hommes,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Durior</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spectatae</hi><hi rend="italic">virtutis quam incognitae conditio—</hi> but
                    also by the fact that he endeavoured first of all to conciliate the theological
                    wolves by publishing a <hi rend="italic">Cato christianus,</hi> or Christian
                    moralist, in which he made profession of his creed. The catholicity of his
                    literary appreciation, in spite of his ultra-Ciceronianism, was soon displayed
                    by the variety of the works which proceeded from his press—ancient and modem,
                    sacred and secular, from the New Testament in Latin to Rabelais in French. But
                    long before the term of his privilege expired his labours were interrupted by
                    the machinations of his enemies, who neither shrank from bringing against him
                    what was then the most terrible of all accusations, nor relented in their
                    pursuit till their purpose was completely realized. From a first imprisonment of
                    fifteen months their victim was released by the advocacy of Pierre Duchatel,
                    bishop of Tulle; and from a second he escaped by his own ingenuity; but,
                    venturing back from Piedmont, whither he had fled in order that he might print
                    at Lyons the letters by which he appealed for justice to the king of France, the
                    queen of Navarre, and the parlement of Paris, he was again arrested, hurried up
                    to the capital, branded as a relapsed atheist by the theological faculty of the
                    Sorbonne, and on the 3d of August 1546 put to the torture, strangled, and burned
                    in the Place Maubert. On his way thither he is said to have composed the punning
                    pentameter— <hi rend="italic">Non</hi><hi rend="italic">dolet</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ipse</hi><hi rend="italic">Dolet, sed pia turba dolet.</hi> As if
                    in prophetic mockery of their own proceedings, the doctors of the Sorbonne based
                    their decision on the three words <hi rend="italic">Rien</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du tout</hi> or “Nothing at all,” inserted by Dolet in a passage of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Axiochus</hi> of Plato, which even without them denied, if not so
                    emphati cally, the immortality of the soul; and this they did in spite of the
                    fact that according to their own showing, his works must have been full of most
                    damnable heresies, and had already in 1543 furnished excellent fuel to the
                    hangman’s fire. Whether Dolet is to be classed with the representatives of
                    Protestantism or with the advocates of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0362-0345"/> anti-Christian rationalism has been frequently
                    disputed; by the principal Protestants of his own time he was not recognized,
                    and by Calvin he is formally condemned, along with Agrippa and his master
                    Villanova, as having uttered execrable blasphemies against the Son of God; but,
                    to judge by the religious character of a large number of the books which he
                    translated or published, such a condemnation is altogether misplaced. His
                    repeated advocacy of the reading of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is
                    especially noticeable.</p>
