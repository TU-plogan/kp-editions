                <p><label type="entry">DYSPEPSIA</label> (from δυς-, and 7r∈7rτ&lt;∣), to digest),
                    or Indigestion, is one of the most common of all complaints, but, from its
                    intimate connection with various other morbid conditions, the term is somewhat
                    vaguely employed. There are comparatively few diseases of any moment where some
                    of the phenomena of dyspepsia are not present as associated symptoms, and not
                    unfrequently these exist to such a degree as to mask the real disease of which
                    they are only complications. This is especially the case in many organic
                    diseases of the alimentary canal, in which the symptoms of dyspepsia are often
                    the most prominent. In its restricted meaning, however (and it is to this that
                    the present brief notice applies), the term is used to describe a functional
                    derangement of the natural process of digestion, apart from any structural
                    change in the organs concerned in the act. The causes of this ailment are very
                    numerous, but are generally regarded as bearing reference either to the food,
                    the condition of the gastric juice, or the movements of the stomach during the
                    process of digestion.</p>
                <p>Among the causes connected with the food are not only the indulgence in
                    indigestible articles of diet, but the too common practice of eating too much of
                    what may be otherwise quite wholesome and digestible, irregular or too frequent
                    meals, and imperfect mastication of the food. Substances which are badly cooked,
                    or too hot or too cold, the excessive use of condiments, the partaking of too
                    much liquid with a meal, and over indulgence in tea, tobacco, and alcoholic
                    liquors are likewise fruitful sources of dyspepsia. Morbid states of the gastric
                    juice readily give rise to dyspepsia. This fluid may be diminished in quantity,
                    or be altered in character by the presence of too much acid, or by deficiency in
                    its active digestive principle, pepsine. These conditions are often connected
                    with actual disease of the mucous membrane of the stomach, but they may also
                    exist in advanced life, in depraved states of the general health (as in
                    rheumatism, gout, Bright’s disease, anaemia, &lt;fcc.), or in constitutions
                    weakened by fatigue, over-anxiety, or debauchery. It must, however, be borne in
                    mind that not only the gastric juice but the other digestive fluids, such as the
                    saliva, bile, pancreatic and intestinal juices, may by defects in their amount
                    or quality materially hinder the process of digestion. Further, dyspepsia may be
                    the result of a perverted condition of the natural movements of the stomach
                    during digestion,—whereby, on the one hand, owing to increased activity of its
                    propulsive power, the food may be carried into the intestines in a half
                    dissolved state, and give rise to many of the symptoms of indigestion, or, on
                    the other hand, from a weakened or atonic state of the muscular coats of the
                    stomach digestion may be retarded, and the food retained and excite discomfort
                    and pain consequent on its undergoing fermentive and putrefactive changes.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of dyspepsia, even when due to a like cause, are so numerous and
                    diversified in different individuals that probably no description could exactly
                    represent them as they occur in any given case. All that can be here attempted
                    is to mention some of the more prominent morbid phenomena usually present in
                    greater or less degree.</p>
                <p>When the attack is dependent on some error in diet, and the dyspepsia
                    consequently more of an acute character, there is often pain followed with
                    sickness and vomiting of the offensive matters, after which the patient soon
                    regains his former healthy state. What are commonly known as “bilious attacks”
                    are frequently of this character. In the more chronic cases of dyspepsia the
                    symptoms are somewhat different. A sensation of discomfort come3 on shortly
                    after a meal, and is more of the nature of weight and distension in the stomach
                    than of actual pain, although this too may be present. These feelings may come
                    on after each meal, or only after certain meals, and they may arise irrespective
                    of the kind of food taken, or only after certain articles of diet. As in most of
                    such cases the food is long retained in the stomach, it is apt to undergo
                    fermentive changes, one of the results of which is the accumulation of gases
                    which cause flatulence and eructations of an acid or foul character.
                    Occasionally quantities of hot, sour, tasteless, or bitter fluid, or mouthfuls
                    of half-digested food, regurgitate from the stomach. Temporary relief may be
                    obtained when another meal is taken, but soon the uncomfortable sensations
                    return as before. The appetite is often diminished, but may be little impaired;
                    the tongue is in general large and flabby, and more or less furred. In some
                    forms of this complaint, however, particularly where there is great irritability
                    of the stomach, the tongue is abnormally red. There is generally obstinate
                    constipation.</p>
                <p>Numerous disagreeable and painful sensations in other parts are experienced, and
                    are indeed often more distressing than the merely gastric symptoms. Pains in the
                    chest, shortness of breathing, palpitation, headache, giddiness, affections of
                    vision, coldness of the extremities, and general languor are common
                    accompaniments of dyspepsia; while the nervous phenomena are specially
                    troublesome in the form of sleeplessness, irritability, despondency, and
                    hypochondriasis.</p>
                <p>A disease of this nature, interfering as it does with the assimilative and
                    nutritive processes, must necessarily exert an evil influence on the general
                    health, and there is reason to believe that many serious ailments owe their
                    origin to persistent dyspepsia. This is notably the case as regards phthisis;
                    for although dyspeptic symptoms often present themselves as complications
                    induced by the disease, yet it cannot be doubted that long-continued
                    indigestion, particularly in youth, must have the effect of favouring the
                    occurrence of consumption in persons at all predisposed to it.</p>
                <p>Dyspepsia appears to be in some cases hereditary. In its chronic form, this
                    disease may long resist treatment, but it is always in some measure influenced
                    by the diet and regimen and by the occupation of the patient. As a rule persons
                    of sedentary pursuits and brain-workers suffer more from dyspepsia than those
                    leading active lives.</p>
                <p>As regards <hi rend="italic">treatment</hi> only a few general observations can
                    be made. The careful arrangement of the diet is a matter of first importance.
                    Quantity must be regulated by the digestive capabilities of the individual, his
                    age, and the demands made upon his strength by work. There is little doubt that
                    the danger is in most instances on the side of excess, and the rule which
                    enjoins the cessation from eating before the appetite is satisfied is a safe one
                    for dyspeptics. Due time, too, must be given for the digestion of a meal, and
                    from four to six hours are in general required for this purpose. Long fasts,
                    however, are nearly as hurtful as too frequent meals. Of no less importance is
                    the kind of food taken, and on this point those who suffer from indigestion must
                    ever exercise the greatest care. Every article of diet which past experience has
                    proved to disagree should be shunned, since what may appear trifling
                    indiscretions to this respect are often productive of great and prolonged
                    suffering. The tables which have been framed to show the relative disestibility
                    of various kinds of food, and which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n608/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0608-0587"/> have been founded largely on the observations of
                    Dr Beaumont in the celebrated case of Alexis St Martin, are only valuable within
                    certain limits when applied to the treatment of dyspepsia. It must be borne in
                    mind that idiosyncrasy often plays an important part in digestion, some persons
                    being unable to partake without injury of substances which are generally
                    regarded as wholesome and digestible. Difficulty, too, is often experienced in
                    dealing with dyspeptics from their aversion to, or want of appetite for, those
                    forms of diet which appear most suitable for them. Experience has shown that in
                    this complaint no particular kind of food is absolutely to be relied on, but
                    that in general the best diet is one of a mixed animal and vegetable kind simply
                    but well cooked. The partaking of many dishes, of highly seasoned or salted
                    meats, raw vegetables, newly baked bread, pastry, and confectionery, are all
                    well known common causes of dyspepsia, and should be avoided. When even the
                    simple diet usually taken is found to disagree, it may be necessary to change it
                    temporarily for a still lighter form, such a3 a milk diet, and that even in very
                    moderate quantity.</p>
                <p>General hygienic measures are highly important, since whatever improves the state
                    of the health will have a favourable influence on digestion. Hence regular
                    exercise in the open air, early rising, and the cold bath are to be strongly
                    recommended.</p>
                <p>The medicinal remedies for dyspepsia are exceedingly numerous, and a few only of
                    them can be mentioned. Attacks brought on by errors in diet are generally
                    relieved by small doses of rhubarb and bismuth, and by the use of small
                    quantities of light and bland food. In chronic dyspepsia the treatment must
                    depend on the cause of the disorder, so far as that can be ascertained. When the
                    dyspepsia is of the atonic form without much irritability of stomach, bitter
                    tonics such as nux vomica, calumba, gentian, or quassia, along with some of the
                    mineral acids taken before, with, or immediately after a meal will be found
                    highly serviceable; while on the other hand, when there is gastric irritation
                    with acid eructations, sickness, and pain, the medicinal hydrocyanic acid along
                    with bismuth, and antacids taken after food will often afford relief. Pepsine is
                    a remedy of undoubted value in many cases of dyspepsia, and appears to supply
                    the place of that ingredient of the gastric juice when it is deficient in
                    amount. It may be given along with a meal, alone, or in conjunction with diluted
                    hydrochloric acid, which also is a remedy of great efficacy in indigestion.
                    Strict attention must ever be paid to the regular action of the bowels, and
                    where laxatives are required an aloetic dinner pill, or, what is often better,
                    one of the mineral bitter waters (such as that of Frederickshall) which are now
                    so commonly used, should be had recourse to.</p>
                <p>The employment of alcoholic stimulants to assist digestion is largely resorted to
                    both with and without medical advice. While it seems probable that in certain
                    cases of atonic dyspepsia, particularly in the feeble and aged, the moderate
                    administration of alcohol has the effect of stimulating the secretion of gastric
                    juice, and is an important adjuvant to other remedies, the advantages of its
                    habitual use as an aid to digestion by the young and otherwise healthy is more
                    than questionable, and it will generally be found that among them those are
                    least troubled with indigestion who abstain from it. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
