                    city of Tentyra, which was the capital of the Tentyrite nome and the seat of a
                    famous temple dedicated to Athor, the Egyptian Venus. The temple, which is
                    remarkable as the first well-preserved and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0089-0078"/> unencumbered building of the kind to be seen on a
                    voyage up the Nile, lies about a mile and a half from the left bank of the
                    river, within a square inclosure formed by four crude-brick walls, each 1000
                    feet in length, and entered by means of a stone-built gateway, adorned with
                    sculptures representing Domitian and Trajan engaged in acts of worship. The
                    portico of the temple is about 135 feet in width, and is architecturally one of
                    the richest and most beautiful structures of its class. It is supported by 24
                    columns, four deep, nearly 50 feet in height, and having a diameter of more than
                    7 feet at the thickest part. The capitals have sculptured on each of their four
                    sides a full face of Athor, crowned by a small shrine or temple. The sculptures,
                    which are of less merit than the architecture, represent offerings made by some
                    of the earlier Caesars; and on the ceiling are various mystical subjects,
                    probably of an astronomical import, and the famous quadrangular zodiac, which
                    will be referred to again in the latter part of this article. Passing through
                    the back wall of the portico (which was at one time the front wall of the
                    temple) the visitor enters a hall supported by three column^ on each side, with
                    cup-shaped capitals beneath those formed by the temple-crowned faces of Athor;
                    and thence, proceeding right onwards through two similar halls, he reaches the
                    sanctuary, which is isolated by a passage running all round. On each side of the
                    temple are many small apartments, and two entrance-ways from the exterior, as
                    well as singular inclined passages in the walls, two of which are entered from
                    the sides of the portico. All the chambers and passages, except the two last
                    mentioned, are profusely covered with sculptures and inscriptions of a religious
                    character, chiefly depicting and narrating the piety of the sovereigns by whom
                    the temple was erected. The royal names have not always been filled in, but,
                    where they have been sculptured, they are generally those of the last Cleopatra,
                    and Caesarion, her son by Julius Caesar. A staircase on the left-hand side of
                    the second chamber, behind the portico, conducts to the roof of the temple. Here
                    are a sort of chapel and some small chambers, one of which is very interesting,
                    because its sculptures relate to the story of Osiris. The exterior of the temple
                    is as completely covered with sculptures as the interior. Among the figures
                    represented there are those of Cleopatra and Caesarion; but they cannot be
                    supposed to bear any resemblance, since they belong not alone to a conventional
                    art, but almost to its lowest period. There are two smaller temples within the
                    same inclosure as the great temple of Athor, one dedicated to Isis in the
                    thirty-first year of Augustus, and the other usually known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Typhonium,</hi> from the representations of Typhon on the capitals
                    of its columns, but probably connected with the worship of Athor.</p>
                <p>The name Denderah, in Coptic <hi rend="italic">Tentore,</hi> and in Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">Tentyra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tentyris,</hi> used to be
                    regarded as equivalent to <hi rend="italic">Thy-n Athor,</hi> “the abode of
                    Athor;” but, according to an hypothesis started by Brugsch, and since proved by
                    the investigations of Dümichen, it is now explained as “the Land of the
                    Hippopotamus” <hi rend="italic">(Tan-ta-rer),</hi> in allusion to the use of
                    this animal as a symbol of the goddess Isis, who is regularly identified with
                    Athor in the Denderah inscriptions. The sacred name was An, and a list is still
                    extant of 136 substitutes or <hi rend="italic">epitheta ornantia,</hi> such as
                    the house of enlightened souls, the house of gladness, the house of the weeping
                    and laughing of the sun-god Ra. Though, as already indicated, the present
                    temples of Denderah belong to the latest period of Egyptian art, the original
                    occupation <hi rend="italic">oî</hi> the site for sacred buildings dates from
                    the earliest times. According to an inscription discovered and published by
                    Dümichen, who spent three months in personal exploration of the ruins, a
                    restoration of the temple w as effected by I both mes III. of the 18 th dynasty,
                    in keeping with an ancient plan belonging to the reign of Chufu, which had been
                    found, in the time of Pheops, “in the interior of a wall of the Southern
                    House.”</p>
                <p>The people of Tentyra were remarkable for their hostility to the crocodile and
                    its worshippers; and in their attacks on the reptile they displayed so much
                    audacity and skill that the Romans in the time of Strabo brought a number of
                    them over to Italy as a new attraction for the amphitheatre. In modern times the
                    name of Denderah has become especially famous on account of the two designs
                    known respectively as the circular and the quadrangular zodiac, which have been
                    the subject of the most elaborate discussion among Egyptologists. The former was
                    discovered by General Desaix about the end of last century, and at length in
                    1820 removed by Μ. Lelorrain to Paris, where it was purchased by the Government
                    for 150,000 francs, and deposited in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Impériale</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the latter, first observed by Μ. Dupuis,
                    a member of the French commission, is still in its original position, as,
                    instead of occupying a comparatively small and portable disk, it forms, as
                    already indicated, the decoration of two extremities of the temple portico, and
                    thus consists of two corresponding halves. Copies of both the zodiacs have
                    frequently been made, and are easily accessible in F. C. Lauth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Zodiaques</hi><hi rend="italic">de Denderah,</hi> Munich,
                    1865, a memoir in which he maintains that both designs are commemorative
                    calendars of the Greco-Roman period.</p>
