                    rend="smallcaps">Count</hi> (1753-1837), a French general and military
                    historian, was born at Montpellier of a noble family, on the 23d November 1753.
                    He joined the army in 1773, and entered upon active service in 1780, as
                    aide-de-camp to Rochambeau commander-in-chief of the army sent to aid the
                    Americans in their war against England. He had a share in all the principal
                    engagements that occurred during a period of nearly two years. Shortly after the
                    capture of Yorktown, in which he took part, he joined the expedition under
                    Vandreuil intended to make an attack on Jamaica. On the conclusion of peace with
                    England in 1783 he returned to France, where he soon afterwards received his
                    commission as major. In 1784 he was sent to explore the archipelago and the
                    coasts of Turkey, a service in which he was engaged for two years, and which he
                    performed with great thoroughness. He was present at the siege of Amsterdam in
                    1787, where he cooperated with the Dutch against the Prussians. At the
                    Revolution he acted with Lafayette and the constitutional liberal party, whose
                    aim was to effect a complete reform without abolishing monarchy. He was
                    intrusted by the Assembly with the command of the escort which conducted Louis
                    XVI. to Paris from Varennes, where he had been arrested. In 1791 he was
                    appointed to a command at Metz, where he rendered important service in improving
                    the discipline of the troops, and in organizing the first battalion of horse
                    artillery that was formed in France. Chosen a member of the Legislative Assembly
                    in the same year by the department of Seine-et-Oise, he advocated with firmness
                    and eloquence the principles and policy of the constitutional party to which he
                    belonged. In the following year he was elected president of the Assembly. "When
                    the extreme republicans gained the ascendancy, however, he became a marked man,
                    and judged it prudent to make his escape to England. Returning after a brief
                    interval under the apprehension that his father-in-law would be held responsible
                    for his absence, he arrived in Paris in the midst of the Reign of Terror, and
                    had to flee to Switzerland to avoid the fate of his friends Bamave and Duport
                    Dutertre. Soon after his return to France he was elected a member of the Council
                    of Ancients. On the triumph of the extreme revolutionists in 1797, Dumas, being
                    proscribed as a monarchist, made his escape to Holstein, where he enjoyed the
                    hospitality of Count Stolberg. During this exile he wrote the first part of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Précis des Événements Militaires,</hi> which was published
                    anonymously in monthly numbers at Hamburg in 1800. Recalled to his native
                    country when Bonaparte became first consul, he declined the prefecture of
                    Bordeaux, preferring a military appointment. Intrusted with the organization of
                    the army of reserve at Dijon, he was on the completion of the task appointed
                    chief of the staff to that army. In 1801 he was nominated a councillor of state,
                    and in the same year he was chosen to propose and defend in the Corps Legislatif
                    the formation of the Legion of Honour, of which order he afterwards (1810)
                    became grand officer. Attached to the household of Joseph Bonaparte, Dumas went
                    in 1806 to Naples, where he became minister of war. On the transfer of Joseph to
                    the throne of Spain, and the accession of Murat to that of Naples, Dumas
                    rejoined the French army, with which he served in Spain during the campaign of
                    1808, and in Germany during that of 1809. After the battle of Wagram, Dumas was
                    employed in negotiating the armistice, and he was left by Napoleon at Vienna in
                    order to superintend the evacuation of Austrian territory by the French troops.
                    In the disastrous Russian expedition of 1812 he held the post of
                    intendant-general of the army, which involved the charge of the entire
                    administrative department. He shared the horrors of the retreat from Moscow, and
                    the privations he suffered brought on a dangerous illness, from which, however,
                    he recovered after a brief interval of repose at Dantzic. Resuming his duties as
                    intendant-general, he took part in the battles of Lützen and Bautzen. When the
                    decisive defeat of Leipsic occurred, Dumas, who was stationed with the besieged
                    army in Dresden, was employed to negotiate the unavoidable capitulation, the
                    terms of which, though agreed to by the opposing general, were not ratified by
                    the allied sovereigns. Dumas, who had gone to report the matter to the emperor,
                    was consequently arrested and imprisoned in Hungary until peace was concluded in
                    1814. On the accession of Louis XVIII. Dumas received several important
                    commissions in connection with the administration of the army. He had the entire
                    confidence of the king, and would have been appointed minister of marine but for
                    the adverse influence of the party that had been in exile during the empire.
                    When Napoleon returned from Elba, Dumas at first kept himself in retirement, but
                    he was persuaded by Joseph Bonaparte to present himself to the emperor, who
                    intrusted him with the task of organizing the National Guards. This brought him
                    into disfavour with the Bourbons, and he was obliged to retire upon half-pay
                    when Louis XVIII. was restored to the throne. He devoted his leisure to the
                    continuation of his <hi rend="italic">Précis des Événements Militaires,</hi> of
                    which nineteen volumes, embracing the history of the war from 1798 to the Peace
                    of Tilsit in 1807, appeared between 1817 and 1826. A growing weakness of sight,
                    ending in total blindness, prevented him from carrying the work farther, but he
                    translated Napier’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Peninsular War</hi> aβ a
                    sort of continuation to it. In .1818 Dumas was restored to favour through the
                    influence of Gouvion Saint-Cyr, and admitted a member of the Council of State.
                    In 1828 he was chosen a deputy by the first arrondissement of Paris. After the
                    revolution of 1830, in the events of which he took an active part, Dumas was
                    created a peer of France, and re-entered the Council of State as president of
                    the war committee. He died at Paris on the 16th October 1837. Besides the <hi
                    rend="italic">Précis des Événements Militaires,</hi> which forms a valuable
                    source for the history of the period of which it treats, Dumas wrote
                    autobiographical reminiscences under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souvenirs,</hi> which were published posthumously by his son (3 vols.
                    1839).</p>
