                    Delft in 1560, and thence passed successively to Louvain, Douai, and Paris. Here
                    he studied Greek under Peter Dorat, professor at the College Royal, and became
                    acquainted with the Chancellor L’Hôpital, Turnebus, Ronsard, and other eminent
                    men. On his return to Holland in 1565 he married. His name stands in the list of
                    nobles who in that year formed a league against Philip IL; but he does not
                    appear to have taken any active part in public affairs till 1572, when he was
                    sent as head of an embassy to England. Two years later he was intrusted with the
                    government and defence of Leyden, then besieged by the Spaniards; and in this
                    arduous post he displayed rare intelligence, fortitude, and practical wisdom. On
                    the foundation of the university of Leyden by William 1. of Orange, Dousa was
                    appointed first curator, and this office he held for nearly thirty years.
                    Through his friendships with foreign scholars he drew to Leyden many illustrious
                    teachers and professors. After the assassination of William I. in 1584, Dousa
                    came privately to England to seek the aid of Queen Elizabeth, and in the
                    following year he was sent formally for the same purpose. About the same time he
                    was appointed keeper of the Dutch archives, and the opportunities thus afforded
                    him of literary and historical research he turned to good account. In 1591,
                    being named a member of the States-General, he removed to the Hague. Heavy blows
                    fell upon him in the deaths of his eldest son in 1597 and of his second son
                    three years later. A bitterer trial still was the misconduct of another son.
                    Dousa was author of several volumes of Latin verse and of philological notes on
                    Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, Petronius Arbiter, and Plautus. But his principal
                    work is the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Holland,</hi> which first appeared in a
                    metrical form in 1599, and was published in prose, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bataviae Hollandiaeque</hi><hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> in
                    1601. This work had been begun by his eldest son. Dousa also took part, as
                    editor or contributor, in various other publications. He died at Noordwyck,
                    October 8, 1604, and was interred at the Hague; but no monument was erected to
                    his memory until 1792, when one of his descendants placed a tomb in his honour
                    in the church of Noordwyck.</p>
