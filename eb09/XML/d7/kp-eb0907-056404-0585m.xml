                    (1761-1812), pianist and composer, was born at Czaslau, in Bohemia, on the 9th
                    February 1761. His father, Johann Joseph Dussek, a musician of high reputation,
                    was organist and choir-master in the collegiate church of Czaslau, and several
                    other members of the family were distinguished as organists. He had thus the
                    most favourable opportunity for tho development of the musical talent which he
                    displayed almost from infancy. Under the careful instruction of his father he
                    made such rapid progress that he appeared in public as a pianist at the age of
                    six. A year or two later he was placed as a choir boy at the convent of Iglau,
                    and he obtained his first instruction in counterpoint from Spenar, the
                    choir-master. When his voice broke he entered on a course of general study,
                    first at the Jesuits’ college, and then at the university of Prague, where he
                    took his bachelor’s degree in philosophy. During his curriculum of two and a
                    half years he had paid unremitting attention to the practice and study of his
                    art, and had received farther instruction in composition from a Benedictine
                    monk. In 1779 he was for a short time organist in the church of St Rombaut at
                    Mechlin. At the close of this engagement he proceeded to Holland, where he
                    attained great distinction as a pianist, and was employed by the stadtholder as
                    musical instructor to his family. While at the Hague he published his first
                    works in the form of several sonatas and concertos for the piano. He had already
                    composed at the age of thirteen a solemn mass and several small oratorios, which
                    still exist in manuscript. In 1783 he visted Hamburg, and placed himself under
                    the instruction of Emmanuel Bach. Though he believed himself to have derived
                    great benefit from this, it may be questioned whether his genius was not
                    fettered rather than stimulated by the enthusiastic veneration with which he
                    regarded his model. From Hamburg he proceeded to Berlin, where his powers as a
                    pianist met with their accustomed recognition. After spending two years in
                    Lithuania in the service of Prince Radziwill, he went in 1786 to Paris, where he
                    remained, with the exception of a short period spent at Milan, until the
                    outbreak of the Revolution, enjoying the special patronage of Marie Antoinette
                    and great popularity with the public. Towards the close of 1789 he removed to
                    London, where three years later he married a daughter of Dominico Corri, who was

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0586-0565"/> herself a clever harpist and pianist. In London
                    he obtained his greatest success alike a3 composer, performer, and teacher.
                    Unfortunately, however, he was tempted by the large sale of his numerous
                    compositions to open a musicpublishing warehouse in partnership with Montague
                    Corri, a relative of his wife. The result was injurious to his fame and
                    disastrous to his fortune. Writing solely for the sake of sale, he composed many
                    pieces that were quite unworthy of his genius; and, as he was entirely destitute
                    of business capacity, bankruptcy was inevitable. In 1800 he was obliged to flee
                    to Hamburg to escape the claims of his creditors. Some years later he was
                    attached in the capacity of musician to the household of Prince Louis Ferdinand
                    of Prussia, with whom he formed an intimate friendship. On the death of his
                    patron in 1806 he passed into the service of Prince Ysenburg as court musician.
                    In 1809 he went to Paris to fill a similar situation in the household of Prince
                    Talleyrand, which he held until his death in March 1812. Dussekhad an important
                    influence on the development of pianoforte music. As a performer he was
                    distinguished by the purity of his tone, the combined power and delicacy of his
                    touch, and the facility of his execution. As a composer he possessed a distinct
                    individuality of style, and, while much that he wrote has little value, his best
                    works rank high among pianoforte classics. His sonatas known as <hi
                    rend="italic">The Invocation, The Farewell,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Harmonic Elegy,</hi> though not equally sustained throughout, contain movements
                    that have scarcely been surpassed for solemnity and beauty of idea. Two operas,
                    which he composed during his residence in London, were failures.</p>
