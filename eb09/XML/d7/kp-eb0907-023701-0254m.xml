                    purpurea,</hi> is common in dry hilly pastures and rocky places and by road
                    sides in various parts of Europe; it ranges in Great Britain from Cornwall and
                    Kent to Orkney, but it does not occur in Shetland or in some of the eastern
                    counties of England. It flourishes best in siliceous soils, and is not found in
                    the Jura and Swiss Alps. The characters of the plant are as follows :—stem
                    erect, roundish, downy, leafy below, and from 18 inches to 6 feet or more in
                    height; leaves dternate, crenate, rugose, ovate or elliptic-oblong, and of a
                    dull green, with the under surface downy and paler than the upper; radical
                    leaves together with their petioles often ι foot in length; root of numerous,
                    slender, whitish fibres; flowers l¾-2⅛ inches long, pendulous, on one side of
                    the stem, purplish crimson, and hairy and marked with eye-like spots within;
                    segments of calyx ovate, acute, cleft to the base; corolla obtuse, with the
                    upper lobe entire or obscurely divided; stamens four and didynamous (see vol.
                    iv. p. 138, fig. 226); anthers yellow and bilobed; capsule bivalved, ovate, and
                    pointed; and seeds numerous, small, oblong, pitted, and of a pale brown. As
                    Parkinson remarks of the plant, “It flowreth seldome before July, and the seed
                    is ripe in August;” but it may occasionally be found in blossom as late as
                    September. In one variety, common in gardens, the flowers are white; in another
                    their purple is of a coppery or metallic hue; and not unfrequently in cultivated
                    plants several of the uppermost blossoms may be united together so as to form a
                    cup-shaped compound flower, through the centre of which the upper part of the
                    stem passes. A figure of <hi rend="italic">D. purpurea</hi> will be found in
                    vol. iv. plate xi. Many species of foxglove .with variously-coloured flowers
                    have been introduced into Britain from the Continent. The plants may be
                    propagated by off-sets from the roots, but are best raised from seed.</p>
                <p>The foxglove (Ang.-Sax., <hi rend="italic">foxes-clife, foxes-glofaſt</hi> is
                    known by a great variety of popular names in Britain. In the south of Scotland
                    it is called bloody fingers; further north, dead-men’s-bells; and on the eastern
                    borders, ladies’ thimbles, wild mercury, and Scotch mercury. Among its Welsh
                    synonyms are <hi rend="italic">menyg-ellyllon</hi> (elves’ gloves), <hi
                    rend="italic">menyg</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">llwynog</hi>
                    (fox’s gloves), <hi rend="italic">bysedd cochion</hi> (red fingers), and <hi

                    (dog’s fingers). In France its designations are <hi rend="italic">gants de
                    notre</hi><hi rend="italic">dame,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doigts</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Vièrge.</hi> The German name <hi rend="italic"
                    >fingerhut</hi> (thimble) suggested to Fuchs, in 1542, the employment of the
                    Latin adjective <hi rend="italic">digitalis</hi> as a designation for the
                    plant.</p>
                <p>The leaves, gathered from wild plants when about two-thirds of their flowers are
                    expanded, deprived usually of the petiole and the thicker part of the midrib,
                    and dried, constitute the drug <hi rend="italic">digitalis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">digitalis folia</hi> of the pharmacopoeia. The prepared leaves
                    have a faint odour and bitter taste; to preserve their properties they must be
                    kept excluded from light in stoppered bottles. They are occasionally adulterated
                    with the leaves of <hi rend="italic">Inula</hi><hi rend="italic">Conyza,</hi>
                    Ploughman’s Spikenard, which may be distinguished by their greater roughness,
                    their less divided margins, and their odour when rubbed; also with the leaves of
                    <hi rend="italic">Symphytum officinale,</hi> Comfrey, aud of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Verbascum Thapsus,</hi> Great Mullein, which unlike those of the foxglove have
                    woolly upper and under surfaces. The powder, infusion, and tincture of digitalis
                    are employed both externally and internally; and its active principle, <hi
                    rend="italic">digitalin,</hi> may further be used for subcutaneous injection.
                    Digitalin, according to Na ti velle, is a crystallizable, neutral, inodorous,
                    bitter substance, of the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 25</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 40</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi>, insoluble in water
                    and ether, but soluble in alcohol and chloroform. The earliest known
                    descriptions of the foxglove are those given by Fuchs and Tragus about the
                    middle of the 16th century, but its virtues were doubtless known to herbalists
                    at a much remoter period. Gerarde, in his <hi rend="italic">Herbal</hi> (1597),
                    advocates the use of foxglove for a variety of complaints; and John Parkinson,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Botanicum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Theater
                    of Plants</hi> (1640), tells us that <pb break="no"

                    <hi rend="italic">The Few London Dispensatory,</hi> praises the remedy foxglove
                    in no measured terms.</p>
                <p>Digitalis was first brought prominently under the notice of the medical
                    profession by Dr W. Withering, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Account of the
                    Foxglove</hi> (1785), gave details of upwards of 200 cases, chiefly dropsical,
                    in which it was used. Having become acquainted with the drug in 1775 as an
                    ingredient in a Shropshire family receipt for the cure of dropsy, he began to
                    administer it as a diuretic, but at first in doses too large; for, “misled by
                    reasoning from the effect of the squills, which generally acts best upon the
                    kidneys when it excites nausea,” he sought to produce the same effect by
                    foxglove. Further experience, however, convinced him “that its diuretic effects
                    do not at all depend upon its exciting nausea or vomiting;” and that often the
                    urinary discharge may be checked when the dose is imprudently urged so as to
                    occasion sickness. He moreover observed that in cases where the drug produced
                    purging it was inefficacious unless combined with small doses of opium, so as to
                    restrain its action on the bowels. Withering seldom found it to succeed in men
                    of great natural strength, tense fibre, warm skin, and florid complexion, or in
                    those with a tight and cordy pulse. He recommended digitalis “in every species
                    of dropsy, except the encysted;” and he was of opinion that it might be made
                    subservient to the cure of diseases unconnected with dropsy, and that its power
                    over the motion of the heart, to a degree unobserved by him in any other
                    medicine, might be turned to good account by the physician.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Marcet and Brunton show that the infusion of digitalis has a
                    poisonous effect on various plants, and, even in very small quantity, kills
                    fishes,—tîíéir auricles after death being found distended, their ventricles
                    strongly contracted. On birds the effect of the infusion is to cause firm
                    contraction of the left ventricle, and consequent excessive congestion of the
                    lungs. A large turkey, according to Μ. Salerne <hi rend="italic">{Hist,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Académie.</hi>
                    1748, p. 120, 12mo, and p. 84, 4to ed.), walked as if intoxicated, in
                    consequence of partaking once of foxglove leaves. Another turkey, weighing 7
                    K&gt;, ate during 4 days about half a handful of the leaves, after which it
                    refused nourishment, and in a couple of weeks died, its weight being reduced to
                    3 lb. Handfield Jones and Fuller have proved that the infusion produces upon the
                    hearts of frogs and mammals effects similar to those observed in birds. The
                    usual results of small and repeated doses of digitalis are contraction of the
                    capillaries, and augmented arterial blood-pressure, with slower and more
                    powerful cardiac systole, and an increase in the urinary secretions; large or
                    long-continued doses, besides causing nausea or vomiting, often accompanied by
                    purging, occasion a slow or irregular pulse, dilatation of the capillaries,
                    decrease in the rate of respiration, cold sweats, disordered vision, chilliness
                    of the extremities, giddiness, and great weakness, followed by convulsions and
                    insensibility. Syncope is apt to occur on sudden changes of posture by patients
                    fully under the influence of the drug. Its cumulative action, or unexpected
                    production of alarmingly acute symptoms, may arise either from an increase in
                    the dose, the elimination of the drug being constant, or from a check in the
                    elimination, the dose remaining unaltered, hence the caution with which
                    digitalis should be administered in cases where the renal functions are
                    disturbed. The experiments of various physiologists have shown that digitalis,
                    by stimulating the sympathetic ganglia of the heart, causes the contraction of
                    Its musculo-motor fibres, this effect being at first masked by a similar action
                    on the pneumogastric nerves. By effecting more complete emptying of the
                    ventricles in cases of cardiac disturbance, digitalis improves the circulation,
                    bringing about in the lungs a more thorough oxidation of the blood. The
                    consequent increased nutrition of the heart is promotive of hypertrophy in that
                    organ; small doses of digitalis are therefore an assistance in hypertrophy
                    following upon cardiac injury. In cases of dilatation of the heart, on the other
                    hand, large doses are required. The continued use of the drug when the heart has
                    become sufficiently hypertrophied may render ventricular action excessive.
                    Digitalis calms excitement of the heart not by acting as a narcotic or sedative
                    but by stimulating its nerves, and enabling it to contract without laboured
                    effort. In feeble conditions of the circulation it acts diuretîcally by
                    increasing arterial tension, but its influence as a diuretic is not constant.
                    Its efficacy in epilepsy appears to be limited by its action on the circulation.
                    In enteric fever, erysipelas, and acute rheumatism, it has been employed to
                    reduce temperature. Its use as a sedative in pneumonia, delirium tremens, and
                    some other diseases has been objected to on the ground that it cuts off the
                    irritating blood supply only by an extreme degree of ventricular contraction. In
                    arachnitis in children, in inflammation tending towards serous effusion, in
                    dropsy, haemorrhage, cerebral anaemia, and occasionally in angina pectoris and
                    nervous palpitation, it is a valuable remedy. Upon the uterus digitalis acts by
                    stimulating the ganglia in which its motor power resides (W. Howship Dickenson,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Med. Chir. Trans,</hi> vol. xxxix. Lond. 1865). In
                    poisoning by digitalis, aconite and probably also Calabar bean may be resorted
                    to.</p>
