                <p><label type="entry">DYNAMICS</label> properly means that science which treats of
                    the action of force. Defining force as that which affects the motion of matter,
                    it appears that the study of dynamics will lead to the consideration of the
                    motion of material systems, and the laws in accordance with which this motion is
                    changed by the mutual actions of the bodies forming such systems. But there is a
                    sense in which we may contemplate the geometrical results of the motion of
                    bodies without studying the forces under which, or the time during which, it
                    takes place; and hence there are many problems which at first sight we might be
                    disposed to include under the head of dynamics, but which also belong to the
                    domain of pure mathematics, and may therefore more properly be considered as a
                    branch of geometry. On the other hand, there is a branch of dynamics which
                    treats of pure motion without taking any account of its subject or the means by
                    which it is produced or changed. In this branch, to which the term kinematics,
                    though first employed by Ampère in a wider sense, may with propriety be
                    confined, it may seem that no consideration of matter or of force is involved;
                    but, unlike the class just alluded to, the problems which come under this head
                    involve explicitly the element of time, and it is only after studying the laws
                    of dynamics that we are able to furnish a theoretical measure of time satisfying
                    the demands of the human mind. Thus any subject in which the measurement of time
                    is involved enters on this account into the domain of dynamics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Measurement of Time.—</hi> For ordinary purposes the rotation
                    of the earth furnishes a sufficiently exact means of measuring time, and the
                    observation of the transit of a known star is the best method we possess of
                    determining the error of a clock; but that the fundamental conception of the
                    measurement of intervals of time is based upon other foundation than the diurnal
                    rotation of our planet at once appears from the fact that we see no
                    inconsistency in asking whether the length of the day is the same now as it was
                    2000 years ago. If our primary conceptions of the measurement of time were
                    derived from the earth’s rotation, the absolute constancy of the length of the
                    day would be a matter of definition. But it is not to the motion of the earth or
                    of any other single body that we are indebted for our highest conception of the
                    measurement of time—it is rather to the dynamical principle expressed in the
                    first law of motion; and hence it is that the theoretical measurement of time,
                    and of other physical quantities which explicitly involve time, must find a
                    place under the head of dynamics. Kinematics may therefore properly be treated
                    as a branch of dynamics, and for its discussion, as well as for the enunication
                    and explanation of the laws of motion, the reader is referred to the article on

                <p>Perhaps there is nothing which appears to present a subject for study simpler
                    than that afforded by the properties of space, and hence it is that geometry
                    attained so high a reputation and made such rapid advances among the ancients.
                    It was easy to construct material standards of length and by their means to
                    measure approximately the linear dimensions of limited portions of space, the
                    human mind being only too ready to believe in the constancy of the dimensions of
                    the standards constructed; and thus the properties of space presented a subject
                    which, at the very outset, afforded a facility for investigation which was
                    wanting in the study of other physical quantities. The great simplification
                    introduced by this belief in the permanence of the dimensions of material
                    standards will be apparent if we consider the position in which we should be
                    placed by the adoption of a different hypothesis. Once admit the supposition
                    that the properties of a figure, as regards dimensions or form, depend
                    explicitly on its position in space, or upon time, either by a process of growth
                    in themselves or because space is changing its character, and the whole subject
                    of geometry will require reconsideration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Displacement.—</hi> A number of points or figures may be
                    connected in accordance with such geometrical conditions that if one or more be
                    displaced in a given manner the displacements of all the others may be
                    determined. The determination of the displacement of each in terms of the given
                    displacements is a problem in pure mathematics, and the branch of geometry which
                    treats of such questions may be called the science of displacement. If we
                    suppose the figures here contemplated to be material bodies, and the geometrical
                    conditions to be determined by means of material constraints such as links,
                    guides, teeth, and the like, the science of displacement thus applied becomes
                    that of mechanism, and it is only necesary here to call attention to the
                    following statements. First, in the study of displacements, or of pure
                    mechanism, no account is taken of any but the geometrical properties of the
                    bodies displaced, while the forces engaged in producing the displacement are
                    entirely neglected: the consideration of the mechanical properties of the
                    materials of which the parts of a machine are constructed, the forces acting
                    between those parts, and the best means of “fitting” them, belongs to applied
                    mechanics and machine construction. Secondly, the element of time is altogether
                    left out of consideration; for, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n603/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0603-0582"/> although it may be argued that the
                    displacement of each part of the system takes place in the same interval of
                    time, and that the geometrical conditions enable us to compare the displacements
                    experienced by different parts during the same time, and thus lead us to a
                    comparison of velocities, yet it must be observed that this is <hi rend="italic"
                        >only</hi> a comparison amounting simply to a relation between corresponding
                    displacements, and does not involve time explicitly, since the whole
                    displacement may take place in a time as long or as short as we please, for we
                    do not consider it. Moreover, the actual motion of any part may be made uniform
                    or varying in any arbitrary manner without any account being taken of it. In
                    fact it is simply two or more configurations of the material system which are
                    compared together, and, though for the sake of distinction we call one the
                    initial and another the final configuration, we might as well distinguish them
                    in any other manner and without stating which follows the other. Indeed we
                    contemplate them as co-existent during the act of comparison. Hence we may
                    complete the science of displacement or pure mechanism without ever considering
                    force, or being able to measure time or even to define equal intervals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kinematics.—</hi> If to our conceptions of space and of
                    displacement we couple that of time <hi rend="italic">as a measurable
                        quantity,</hi> we are led to compare the rates of non-simultaneous as well
                    as of simultaneous displacements, and are consequently obliged to measure the
                        <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> at which displacement occurs by the change of
                    position experienced in a <hi rend="italic">definite interval of time</hi> by
                    the body, figure, or point we are regarding. Rate of change of position measured
                    thus we call <hi rend="italic">velocity.</hi> The next step in the same
                    direction is the consideration of the rate at which velocity changes, or <hi
                        rend="italic">acceleration,</hi> and thus the association of our conception
                    of space with that of time as a measurable quantity opens up to us that branch
                    of dynamics which we call kinematics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Matter.—</hi> Having considered displacement in connection with
                    the time during which it occurs, the next step leads us to take account of the
                    thing displaced, and here we are obliged to contemplate matter directly. Matter,
                    like time and space, we do nob attempt to define, but treat it as a primary
                    conception, its more obvious properties making themselves known to all through
                    daily experience.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Force.—</hi> The change of the motion of material bodies brings
                    us at once, through the introduction furnished by the first law of motion, to
                    the conception of force, which may be defined in terms of three primary
                    quantities, viz., space, time, and matter. The second law of motion expresses
                    the manner in which matter is affected by force, and teaches us how to measure
                    force by the observation of its effects.</p>
                <p>The science of dynamics in its restricted sense is that which treats of the
                    consequences arising from the relations of matter to force, and before we can
                    proceed in this science beyond the first step we must become acquainted with the
                    second law of motion, while kinematics requires for its complete development
                    only the first law of motion, its range being thereby sharply defined and
                    separated from that of the rest of dynamics. The laws of motion, like other
                    natural laws, must be understood to express merely the properties of natural
                    bodies as we find them, and within the degree of accuracy to which our
                    experiments can be relied on. We might, of course, have started with any
                    hypotheses we liked respecting the relations of force to matter, and upon these
                    hypotheses and our conceptions of time and space have constructed a purely
                    theoretical system of dynamics which would have been perfectly self-consistent;
                    but our conclusions might, or might not, have agreed with observations of
                    natural phenomena. If we found an agreement between the results of the
                    application of our theory to special problems and the solutions of the
                    corresponding problems as worked out objectively in nature, we should have
                    reason to believe that our hypotheses agreed with the facts, or, in other words,
                    that they were true, and we should then raise them to the dignity of natural
                    laws. It is on evidence of this kind that our acceptation of all natural laws is
                    based. ∏ our conclusions were inconsistent with natural phenomena our system of
                    dynamics would be an abstract, instead of a natural, science—if, indeed, it
                    might be called a science at all—and would be valuable merely as an intellectual
                    exercise. In the case of such an abstract science we are not even bound to adopt
                    the axioms respecting the properties of space which are usually accepted, but
                    may confer upon our “space” any number of dimensions and any properties we
                    please.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stress.—</hi> Though the conception of a single force is
                    convenient, it nevertheless results from a mere process of mental abstraction.
                    We never meet with a single isolated force in nature, but each is accompanied by
                    an equal and opposite force acting in the same straight line, and when we speak
                    of one without the other we do so merely for the sake of brevity. The third law
                    of motion implies this statement, though it has also a wider signification. The
                    action and reaction which are thus always inseparably linked together may be
                    conveniently called a stress, of which the two forces are opposite aspects. Thus
                    it appears that there is nothing in nature corresponding to what we are
                    accustomed to call a single force; stresses, indeed, abound, and may be produced
                    whenever we please, but we are completely ignorant of their existence except
                    when they change the relative velocities of different portions of matter. Then,
                    and then only, do they appeal to our senses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statics.—</hi> The investigation of the conditions under which
                    a system of stresses produces no displacement of the bodies between which they
                    act constitutes the science of statics, and will be discussed under the head of
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics.</hi><hi rend="italic">Measurement of
                        Force.—</hi> Since force can be defined in terms of space, time, and matter,
                    it follow that the measurement of a force ought to involve measurements of these
                    three quantities and of them only. Now it is plain that any force whatever may
                    be chosen as the unit in terms of which other forces should be expressed,
                    provided it is capable of being reproduced at all times and in all places with
                    precision. We all now believe that the quantity of matter in a body is unchanged
                    by changing its position or by the simple lapse of time, and we also believe
                    that the region of space which we inhabit is sufficiently homoloidal to allow us
                    to compare distances in different directions, at different places, and at
                    different times. Moreover, the first law of motion, as has been stated above,
                    provides, when proper precautions are taken, a method of measuring time which
                    satisfies the requirements of the mind, while the rotation of the earth affords
                    a practical measure of time sufficiently exact for the most refined experiments
                    we can execute. Therefore a unit of force which depends only on the units of
                    length, mass, and time will be the same at all places, and, so far as our
                    experience allows us to judge, at all times. Such a unit is termed an absolute
                    unit. Not ouly force but every other quantity dealt with in dynamical science,
                    as well as every physical quantity whose relations to space, mass, and time are
                    known, can be measured in terms of a unit of its own kind which depends only on
                    the fundamental units of length, mass, and time, and is then said to be
                    expressed in <hi rend="italic">absolute measure.</hi> The three primary units
                    must be chosen in an arbitrary manner, and their permanence must be considered a
                    matter of definition; but when these have been once fixed, ail the absolute
                    units derived from them are perfectly determinate and invariable. If a foot, a
                    pound, and a second be chosen as units, the corresponding absolute unit of force
                    is called a <hi rend="italic">poundal;</hi> while if the primary units be a
                    centimetre, a gramme, and a second, the unit of force is called a <hi
                        rend="italic">dyne.</hi></p>

                <p>For the definitions of the derived dynamical units and the investigation of their
                    dependence on the fundamental units, the reader may refer to the article on <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mechanics.</hi></p>
                <p>From what has been said it will appear that the whole difficulty in fixing upon a
                    system of dynamical units lies in the determination of the fundamental units of
                    length, mass, and time in such a manner that their constancy can be relied upon.
                    The unit of mass offers very little difficulty in this respect. Long experience
                    has taught us which are the most permanent of the varieties of matter we have at
                    command. We have good reason to believe that a piece of platinum or an alloy of
                    platinum and iridium may be exposed to pure air at ordinary temperatures for an
                    indefinite time without any increase or diminution of its mass whatever. Such a
                    piece of metal may therefore with propriety be chosen as a national standard of
                    mass, the <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> constancy of the quantity of matter
                    constituting it being accepted on definition, as we are unable to test it by any
                    standard in which we have more confidence than we have in itself. The British
                    and French national standards of mass are of platinum, but the new standards
                    recently constructed in Paris consist of an alloy of platinum and iridium.</p>
                <p>The determination of a unit of length is not so simple as that of the unit of
                    mass. In this case, as in the preceding, we avail ourselves of the properties of
                    a material standard, but we know that however indestructible the standard itself
                    may be its dimensions depend upon the pressure to which it is exposed, its
                    temperature, and in some cases upon other accidents, such as the magnetic force
                    in the neighbourhood, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> fcc. Hence the only course
                    open to us is to determine as far as possible all the causes of variation in the
                    length of our standard, and carefully to define its condition with respect to
                    these variables, so that it shall be a standard only under the circumstances
                    thus defined. Having thus defined the condition of the material standard with
                    respect to all the variables upon which we know its length to depend, we must
                    consider the <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> constancy of its length at all
                    times and places to be a matter of definition until we have discovered other
                    causes which affect it. It has been proposed that the wave length <hi
                        rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> of a particular kind of light, as for instance
                    that corresponding to one of the sodium lines, should be taken as the unit of
                    length, and its period as the unit of time. These units are probably more
                    constant than those afforded by any material standards or vibrating springs
                    which we can construct; but a belief in their <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi>
                    constancy implies complete confidence in the constancy of the properties of the
                    interstellar medium, and of the sodium molecule.</p>
                <p>The determination of a satisfactory means of measuring time seems to offer
                    greater difficulties than the measurement of mass or of space, though the
                    difficulties are of the same character as those we have just considered. The
                    great difficulty' consists in defining what is meant by the equality of two
                    intervals of time which do not commence simultaneously. Remembering that it is
                    upon the properties of matter alone that we can rely for assistance, we might
                    construct a spring and define as equal lapses of time those intervals during
                    which this spring executes the same number of vibrations, the temperature,
                    &lt;fcc., being kept constant. But if we were to construct a number of such
                    springs, though a perfect agreement might obtain between them at first, we
                    should find after a considerable period that the measurements of time derived
                    from different springs did not agree, while our knowledge is insufficient to
                    enable us to apply to each the corrections necessary to lead us to a consistent
                    result. Now there may be no reason why we should prefer one spring above all the
                    others, and thus it appears that a definition of equal intervals of time based
                    upon the behaviour of any single spring is too arbitrary to be satisfactory. If,
                    however, we found a large number of springs, constructed of different materials
                    and differently affected by temperature and other known causes of variation,
                    continue to give perfectly consistent results, the theory of probability would
                    lead us to place a high value upon the measure of time thus afforded. Now, we
                    have stated that our highest conception of the measurement of time is derived
                    from the dynamical principle expressed in the first law of motion, but when we
                    come to apply this it is impossible to determine <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    whether in the case of two given bodies there is no stress acting between them
                    or between one of them and some third object. Consequently, the only course open
                    to us is to examine the motion of a large number of material systems, making
                    such corrections for the action of stresses which we know to be in operation as
                    our theoretical dynamics will enable us to determine; and, if after this we find
                    that several independent systems afford the same measurement of time, while
                    those systems which lead to a different result disagree also among themselves,
                    we must accept the measurement of time afforded by the first set as the true
                    measure, and attribute the discrepancies manifested by the other systems to some
                    unknown stresses, which it should be our subsequent business to discover.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Work.—</hi> The contemplation of a stress, together with a
                    relative displacement of theportions of matter between which it acts, introduces
                    us to the conception of <hi rend="italic">work.</hi> If we consider a stress,
                    together with the distance through which the solicited bodies are capable of
                    moving relative to one another in obedience to the stress, the object of our
                    contemplation is the work which may be done under the given conditions of the
                    system, and this we call <hi rend="italic">energy.</hi> The subject of which
                    natural philosophy treats is the transformation of energy, which in all its
                    phases takes place in accordance with two great principles, known respectively
                    as the principles of the conservation and the dissipation of energy. Of these
                    two principles the former rests upon a much higher scientific basis than the
                    latter. In order to lose our faith in the principle of the conservation of
                    energy we must give up our belief in the fundamental principles of dynamics
                    expressed in the laws of motion; but as regards the dissipation of energy we can
                    say little more than that all the operations of nature with which we are
                    acquainted take place in accordance with this principle. Clerk Maxwell has,
                    however, shown that it is possible to subvert the principle of the dissipation
                    of energy by the simple exercise of a sufficiently high order of intelligence.
                    For the statement and discussion of these two principles see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Energy.</hi></p>
                <p>It is the work of the natural philosopher to explain the operations of nature in
                    accordance with the principles of dynamics, and we consider that we understand
                    any phenomenon when we have shown it to consist of a motion of matter and
                    determined the character of this motion. Thus it is that dynamics forms the
                    foundation of every branch of natural philosophy, and a thorough appreciation of
                    the principles of conservation and dissipation of energy is the only safe guide
                    in physical investigations. (w. G.)</p>
