                <p><label type="entry">DIPTYCH</label>, a double tablet made with a hinge to open
                    and shut. Diptychs were used in the time of the Roman empire for sending
                    letters—“mainly love letters,” says Facciolati, quoting the scholiast to Juvenal
                    ix. 36, whose note does not, however, seem to imply as much. The consuls and
                    quaestors used, on assuming office, to send diptychs containing their names and
                    portraits to their friends. The exterior of the leaves was often ornamented with
                    other paintings. The tablets were made, the more ordinary kind of boxwood or
                    maple, the richer sort of cedar, of ivory, of silver, and sometimes even of
                    gold. They were very frequently sent by friends to each other as presents at the
                    beginning of a new year. The early Christians used tablets thus made in the
                    celebration of divine worship. And Cardinal Noris <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dissertai,</hi><hi rend="italic">de Hist. Synod.)</hi> expends much learning
                    in showing, what is very evident, that the Christians adopted the use of them
                    from that of the consular diptychs. They were placed on the “ambones,”—the
                    pulpits, or reading desks, which may still be seen in ancient basilicas at the
                    west end of the choir or presbytery; and from them were read to the congregation
                    of the faithful the names of the celebrating priests, of those who occupied the
                    superior positions in the Christian hierarchy, of the saints, martyrs, and
                    confessors, and, in process of time, also of those who had died in the faith. It
                    is the diptychs that are referred to by the early Christian writers under the
                    names of “mystic tablets,” “anniversary books,” “matriculation registers” of the
                    church, and sometimes “books of the living,” or “books of life.” The word is
                    also occasionally found used in other senses, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> for
                    the priest’s vestment, which was usually folded in two (see Ducange, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad voc.)</hi> When it became customary to write in the diptychs
                    names so numerous as those of the different classes of persons above mentioned,
                    it will be easily understood that it became impossible to inscribe them on two
                    tablets of convenient size. Hence the diptychs became triptychs, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> consisting of three such conjoined tablets.</p>
                <p>But, though triptychs are often spoken of in the artlanguage of a later time,
                    these were by the early church writers still called diptychs; and continued to
                    be so -called, even when many leaves, probably of parchment in some cases,
                    though more frequently of wood, were introduced between the two original folds
                    of the diptych, thus forming a veritable <hi rend="italic">book.</hi> The
                    inscription on the diptychs of deaths and baptisms, naturally led to the
                    insertion of <hi rend="italic">dates,</hi> and the diptychs seem thus to have
                    grown into calendars, and to have been the germ from which necrologies, lists of
                    saints, and almanacs have been developed. Much doubt exists as to the time when
                    the use of diptychs to read from died out in the church. The best opinion seems
                    to be that their use lasted to about the end of the 8th century. The outsides of
                    the diptych folds being often very richly ornamented, their preservation was
                    carefully attended to, and even those which were ornamented with profane
                    paintings or carvings were often to be found in use in the primitive churches.
                    This ornamentation caused the diptychs to be exhibited to the congregation, and
                    used as adornments for the altar. And in this position, by a natural process of
                    development, the ornamentation became the main end and object of the thing
                    itself. The best painters of the time employed their talents in painting
                    them—generally in the form of triptychs, and on both sides of the folding doors,
                    so that the triptych when closed showed two subjects, often the portraits of the
                    donor and his wife, and when open three paintings;—hence the very large number
                    of diptychs and triptychs which are found in our museums and galleries.</p>
