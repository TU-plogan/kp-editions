                    woman of the name of Perkins, the daughter of a verger. She had a more than
                    questionable reputation, and her extravagant habits contributed in no small
                    degree to her husband’s disgrace and ruin. In 1751 he was ordained deacon, and
                    in 1753 priest, and he soon became a popular and celebrated preacher. His first
                    preferment was the lectureship of West-Ham and Bow. In 1754 he was also chosen
                    lecturer of St Olave’s, Hart Street; and in 1757 he took the degree of Μ. A. at
                    Cambridge. He was a strenuous supporter of the Magdalen Hospital, which was
                    founded in 1758, and soon afterwards became preacher at the chapel of that
                    charity. In 1763 he obtained a prebend at Brecon, and in the same year he was
                    appointed one of the king’s chaplains,—soon after which the education of Philip
                    Stanhope, afterwards earl of Chesterfield, was committed to his care. In 1766 he
                    went to Cambridge, and took the degree of LL.D. At this period he was held in
                    high estimation; but eager for further advancement, he unhappily entered on
                    courses which in the end proved the occasion of his ruin. On the living of St
                    George’s, Hanover Square, becoming vacant, he wrote an anonymous letter to the
                    wife of the lord chancellor offering three thousand guineas if, by her
                    assistance, he was promoted to the benefice. This letter having been traced to
                    him, a complaint was immediately made to the king, and he was dismissed with
                    disgrace from his office of chaplain. After residing for some time at Geneva and
                    Paris, he returned to England in 1776. He still continued to exercise his
                    clerical functions, but his extravagant mode of life soon involved him in
                    difficulties. To meet the demands of his creditors he forged a bond on his
                    former pupil Lord Chesterfield for £4200, and actually received the money. But
                    he was detected, committed to prison, tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and
                    sentenced to death; and, in spite of numerous applications for mercy, he was
                    executed at Tyburn on the 27th June 1777. Dr Samuel Johnson was very zealous in
                    pleading for a pardon, and a petition from the city of London received 23,000
                    signatures. Dr Dodd was a voluminous writer, and possessed considerable
                    abilities, with but little judgment and much vanity. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beauties of Shakespeare,</hi> published before he entered the church, was long
                    a well-known work; and his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts in Prison,</hi> a poem in
                    blank verse, written in the interval between his conviction and his execution,
                    naturally attracted much attention. He published a large number of sermons and
                    other theological works. An accurate list of his various writings is prefixed to
                    his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts in Prison.</hi></p>
