                    (1579-1625), a Scottish scholar, was born at Cliftbog, Aberdeenshire, and was
                    the twentyfourth of twenty-nine children of the same mother. From his earliest
                    years he gave promise of the learned attainments which gained him contemporary
                    celebrity and posthumous fame. At a very early age, qualified by the tuition of
                    Thomas Cargill, his classical master in Aberdeen—of whom he speaks in his <hi

                    having studied there for some time, he went to Paris, but did not continue his
                    studies, on account of a contagious disease which closed the schools and
                    prostrated himself. On his recovery he hastened to Louvain, where he was
                    selected, along with other young Scotchmen, to go to Rome for the furtherance of
                    his education. Through the kindness of Cardinal Cajetan, he became a student in
                    the Roman seminary; but he had hardly begun the art of Latin versifica-tiou<pb

                    leave Rome for change of climate. By way of Switzerland, he travelled to the
                    Netherlands, and made a short stay at Tournay, to which he returned to teach
                    humanity after a period of study at the university of Douai, where he
                    distinguished himself in poetical and philosophical competitions, and took the
                    degree of Μ. A. As his prospects in Tournay were discouraging,· he went back to
                    Paris, graduated as doctor of canon law, and became a regent in the college of
                    Navarre, while yet, as he himself states, in his seventeenth year. Destined to
                    be a wanderer through life, he soon quitted Paris to settle in Toulouse, where
                    his stay was shortened by certain influential individuals, whose resentment he
                    had excited by his advocacy of university rights. At Nîmes, his next
                    resting-place, he was, by twenty-three of the twenty-four judges, chosen to the
                    professorship of eloquence in the Protestant university or academy, which
                    circumstance colours in some degree the conjecture of Bayle, that his zeal for
                    the Romish faith had somewhat cooled. Having retained his chair for little more
                    than the two years of litigation into which he had been dragged by one of the
                    unsuccessful candidates who had libellously assailed him, and against whom the
                    Parliament of Toulouse decided, Dempster made a journey into Spain, whence,
                    after a brief engagement as preceptor to a son of the famous Saint-Luc, he
                    departed for his native land. As he did not experience a favourable reception
                    either from his relatives or from the clergy, he remained but a short time, and
                    again betook himself to Paris. There he spent seven years with advantage to his
                    reputation and purse, as regent in different colleges. His connection with that
                    of Beauvais, over which he presided for a time, was brought to a close by a
                    high-handed procedure illustrative of his fierce courage, and suggestive of his
                    fitness for other than literary contests. In the year 1615 he accepted the
                    invitation of King James to come to London, and was honoured and rewarded by
                    that sovereign. But disappointed of preferment, which clerical and episcopal
                    prejudices influenced the king to withhold, he again left England for Italy. On
                    his arrival in Rome he was at first suspected of being a spy, but when his
                    claims were ascertained, he was so fortunate as to receive letters of
                    recommendation from the Pope and other influential personages to the duke of
                    Tuscany, which issued in his appointment to the professorship of the Pandects in
                    the university of Pisa. Writings of this date attest his competency for the
                    chair. After his inaugural lecture his reputation and emoluments increased. In
                    the following year, on a visit to England, his disputatious spirit brought him
                    into collision with an English ecclesiastic, whose representation of the quarrel
                    led the grand duke to require that Dempster should either apologize or leave the
                    country. Rather than make the prescribed apology he quitted Florence with the
                    intention of settling in Scotland; but he was prevailed upon by Cardinal Capponi
                    to stay at Bologna, and in a few days, by the influence of the cardinal, was
                    appointed to the chair of humanity, which he filled with the utmost efficiency
                    and increase of fame. Honours, civil and literary, were bestowed upon him, and
                    it seemed as if his wanderings and reverses had together come to an end. But the
                    crowning calamity of his life then befell him. His light-headed wife (he married
                    her in London in 1615), whose beauty had always been a snare to her, eloped with
                    one of his students; and the mental distress and bodily fatigue consequent on
                    his pursuit of the fugitives, during the dog days, predisposed him to fever,
                    which attacked him and proved fatal. He died at Bologna in 1625, in his
                    forty-sixth year. Morally his chief defect was the fierceness of his
                    temperament, which involved him in many broils, and made his sword and pen alike
                    formidable. His natural impetuosity, which so easily broke forth in ebullitions
                    of violence, explains in large measure the looseness and recklessness of
                    statement often found in his writings. His intellectual qualifications entitle
                    him to be considered “one of the most learned men whom Scotland has produced.” A
                    vast memory, which was the receptacle of many books; an extraordinary
                    familiarity with Greek and Latin, that enabled him to improvise verses in these
                    tongues with the utmost rapidity; and a versatility which made versification,
                    philological discussions, classical criticism, juridical expositions,
                    biographical narratives, and historical annals congenial to him,—these
                    endowments give him a high place among the learned. The defects of his writings
                    were mainly due to the passionateness which often clouded his judgment, to a
                    patriotic vanity that led to absurd exaggerations on Scotch subjects, and to the
                    disturbing influence of a restless life. For list of his very numerous writings
