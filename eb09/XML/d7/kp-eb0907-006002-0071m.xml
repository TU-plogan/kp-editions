                <p><label type="entry">DEMONOLOGY</label>. The w ord <hi rend="italic">demon</hi>
                    (or <hi rend="italic">daemon)</hi> is the Greek δαi)zωy, the etymology of which
                    is too doubtful to explain its original signification (see Pott, <hi
                    rend="italic">Etym.</hi><hi rend="italic">Forsch.,</hi> ii. 1, 947). Setting
                    aside the use of the word in the general sense of deity (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> i. 222), we find it employed in classic Greek literature with the
                    more specific meaning under which it becomes an important term in the science of
                    religion. Among the most instructive passages are those in which Hesiod tells
                    how the men of the golden race became after death demons, guardians or watchers
                    υver mortals (Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Op.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dies,</hi> 109, &amp;c.; see Welcker, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Götterlehre,</hi> vol. i. p. 731), and where the
                    doctrines of Empedocles, Plato, and other philosophers are set forth, showing
                    how the demons came to be defined as good and evil beings intermediate between
                    gods and men (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">De Defect.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >0rac.,</hi><hi rend="italic">De Isid.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi

                    of Greece,</hi> vol. i. chaps. 2, 17). The religions of the world usually
                    recognize an order of spiritual beings, below the rank of governing deities, and
                    distinguished from nature-spirits such as elves and nymphs by being especially
                    concerned with living men and their affairs; these beings, very often themselves
                    considered to be ghosts of dead men, are the demons. The earlier and wider
                    notion of demons includes the w hole class of such spirits, who may be friendly
                    or hostile, good or evil, persecuting and tormenting man or acting as his
                    protecting and informing patron-spirits; while, when they are mediators or
                    ministers of some higher deity, they will be, like the god himself, kindly or
                    ill-disposed. A narrower definition was introduced in Christian theology, where
                    the ideas of a good demon and guardian genius were merged in the general
                    conception of good “angels,” w hile the term demon w as appropriated to evil
                    spirits, or “devils.” For scientific purposes, it is desirable to use the term
                    in the wider sense. Demonology, the branch of the science of religion which
                    relates to demons, is much obscured in the treatises of old writers by their
                    taking the evidence too exclusively from among civilized nations, and neglecting
                    what is to be learnt from barbarous tribes, whose ideas of demons, being nearer
                    their primitive state, are comparatively clear and comprehensible. When savage
                    notions of the nature and functions of these spirits are taken as the
                    starting-point, the demon appears as only a more or less modified human
                    soul—whether it is still actually considered to be a human ghost, or whether
                    part of the human quality has fallen away, so that only traces are left to show
                    that man’s soul furnished the original model. But when such early and natural
                    animistic conceptions were carried on into higher stages of culture, their
                    original use as explaining natural phenomena was gradually superseded by the
                    growth of knowledge, and they came to be maintained as broken-dow n and confused
                    superstitions, only to be understood by comparison with their earlier forms.
                    Such comparison, however, is facilitated by the primitive demon-ideas cropping
                    up anew even in civilized life, as in the so-called “spirit-manifestations” of
                    the present day. The following details will show the main <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0072-0061"/> purposes which the doctrine of demons served in
                    the philosophy of the primitive and savage world, as well as its large
                    contribution to civilized superstition. The authorities, when not mentioned,
                    will mostly be found referred to in Tylor, <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                    Culture,</hi> chaps, xiv. xv. Other cases are given in Spencer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Sociology,</hi> vol. i., and every reader may
                    supplement them with similar instances from the works of travellers and
                    missionaries. Prof. Adolf Bastian’s <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mensch in</hi><hi rend="italic">der Geschichte</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beiträge zur Vergleichenden Psychologie</hi> are of great value to
                    students.</p>
                <p>Among races of low culture, the conception of a ghostsoul being made to account
                    for the phenomena of life (see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Animism)</hi>
                    readily leads to a corresponding theory of morbid states of body and mind. As
                    the man’s proper soul causes the functions of normal life by its presence, while
                    its more or less continued absence induces sleep, trance, and at last death, so
                    the abnormal phenomena of disease have a sufficient explanation at hand in the
                    idea that some other soul or soul-like spirit is acting on or has entered into
                    the patient. Among the cases which most strongly suggest this are—first, such
                    derangements as hysteria, epilepsy, and madness, where the raving and
                    convulsions seem to bystanders like the acts of some other being in possession
                    of the patient’s body, and even the patient is apt to think so when he “comes to
                    himself,” and, second, internal diseases where severe pain or wasting away may
                    be ascribed to some unseen being wounding or gnawing within. The applicability
                    of demoniacal possession as a theory to explain disease in general is best
                    proved by the fact that it is so often thus applied by savage races. Especially,
                    reasoning out the matter in similar ways, rude tribes in different countries
                    have repeatedly arrived at the conclusion that diseases are caused by the
                    surviving souls or ghosts of the dead, who appear to the living in dreams and
                    visions, thus proving at once their existence after death, and their continued
                    concern with mankind. This notion being once set on foot, it becomes easy to the
                    savage mind to identify the particular spirit, as when the Tasmanian ascribes a
                    gnawing disease to his having unwittingly pronounced the name of a dead man, who
                    thus summoned has crept into his body, and is consuming his liver; or when the
                    sick Zulu believes that some dead ancestor he sees in a dream has caused his
                    ailment, wanting to be propitiated with the sacrifice of an ox; or when the
                    Samoan persuades himself that the ancestral souls, who on occasion reveal
                    themselves by talking through the voices of living members of the family, are
                    the same beings who will take up their abode in the heads or stomachs of living
                    men and cause their illness and death. Here, then, the demon appears in what
                    seems its original character of a human ghost. We may notice in the last example
                    the frequent case of the man’s mind being so thoroughly under the belief in a
                    spirit possessing him that he speaks in the person of that spirit, and gives its
                    name; the bearing of this on oracular possession will appear presently. In many,
                    perhaps in most cases, however, the disease-demon is not specially described as
                    a human ghost; for instance, some Malay tribes in their simple theory of
                    diseases are content to say that one kind of demon causes small-pox, another
                    brings on swellings, and so on. The question is whether in such cases the human
                    character has merely dropped away, and this seems likely from the very human
                    fashion in which the demons are communicated with; they are talked to with
                    entreaties or threats, enticed out with offerings of food, or driven away with
                    noises and blows, just as though they were human souls accessible to the same
                    motives as when they were in the body. Thus the savage theory of demoniacal
                    possession has for its natural result the practice of exorcism or banishment of
                    the spirit as the regular means of cure, as where, to select these from hundreds
                    of instances, the Antilles Indians in Columbus’s time went through the pretence
                    of pulling the disease off the patient and blowing it away, bidding it begone to
                    the mountain or the sea. or where the Patagonians till lately, believing every
                    sick person to be possessed by an evil demon, drove it away by beating at the
                    bed’s head a drum painted with figures of devils.</p>
                <p>That such modern savage notions fairly represent the doctrine of
                    disease-possession in the ancient world is proved by the records of the earliest
                    civilized nations. The very charms still exist by which the ancient Egyptians
                    resisted the attacks of the wicked souls who, become demons, entered the bodies
                    of men to torment them with diseases and drive them to furious madness. The
                    doctrine of disease among the ancient Babylonians was that the swarming spirits
                    of the.air entered man’s body, and it was the exorcist’s duty to expel by
                    incantations “the noxious neck-spirit,” “the burning spirit of the entrails
                    which devours the man,” and to make the piercing pains in the head fly away
                    “like grasshoppers” into the sky. (See <hi rend="italic">Records of the
                    Past,</hi> vols, i., iii., &amp;c.; Birch’s trans, of the Egyptian <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of the Dead,</hi> see below; Maspero, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">La Magie chez les Chaldéens,</hi> &lt;fcc.) The transition-stage
                    of the ancient belief in the classical period of Greece and Rome is particularly
                    interesting. The scientific doctrine of medicine was beginning to encroach upon
                    it, but it was still current opinion that a fit was an attack by a demon <hi
                    rend="italic">(eττiλη</hi> ∖∣ <hi rend="italic">∕Ls</hi> = “seizure,” hence
                    English <hi rend="italic">epilepsy),</hi> that fury or madness was demoniacal
                    possession (δαι∕zovαω = to be possessed by an evil spirit, hence English <hi
                    rend="italic">daemoniac,</hi> &amp;c.), that madmen were “larvati,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> inhabited by ghosts, &amp;c. No record shows the
                    ancient theory more clearly than the New Testament, from the explicit way in
                    which the symptoms of the various affections are described, culminating in the
                    patient declaring the name of his possessing demon, and answering in his person
                    when addressed. The similarity of the symptoms with those which in barbarous
                    countries are still accounted for in the ancient way may be seen from such
                    statements as the following, by a well-known missionary (Rev. J. L. Wilson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Western Africa,</hi> p. 217):—“Demoniacal possessions are common,
                    and the feats performed by those who are supposed to be under such influence are
                    certainly not unlike those described in the New Testament. Frantic gestures,
                    convulsions, foaming at the mouth, feats of supernatural strength, furious
                    ravings, bodily lacerations, gnashing of teeth, and other things of a similar
                    character, may be witnessed in most of the cases.” Among the early Christians
                    the demoniacs or energumens (∈vepγoυ∕zevoι) formed a special class under the
                    control of a clerical order of exorcists, and a mass of evidence drawn from such
                    writers as Cyril, Tertullian, Chrysostom, and Minutius Felix, shows that the
                    symptoms of those possessed were such as modern physicians would class under
                    hysteria, epilepsy, lunacy, &amp;c. (See their works, and refs, in Bingham, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of the Christian Church;</hi> Maury, <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Magie et</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Astrologie,</hi> part
                    ii. ch. 2, &amp;c.) Some theologians, while in deference to advanced medical
                    knowledge they abandon the primitive theory of demons causing such diseases in
                    our own time, place themselves in an embarrassing position by maintaining, on
                    the supposed sanction of Scripture, that the same symptoms were really caused by
                    demoniacal possession in the 1st century. A full statement of the arguments on
                    both sides of this once important controversy will be found in earlier editions
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</hi> but for our times it
                    seems too like a discussion whether the earth was really flat in the ages when
                    it was believed to be so, but became round since astronomers provided a
                    different explanation of the same phenomena. It is more profitable <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0073-0062"/> to notice how gradual the change of opinion has
                    been from the doctrine of demon-possession to the scientific theory of disease,
                    and how largely the older view still survives in the world. Not only in savage
                    districts, but in countries whose native civilization is below the European
                    level, such as India and China, the curious observer may still see the exorcist
                    expel the malignant ghost or demon from the patient afflicted with fever,
                    dizziness, frenzy, or any unaccountable ailment. (See Ward, <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Hindoos,</hi> vol. i. p. 155, vol ii. p. 183; Roberts, <hi

                    the belief in mediaeval Europe may be gathered from such works as the excellent
                    treatise by Maury, <hi rend="italic">La Magie et l’Astrologie</hi><hi

                    with ecclesiastical approval a regular exorcist’s manual, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fustis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Flagellum</hi><hi

                    Mengo</hi> (1727), which among its curious contents gives instructions how to
                    get the better of those cunning demons who hide in the bodies of men and vex
                    them with diseases, and which are apt when expelled to take refuge in the
                    patient’s hair. The gradual shifting of opinion is marked by the attempt to
                    reconcile the older demonology with the newer medicine. This argument, which
                    appears among the early Christian fathers, is worked out most elaborately in
                    that curious museum of demonology, the <hi rend="italic">Disquisitiones</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Magicae</hi> of Martin Delrio, published as late as 1720. While
                    inveighing against those physicians who maintain that all diseases have natural
                    causes, this learned Jesuit admits that men may be dumb, epileptic, or lunatic
                    without being obsessed; but what the demons do is that, finding the disposition
                    of epileptics suitable, they insinuate themselves into them; also they attack
                    lunatics, especially at full moon, when their brains are full of humours, or
                    they introduce diseases by stirring up the black bile, sending blacks into the
                    brain and cells of the nerves, and setting obstructions in the ears and eyes to
                    cause deafness and blindness. Looking at the date of this celebrated work, we
                    cannot wonder that in benighted districts of Europe the old diabolical
                    possession and its accompanying exorcism may still now and then be met with, as
                    in 1861 at Morzine in Savoy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    while the priest carried on a dialogue with the devil, whom he addressed by the
                    name of Rusbel, the flend’s answers being of course spoken by the voice of the
                    frantic girl herself. At last a number of demons were supposed to come out of
                    the patient’s body, and such scenes were repeated for days in the presence of
                    many spectators till a riot arose, and the civil authorities intervening put a
                    »top to the whole affair.</p></note> (See A. Constans, <hi rend="italic"

                    last notable cases of this kind in England was that of George Lukins of Yatton,
                    a knavish epileptic out of whom seven devils were exorcised by seven clergymen,
                    at the Temple Church at Bristol, on June 13, 1788. (See <hi rend="italic">Encyc.

                <p>The derivation of the ideas of demons from the phantoms seen in dreams has
                    already been instanced where the apparition is that of a dead man, but there are
                    peculiar kinds of demons which are to be considered specially from this point of
                    view, ’n savage animism, as among the Australians, what we call a <hi
                    rend="italic">nightmare</hi> is of course recognized as a demon; and though we
                    have long learnt to interpret it subjectively as arising from some action of the
                    sleeper’s brain, it is interesting to remember that its name remains proof of
                    the same idea among our ancestors (Anglo-</p>
                <p>Saxon <hi rend="italic">mcer</hi> = spirit, elf, &amp;c., compare old German <hi

                    >Mythologie,</hi> p. 433). The <hi rend="italic">vampires,</hi> or drinkers (Old

                    variety of the nightmare, being witch-souls or ghosts who suck the blood of
                    living victims, thus accounting for their becoming pale and bloodless, and
                    falling into decline. (See Grohmann, <hi rend="italic">Aberglauben aus
                    Böhmen,</hi> p. 24; Ralston, <hi rend="italic">Songs of the Russian People,</hi>
                    p. 410.) From dreams are avowedly formed the notions of <hi rend="italic"
                    >incubi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">succubi,</hi> those nocturnal demons who
                    consort with women and men in their sleep. From the apparent distinctness of
                    their evidence, these beings are of course well known in savage demonology, and
                    in connection with them there already arises among uncultured races the idea
                    that children may be engendered between spirits and human mothers. (See Martin,
                    <hi rend="italic">Mariner's Tonga Islands,</hi> vol. ii. p. 119). For an ancient
                    example of the general belief in this class of demons, no better could be chosen
                    than that of the early Assyrians, whose name for a succubus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >lilit,</hi> evidently gave rise to the Rabbinical tale of Adam’s demon-wife <hi
                    rend="italic">Lilith.</hi> (See Lenormant, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> p.
                    36.) The literature of mediaeval sorcery abounds in mentions of this belief, of
                    which the absurd pseudo-philosophical side comes well into view in the chapter
                    of Delrio (lib. ii. quaest. 15), “An sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae, et
                    an ex tali congressu proles nasci queat î” But its serious side is shown by the
                    accusation of consorting with such demons being one of the main charges in the
                    infamous bull of Innocent VIII., which brought judicial torture and death upon
                    so many thousands of wretched so-called witches. (See Roskoff, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte des Teuf</hi><hi rend="italic">ds,</hi> vol. ii. p. 222.) It further
                    throws light on demonology that the frightful spectres seen in such affections
                    as delirium tremens have of course been interpreted as real demons. It is
                    needless to give instances from among savage tribes, for the connection between
                    such phantoms and the doctrine of demoniacal possession is shown in its most
                    primitive state in modern Europe. In the <hi rend="italic">Fustis Daemonum,</hi>
                    p. 42, it is mentioned that demons before entering human bodies are apt to
                    appear in some terrible form or deformity, human or bestial, and while they seem
                    to the patients suddenly to vanish, then they enter into their bodies. By this
                    supposition the disappearance of the phantom and the accompanying illness of the
                    delirious patient are ingeniously accounted for at one stroke.</p>
                <p>Though the functions ascribed to demons in savage philosophy are especially
                    connected with disease, they are by no means exclusively so, but the swarming
                    host of spirits pervading the world is called on to account for anj events which
                    seem to happen by some unseen but controlling influence. Some cause must lead
                    the wild man to find game one day and come back empty another, to stumble and
                    hurt himself in the dusk, to lose his way and become bewildered in the dark
                    forest, where the cries of animals and other sounds seem to him spir⅛voices
                    misleading or mocking him. For all such events requiring explanation savages
                    find personal causes in intervening demons, who are sometimes ghosts, as when an
                    American Indian falling into the fire will say that an angry ancestral spirit
                    pushed him in; or they may be simply spirits of undefined origin, like those
                    whom the Australians regard as lurking everywhere, ready to do harm to the poor
                    black-fellow. To compare this state of thought with that of the classic world,
                    we have but to remember the remark of Hippocrates about the superstitious who
                    believed themselves infested day and night by malicious demons, or the Romans’
                    fear of those harmful ghost-demons the lemures, whom they got rid of by the
                    quaint ceremonies of the annual Lemuralia. How permanent these demon-ideas <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n74/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0074-0063"/> have been from the infancy of culture, may be
                    well shown by the permanence of the practice of holding at intervals such
                    special ceremonies to expel them. In Siam the people first hunt the demons out
                    of the houses, and then drive them with cannon-shots through the streets till
                    they get them outside the walls into the forest. In Old Calabar they put puppets
                    along the streets leading to the sea, to entice the demons into, and then at
                    dead of night a sudden rush is made by the negroes with whips and torches to
                    drive the spirits down into the sea. Not only do other barbaric regions, such as
                    the South Sea Islands and Peru, furnish similar examples of the expulsion of
                    demons, but it may still be seen among European peasantry. In Sweden,
                    Easter-tide is the season for a general purging of the land from the evil
                    spirits and trolls of the old heathendom; and in many parts of Germany unseen
                    witches are to this day driven out on Walpurgis-night with crack of whip and
                    blast of horn. (See a collection of cases in Bastian and Hartmann, <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Ethnologie,</hi> 1869, p. 189; also
                    Hylten-Cavallius, <hi rend="italic">Wär end och Wirdarne,</hi> part i. p. 178).
                    In these cases it is generally unfavourable influences which are considered as
                    due to the demons. But favourable events are even by savages often recognized as
                    due to the intervention of some kindly spirit, and especially to a guardian or
                    patron demon, whose help accounts for what among ourselves is often not much
                    more rationally considered to be “luck.” It is often a recognized ancestral soul
                    which from natural affection undertakes this duty, as when a Tasmanian has been
                    known to account for escape from danger by the idea that his father’s soul was
                    still watching over him. But it need not be so; and among the American Indians
                    or West Africans, where each man lives in constant imaginary intercourse with
                    his patron-spirit, talking with it, making it offerings, and trusting to its
                    guidance in difficulty and protection from danger, this spirit may be revealed
                    in a dream or vision, and is often connected with some object known as a
                    “medicine” or “fetish,” but is seldom identified with any particular ghost. In
                    Greek literature this idea is best exemplified by the lines of Menander on the
                    good demon whom every man has from birth as his guide through the mysteries of
                    life (ap. Clem. Alex., <hi rend="italic">Stromat.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vf</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the most popularly known example is the
                    so-called “demon” of Socrates, but he himself did not give such personal
                    definiteness to the divine or daemonic influence <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ſkuµóviov)</hi> which "warned him by what he described as a voice or sign (see
                    Zeller, <hi rend="italic">Socrates,</hi> ch. 4). The primitive idea of the
                    patron spirit is carried on in the Roman <hi rend="italic">genius,</hi> whose
                    name (even without the addition of “natalis ”) indicates that it is born with
                    the person whom it accompanies through life. Its place very closely corresponds
                    to that occupied in modern folklore by the guardian angel. There are districts
                    in France where a peasant meeting another, salutes not only the man, but his
                    “companion,” the guardian angel who is supposed to be invisibly at his side.</p>
                <p>Among attendant and patron demons, as recognized in the general belief of
                    mankind, a specially important class is formed by the familiar spirits who
                    accompany sorcerers, giving them mysterious knowledge, uttering oracular
                    responses through their voices, enabling them to perform wonderful feats,
                    bringing them treasure or injuring their enemies, and doing other spiritual
                    services for them. From the descriptions of sorcerers among the lower nations,
                    it is at once evident that their supposed intercourse with demons is closely
                    connected with the symptoms of diseasepossession. Thus among the Zulus, “the
                    disease which precedes the power to divine” is distinctly hysterical, the
                    patient’s morbid sensitiveness and intensely vivid imagination of sights and
                    voices fitting well with his persuasion that he is under the control of some
                    ancestral ghost. So well is this connection recognized among races like the
                    Patagonians and rude tribes of Siberia, that children with an hereditary
                    tendency to epilepsy are brought up to the profession of magicians. Where the
                    sorcerer has not naturally such symptoms of possession by a controlling demon,
                    he is apt to bring them on by violent dancing and beating drums, or by drugs, or
                    to simulate them by mere knavery; which latter is really the most convincing
                    proof that the original notion of the demon of the magician did not arise from
                    imposture, but from actual belief that the morbid excitement, hallucination, and
                    raving consequent on mental disease were caused by spirits other than the man’s
                    own soul, in possession of his body. The primitive and savage theory of
                    inspiration by another spirit getting inside the body is most materialistic, and
                    cheating sorcerers accordingly use <hi rend="italic">ventriloquism</hi> of the
                    original kind, which (as its name implies) is supposed to be caused by the voice
                    of a demon inside the body of the speaker, who really himself talks in a feigned
                    human voice, or in squeaking or whistling tones thought suitable to the
                    thin-bodied spirit-visitor. The familiar spirit may be a human ghost or some
                    other demon, and may either be supposed to enter the man’s body or only to come
                    into his presence, which is somewhat the same difference as whether in disease
                    the demon “possesses” òr “obsesses” a patient, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    controls him from inside or outside. Thus the Greenland <hi rend="italic"
                    >angekok,</hi> or sorcerer, is described as following his profession by the aid
                    of a <hi rend="italic">torngak,</hi> or familiar spirit (who may be an ancestral
                    ghost), whom he summons by drumming, and with whom he is heard by the bystanders
                    to carry on a conversation within the hut, obtaining information which enables
                    him to advise as to the treatment of the sick, the prospect of good or bad
                    weather, and the other topics of the business of a soothsayer. Passing over the
                    intermediate space which divides the condition of savages from that of mediaeval
                    or modern Europeans, we shall find, so far as the doctrine of familiar demons
                    has survived, that it has changed but little in principle. In the witch trials a
                    favourite accusation was that of having a familiar demon. Sir Walter Scott’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Demonology and Witchcraft</hi> contains among others the case of
                    Bessie Dunlop, whose familiar was the ghost of one Thome Reid, killed at the
                    battle of Pinkie (1547), who enabled her to give answers to such as consulted
                    her about the ailments of human beings or cattle, or the recovery of things lost
                    or stolen. This miserable woman, chiefly on her own confession, was as usual
                    “convict and burnt.” Here the imagined demon was a human soul; but other spirits
                    thus attended sorcerers and diviners, such as the spirit called Hudhart, who
                    enabled a certain Highland woman to prophesy as to the conspiracy to murder
                    James I. of Scotland. Dissertations on the art of raising demons for the
                    sorcerers’ service, and even the actual charms and ceremonies to be used, form a
                    large part of the precepts of magical books. (See Ennemoser, <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Magic;</hi> Horst, <hi rend="italic">Zauberbibliothek,</hi> and
                    other works already cited.) Among the latest English books treating seriously of
                    this “black art” is Sibly’s <hi rend="italic">Illustration of the Occult
                    Sciences,</hi> of which a 10th edition, in 4to, bears date London, 1807. The
                    statute of James I. of England enacts that all persons invoking any evil spirit,
                    or consulting, covenanting with, entertaining, employing, feeding, or rewarding
                    any evil spirit, should be guilty of felony, and suffer death. This was not
                    repealed till the reign of George II. Educated public opinion has now risen
                    above this level; but popular credulity is still to be worked upon by much the
                    same means as those employed by savage sorcerers professing intercourse with
                    familiar spirits. At “spiritualistic séances” the convulsive and hysterical
                    symptoms (pretended or real) of the “medium” under the “control” of his “guiding
                    spirit” are much the same as those which <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0075-0064"/> may be seen among the Fijians or the hill-tribes
                    of Burmah, while the feigned voice, supposed to indicate that it is some Negro
                    or Irish spirit speaking through the medium’s organs, is often a clumsier
                    performance than that of the New Zealand sorceress, producing in thin squeaking
                    tones the voice of a family ghost. Many of the special “manifestations,” such as
                    thumping and drumming in the dark, are those usual in the performances of the
                    Siberian shamans, who also, in common with the Greenland angekoks, impose on the
                    bystanders by the miraculous performance of the “rope-trick;” the
                    “planchette-writing,” by the guiding hand of a familiar spirit, has long been
                    done by an inferior class of magicians in China. The crowning incident in the
                    English proceedings is the “materialization” of the familiar spirit in a
                    dimly-seen figure which, when a rush is made to seize it, proves to be a dull or
                    the medium himself in drapery.</p>
                <p>Returning to the general theory of demonology, two important principles have to
                    be brought together under notice. As the religions of the world become more
                    complexly organized, the various kinds of spirits divide into orders or ranks of
                    a hierarchy; while with the growth of dualism the class of demons further
                    arrange themselves as it were in two opposite camps, under the presiding good
                    and evil deities. The way in which such views may be developed is well seen in
                    Bishop Callaway’s <hi rend="italic">Religion of the Amazulu,</hi> among whom the
                    ancestral ghosts (amatongo) carry on after death their friendly or hostile
                    character, so that in general the ghosts of a man’s own family or tribe are
                    friendly demons helping him and fighting on his side, while the ghosts of
                    enemies remain hostile demons. In the religion of Congo, according to Magyar <hi
                    rend="italic">CRefisen in</hi><hi rend="italic">Süd-Afrika,,</hi> 1849-57), the
                    highest deity, Suku-Vakange, takes little interest in mankind, and the real
                    government of the world belongs to the good and bad kilulu,—spirits or demons.
                    When a man dies, according to his circumstances in life he becomes a friend or
                    enemy of the living, and thus passes among the good or bad kilulu. But as there
                    are more bad spirits who torment than good who favour, man’s misery would be
                    unbearable did not Suku-Vakange from time to time, enraged at the wickedness of
                    the evil spirits, terrify them with thunder and smite the more obstinate with
                    his bolts; then he returns to rest and leaves the demons to rule again. In the
                    religion of the ancient Egyptians the dualistic system is worked out in the
                    antagonism between the gods of light and the evil powers under the serpent Apap,
                    whose long undulating form may be seen in those portions of the pictorial ritual
                    of the dead which are painted on the mummy-cases. (See Birch’s translation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Boole of the Dead,</hi> in vol. v. of Bunsen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Egypt’s Place in Universal History.)</hi> In the ancient
                    Babylonian system the demons were classified in orders, and the minuteness with
                    which their functions as personal causes of evil are assigned to them is well
                    shown by the following passage from a cuneiform inscription :—“They assail
                    country after country; they make the slave set himself up above his place; they
                    make the son of the house leave his father; they make the young bird fly out of
                    its nest; they make the ox and the lamb run away—the evil demons who set snares”
                    (Lenormant, p. 29.) In Brahmanism and Buddhism which sprang from it, as well as
                    in the ancient Persian religion, the various orders of spirits who come under
                    the general definition of demons have large place. The latter faith, as
                    represented in the <hi rend="italic">Zend-Avesta,</hi> worked out to its extreme
                    development the doctrines of the good and evil deities, Ahuramazda and
                    Anra-mainyu (Ormuzd and Ahriman), each with his innumerable armies of spirits or
                    demons, those of light, purity, and goodness being met in endless contention by
                    the legions of darkness who seek to undo all good and spread foulness and sin
                    around them. This remarkable system exercised strong influence on religions of
                    later civilization. The later Jewish or Talmudic ideas are strongly leavened by
                    it, and to it is in great measure due the rise of the Manichaean doctrine. The
                    demonology of these systems may best be studied as part of their general
                    doctrine, while their relation to the angelology and demonology of Christianity
                    belongs to Christian theology.</p>
                <p>Though in this short notice only a few illustrative cases are given as to the
                    belief in demons, the great mass of details of the kind in the various religions
                    of the world will be found to conform with them both as to the notion of demons
                    being derived from the idea of the human soul, and as to their function in
                    primitive philosophy being to serve as personal causes of events. The principles
                    of demonology thus form an interesting branch of intellectual history. But
                    beside this, its names and formulas transmitted as they have been by the blind
                    reverence of generations of magicians, preserve for the historical student some
                    curious relics of antiquity. As a pendant to the already-mentioned Talmudic <hi
                    rend="italic">Lilith,</hi> the female nocturnal demon of ancient Assyria, may be
                    noticed <hi rend="italic">Asmodeus,</hi> famous in Le Sage’s novel <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Diable Boiteux,</hi> who is not only to be found in the book of
                    Tobit and the Talmudic legend of King Solomon (see Eisenmenger, <hi
                    rend="italic">Entdecktes</hi><hi rend="italic">Judenthum),</hi> but may be
                    traced back still farther to his real origin in <hi rend="italic">Aeshma
                    daeva,</hi> one of the evil demons of the ancient Persian religion. The
                    conjurations and formulas for raising demons in the curious old book of magic
                    which bears the name of Doctor Faustus (see reprint in Horst) are a wonderful
                    medley of scraps from several religions. Their principal source, beside
                    Christian invocations and fragments of ritual, is Hebrew, whether biblical or
                    from the later Rabbinical books; Aziel, Faust’s own familiar, chosen because he
                    can do his errands swift as thought, is apparently the fallen angel Azael of the
                    Talmud, to whom Solomon goes every day for wisdom; Michael, Raphael, Uriel, and
                    Gabriel guard the four quarters of a mystic demon-circle; while the names of
                    Satan and Pluto, Ariel and Hesper, Petrus and Adonis, figure among incantations
                    in dog-Latin and good high Dutch, and a mass of words reduced to gibberish
                    beyond comprehension. The study of demonology also brings into view the tendency
                    of hostile religions to degrade into evil demons the deities of a rival faith.
                    The ancient schism between two branches of the Aryan race, which separated the
                    Zarathustrian religion from the Vedic religion, now represented by Brahmanism,
                    is nowhere better marked than in the fact that the <hi rend="italic">devas,</hi>
                    the bright, gods of the Hindoo, have become the <hi rend="italic">devs</hi> or
                    evil demons of the Persian. So the evil beings recognized in the folk-lore of
                    Christendom are many of them the naturespirits, lares, and other deities of the
                    earlier heathendom, not discarded as imaginary, but lowered from their high
                    estate and good repute to swell the crowd of hateful demons. <hi
