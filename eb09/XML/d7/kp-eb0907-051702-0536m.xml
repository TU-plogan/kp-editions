                    rend="smallcaps">(c.</hi> 1314-1380), constable of France, the most famous
                    French warrior of his age, was born of an ancient but undistinguished family, at
                    the castle of La Motte-Broon, near Rennes, about 1314. The date is doubtful, the
                    authorities varying between 1311 and 1324. The name is spelt in various ways in
                    contemporary records, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Claquin, Kiesquin, Guescquin,
                    Glayaquin, &amp;c. The familiar form is found on his monument at St Denis, and
                    in some legal documents of the time. In his boyhood Bertrand was a dull learner,
                    spending his time in open air sports and exercises, and could never read or
                    write. He was remarkable for ugliness, and was an object of aversion to his
                    parents. He first made himself a name as a soldier at the tournament held at
                    Rennes in 1338 to celebrate the marriage of Charles of Blois with Jeanne de
                    Penthièvre, at which he unseated the most famous competitors. But this playing
                    at fighting was not enough for his ambition; and iu the war which followed
                    between Charles of Blois and John de Montfort, for the possession of the duchy
                    of Brittany, he served his apprenticeship as a soldier. As he was not a great
                    baron with a body of vassals at his command, he put himself at the head of a
                    band of adventurers, and fought on the side of Charles and of France. He
                    distinguished himself by a brilliant action at the siege of Vannes in 1342; and
                    after that he disappears from history for some years. In 1351, having shortly
                    before been made a knight, he was sent into England with the lords of Brittany
                    to treat for the ransom of Charles of Blois, who had been defeated and captured
                    by the English in 1347. When Rennes was besieged by the duke of Lancaster, in
                    1356, Du Guesclin forced his way with a handful of men into the town, and
                    successfully defended it till June 1357, when the siege was raised in pursuance
                    of the truce of Bordeaux. For this service he was rewarded with the lordship of
                    Roche d’Airien. At the expiration of the truce he distinguished himself by the
                    defence of Dinan, and here he engaged in single combat with Sir Thomas
                    Canterbury. Shortly afterwards he married; and about the same time he passed
                    into the service of France, and greatly distinguished himself at the siege of
                    Melun (1359). In April 1364, in conjunction with Boucicaut, he recovered Mantes
                    and Meulan from the king of Navarre; and in May he defeated the Navarrese under
                    Captai de Buch at Cocherel, and took their leader prisoner. The king now created
                    him marshal of Normandy and count of Longueville. At the battle of Auray, in
                    September of the same year, Charles of Blois was defeated and killed, and Du
                    Guesclin taken prisoner, by Sir John Chandos. The grand companies beginning,
                    after the close of the war, to play the part of brigands in France, it was
                    necessary to get rid of them. Du Guescliu was ransomed for 100,000 crowns, and
                    was charged to lead them out of France. He marched with them into Spain,
                    visiting Avignon on the way, and extorting from the Pope a large sum of money
                    and his absolution. D¾ Guesclin now supported Henry of Trastamare against Peter
                    the Cruel, set the former upon the throne of Castile (1366), and was made
                    constable of Castile and count of Trastamare. In the following year he was
                    defeated and captured by the Black Prince, ally of Peter the Cruel, at Najara,
                    but was soon released for a heavy ransom. Once more he fought for Henry,
                    reinstated him on the throne <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0537-0518"/> (1369), and was created duke of Molinas. In May
                    1370, at the command of Charles V., who named him constable of France, he
                    returned to France. War had just been declared against England, and Du Guesclin
                    was called to take part in it. For nearly ten years he was engaged in fighting
                    against the English in the south and the west of France, recovering from thorn
                    the provinces of Poitou, Guienne, and Auvergne, and thus powerfully contributing
                    to the establishment of a united France. In 1373, when the duke of Brittany
                    sought English aid against a threatened invasion by Charles V., Du Guesclin was
                    sent at the head of a powerful army to seize the duchy, which he did; and two
                    years later he frustrated by a defensive policy the attempt of the duke with an
                    English army to recover it. Finding in 1379 that the king entertained suspicions
                    of his fidelity to him, he resolved to give up his constable’s sword and retire
                    to Spain. His resolution was at first proof against remonstrance; but ultimately
                    he received back the sword, and continued in the service of France. In 1380 he
                    was sent into Languedoc to suppress disturbances and brigandage, provoked by the
                    harsh government of the duke of Anjou. His first act was to lay siege to the
                    fortress of Châteauneuf-Randon, held by the English, strongly garrisoned and
                    well provisioned. A day was fixed conditionally for capitulation. Meanwhile the
                    great warrior was smitten with a mortal illness, and died, July 13, 1380. The
                    commander led out the garrison and deposited the keys of the castle on the
                    coffin of the hero. Du Guesclin lost his first wife iu 1371, and married a
                    second in 1373, but he left no legitimate children. His remains were interred,
                    by order of the king, in the church of St Denis.</p>
