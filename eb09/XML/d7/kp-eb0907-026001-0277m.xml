                    into vapour, which vapour is then condensed, by the application of cold, in
                    another apparatus (the “condenser ”) connected with the vessel, and allowed to
                    collect in a third portion of the apparatus, called a “receiver.” In most cases
                    the substance is a liquid, or assumes the liquid form previous to emitting
                    vapours, and the product obtained (the “distillate ”) is also in greater
                    proportion liquid. The comparatively few and special cases of distillation,
                    wherein solids are converted into vapours which condense directly from the
                    gaseous into the solid form, are designated “sublimations.” Thus we speak of the
                    “distillation” of water or of spirits, while we speak of the “sublimation” of
                    sal-ammoniac. Distillations may be divided into two classes—viz., 1st, those
                    which are <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> and 2d, those which <hi rend="italic"
                    >are,</hi> accompanied by chemical changes. The word “distillation,” in a
                    narrower sense, is generally understood to apply to the first class only. The

                    distillations,” if it were not customary to reserve this term for the particular
                    case in which the substance operated on consists of vegetable or animal matter
                    which is being decomposed by the application of heat alone, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> without the aid of re-agents.</p>
                <p>The general object of simple distillation is the separation of substances of
                    different degrees of volatility. The apparatus used varies very much according
                    to the nature of the substance operated on and of the product extracted, and
                    according to the scale on which the operation is carried out. Of the various
                    contrivances used in chemical laboratories, the simplest is a glass retort, the
                    descending neck of which is inserted into, and goes to near the bottom of, a
                    slanting globular flask. The retort serves for the reception of the substance to
                    be distilled, and is heated by means of charcoal or gas fire; the vapours pass
                    into the flask, which is kept cool by a continuous current of cold water running
                    over it, or, in the case of more volatile substances, by being immersed in ice
                    or some freezing mixture. This somewhat primitive arrangement works
                    satisfactorily only when the vapours are easily condensible, and when the
                    product is meant to be collected as a whole. In the majority of cases, however,
                    the distillate has to be “fractionated,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> collected
                    in a number of separate, consecutive portions; and it is then desirable that the
                    apparatus should be so constructed as to enable one at any moment to examine the
                    distillate as it is coming over. For this purpose it is necessary to condense
                    the vapours on their way to, and not within, the receiver, so that the latter
                    can, at any time, be removed and replaced by another. The condenser most
                    generally used in chemical laboratories is that known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liebig’s condense!'.</hi> It consists of a straight glass or metal tube, 1 to 3
                    feet long and ¾ to 1 inch wide, fitted co-axially, by means of corks or
                    india-rubber tubes, into a wider tube (made of glass or iron) which communicates
                    at the lower end with a water tap, and at the upper with a sink, so that a
                    stream of cold water can be made to run <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the
                    current of the vapour. The condenser tube is fixed in a slanting position, and
                    the vapours made to enter at the upper end. The dimensions of the condenser and
                    rate of water-flow depend on the speed at which the vapour is driven over, and
                    on the temperature of that vapour, and, last not least, on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >latent heat of the vapour</hi> and <hi rend="italic">specific heat of the
                    distillate.</hi> To show the importance of the last-named point, let us compare
                    the quantities of heat to be withdrawn from 1 lb of steam and 1 lb of bromine
                    vapour respectively, to reduce them to liquids at 0° C. We have in the case of

                    saturated, and to have the temperature of the condensed water). But obviously a
                    condenser under all circumstances is the more efficacious the greater its
                    surface and the thinner its body. It is also obvious, <hi rend="italic">caeteris
                    paribus,</hi> that the most suitable material for a condenser tube is that which
                    conducts heat best. Hence a metal tube will generally condense more rapidly than
                    one of glass, and for metal tubes copper is better than tin, and silver better
                    than either. In chemical laboratories glass is the <hi rend="subscript">
                    0n</hi>]y material which is quite generally applicable. In chemical works, on
                    the other hand, glass, on account of its fragility, is rarely used; condensers
                    there, wherever possible, are made of metal, usually fashioned into spirals
                    (“worms ”) and set in tub-shaped refrigerators Where acids have to be condensed,
                    stoneware worms are generally employed. In the distillation of acetic acid
                    platinum worms, notwithstanding their high price, have been found to work best,
                    and in the long run to be cheapest.</p>
                <p>The theory and successful execution of the process assume their greatest
                    simplicity when the substances to be separated differ so greatly in their
                    volatility that, without appreciable error, one can be assumed to be
                    non-volatile at the boiling point of the other. A good illustration of this
                    special case is afforded by the customary process used for the purification of
                    water. A natural sweet water may in general be assumed to consist of three
                    parts—1st, water proper, which always forms something like 98 per cent, or more
                    of the whole; 2d, non-volatile salts; 3d, gases. To obtain pure water from such
                    material, we need only boil it in a distillation apparatus, so as to raise from
                    it dry steam, which steam when condensed yields water contaminated only with the
                    gases. To expel these all that is necessary is to again boil it for a short
                    time; the gases go off with the first portions of steam, so that the residue,
                    when allowed to cool in absence of air, constitutes pure water. To pass to a
                    less simple case, let us assume that the substance to be distilled is a solution
                    of ether in water, and the object is the separation of these two bodies. Ether
                    boils at 35’ C., water at 100’ C. The elastic force of saturated steam at 35’ is
                    42 mm., = - <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛¾- = <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th
                    of an atmosphere. Assuming now the mixture to be distilled from a flask, what
                    will go on? Neglecting for the sake of simplicity the small tension of the steam
                    at 35°, we should expect that at first the ether would simply boil away, so to
                    speak, from a bath of warm water at .35° C.; that the vapour would be pure
                    ether, and maintain that composition until all the ether had boiled off; then
                    there would be a break—the temperature of the liquid would gradually rise to
                    100°, and the water then distil over in its turn. And so it is approximately,
                    but not exactly. Our theory obviously neglects some important points. Water at
                    35° has a tension of ∙⅛th atmosphere, ether of one atmosphere; hence the two
                    saturated vapours together should press with a force of 1 ⅛th atmosphere—in
                    other words, the mixture should commence to boil at less than 35°. This, however
                    (as in the majority of analogous cases), is not confirmed by experiment. The
                    mixture commences to boil at a little above 35°, and the boiling point rises <hi
                    rend="italic">steadily</hi> as the proportion of ether in the liquid decreases.
                    Now, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> we should presume that at every given
                    moment the volumes of ether and water in the vapour should be, approximately at
                    least, proportional to the respective vapour tensions at the temperature at
                    which the mixture happens to boil. Thus, for instance, assuming at the first
                    that the liquid boils at 40° C., when the two tensions are equal to 910 and
                    55</p>
                <p>910</p>
                <p>mm. respectively, the vapour will contain −-—— = 0 94 y io+ <hi rend="italic

                    06 of its volume of steam, supposing both substances to have the same chances of
                    forming saturated vapour, which, of course, holds only so long as they both are
                    present in appreciable quantities. We easily see that, as the distillation
                    progresses, the ether vapour must get more and more largely charged with vapour
                    of water, until at last what goes off is <hi rend="italic">steam,</hi>
                    contaminated with less and. less of ether vapour. A thermometer placed near the
                    entrance end of the condenser will, of course, record lower than one plunged
                    into the boiling liquid, because the vapour in rising undergoes partial
                    condensation, and the thermometer being bedewed with the condensed vapour will

                <p>This consideration strips of its apparently anomalous character what we observe
                    when vegetable substances containing essential oils are distilled with water,
                    when we find that these oils, although boiling far above 100° C., go over with
                    the first fractions of the water. Take the case of lemon oil, which boils at
                    about 174° C. The molecular weight of the oil is 136 = C <hi rend="subscript">

                    Hence what goes over at first when lemon peel is distilled with water should

                <p>The oil, although the less volatile substance of the two, being present in small
                    quantity, but finely diffused, is soon completely driven over. No doubt the
                    latent heats of vaporization of the two constituents have something to do with
                    the composition of the vapour formed, as the chance of every particle of the
                    mixture to be vaporized is obviously the greater the less its latent heat of
                    vaporization.</p>
                <p>After what has been said it will be clear that in the distillation of a mixture
                    of two substances of approximately equal molecular weight and latent heats of
                    vaporization, supposing neither to predominate overwhelmingly over the other,
                    the one with the lower boiling point will predominate in, the early, and the
                    other will gradually accumulate in the later, fractions of the distillate. And
                    similarly with mixtures of three or more bodies. The further the respective
                    boiling points are removed from one another the more complete a separation can
                    be effected ∙ but in no case is the separation perfect. It is, however, easily
                    seen that the analytic effect of a distillation can be increased by causing the
                    vapour, before it reaches the condenser, to undergo <hi rend="italic"
                    >partial</hi> condensation, when naturally the less volatile parts chiefly will
                    run back. This artifice is largely employed by chemists, technical as well as
                    scientific. The simplest mode is to let the vapour ascend through a long,
                    vertical tube before it reaches the condenser, and to distil so slowly that a
                    sufficiently large fraction of the vapour originally formed fails to survive the
                    ascent through the cooling influence of the atmosphere. A more effective method
                    is to let the condensed vapour accumulate in a series of small receptacles
                    inserted between flask and condenser, constructed, so that the vapour cannot
                    pass through the receptacles without bubbling through their liquid contents, and
                    so that the liquid in the receptacles cannot rise above a certain level, the
                    excess flowing back into the next lower receptacle or into the still. But the
                    most effective method is to let the vapour ascend through a slanting condenser
                    kept by means of a bath at a certain temperature, which is controlled so that
                    while the liquid in the flask boils rapidly, the distillation only just
                    progresses and no more.</p>
                <p>The general principles thus stated regarding fractional distillation are liable
                    to not a few exceptions, of which the following may be cited as examples. A
                    solution of one part of hydrochloric acid gas in four parts of water boils
                    (constant) at 110° C.—f.e., 10° above the boiling point of water, although the
                    acid constituent is an almost permanent gas. This, however, is easily explained;
                    there can be no doubt that such an acid is a mixture of real hydrates, f.e.,
                    does not contain either free water or free hydrochloric acid. A similar
                    explanation applies to the case of aqueous oil of vitriol, which boils the
                    further above 100° the stronger it is, although the vapour may be, and in the
                    case of acids containing less than 84 per cent, of real acid really is, pure
                    steam. The following cases, however, can scarcely be disposed of by the
                    assumption of the interference of chemical action. Propyl alcohol boils at 97°
                    C., water at 100°; and yet a mixture of the two, as Pierre and Puchot found,
                    when distilled always commences to boil at 88° ’ 5 with formation of a
                    distillate of the approximate composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi> O + 2 ’ 78H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; and this
                    particular aqueous alcohol boils without apparent decomposition at 88° ’ 3. Some
                    time later Dittmar and Steuart made a precisely analogous observation with
                    regard to aqueous allyl alcohol. A strong temptation exists to explain these
                    anomalies by the assumption of definite hydrates in the aqueous alcohols, and
                    this hypothesis would serve in the meantime were it not for the curious fact,
                    discovered by the two French chemists named, that amyl alcohol and water (two
                    liquids which <hi rend="italic">do not mix),</hi> when distilled simultaneously
                    out of the same retort, go over at a constant temperature less than 100°, and
                    with formation of a distillate which, although it is not even a mixture, has a
                    constant composition. The most natural explanation of these phenomena is to
                    assume them to be owing, not to chemical action, but rather to an exceptional
                    absence of chemical affinity between the two components of the mixture, which
                    for once gives the physical forces fair play.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dry (destructive) Distillation.</hi> —Of the great number of
                    chemical operations falling under this head, we can notice only those which are
                    carried out industrially for the manufacture of useful products. Of such the
                    most important are those in which wood, coal, shale, and bones form the
                    materials operated upon. But as these processes form so many important
                    industries, which have all special articles devoted to them, we must confine
                    ourselves here to summing up shortly the features common to all.</p>
                <p>In all cases the “retorts” consist of iron or fire-clay semi-cylinders placed
                    horizontally in a furnace and connected by iron pipes with refrigerators, and
                    through these with gas-holders. Within these retorts the materials are brought
                    up, more or less gradually, to a red heat, which is maintained until the
                    formation of vapours practically ceases. Each of the materials named is a
                    complex mixture of different chemical species. Wood consists mainly of cellulose
                    and other carbo-hydrates, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> bodies composed of carbon
                    and the elements of water; in coal and shale the combustible part consists of
                    compounds of carbon and hydrogen, or carbon, hydrogen, and. oxygen, richer in
                    carbon than the components of wood; bones consist of about half of incombustible
                    and infusible phosphate of lime (bone earth) and half of organic matter, of
                    which the greater part is gelatine (compounds of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and
                    oxygen), and the lesser is fat (compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen). The
                    chemical decomposition in each case is highly complex. An infinite variety of
                    products is invariably formed, which, however, always readily divide into three
                    :—lst, a non-volatile residue, consisting of mineral matter and elementary
                    carbon (“wood charcoal,” “coke,” &amp;c.) which, in the case of animal matter,
                    contains chemically combined nitrogen; 2d, a part condensible at ordinary
                    temperatures which always readily separates into two distinct layers, viz. :—(a)
                    an aqueous portion (“tar-water ”), and <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> a semifluid,
                    viscid, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0280-0263"/> oily, or resinous portion (“tar. ”); and 3d, a.
                    gaseous portion.</p>
                <p>The “tar-water” is the one, of all the four products, of which the qualitative
                    composition most directly depends on the nature of the material distilled. In
                    the case of wood it has an acid reaction, from the presence in it of acetic
                    acid, which is associated (amongst many other things) with acetone and methyl
                    alcohol. In the case of coal it is alkaline, from ammonia, present as carbonate,
                    sulphide, sulphocyanide, and in other forms. Alcohols and oxygenated acids are
                    absent.</p>
                <p>The “tar” is a complex mixture of carbon compounds, all combustible, but,
                    although all directly derived from a vapour, not by any means all of them <hi
                    rend="italic">volatile.</hi> (Regarding the components, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tar.)</hi> The quantity and quality of the tar naturally depend on the kind of
                    material used, but perhaps yet more on the mode in which the distillation is
                    conducted. Thus, for instance, a coal tar produced at low temperature contains a
                    considerable percentage of paraffins. If, on the other hand, the distillation is
                    conducted at a high temperature, the paraffins are almost absent, while the
                    proportion of benzols considerably increases. A similar remark applies to the
                    gaseous portion, as will readily be understood when we say that <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> volatile tar constituents, when passed through red hot
                    tubes, are decomposed with formation of hydrogen and gaseous hydrocarbons, which
                    latter again, when submitted to the same operation, are all liable to undergo
                    dissociation into simpler compounds and association into more complex.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distillation of Water.</hi> —The continual interchange and
                    circulation cf water, between oceans and other great reservoirs of water on the
                    one hand and dry land on the other, may be regarded as a process of
                    distillation. Rain i⅛ thus a form of distilled water; and when it falls through
                    a pure atmosphere it is found to possess the softness and freedom from dissolved
                    salts characteristic of water artificially distilled. Rain water, however,
                    absorbs a considerable proportion of air and some carbonic acid from the air,
                    and also frequently contains ammonia, salts, and free acids.</p>
                <p>Water of that purity which can be secured only by distillation is of
                    indispensable value in many operations both of scientific and industrial
                    chemistry. The apparatus and process for distilling ordinary water are very
                    simple. The body of the still is made of copper, with a head and worm, or
                    condensing apparatus, either of copper or tin. The first portion of the
                    distillate brings over the gases dissolved in the water, ammonia, and other
                    volatile impurities, and is consequently rejected, and scarcely two-fifths of
                    the entire quantity of water can be with safety used as pure distilled
                    water.</p>
                <p>Among the innumerable schemes which have been proposed for the production of a
                    potable fresh water from the salt water of the ocean, two or three dependent on
                    simultaneous distillation and aeration have been found, in practice, to produce
                    most satisfactory results. Of course the simple distillation of sea water, and
                    the production thereby of a certain proportion of chemically fresh water, is a
                    very simple problem; but it is found that water which is merely evaporated and
                    recondensed has a very disagreeable empyreumatic odour, and a most repulsive
                    flat taste, and it. is only after long exposure to pure atmospheric air, with
                    continued agitation, or repeated pouring from one vessel to another, that it
                    becomes sufficiently aerated to lose its unpleasant taste and smell and become
                    drinkable. The water, moreover, till it is saturated with gases, readily absorbs
                    noxious vapours to which it may be exposed. For the successful preparation of
                    potable water from sea water, therefore, the following conditions are essential
                    :—1st, aeration of the distilled product so that it may be immediately available
                    for drinking purposes; 2d, economy of coal to obtain the maximum of water with
                    the minimum expenditure of fuel; and. 3d, simplicity of working parts, to secure
                    the apparatus from breaking down, and enable unskilled attendants to work it
                    with safety. Among the forms of apparatus which have most fully satisfied these
                    conditions are the inventions of Dr Normandy and oi Chaplin of Glasgow. While
                    these have met with most acceptance in the United Kingdom, the apparatus of
                    Rocher of Nantes, and that patented by Gallé and Mazeline of Havre, have been
                    highly appreciated by French maritime authorities.</p>
                <p>Normandy’s apparatus, while leaving nothing to be desired in point of economy of
                    fuel and quality of water produced, is very complex in its structure, consisting
                    of very numerous working parts, with elaborate arrangements of pipes, cocks, and
                    other fittings. It is consequently expensive, and requires for its working the
                    careful attention of an experienced workman. It consists of three essential
                    parts, in addition to any convenient form of boiler from which steam under a
                    certain amount of pressure may be obtained. These parts are called respectively
                    the evaporator, the condenser, and the refrigerator. These are all closed
                    cylindrical vessels, permeated internally with sheaves of pipes, through which
                    pipes the steam generated percolates, condenses, and is aerated as explained
                    below. The refrigerator is a horizontal vessel above which the condenser and the
                    evaporator are placed in a vertical position. When the apparatus is in operation
                    the refrigerator and condenser are filled with sea. water, and a constant
                    current is maintained which enters by the refrigerator, passes upwards through
                    the condenser, and is discharged by an overflow pipe at a level a little above
                    the top of the condenser. The evaporator is filled only to about two-thirds of
                    its height with water fiom the condenser, and the admission and regulation of
                    its contents are governed by a stop-cock on the pipe communicating between the
                    two vessels. The vessels being so prepared, superheated steam is admitted by a
                    pipe leading from the boiler into the top of the evaporator, and, passing
                    through the sheaf of pipes immersed in water, is there condensed. The condensed
                    water passes direct from the evaporator into the pipes of the refrigerator, in
                    which it is cooled to the temperature of the surrounding sea water. Here then is
                    produced pure distilled but non-aerated water; and the means by which it is
                    aerated and rendered fit for immediate use may be now traced. The superheated
                    steam in permeating the pipes in the evaporator heats and vaporizes a portion of
                    the water around them. The steam so generated passes into the sheaf of pipes in
                    the condenser, in which, as already explained, a current of water is constantly
                    rising and passing away by the overflow pipe. The condensation of the steam
                    within the pipes, again, communicates a high temperature to the upper stratum of
                    water in the condenser. As water at a temperature of 54 <hi rend="superscript">
                    0-</hi> 5 C. parts with its dissolved air and carbonic acid gas, a stream of
                    water is continually rising to the upper part of the condenser at a temperature
                    more than sufficient to liberate these gases, and by means of a pipe these pass
                    over into the upper part of the evaporator, and there mingle with and
                    supersaturate the steam generated in that vessel. Instead, therefore, of it
                    being simply steam which passes from the evaporator to the tubes of the
                    condenser, it is a mixture of steam and gases, the latter being in sufficient
                    quantity not only to supersaturate the steam, with which they are mixed, but
                    also fully to aerate the condensed steam which passed direct from the evaporator
                    into the refrigerator. The super-aerated condensed steam passes from the pipes
                    in the condenser into those in the refrigerator, where it meets the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0281-0264"/> non-aerated water from the evaporator pipes, the
                    course of which has already been traced. Here the two products mingle, cool down
                    to the; temperature of the sea, and passing outwards through a filter, may be
                    drawn off as pure aerated water of excellent quality. In Dr Normandy’s apparatus
                    the combustion of 1 lb of coal yields from 14 to 20 lb of potable water. The
                    apparatus is extensively adopted in the British navy, the Cunard line, and many
                    other important emigrant and mercantile lines.</p>
                <p>Chaplin’s apparatus, which was invented and patented later, has also, since 1865,
                    been sanctioned for use on emigrant, troop, and passenger vessels. The apparatus
                    possesses the great merit of simplicity and compactness, in consequence of which
                    it is comparatively cheap and not liable to derangement. In addition to a boiler
                    for generating steam from sea water the apparatus consists of an aerator, a
                    condenser, and a filter. The condenser is a cylinder, usually of cast iron with
                    an internal worm pipe of copper, which is found to be the only really suitable
                    metal for this use. The steam to be condensed is admitted to this worm or coil
                    through the aerator. This part of the apparatus—the aerator—is really the
                    essential feature in the invention, and consists simply of a series of holes
                    perforated around the steam inlet pipe at the point where it enters the
                    condenser. The steam passing down in a powerful jet draws with it through these
                    holes a proportion of atmospheric air sufficient· to properly aerate the water
                    for drinking purposes. The steam and air thoroughly commingled are together
                    condensed as they pass through the coils of the worm,—cold sea water passing in
                    to the condenser at its lowest end, and rising upwards and flowing away at the
                    top. After passing through the filter placed directly under the condenser, the
                    aerated water is delivered or stored ready for use, clear, bright, colourless,
                    palatable, and devoid of odour, at a temperature of about 15° C. The cold sea
                    water for condensing may be forced into the condenser by a special steam pump
                    attached to the apparatus—a plan usually followed on sailing vessels—or any
                    other convenient pumping arrangement may be resorted, to. The steam for
                    condensation is, in steamers, frequently supplied from the engine boilers; but
                    generally it is preferable to employ a special small upright boiler, or to use
                    the boilers attached to steam winches. Chaplin’s apparatus has been adopted by
                    many important British and Continental shipping companies, among others by the
                    Peninsular and Oriental, the Inman, the North German Lloyd, and the Hamburg
                    American Companies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distillation of Spirits.</hi> —Notwithstanding the enormous
                    scale on which this industry is now prosecuted, it is only in modern and
                    comparatively recent times that it has attained to the important position which
                    it now occupies. The art of separating alcoholic spirit from fermented liquors
                    appears, however, to have been known in the far East from the most remote
                    antiquity. It is supposed to have been first known to, and practised by, the
                    Chinese, whence a knowledge of the art gradually travelled westward. A rude kind
                    of still, which is yet employed, has been used for obtaining ardent spirits in
                    Ceylon from time immemorial. The name alcohol indicates that a knowledge of the
                    method of preparing that substance probably came to Western Europe, like much
                    more chemical knowledge, through the Arabs. Albucasis, who lived in the 12th
                    century, is spoken of as the first Western philosopher who taught the art of
                    distillation as applied to the preparation of spirits; and in the 13th century
                    Raymond Lully was not only well acquainted with the process, but also knew the
                    method of concentrating it into what he denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >aqua</hi><hi rend="italic">ardens</hi> by means of potassic carbonate. At the
                    time when Henry II.—in the 12th century— invaded and conαuered Ireland, the
                    inhabitants were in the habit of making and using an alcoholic liquor—usquebagh
                    <hi rend="italic">(uisge-béáctta,</hi> water of life), a term since abbreviated
                    into whisky, which consequently is synonymous with the classical <hi

                    found, among the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands discovered by him, a
                    knowledge ofthe art of distilling spirit from alcoholic infusions.</p>
                <p>The preparation of ardent spirit involves two separate series of operations:—1st,
                    the making of an alcoholic solution by means of vinous fermentation; and 2d, the
                    concentration of the alcoholic solution so obtained by the process of
                    distillation and rectification.</p>
                <p>All substances in nature which contain sugar in any of its forms are susceptible
                    of undergoing vinous fermentation, and may therefore be used as sources of
                    alcohol. Further, all starchy substances and ligneous tissue, seeing that by
                    various chemical processes starch and cellulose may be converted into grape
                    sugar, may also be used for the preparation of alcohol. It is thus obvious that
                    the variety of organic substances, especially of the vegetable kingdom, from
                    which alcohol may be elaborated is almost endless; and in practice it is found
                    that the sources employed are very numerous. Commercially, distilled alcoholic
                    liquors are manufactured of varying strength, or proportion of alcohol to water,
                    according as the spirit is intended to be used for drinking purposes or for
                    employment in the arts. The standard by which excise duty on alcoholic liquor is
                    charged in Great Britain is proof spirit, in which the alcohol and water are in
                    almost equal proportions by weight, there being in 100 parts 49 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 24 of absolute alcohol, and 50 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 76 of water. Distilled spirits are said to be “over proof” when the
                    proportion of alcohol is greater, and “under proof” when there is more water
                    present than is indicated by “proof.” Thus a spirit 11 over proof (o.p.) is a
                    compound which requires the addition of 11 volumes of water to every hundred to
                    reduce it to proof strength; and similarly 10 under proof (u.p.) indicates a
                    liquor from every 100 gallons of which 10 gallons of water must be withdrawn to
                    bring it to proof strength. Spirit for drinking is seldom sold at more than 11
                    over proof, from which it varies downward to 25 and more under proof. Rum,
                    however, is manufactured and imported as highly concentrated as from 10 to 43
                    over proof. Spirit of wine as used in the arts must be at least 43 over proof,
                    and generally it is sold at from 54 to 64 over proof.</p>
                <p>The alcoholic liquors enumerated below are those most commonly distilled for
                    drinking or medicinal purposes. Brandy, when genuine, is a spirit chiefly
                    distilled in France from wine. Rum is made from molasses or treacle, and is
                    distilled in the West Indies, and generally in all countries where the sugar
                    cane is cultivated. From fermented infusions of grain, malted and unmalted, and
                    chiefly from barley, whisky is distilled, and that spirit when “silent” or
                    flavourless is the basis of flavoured spirits, such as gin and factitious or
                    British brandy. Arrack is an Oriental spirit distilled from “toddy,” or the
                    fermented juice of certain palm trees, and also from rice, which grain is the
                    source of saké, the national spirit of the Japanese. Potato brandy is very
                    extensively prepared from the fecula of potatoes in Germany and Russia, and is a
                    spirit much used for fortifying wines, and for making factitious wine, as well
                    as in the arts. Beet root, carrots, Jerusalem artichokes, and several other
                    saccharine roots are also used for the distillation of spirit on a commercial
                    scale. The only example of a spirit drawn from animal sources is the koumiss of
                    the Tartars, which is distilled from the fermented milk of mares.</p>
                <p>The modifications of stills or of distilling apparatus used in the preparation of
                    alcoholic liquor are exceedingly numerous, and many of the later inventions are
                    of most <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0282-0265"/> complicated structure. The simple and primitive
                    varieties of apparatus yield only a comparatively weak spirit on the first
                    distillation, while the effect of the complex appliances now generally used is
                    to produce, in one operation, a highly concentrated spirit, and that with a
                    great saving of fuel, time, and labour. All varieties of distillatory apparatus
                    resolve themsðlves under these heads :—1st, stills heated and worked by the
                    direct application of the heat of a fire; 2d, stills worked by the action of
                    steam blown direct into the alcoholic solution from a steam boiler; and 3d,
                    stills heated by steam passing in coiled pipes through the alcoholic solutions
                    to be acted upon.</p>
                <p>To the first of these classes—stills heated by direct fire— belong the earliest
                    and simplest forms of distillatory apparatus; and for producing particular
                    classes of alcoholic liquor, stills very simple in their construction are yet
                    employed. The common still is a flat-bottomed, close vessel of copper, with a
                    high head to prevent the fluid within boiling over. To the top of this head a
                    tube is connected, which is carried in a spiral form round the inside of a tub
                    or barrel (the condenser or refrigerator), filled with cold water, and from its
                    twisted form this tube receives the name of the “worm.” The tube terminates at
                    the bottom of the barrel, passing through it to the outside, and is conducted
                    into the vessel termed the receiver, a stopcock, or more commonly a vessel
                    termed a “safe,” being usually placed on the tube where it leaves the
                    refrigerator. In distilling with an apparatus of this simple construction, it is
                    obvious that at the beginning of the operation, when the wash or liquid to be
                    distilled is rich in alcohol, and its boiling point consequently low, the
                    distillate will pass over at a low temperature and contain a high percentage of
                    alcohol. But as the operation progresses, the boiling point of the mixture in
                    the still rises, the heat has therefore to be forced, and the quantity of watery
                    vapour which passes over with the alcohol is proportionately increased. As the
                    wash or liquid in the still continually weakens, a point is arrived at when the
                    value of the weak distillate produced will not balance the expenditure on fuel
                    for maintaining the heat of distillation.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest devices for economizing the heat of distillation consisted in
                    interposing between the still and the refrigerator a wash warmer, or vessel
                    charged with liquid ready for distillation. Through this vessel the pipe
                    conveying the hot vapours to the refrigerator coil passed, and the vapours,
                    partly condensing there, heated up the wash, which was thus prepared to pass
                    into the still at an elevated temperature. The “pot” stills, in which the
                    markedly flavoured Irish whisky is made, are of this construction. In the great
                    establishment of the Banagher Distillery Company, King’s co., Ireland, simple
                    stills of a capacity of 20,000 gallons are erected having a rousing apparatus
                    within them to keep the wash in agitation so as to prevent solid particles from
                    settling on the bottom and burning. Beyond a wash warmer, or intermediate
                    charger interposed between the still and the condenser, there is no other
                    appliance attached to the apparatus. The first distillate from the still is
                    termed “low wines,” and passes into the “low wines receiver,” whence it passes
                    into No. 1 “low wine still” to undergo a second distillation. The product of the
                    second distillation, under the name of “faints or feints,” is caught in the
                    “faints receiver,” from which it passes to No. 2 low wines still, and from this
                    it is discharged as Irish whisky.</p>
                <p>The introduction of another principle into distillatory apparatus is illustrated
                    by Dorn’s still, which was intro-, duced into Germany in the early part of the
                    century, and is yet much used in smaller establishments in that country. In that
                    apparatus the vessel, of copper, interposed between the still and the condenser
                    is divided horizontally into two unequal compartments by a diaphragm of copper.
                    The upper and larger portion acts as å wash warmer (German, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vorwärmer),</hi> and through it the pipe from the still body coils, opening
                    into the lower division. For a time the whole distillate condenses in this
                    division, but as the temperature of the wash in the upper division rises, and
                    the heat of the more watery distillate from the still also increases, the
                    condensed liquor in the lower division in its turn begins to boil, and undergoes
                    a second distillation or rectification, the vapours from it passing onwards to
                    be condensed in the ordinary refrigerator. In many forms of distillatory
                    apparatus two or more such rectifiers are placed between the primary still and
                    the final condenser. The principle of the rectifier is easily understood,
                    Supposing the operation of distilling to commence, the vapours which condense in
                    rectifier No. 1 are much richer in alcohol than the liquid remaining in the
                    still. The boiling point of the condensed liquid is consequently proportionately
                    lower, and the vapour from the still passing into it gradually raises it to the
                    boiling point, so that in its turn rectifier No. 1 distills into rectifier No 2
                    a liquid of still higher alcoholic richness. The relation of No. 2 to No. 1 is
                    the same as that of No. 1 to the still body, and thus the concentration and
                    redistillation might be carried on to any practicable or desired extent.</p>
                <p>Another principle brought into play in complex stills for the separation of
                    stronger from weaker alcoholic solutions consists of dephlegmation, or the
                    submitting of the vapour to a temperature so regulated that a portion of it, and
                    that of course the most watery, is condensed and separated, running back into
                    the still or into a special vessel, whilst the richly alcoholic vapour passes on
                    to the rectifier or condenser. In Dorn’s still the wide and lofty head attached
                    acts as a dephlegmator, watery vapours condensing on it, and thence falling back
                    into the body; but in the more recent forms of apparatus—such as those of
                    Pistorius and Siemens—special dephlegmators of an elaborate nature are
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>Of the second class of stills—those in which the operation is conducted by the
                    heat of steam generated in a boiler, and forced into the apparatus—the Coffey
                    still may be taken as an example. It is the form most frequently adopted in
                    Great Britain for the manufacture of <hi rend="superscript"> tt</hi> silent”
                    spirit, and it is generally recognized as the best and most economical device
                    for preparing a highly concentrated spirit in a single operation. The Coffey
                    still may further be regarded as a type of continuous distilling apparatus, as
                    in it the necessity for withdrawing exhausted solutions and recharging the still
                    with fresh wash is avoided. Beginning, as the Coffey still does, with the steam
                    of pure water, the principle of rectification formerly alluded to is here
                    carried out from the first step. The watery vapour becomes more and more highly
                    charged with alcoholic fumes, till in the end the strongest spirit falls,
                    condensed, into the receiver. In Coffey’s apparatus the wash is exposed in a
                    series of shallow chambers, placed one over the other, to the vapour of steam,
                    which rises through the perforated bottoms of each chamber, and carries off the
                    alcoholic vapours into the condenser. This condenser also consists of a series
                    of chambers separated from each other by .perforated plates, and is so contrived
                    that the cold wash passing in pipes through these chambers, in its way to feed
                    the other series of chambers, acts as the condenser to the vapour of the
                    alcohol, the wash being gradually heated thereby, as it passes through the
                    successive chambers. The still, therefore, consists essentially of three
                    separate but connected parts. The first is a large square receiver at the base,
                    which receives the spent wash after it has been deprived of its alcohol by
                    passing through the series of evaporating chambers; the second, a large, square,
                    upright <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0283-0266"/> box, termed an “analyzer,” contains the series of
                    evaporating chambers, each communicating with the one below by means of a valved
                    tube, which allows fluid to escape from the upper to the lower chamber only, and
                    having the dividing partition of each chamber perforated with fine apertures, to
                    allow the steam which is admitted from below to pass from chamber to chamber
                    through the shallow layer of wash of each. A safety or escape valve is also
                    fitted to each chamber. The already heated wash enters the uppermost of these
                    chambers in a continuous regulated stream, is gradually deprived of its alcohol
                    by the steam as it passes from chamber to chamber, and at last escapes into the
                    lower large receiver, from which it flows off after attaining a certain depth.
                    The third part of the apparatus also consists of a square upright box, termed a
                    “condenser,” divided into compartments by means of finely perforated plates, and
                    in each chamber is a link of the tube which carries the cold wash onwards to
                    supply the evaporating chambers just described. The alcoholic vapours escaping
                    from the uppermost of the evaporating chambers are carried by pipes to the
                    lowermost of these chambers, and are partly condensed by each successive chamber
                    being colder than the one below it, in consequence of the wash entering the
                    pipes from above, and only getting gradually heated by contact with the
                    alcoholic vapour as it advances from chamber to chamber. As in the lowest of
                    these chambers the heat is greatest, the alcoholic vapour or the condensed
                    spirit contains a large amount of water; but as the chambers are successively
                    cooler, the alcoholic vapour and condensed spirit at last arrive at a
                    temperature only sufficient to convert spirit of the strength wished into
                    vapour, and by an adaptation of valves, the substitution of an impervious
                    partition for the perforated plate, and the admission of the alcoholic vapour
                    into the chambers cooled by the passage of the cold wash in its contained pipes,
                    that spirituous vapour is condensed, and the spirit is drawn off at one
                    operation, of the very strength which it ought to have, and of the utmost
                    purity.</p>
                <p>Flat-bottomed and fire-heated stills are considered the best for the distillation
                    of malt spirit, as by them the flavour is preserved. Coffey’s still, on the
                    other hand, is the best for the distillation of grain spirit, as by it a spirit
                    is obtained almost entirely destitute of flavour, and of a strength varying from
                    55 to 70 over proof. Spirit produced of this high strength evaporates at such a
                    low temperature that scarcely any of the volatile oils on which the peculiar
                    flavour of spirits depends are evaporated with it, hence the reason why it is
                    not adapted for the distillation of malt whisky, which requires a certain amount
                    of these oils to give it its requisite flavour. The spirit produced by Coffey’s
                    still is, therefore, chiefly used for making gin and factitious brandy by the
                    rectifiers, or for being mixed with malt whiskies by the wholesale dealers.</p>
                <p>As the preparation of alcoholic spirit is the most important industry in which
                    the operation of distillation occupies a prominent place, the establishments in
                    which the manufacture is conducted are known as distilleries. But there are many
                    other important industries in which distillation is an essential feature, being
                    in them employed either for the separation, purification, or concentration of
                    various products. A large proportion of the essential oils are, for example,
                    obtained by the distillation of the substances containing them from water or a
                    mixture of salt and water. The treatment of other bodies in which distillation
                    plays a part will be found under their respective headings. (w. <hi
