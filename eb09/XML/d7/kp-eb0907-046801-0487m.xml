                    at an altitude of 402 feet above the level of the Baltic, 72 miles E.S.E. of
                    Leipsic, and 116 miles S.E. of Berlin, in 51° 3' N. lat. and 13° 44' E. long. It
                    is approached on almost every side through avenues of trees, and the distance is
                    bounded by gentle eminences covered with plantations and vineyards. On the left
                    bank of the Elbe are the Altstadt, with three suburbs, and Friedrichstadt
                    (separated from the Altstadt by the Weisseritz, a small affluent of the Elbe);
                    on the right the Neustadt and Antonstadt. Two fine brdges connect the Alstadt
                    and Neustadt,—one of them, the old bridge, erected 1727-31, being 1420 feet
                    long, and having 16 arches. The other, built 1846-52, unites the railways on the
                    right and left banks. The streets of the Altstadt are narrow and somewhat
                    gloomy; those of the Neustadt wider and more regular. In 1875 there were 196,378
                    inhabitants, of whom 138,306 were on the left bank, 58,072 on the right. The
                    vast majority of the population belong to the Lutheran Church.</p>
                <p>On account of its delightful situation, and the many objects of interest it
                    contains, Dresden is often called “the German Florence,” a name first applied to
                    it by Herder. The most imposing of the churches is the church of Our Lady, built
                    1726-45, with a cupola 311 feet high. The Roman Catholic church, built 1737-56,
                    contains a magnificent organ by Silbermann, a number of statues by Mattielli,
                    and pictures by Raphael Mengs, Sylvestre, and other artists. The church of St
                    Sophia, begun in the 14th century, completed in the 16th, and restored in
                    1864-69, the Cross Church, the Russian church, and the synagogue are also
                    noteworthy buildings. The Royal Palace, rebuilt in 1534 by Duke George,
                    surmounted by a tower 387 feet high, the highest in Dresden, is externally
                    unattractive, but the interior is splendidly decorated. In the palace chapel are
                    pictures by Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin, Guido Reni, and Annibale Caracci. The
                    Prince’s Palace, built in 1715, has a fine chapel, in which are various works of
                    Torelli; it has also a library of 20,000 volumes. The Zwinger, begun in 1711,
                    and built in the Rococo style, forms an inclosure within which is a statue of
                    King Frederick Augustus I. It was intended to be the vestibule to a palace, but
                    now contains a number of collections of great value. Until 1846 it was open at
                    the north side; but this space has since been occupied by the Museum, a
                    beautiful building in the Renaissance style, the exterior of which is adorned by
                    statues of Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Dante, Goethe, and other artists and
                    poets, by Rietschel and Hähnel. The Brühl Palace was built iu 1737 by Count
                    Brühl, the minister of Augustus II. Near it is the Brühl Terrace, approached by
                    a grand flight of steps, on which are groups, by Schilling, representing
                    Morning, Evening, Day, and Night. The terrace commands a charming view of the
                    Elbe and the surrounding country, and is a favourite promenade. The Japanese
                    Palace, in the Neustadt, built iu 1715 as a summer residence for Augustus IL,
                    receives its name from certain Oriental figures with which it is decorated; it
                    is also sometimes called the Augusteum. Connected with it is a public garden,
                    from which, as from the Brühl Terrace, fine views are obtained. Among the
                    remaining buildings of note may be named the guard-house, the arsenal, and the
                    court theatre, an edifice in the Renaissance style, built since 1871 to replace
                    the theatre burnt in 1869. In the Neustadt there is an equestrian statue of
                    Augustus the Strong, erected in 1737. The public monuments of Dresden also
                    include the Maurice Monument, a relief dedicated by the elector Augustus to the
                    memory of his brother; a statue of Weber, the musical composer, by Rietschel;
                    statues of King Frederick Augustus II. and Theodor Körner, by Hähnel; and the
                    Rietschel monument, on the Brühl Terrace, by Schilling.</p>
                <p>The chief pleasure-ground of Dresden is the Grosser Garten, in which there are a
                    summer theatre, the Rietschel Museum, and a château containing the Museum of
                    Antiquities. The latter is composed chiefly of objects removed from the churches
                    in consequence of the Reformation. Near the château is the zoological garden,
                    formed in 1860, and excellently arranged. A little to the south of Dresden, on
                    the left bank of the Elbe, is the village Räcknitz, in which is Moreau’s
                    monument, erected on the spot where he was fatally wounded in 1813. The
                    mountains of Saxon Switzerland are seen from this neighbourhood. On the right
                    bank, the slopes of which are covered <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n488/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0488-0469"/> with villas, there are several popular places of
                    public resort.</p>
                <p>Dresden owes a large part of its fame to its extensive artistic, literary, and
                    scientific collections. Of these the most valuable is its splendid picture
                    gallery, founded by Augustus I. and increased by his successors at great cost.
                    It is in the Museum, and contains about 2500 pictures, being especially rich in
                    specimens of the Italian, Dutch, and Flemish schools. Among the Italian masters
                    represented are Raphael, Titian, Correggio, Leonardo da Vinci, Paolo Veronese,
                    Andrea del Sarto, Giulio Romano, Annibale Caracci, Guido Reni, and Carlo Dolci.
                    Of the Flemish and Dutch schools there are paintings by Rubens, Vandyck,
                    Rembrandt, and Ruysdael, Wouvermann, Dow, Teniers, Ostade, Potter, &amp;c. The
                    French school is represented, among others, by Poussin and Claude. The gem of
                    the collection is Raphael’s Madonna di San Sisto, for which a room is set apart.
                    There is also a special room for the Madonna of the younger Holbein. Other
                    paintings with which the name of the gallery is generally associated are
                    Coreggio’s La Notte and Mary Magdalene; Titian’s Tribute Money and Venus; The
                    Adoration and The Marriage in Cana, by Paolo Veronese; Andrea del Sarto’s
                    Abraham’s Sacrifice; Rembrandt’s Portrait of Himself with his Wife sitting on
                    his Knee; The Judgment of Paris and The Boar Hunt, by Rubens; Vandyck’s Charles
                    I., his Queen, and their Children. In separate compartments there are a number
                    of crayon portraits, most of them by Rosalba Camera, and views of Dresden by
                    Canaletto and other artists. Besides the picture gallery the Museum includes a
                    magnificent collection of engravings and drawings. There are upwards of 350,000
                    specimens, arranged in twelve classes, so as to mark the great epochs in the
                    history of art. A collection of casts, likewise in the Museum, is designed to
                    display the progress of plastic art from the timeof the Egyptians and Assyrians
                    to modern ages. This collection was begun by Raphael Mengs, who secured casts of
                    the most valuable antiques in Italy, some of which no longer exist.</p>
                <p>The Japanese Palace contains a public library of more than 300,000 volumes, with
                    about 3000 MSS. and 20,000 maps. This library is especially rich in the ancient
                    classics, and in works bearing on literary history and the history of Germany,
                    Poland, and France. In the Japanese Palace there are also a valuable cabinet of
                    coins and a collection of ancient works of art. A collection of porcelain,
                    formerly in the Japanese Palace, but since 1876 in the “Museum Johanneum” (which
                    once contained the picture gallery), is made up of specimens of Chinese,
                    Japanese, East Indian, Sèvres, and Meissen manufacture, carefully arranged in
                    chronological order. There is in the same building an excellent Historical
                    Museum, in which there are many interesting relics of past times, besides
                    objects which cast light on the history of races and of manners. In the Green
                    Vault of the Royal Palace, so called from the character of its original
                    decorations, there is an unequalled collection of precious stones, pearls, and
                    works of art in gold, silver, amber, and ivory. The objects, which are about
                    3000 in number, are arranged in eight rooms. They include the regalia of
                    Augustus II. as king of Poland; the electoral sword of Saxony; a group by
                    Dinglinger, in gold and enamel, representing the court of the Grand Mogul
                    Aurungzebe, and consisting of 132 figures upon a plate of silver 4 feet <hi
                    rend="italic">4</hi> inches square; the largest onyx known, 6§ inches by 2 ⅛
                    inches; a pearl representing the dwarf of Charles II. of Spain; and a green
                    brilliant weighing 40 carats. Besides the Green Vault the Royal Palace has a
                    gallery of arms, consisting of more than 2000 weapons of artistic or historical
                    value. In the Zwinger are the Zoological and Mineralogical Museums, and a
                    collection of instruments used in mathematical and physical science.</p>
                <p>The two chief art institutions in Dresden are the Royal Academy of Arts, founded
                    in 1764, and the Royal Choir. The Art Union, founded in 1828, which has a
                    permanent exhibition in the Brühl Terrace, is a private body; and there are a
                    good many other private art societies more or less distinguished. Dresden is
                    also the seat of a number of well-known scientific associations. The educational
                    institutions of the town are both numerous and of a high order, including a
                    technical college with a staff (in 1876) of 39 professors and teachers, three
                    gymnasia, two real schools of the first class, and many schools of different
                    ranks for popular education. The Catholics and Jews have schools of their own;
                    and there are two seminaries for the education of teachers. Dresden has several
                    important hospitals, asylums, and other charitable institutions.</p>
                <p>Among the chief branches of industry are manufactures in gold and silver,
                    turnery, straw plait, scientific and musical instruments, paper-hangings,
                    artificial flowers, and painters’ canvas. There are several large breweries; a
                    considerable corn trade is carried on; and there is an extensive traffic in
                    books and objects of art. A number of steam-ship companies provide for the
                    navigation of the Elbe.</p>
                <p>Dresden, which is known to have existed in 1206, is of Slavonic origin. It became
                    the capital of Henry the Illustrious, margrave of Meissen, in 1270, but belonged
                    for some time after his death, first to Wenceslas of Bohemia, and next to the
                    margrave of Brandenburg. Early in the fourteenth century it was restored to the
                    margrave of Meissen. On the division of the territory in 1485, it fell to the
                    Albertine line, which has since held it. Having been burned almost to the ground
                    in 1491, it was rebuilt; and in the 16th century the fortifications were begun
                    and gradually extended. John George IL, in the 17th century, formed the Grosser
                    Garten, and otherwise greatly improved the town; but it was in the first half of
                    the 18th century, under Augustus I. and Augustus IL, who were kings of Poland as
                    well as electors of Saxony, that Dresden assumed something like its present
                    appearance. The Neustadt, which had been burned down in the 17th century, was
                    founded anew by Augustus I.; he also founded Friedrichstadt. The town suffered
                    severely during the Seven Years’ War, being bombarded in 1760. Some damage was
                    also inflicted on it in 1813, when Napoleon made it the centre of his
                    operations; one of the buttresses and two arches of the old bridge were then
                    blown up. The dismantling of the fortifications had been begun by the French in
                    1810, and was gradually completed after 1817, the space occupied by them being
                    appropriated to gardens and promenades. Many buildings were completed or founded
                    by King Anton, from whom Antonstadt derives its name. Dresden again suffered
                    severely during the revolution of 1849, but all traces of the disturbances which
                    then took place were soon effaced. In 1866 it was occupied by the Prussians, who
                    did not finally evacuate it until the spring of the following year. Since that
                    time numerous improvements have been carried out, and between 1871 and 1875 the
                    population increased at the rate of rather more than 11 per cent. (J. SI.)</p>
