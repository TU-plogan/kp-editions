                <p>ALTHOUGH dictionaries are so numerous, so well known, and so much used, they vary
                    so greatly in the nature and treatment of their subjects that any definition
                    must be very much modified in order to include some works so entitled and
                    usually so called. In its proper and most usual meaning, a dictionary is a book
                    containing a collection of the words of a language, dialect, or subject,
                    arranged alphabetically or in some other definite order, and with explanations
                    in the same or some other language. What is essential is, that the words given
                    should be all or most of those belonging to the subject of the dictionary, or at
                    least be very many in number, and that they should be arranged in definite
                    order, and accompanied with interpretations. Many other characters may rightly
                    and advantageously belong to a dictionary, but these are the essentials. When
                    the words are few in number, being only a small part of those belonging to the
                    subject, or when they are given without explanation, or some only are explained,
                    or the explanations are partial, the work is called a vocabulary. An
                    alphabetical arrangement of the words of some book or author with references to
                    the places where they occur is called an index. When under each word the phrases
                    containing it are added to the references, the work is called a concordance.
                    Sometimes, however, these names are given to true dictionaries; thus the great
                    Italian dictionary of the Academy of La Crusca, in six volumes folio, is called
                        <hi rend="italic">Vocabolario,</hi> and Ernesti’s dictionary to Cicero is
                    called <hi rend="italic">Index.</hi> When the words are arranged according to a
                    definite system of classification under heads and subdivisions, according to
                    their nature or their meaning, the book is usually called a classed vocabulary;
                    but when sufficient explanations are given, it is often accepted as a
                    dictionary, like the <hi rend="italic">Onomastiχon</hi> cf Julius Pollux, or the
                    native dictionaries of Sanskrit, Manchu, and many other languages. Dictionaries
                    were originally books of reference explaining the words of a language or of some
                    part of it. As the names of things, as well as those of persons and places, are
                    words, and often require explanation even more than other classes of words, they
                    were necessarily included in dictionaries, and often to a very great extent. In
                    time, books were devoted to them alone, and were limited to special <pb

                    dictionaries of things now rival in number and variety those of words or of
                    languages, while they often far surpass them in bulk. There are dictionaries of
                    biography and history, real and fictitious, general and special, relating to men
                    of all countries, characters, and professions; dictionaries of bibliography,
                    relating to all books, or to those of some particular kind or country;
                    dictionaries of geography, of the whole world, of particular countries, or of
                    small districts, of towns and of villages, of castles, monasteries, and other
                    buildings. There are dictionaries of philosophy; of mathematics; of natural
                    history, zoology, botany; of birds, trees, plants, and flowers; of chemistry,
                    geology, and mineralogy; of architecture, painting, and music; of medicine,
                    surgery, anatomy, pathology, and physiology; of diplomacy; of law, canon, civil,
                    statutory, and criminal; of political and social sciences; of agriculture, rural
                    economy, and gardening; of commerce, navigation, horsemanship, and the military
                    art; of mechanics, machines, and the manual arts. There are dictionaries of
                    antiquities, of chronology, of dates, of genealogy, of heraldry, of diplomatics,
                    of abbreviations, of useful receipts, of monograms, of adulterations, and of
                    very many other subjects. And lastly, there are dictionaries of the arts and
                    sciences, and their comprehensive offspring, <hi rend="italic"
                        >encyclopaedias,</hi> which include in themselves every branch of knowledge.
                    The tendency of dictionaries of language is to increase the vocabulary, to
                    multiply articles; the tendencies of dictionaries of things, and especially of
                    encyclopaedias, is to diminish the number of articles, fusing subjects together
                    as far as possible, and to develop the explanation, making it longer and more
                    copious and circumstantial. This does away with the necessity of turning to many
                    articles scattered through all parts of the work for a complete view of a
                    subject. On the other hand, as requiring an index, it is less convenient for
                    frequent reference on minor points.</p>

                    used in mediaeval Latin to mean a word. Lexicon is a corresponding word of Greek
                    origin, meaning a book of or for words—a dictionary. A glossary is properly a
                    collection of unusual or foreign words requiring explanation. It is the name
                    frequently given to English dictionaries of dialects, which the Germans usually
                    call idioticon, and the Italians vocabolario. Wörterbuch, a book of words, was
                    first used among the Germans according to Grimm, by Kramer (1719), imitated from
                    the Dutch woordenboek. From the Germans the Swedes and Danes adopted ordbok,
                    ordbog. The Icelandic ordabôk, like the German, contains the genitive plural.
                    The Slavonic nations use slovar, slovnik, and the Southern Slavs ryetshnik, from
                    slovo, ryetsh, a word, formed, like dictionary and lexicon, without composition.

                <p>A dictionary of language should contain all the words which may be reasonably
                    looked for in it, so arranged as to be readily and surely found, and so
                    explained as to make their meaning, and if possible their use, clear to those
                    who have a competent knowledge of the language or languages in which the
                    explanations are given. Some dictionaries may suppose a very considerable degree
                    of knowledge in those who use them, but though one could not be written which
                    would make every word clear to a young child, they should in general be as easy
                    and simple as possible. A full and complete dictionary of a great literary
                    language can be compiled only by great labour, patience, knowledge, and skill,
                    employed for many years in collecting, correcting, adjusting, and completing the
                    labours of many previous generations of workers. Such a dictionary should
                    include all the words of the language. As a great library cannot select books
                    and publications, but must collect and preserve all without regard to their
                    apparent value or worthlessness, for it is impossible to foretell what may be
                    valued in future times, or what may be required by its readers for completing
                    their researches, so a complete and standard dictionary should make no choice.
                    Words obsolete and newly coined, barbarous, vulgar, and affected, temporary,
                    provincial, and local, belonging to peculiar classes, professions, pursuits, and
                    trades, should all find their place,—the only question being as to the evidence
                    for their existence,—not indeed, all received with equal honour and regard, but
                    with their characteristics and defects duly noted and pointed out. A complete
                    dictionary should be the complete record and picture, or, as Archbishop Trench
                    says, the inventory of language. It must contain all words ever in any way
                    belonging to it, in writing or in speech, or it will not be a complete record,
                    and will not satisfy those who consult it. Lexicographers have too often tried
                    to exercise a choice, and not content with being recorders, have made themselves
                    judges of words, and refiners and improvers of language, and have attempted not
                    only to reform the language, but to check it in that growth and development
                    which is inherent in all living tongues, and to make their dictionaries
                    standards and rules of language, rather than inventories and records.
                    Unfortunately, this error is echoed by popular opinion; and a standard
                    dictionary is too often supposed to be an arbitrator of words, rather than a
                    standard of excellence among dictionaries. The intention of the author should
                    be, as Bescherelle says, not to reform the language, but to present it with all
                    its caprices, anomalies, irregularities, beauties, defects,—in a word, as the
                    nation has made it. The precise value or worthlessness of a word can only be
                    marked when it is admitted. If not found in the dictionary, it may be supposed
                    to have been unknown to the author, as there is nothing to show that it has been
                    condemned and rejected. The French Academy at first rejected all technical
                    terms, but was compelled by popular clamour and the success of Furetière’s
                    dictionary, in which very many were given, to admit them in increasing numbers
                    in its seoond and all subsequent editions. It is the more necessary that they
                    should not be excluded, as the meanings are difficult to learn, and are most
                    often looked for; and a dictionary intended for general use, should, as Dr
                    Johnson says, include the words belonging to every profession. Obsolete words
                    are admitted by Johnson, Littré, and other first-rate lexicographers, only when
                    they have remained in use <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0198-0181"/> after a certain period. Richardson gives ónly
                    those useful for etymology, which is Littré’s rule for patois. Grimm admits all
                    words at any time belonging to High German or its dialects. The great German
                    dictionaries generally admit dialects, and in this respect are more complete
                    than the French and English. The Chinese give in their standard dictionaries
                    every character known to exist, though many are erroneous, corrupt, vulgar, or
                    local, or are merely improvements proposed by some eminent person. Of tfie
                    ancient characters, sometimes the pronunciation, and occasionally the meaning,
                    are unknown, while both one and the other are in some cases completely lost.
                    Johnson omits all words relating to proper names, but they, as well as proper
                    names, often as really belong to a language as any other words. The Philological
                    Society propose that their new dictionary of English, begun in 1856, shall
                    contain “every word occurring in the literature of the language,” and “admit as
                    authorities all English books,” unwisely excepting “such as are devoted to
                    purely scientific subjects, as treatises on electricity, mathematics,” &lt;fcc.,
                    beginning “with that definite appearance of an English type of language distinct
                    from the preceding semi-Saxon,” about the year 1250. Their vocabulary of words
                    beginning with the letter B, printed in .1863, contains 17,729. The practice of
                    universal admission of words is becoming more generally adopted in standard
                    dictionaries of all languages.</p>
                <p>Words can be most surely and quickly found when arranged alphabetically in a
                    single series. Other arrangements, though sometimes more useful, are not so
                    generally convenient. When it is thought desirable to separate any class of
                    words, they should still be also inserted in their proper places in the general
                    alphabet. In a large dictionary a small separate additional alphabet is almost
                    lost, and is usually overlooked by searchers. According to Grimm, the
                    alphabetical arrangement not only facilitates reference, but makes the author’s
                    work quicker and surer; “for he who would insert rich contributions must have
                    the places for them before his eyes, and not have to search about undecidedly to
                    find whether the word is already there or not.” The order of the alphabet should
                    be that commonly used in the language. Any other makes reference more slow and
                    uncertain. Grimm says that the order of the Sanskrit alphabet, adopted by
                    Diefenbach and others, brings confusion rather than light to European languages.
                    The etymological arrangement under roots has been generally condemned by
                    experience. It places all words of the same origin together, so that they can be
                    at once seen, which is often very useful and important, and is a great help in
                    learning a language, as it assists the memory. But a word not belonging to the
                    small number of roots cannot be found unless its root is known; otherwise it
                    must be looked for in the index, or if there is none, sought for by guess-work
                    in many places. And as etymologies will vary according to fancy or knowledge, no
                    word, as Grimm says, will be sure of its place, and no arrangement is more
                    destructive of the object and use of a dictionary. All its advantages may be
                    secured by giving under each root a list of derivatives. Another system, more
                    rarely adopted, though perhaps more useful, is that of arranging all words under
                    their leading ideas, so that all those relating to a subject are seen together,
                    and the proper word to express an idea may be found almost as easily as the idea
                    expressed by a word may be found in an ordinary dictionary. It is, in fact, a
                    classed vocabulary of all the words of the language, with the sections arranged
                    alphabetically, and resembles in its purpose the classified index of a
                    bibliographical dictionary, while it is quite as useful and necessary. Boissiere
                    has chosen about 2000 common words, under each of which he gives all the French
                    words evidently attached to it by community of ideas, or by relations of
                    habitual use, cause, means, effect, or any analogy whatever. This part, he says,
                    shows how to call things by their right names, and, as he remarks, great care is
                    taken to teach children grammar, but none to teach them words. In the upper part
                    of each page he gives all the words in alphabetical order, with a reference to
                    the group in which each will be found. Roget, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thesaurus,</hi> gives under each head (1000 in number) not only the words
                    belonging to the idea, but their opposites, and adds at the end of the book an
                    index of all the words. This system, on account of its very great use and value,
                    might well be made a subsidiary part of a standard dictionary, the groups being
                    placed in the general alphabet, and a reference to each group being added to
                    each word. The arrangement by terminations is of use grammatically and
                    stenogra-phically, and for making out words of which the beginning is illegible
                    or wanting. A dictionary of rhymes is similar, but not exactly the same, and is
                    of little use except for making verses, and, when the rhymes are perfect, for
                    showing the pronunciation. In the Semitic languages words are commonly placed
                    under their roots, and in MS. lexicons the roots are often arranged
                    alphabetically, according to the last radical. When Lane was making his great
                    Arabic lexicon, he generally had before him eight or ten native lexicons,
                    containing three different arrangements of roots. In Chinese dictionaries the
                    characters are usually arranged under the 214 radicals, which now serve as an
                    alphabet. In former times the number varied, and was much greater. The
                    characters under each radical are further subdivided according to the number of
                    strokes used in making each character, in addition to its radical, or the
                    abbreviation of its radical which each character contains. But no arrangement is
                    attempted of the characters having the same number of strokes. Other systems are
                    sometimes used, arranged by tones and endings, and by the characters (about
                    1040) called phonetics.</p>
                <p>In the separate articles of a dictionary the arrangement must vary very much with
                    the language, as well as with the word itself. When necessary, the orthography,
                    pronunciation, and grammatical inflexions of the word should be given, and any
                    variations of these at different times and places carefully pointed out, as well
                    as the character of the word, such as obsolete, provincial, &amp;c.; and forms
                    beginning with a different spelling should be placed in separate articles, with
                    references to the main article. The etymology should be given, referring
                    derivatives to their respective roots; and under each root giving, if not the
                    derivation as far back as it can be traced, at least what Littré calls the
                    secondary etymology—that is, deriving it from a word not belonging to the
                    language, as when a French word is traced to a Latin or German word without
                    proceeding farther; and cognate words should generally be enumerated, often with
                    their principal meanings. This gives a primary meaning, but care must be taken
                    that the derivation is a real one, not a mere fancy or guess. The times when the
                    word was introduced or became obsolete should be noted, and the meaning it bore
                    at first, as well as those which prevailed at various periods. The meanings may
                    be arranged in a series, not merely as they may be imagined to have been
                    logically developed from each other, but as their connection may be traced, and
                    can be shown to have existed in actual use; and where this connection cannot be
                    traced, the defect should be pointed out. Sometimes, too, the meanings are, as
                    Johnson says, collateral. In some kinds of dictionaries the explanations may be
                    merely sufficient to identify the word, as in Bilderdijk’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Voordenboek</hi><hi rend="italic">υoor</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        Nederduitsche Spelling,</hi> or, as in most small dictionaries, they may
                    merely give the sense. They may also be full <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0199-0182"/> and complete explanations of all the
                    meanings, and again, as is necessary in a complete dictionary, may include
                    usage. The explanations of the meanings should be precise and not vague, real
                    definitions and not a mere reference of one word to another of the same meaning,
                    as when the French Academy explains <hi rend="italic">fier</hi> by <hi
                        rend="italic">hautain, altier,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hautain</hi> by
                        <hi rend="italic">fier, orgueilleux.</hi> But when one language is explained
                    by another, nothing conveys the meaning so well as a perfectly equivalent word.
                    The interpretation of a language by itself is, as Dr Johnson says, very
                    difficult, for there is no other word to express the idea, and simple ideas
                    cannot be described. Therefore, in Grimm’s dictionary Latin and other languages
                    are used when necessary. Synonyms and homonyms should be given, as well as words
                    of opposite meaning, and their similarities and differences explained. Remarks
                    should be made on difficulties, faults to be avoided, peculiar constructions,
                    figurative, idiomatic, and proverbial expressions, and the origin of these given
                    when possible. All this should be done in the fewest and plainest words.
                    Eloquence is out of place in a dictionary; but the author must not fear fulness
                    when it is necessary, and must not allow brevity to make him obscure. A complete
                    dictionary of a copious language must necessarily be a very large book, but much
                    space may be saved by the use of well-selected terms and abbreviations, and by
                    typographical arrangements.</p>
                <p>Examples form a very important part of a dictionary, but one which is generally
                    omitted, often neglected, and seldom so carefully attended to as it deserves.
                    When no quotations are given, the whole language depends on the authority of the
                    author of the dictionary. The French Academy have always claimed the right of
                    making their own examples. Voltaire says they seem to have made a law not to
                    quote, but, he adds, a dictionary without quotations is a skeleton. Examples may
                    be arranged either under the meanings they illustrate, which is the usual and
                    most useful plan, or, in languages possessing an extensive literature of long
                    duration, chronologically in one series, as the Philological Society formerly
                    proposed. Littré has adopted a medium, and gives examples from authors of the
                    17th, 18th, and 19th centuries under the meanings to which they belong, and
                    those from previous authors in a chronological series. Each quotation should
                    give a complete sense, and not be a mere fragment of a sentence. It should, if
                    possible, be instructive and interesting in itself, but should not on this
                    account be made too long. Those containing etymologies, definitions, or
                    explanations of a word, as well as those in which it is joined to words of the
                    same or opposite meaning, and those which mark its introduction or disuse, and
                    those in which it is used as a foreign word not yet naturalized, should be
                    especially sought for. Each should have as exact a reference as possible. The
                    common practice of giving only the author’s name makes it sometimes impossible
                    to verify a quotation without searching through his entire works, which may fill
                    many volumes. In the case of some rare words, when the quotation would add
                    nothing to the information otherwise given, the mere reference may suffice. The
                    value of a dictionary and the richness of its vocabulary depend very much on the
                    carefulness and extent of the search for examples, which can only be complete
                    when it has extended to the whole literature of the language. If concordances
                    and full indexes were more universal, the search for examples would be much
                    facilitated. The foundation of the Philological Society’s intended dictionary
                    was to have been the reading of all English books not purely scientific for
                    examples by volunteers. In October 1864, 1149 had been read, and 360 were in
                    hand.</p>
                <p>Though complete dictionaries of a language are very few, and none as yet exists
                    in English, large dictionaries are many. The tendency of great dictionaries is
                    to unite in themselves all the peculiar features of special dictionaries. A
                    large dictionary is most useful when a word is to be thoroughly studied, or when
                    there is difficulty in making out the meaning of a word or phrase. Special
                    dictionaries are more useful for special purposes; for instance, synonyms are
                    best studied in a dictionary of sjnonyms. And small dictionaries are more
                    convenient for frequent use as in translating from an unfamiliar language, for
                    words may be found more quickly, and they present the words and their meanings
                    in a concentrated and compact form, instead of being scattered over a large
                    space, and separated by other matter. Dictionaries of several languages, called
                    polyglots, are of different kinds. Some are polyglot in the vocabulary, but not
                    in the explanation, like Johnson’s dictionary of Persian and Arabic explained in
                    English; some in the interpretation, but not in the vocabulary or explanation,
                    like <hi rend="italic">Calepini Octoglotton,</hi> a Latin dictionary of Latin,
                    with the meanings in seven languages. Many great dictionaries are now polyglot
                    in this sense. Some are polyglot in the vocabulary and interpretation, but are
                    explained in one language, like Jal’s <hi rend="italic">Glossaire Nautique,</hi>
                    a glossary of sea terms in many languages, giving the equivalents of each word
                    in the other languages, but the explanation in French. Pauthier’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Annamese Dictionary</hi> is polyglot in a peculiar way. It
                    gives the Chinese characters with their pronunciation in Chinese and Annamese.
                    Special dictionaries are various, and many kinds will be found in the following
                    list. There are dictionaries of etymology, foreign words, dialects, secret
                    languages, slang, neology, barbarous words, faults of expression, choice words,
                    prosody, pronunciation, spelling, orators, poets, law, music, proper names,
                    particular authors, nouns, verbs, participles, particles, double forms,
                    difficulties, and many others. Fick’s dictionary (Göttingen, 1868,8vo; 1874-76,
                    8vo, 4 vols.) is a remarkable attempt to ascertain the common language of the
                    Indo-European nations before each of their great separations. In the second
                    edition of his <hi rend="italic">Etymologische Forschungen</hi> (Lemgo and
                    Detmoldt, 1859-73, 8vo, 7217 pages) Pott gives a comparative lexicon of
                    Indo-European roots, 2226 in number, occupying 5140 pages.</p>
                <p>Comparatively few languages possess dictionaries, and they are few in number
                    compared to other books, probably much under 2 per cent.; and 5000, not counting
                    different editions, might be considered a very large collection. More than half
                    belong to European languages, of which five surpass the rest in the number and
                    variety of their dictionaries, namely, Greek, Latin, French, English, and
                    German. In Asia, those excelling in this respect are Hebrew, Arabic, Persian,
                    Sanskrit, Hindustani, Malay, Chinese, and Japanese; in Africa, Egyptian,
                    Ethiopie, and Kaffre; in America, Otomi, Aztec, Guarani, Tupi, and Quichua.</p>
                <p>The following list of dictionaries is arranged geographically by families of
                    languages, or by regions. In each group the order, when not alphabetical, is
                    usually from north to south, extinct languages generally coming first, and
                    dialects being placed under their language. Dictionaries forming parts of other
                    works, such as travels, histories, transactions, periodicals, reading-books,
                    &amp;c., are generally excluded. When a selection has to be made, the earliest,
                    largest, latest, and best dictionaries are preferred. This system seemed on the
                    whole best calculated to keep together dictionaries naturally associated. The
                    languages to be considered are too many for an alphabetical arrangement, which
                    ignores all relations both natural and geographical, and too few to require a
                    strict classification by affinities, by which the European languages, which for
                    many reasons should be kept together, would be dispersed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n200/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0200-0183"/>
                <p>Under either system, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, whose dictionaries are so
                    closely connected, would be widely separated. A wholly geographical arrangement
                    would be inconvenient, especially in Europe. Any system, however, which attempts
                    to arrange in a consecutive series the great network of languages by which the
                    whole world is enclosed, must be open to some objections; and the arrangement
                    adopted in this list has produced some anomalies and dispersions which might
                    cause inconvenience if not pointed out. The old Italic languages are placed
                    under Latin, all dialects of France under French (but Provençal as a distinct
                    language), and Wallachian among Romanic languages. Low German and its dialects
                    are not separated from High German. Basque is placed after Celtic; Albanian,
                    Gipsy, and Turkish at the end of Europe, the last being thus separated from its
                    dialects and congeners in Northern and Central Asia, among which are placed the
                    Kazan dialect of Tartar, Samoyed, and Ostiak. Accadian is placed after Assyrian
                    among the Semitic languages, and Maltese as a dialect of Arabic; while the
                    Ethiopie is among African languages, as it seemed undesirable to separate it
                    from the other Abyssinian languages, or these from their neighbours to the north
                    and south. Circassian and Ossetic are joined to the first group of Aryan
                    languages lying to the north-west of Persia, and containing Armenian, Georgian,
                    and Kurd. The following is the order of the groups, some of the more important
                    languages, that is, of those best provided with dictionaries, standing alone
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Europe</hi>: Greek, Latin, French, Romance, Scandinavian,
                    Teutonic (including English and German), Celtic, Lithuanie, Slavonic, Ugrian,

                <p>Greek.—Athenaeus quotes 35 writers of works, known or supposed to be
                    dictionaries, for, as they are all lost, it is often difficult to decide on
                    their nature. Of these, Anticlides, who lived after the reign of Alexander the
                    Great, wrote <hi rend="italic">ΕξηγητικAs,</hi> which seems to have been a sort
                    of dictionary, perhaps explaining the words and phrases occurring in ancient
                    stories. Zenodotus, the first superintendent of the great library of Alexandria,
                    who lived in the reigns of Ptolemy I. and Ptolemy IL, wrote <hi rend="italic"
                        >Γλωσσaι,</hi> and also Λt ’ ζc&lt;s <hi rend="italic">lθrικaι,</hi> a
                    dictionary of barbarous or foreign phrases. Aristophanes of Byzantium, son of
                    Apelles the painter, who lived in the ιeigns of Ptolemy II. and Ptolemy III.,
                    and had the supreme management of the Alexandrian library, wrote a number of
                    works, as ’ Aττocαi <hi rend="italic">Λe'ξtιs, Λaκovικai Γλωσσaι,</hi> which,
                    from the titles, should be dictionaries, but a fragment of his Λ&lt;=ξ∈ιs,
                    printed by Boissonade, in his edition of Herodian (London, 1869, 8vo, pp.
                    181-9), is not alphabetical. Artemidorus, a pupil of Aristophanes, wrote a
                    dictionary of technical terms used in cookery. Nicander Colophonius, hereditary
                    priest of Apollo Clarius, bom at Claros, near Colophon, in Ionia, probably in
                    reputation for 50 years, from 181 to 135, wrote <hi rend="italic">Γλωσσaι</hi>
                    in at least three books. Parthenius, a pupil of the Alexandrian grammarian
                    Dionysius (who lived in the 1st century before Christ), wrote on choice words
                    used by historians. Didymus, called <hi rend="italic">χa</hi> ∖ <hi
                        rend="italic">κirτepos,</hi> who, according to Athenaeus, wrote 3500 books,
                    and, according to Seneca, 4000, wrote lexicons of the tragic poets (of which
                    book 28 is quoted), of the comic poets, of ambiguous words, and of cormpt
                    expressions. Glossaries of Attic words were written by Crates, Philemon,
                    Philetas, and Theodoras; of Cretan, by Hermon or Hermonax; of Phrygian, by
                    Neoptolemus; of Rhodian, by Moschus; of Italian, by Diodorus of Tarsus; of
                    foreign words, by Silenus; of synonyms, by Simaristus; of cookery, ny Heracleon;
                    and of drinking vessels, by Apollodorus of Cyrene. According to Suidas, the most
                    ancient Greek lexicographer was Apollonius the sophist, son of Archibius.
                    According to the common opinion, he lived m the time of Augustus at Alexandria.
                    He composed a lexicon of words used by Homer, <hi rend="italic">Atξtιs
                        Ou∙ηpικai,</hi> a very valuable and useful work, though much interpolated,
                    edited by Villoison. from an MS. of the 10th century, Paris, 1773, 4to, 2 vols.;
                    and by Tollius, Leyden, 1788, 8vo; ed. Bekker, Berlin, 1833, 8vo. Erotian or
                    Herodian, physician to Nero, wrote α lexicon on Hippocrates, arranged in
                    alphabetical order, probably by some copyist, whom Klein calls for “homo
                    sciolus.” It was first published in Greek in H. Stephani <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dictionarium Medicum,</hi> Paris, 1564, 8vo; ed. Klein, Lipsiae, 1865, 8vo,
                    with additional fragments. Timaeus the sophist, who, according to Ruhnken, lived
                    in the 3d century, wrote a very short lexicon to Plato, which, though much
                    interpolated, is of great value, 1st ed. Ruhnken, Leyden, 1754; ed. locupletior,
                    Lugd. Bat. 1789, 8vo. Aelius Maeris, called the Atticist, lived about <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 190, and wrote an Attic and Greek lexicon, 1st
                    ed. Hudson, Oxf. 1712, 8vo. Julius Pollux (<hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Ioυλωs
                    ∏oλυδidκτjs) of Naucratis, in Egypt, died, aged 58, in the reign of Commodus
                    (180-192), who made him professor of rhetoric at Athens. He wrote, besides other
                    lost works, an Onomasticon in ten books, being a classed vocabulary, intended to
                    supply all the words required by each subject with the usage of the best

                    antiquities. First printed by Aldus, Venice, 1500, fol.; often afterwards; ed.

                    8vo, 5 vols. Harpocration of Alexandria, who lived in the 4th century, wrote a
                    lexicon on the ten Attic orators, first printed by Aldus, Ven. 1503, fol.; ed.
                    Dindorf, Oxford, 1853, 8vo, 2 vols, from 14 MSS. Orion, a grammarian of Thebes,
                    in Egypt, who lived between 390 and 460, wrote an etymological dictionary,

                    Alexandria, when the heathen temples there were destroyed by Theophilus in 389
                    or 391 escaped to Constantinople, where he was living in 408. He wrote an
                    alphabetical lexicon, now lost, chiefly of prose, called by Photius the largest

                    which he knew. Ammonius, professor of grammar at Alexandria, and priest of the
                    Egyptian ape, fled to Constantinople with Helladius, and wrote a dictionary of
                    words similar in sound but different in meaning, which has been often printed in
                    Greek lexicons, as Aldus, 1497, Stephanus, and separately by Valckenaer, Lugd.

                    Alexandria, probably a heathen, who lived before 389, wrote a lexicon, important
                    for the knowledge of the language and literature, containing many dialectic and
                    local expressions and quotations from other authors, 1st ed. Aldus, Ven. 1514,
                    fol.; the best is Alberti and Ruhnken, Lugd. Bat. 1746-66, fol. 2 vols.;
                    collated with the MS. in St Mark’s Library, Venice, the only MS., existing, by
                    Niels Iversen Schow, Leipzig, 1792, 8vo; ed. Schmidt, Jena, 1867, 8vo. The
                    foundation of this lexicon is supposed to have been that of Pamphilus, an
                    Alexandrian grammarian, quoted by Athenaeus, which, according to Suidas, was in
                    95 books from E to ∩; A to Δ had been compiled by Zopirion. Photius, consecrated
                    patriarch of Constantinople, 25th Dec. 857, living in 886, left a lexicon,
                    partly extant, and printed with Zonaras, Lips. 1808, 4to, 3 vols., being vol.
                    iii.; ed. Naber, Leidae, 1864-5, 8vo, 2 vols. The most celebrated of the Greek
                    glossaries is that of Suidas, of whom nothing is known. He probably lived in the
                    10th century. His lexicon is an alphabetical dictionary of words, including the
                    names of persons and places,—a compilation of extracts from Greek writers,
                    grammarians, scholiasts, and lexicographers, very carelessly and unequally
                    executed. It was first printed by Demetrius Chalcondylas, Milan, 1499, fol.; the
                    best edition, Bemhardy, Halle, 1853, 4to, 2 vols. John Zonaras, a celebrated
                    Byzantine historian and theologian, who lived in the 12th century, compiled a
                    lexicon, first printed by Tittmann, Lips. 1808, 4to, 2 vols. An anonymous Greek
                    glossary, entitled ’ Eτυμoλoγικδvμ∈γα, Etymologicum magnum, has been frequently
                    printed. The first edition is by Musurus, Venitia, 1499, fol.; the best by
                    Gaisford, Oxonii, 1848, fol. It contains many grammatical remarks by famous
                    authorities, many passages of authors, and mythological and historical notices.
                    The MSS. vary so much that they look like the works of different authors.

                <p>The French Academy, after five years’ consideration, began their dictionary, 7th
                    February 1639, by examining the letter A, which took them nine months to go
                    through. The word Académie was for some time omitted by oversight. They decided,
                    8th March 1638, not to cite authorities, and they have since always claimed the
                    right of making their own examples. Ollivier justifies them by saying that for
                    eighty years all the best writers belonged to their body, and they could not be
                    expected to cite each other. Their design was to raise the language to its last
                    perfection, and to open a road to reach the highest eloquence. Antoine
                    Furetière, one of their members, compiled a dictionary which he says cost him
                    forty years’ labour for ten hours a day, and the manuscript filled fifteen
                    chests. He gave words of all kinds, especially technical, names of persons and
                    places, and phrases. As a specimen, he published his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Essai,</hi> Paris, 1684, 4to; Amst. 1685, Γ2mo. The Academy charged him
                    with using the materials they had prepared for their dictionary, and expelled
                    him, 22d January 1685, for plagiarism. He died 14th May 1688, in the midst of
                    the consequent controversy and law suit. His complete work was published, with a
                    preface by Bayle, La Haye and Rotterdam, 1690, fol. 3 vols.; again edited by
                    Basnage de Beauval, 1701; La Haye, 1707, fol. 4 vols. From the edition of 1701
                    the so-called very popular <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de Trévoux,</hi>
                    Trévoux, 1704, fol. 2 vols., was made by the Jesuits, who excluded everything
                    that seemed to favour the Calvinism of Basnage. The last of its many editions is
                    Paris, 1771, fol. 8 vols. The Academy’s dictionary was first printed Paris,
                    1694, fol. 2 vols. They began the revision in 1700; second edition 1718, fol. 2

                <p>Hebrew.—About 875, Zemach, head of the school of Pumbeditha, wrote a Talmudical
                    dictionary of words and things, arranged in alphabetical order, which is lost.
                    About 880, Jehudah ben ’Alan, of Tiberias, and Jehudah ibn Koreish, of Tahurt,
                    in Morocco, wrote Hebrew dictionaries. Saadia ben Joseph (born 892, died 942),
                    of Fayyûm, in Upper Egypt, wrote ſnjx ιa□, probably a Hebrew-Arabic dictionary.
                    Menachem ben Jacob Ibn Sarûk (born 910, died about 970), of Tortosa and Cordova,
                    wrote a copious Hebrew dictionary, first printed by Herschell F. Filipowski,
                    Edinburgh, 1855, 8vo, from five MSS. David ben Abraham, of Fâs, wrote, in
                    Arabic, a large Hebrew dictionary, the MS. of which, a quarto of 313 leaves on
                    cotton paper, was found about 1830 by A. Firkowitz, of Eupatoria, in the cellar
                    of a Karaite synagogue in Jerusalem. The age of this work cannot be ascertained.
                    About 1050, Ali ben Suleiman wrote a dictionary in Arabic, on the plan of that
                    of David ben Abraham. The MS. of 429 leaves belongs to Firkowitz. Haja ben
                    Sherira, the famous teacher of the Academy of Pumbeditha, wrote a Hebrew
                    dictionary in Arabic, called <hi rend="italic">El Châvi</hi> (The Gathering),
                    arranged alphabetically in the order of the last radical letter. This dictionary
                    is lost, as well as that of the Spaniard Isaac ben Saul, of Lucena. Iona ibn
                    Ganach, of Cordova, bom about 985, wrote a Hebrew dictionary in Arabic called
                        <hi rend="italic">Kitáb el Azul</hi> (Book of Roots). This, as well as a
                    Hebrew translation by Samuel ibn Tabôn, is extant in MS., and was used by
                    Gesenius in his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> Rabbi David ben Joseph Kimchi
                    died soon after 1232. His lexicon of roots, called □'c ’ nσ, was printed at

                <p>Syriac.—Joshua ben Ali, a physi∙cian, who lived about 885, made a Syro-Arabic
                    lexicon, of which there is an MS. in the Vatican. Hoffmann printed this lexicon
                    from Alif to Mim, from a Gotha MS., Kiel, 1874, 4to. Joshua bar Bahlul, living
                    963, wrote another, great part of which Castelli put into his lexicon. His MS.
                    is now at Cambridge, and, with those at Florence and Oxford, was used by
                    Bernstein. Elias bar Shinaya, born 975, metropolitan of Nisibis, 1009, wrote a
                    Syriac and Arabic lexicon, entitled <hi rend="italic">Kitäb ût Tarjuman fi

                    (Book called the Interpreter for teaching the Language of the Syrians), of which
                    there is a MS. in the British Museum. It was translated into Latin by Thomas à
                    No varia, a Minorite friar, edited by Germanus, and published at Rome by
                    Obicinus, 1636, 8vo. It is a classified vocabulary, divided in 30 chapters, each
                    containing several sections. Crinesius, Wittebergae, 1612, 4to: Buxtorf,

                <p>Arabic.—The native lexicons are very many, voluminous, and copious. In the
                    preface to his great Arabic-English lexicon, Lane describes 33, the most
                    remarkable of which are—the <hi rend="italic">Eyn,</hi> so called from the

                    Sea, or The Extension of the Kamoos. It was undertaken in 1842, at the
                    suggestion and at the cost of the late duke of Northumberland, then Lord
                    Prudhoe, by Mr Lane, who returned to Egypt for the purpose, and lived in Cairo
                    for seven years to study, and obtain copies of, the great MS. lexicons in the
                    libraries of the mosques, few of which had ever been seen by a European, and
                    which were so quickly disappearing through decay, carelessness, and theft, that
                    the means of composing such a work would not long have existed. His work is
                    divided into two books, the first, to be completed in 8 parts, containing words
                    and meanings commonly known to learned Arabs; the second, those that are of rare
                    occurrence, and not commonly known. It does not contain proper names or modern
                    Words. The publication, interrupted by his death, will be carried on by his
                    nephew, Air Staιjley Lane Poole. The preface to Part vi., now in the press, will
                    state fully how far Mr Lane had advanced in this work, and what materials he has
                    left for continuing it. Dr Badger is preparing an English-Arabic dictionary of
                    at least 1000 pages 4 to, which will be very useful when finished. Newman
