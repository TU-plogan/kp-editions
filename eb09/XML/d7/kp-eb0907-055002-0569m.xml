                    met him, and, being struck with his intelligence, gave him a bursary in the
                    college of Harcourt. Dupuis made such rapid progress in his studies that, at the
                    age of twenty-four, he was appointed professor of rhetoric at the coliege of
                    Lisieux, where he had previously passed as a licentiate of theology. In his
                    hours of leisure he applied himself to the study of the law, and in 1770 was
                    admitted an advocate before Parliament. Two university discourses which he
                    delivered, one on occasion of the distribution of prizes, and the other on the
                    death of the empress Maria Theresa, having been printed, were admired on account
                    of their elegant Latinity, and laid the foundation of the author’s fame as a
                    writer. His chief attention, however, was devoted to mathematics, the object of
                    his early studies; and for some years he attended the astronomical lectures of
                    Lalande, with whom he formed an intimate friendship. In 1778 he constructed a
                    telegraph on the principle suggested by Amontons, and employed it in keeping up
                    a correspondence with his friend M. Fortin in the neighbouring village of
                    Bagneux, until the Revolution rendered it necessary that he should destroy his
                    machine to avoid suspicion.</p>
                <p>Much about the same time, Dupuis formed his ingenious theory with respect to the
                    origin of the Greek months. In the course of his investigations upon this
                    subject, he composed a long memoir on the constellations, in which he
                    endeavoured to account for the want of any resemblance between the groups of
                    stars in the heavens and the names by which they are known, by supposing that
                    the zodiac was, for the people who invented it, a sort of calendar at once
                    astronomical and rural, and that the figures chosen for the constellations were
                    such as would naturally suggest the agricultural operations of the season. It
                    seemed only necessary, therefore, to discover the clime and the period in which
                    the constellation of <hi rend="italic">Capricorn</hi> must have arisen with the
                    sun on the day of the summer solstice, and the vernal equinox must have occurred
                    under <hi rend="italic">Libra.</hi> It appeared to Dupuis that this clime was
                    Upper Egypt, and that the perfect correspondence between the signs and their
                    significations had existed in that country at a period of between fifteen and
                    sixteen thousand years before the present time; that it had existed only there;
                    and that this harmony had been disturbed by the effect of the precession of the
                    equinoxes. He therefore ascribed the invention of the signs of the zodiac to the
                    people who then inhabited Upper Egypt or Ethiopia. This was the basis on which
                    Dupuis established his mythological system, and endeavoured to explain the
                    subject of fabulous history, and the whole system of the theogony and theology
                    of the ancients.</p>
                <p>Persuaded of the importance of his discoveries, which, however, were by no means
                    entirely original, Dupuis <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0570-0551"/> published several detached parts of his system in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants</hi> for the months of June, October,
                    and December 1777, and of February 1781. These he afterwards collected and
                    published, first in Lalande’s <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> and then in a
                    separate volume in 4to, 1781, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoire</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l’origine des Constellations et sur V
                    Explication de la Fable par l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Astronomie.</hi> The theory
                    propounded in this memoir was refuted by Bailly, in the fifth volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Astronomy,</hi> but, at the same time, with a just
                    acknowledgment of the erudition and ingenuity exhibited by the author. Condorcet
                    proposed Dupuis to Frederick the Great of Prussia as a fit person to succeed
                    Thiébault in the professorship of literature at Berlin; and Dupuis had accepted
                    the invitation, when the death of the king put an end to the engagement. The
                    chair of humanity in the college of France having at the same time become vacant
                    by the death of Bejot, it was conferred on Dupuis; and in 1788 he became a
                    member of the Academy of Inscriptions. He now resigned his professorship at
                    Lisieux, and was appointed by the administrators of the department of Paris one
                    of the four commissioners of public instruction. At the commencement of the
                    Revolutionary troubles Dupuis sought an asylum at Evreux; and, having been
                    chosen a member of the National Convention by the department of Seine-et-Oise,
                    he distinguished himself by the moderation of his speeches and public conduct.
                    In the third year of the republic he was elected secretary to the Assembly, and
                    in the fourth he was chosen a member of the Council of Five Hundred. After the
                    memorable 18th Brumaire he was elected by the department of Seine-et-Oise a
                    member of the legislative body, of which he became the president. He had been
                    proposed as a candidate for the senate when he resolved to abandon politics,
                    devoting himself during the rest of his life to his favourite studies. He died
                    September 29, 1809.</p>
                <p>In 1794 he published the work by which he is best known, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Origine de tous les Cultes, ou</hi><hi rend="italic">lα Religion
                    Universelle</hi> (3 vols. 4t&lt;.&gt;, with an atlas, or 12 vols. 12mo.) Though
                    its circulation was small, it became the subject of much bitter controversy, and
                    the theory it propounded as to the origin of mythology in Upper Egypt led to the
                    expedition organized by Napoleon for the exploration of that country. In 1798
                    Dupuis published an abridgment of his work in one volume 8vo, which met with no
                    better success than the original. Another abridgment of the same work, executed
                    upon a much more methodical plan, was published by Μ. de Tracy. The other works
                    of Dupuis consist of two memoirs on the Γelasgi, inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs of the</hi><hi rend="italic">Institute;</hi> a memoir “On
                    the Zodiac of Tentyra,” published in the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophique</hi> for May 1806; and a <hi rend="italic">Mémoire
                    Explicatif du Zodiaque Chronologique et Mythologique</hi> published the same
                    year, in one volume 4to. Μ. Dacier, secretary to the third class of the
                    Institute, delivered his éloge; and an historical account of his life and
                    writings was published by his widow.</p>
