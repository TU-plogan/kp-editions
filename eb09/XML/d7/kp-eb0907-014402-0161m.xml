                    (1750-1812), Dutch admiral, was born at the Texel in 1750. He entered the navy
                    at the age of twelve, but after twenty-five years of honourable service he had
                    attained no higher rank than that of lieutenant. In 1787 he took part with the
                    Revolutionists, and on the failure of their efforts fled io France. He then
                    entered the French army, and served under Dumouriez and Pichegru in the
                    campaigns of 1792 and 1793. In 1795 he returned to Holland and was appointed
                    rear-admiral. In the following year he attained the rank of vice-admiral, and
                    was named commander of the fleet at the Texel. The most memorable event in his
                    career was the battle of the Texel, fought on the 11th of October 1797, in which
                    after a gallant struggle the Dutch fleet was defeated <pb break="no"

                    under Admiral Duncan. De Winter was in a few months liberated by exchange; and
                    his conduct in the battle was declared by a council of investigation to have
                    nobly maintained the honour of the Dutch flag. He held the post of
                    minister-plenipotentiary to the French republic from 1798 to 1802, when he
                    reassumed the command of the Dutch fleet. He was employed in suppressing the
                    piracies of the Tripolitans, and negotiated a treaty of peace with the
                    Government. He enjoyed the confidence of Louis Bonaparte, king of Holland, and
                    afterwards of the emperor Napoleon I. By the former he was created count of
                    Huessen and made commander-in-chief of his armies by sea and land; and by the
                    latter he was named grand officer of the Legion of Honour, inspector-general of
                    the coasts of the North Sea, and in 1811 commander of the Texel fleet. De Winter
                    died at Paris, June 2, 1812, and his remains were buried in the Pantheon at the
                    public expense.</p>
