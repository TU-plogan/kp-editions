                    >latrunculi,</hi> the men moving diagonally, capturing by leaping over, and
                    obtaining superior power when they arrived at the furthest row of squares. The
                    board, however, consisted of only sixteen squares. It is believed that <hi
                    rend="italic">τreσσοl</hi> among the Greeks was a similar game with a central
                    space “called the sacred barrier and representations of a kind of draught game
                    are frequently found on the monuments of the ancient Egyptians (Wilkinson).</p>
                <p>Draughts is played by two persons. A board (see diagram) is required, and
                    twenty-four men—twelve white <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n464/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0464-0445"/> and twelve black—which at starting are disposed
                    on the board as in the diagram, hither the white or black squares may be played
                    on (the latter being now more usual). If the black squares are used the board
                    must be placed with a black square in the left hand corner; if the white squares
                    are used, it is placed as in diagram.</p>
                <p>The game is played by moving a man, one square at a time, along the diagonal to
                    the right or left. Thus a man placed on square 18 in diagram can move to 15 or
                    14. Each player moves alternately, the first move being decided by lot.</p>
                <p>As soon as a man is moved on the square adjacent to an opponent’s man, and there
                    is an unoccupied square beyond, the unprotected man may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >captured</hi> and removed from the board. Thus, if there is a white man on
                    square 18, and a black man on square 14, square 9 being vacant, and white having
                    to move, he jumps over 14 and remains on square 9, and the man on 14 is taken
                    up.</p>
                <p>If two or more men are so placed that one square intervenes between each they may
                    all be taken at one move. Thus if white having to move has a man on 29, and
                    black men on 25, 18, and 10, the intermediate squares and square 6 being vacant,
                    white could move from 29 to 6, and take the men on 25, 18, and 10. In making
                    such a move with a man, all the steps must be forward, that is, in the direction
                    away from the player, just as in making simple moves and captures.</p>
                <p>It is compulsory to take if able. If a player has a man <hi rend="italic">en
                    prise,</hi> and makes a move that does not capture, his adversary may allow the
                    move to stand without penalty, or he may have the move retracted and compel the
                    player to take, or he may allow the move to stand and remove the man that
                    neglected to capture from the board (called <hi rend="italic">huffing),</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> il</hi> Huff and move” go together, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the player who huffs then makes his move. The huff must be made
                    before the move. If the adversary of the player who fails to capture allows the
                    move to stand, without huffing, and the player who can capture moves again
                    without taking, the adversary again has the options he had before. If a player
                    can take one man in one place and more than one in another, he may take in which
                    place he pleases, not being obliged to capture the larger number of men. But if
                    he elects to take the larger number, he must take all of that lot that are <hi
                    rend="italic">en prise,</hi> or he may be huffed from where he stands when he
                    has taken a portion of the men, or he may be compelled to take the remainder, or
                    the incomplete move may be allowed to stand.</p>
                <p>As soon as a man reaches one of the squares furthest from his side of the board,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when a white man (see diagram) reaches square 1, 2,
                    3, or 4, or a black man square 29, 30, 31, or 32, he is <hi rend="italic"
                    >crowned</hi> by placing one of the captured men of his own colour on him, and
                    becomes a <hi rend="italic">king.</hi> A king has the additional power of moving
                    and taking backwards, 7.e., toward his own side of the table, as well as
                    forwards. But on becoming a king the move ends, notwithstanding that there may
                    be an adverse man <hi rend="italic">en prise.</hi> Thus if there are black men
                    on squares 7 and 6, a white one on 9, and squares 2 and 11 are unoccupied, white
                    having to move takes the man on square 6 and becomes a king; but he cannot take
                    the man on square 7 at the same move. A king can be huffed for not taking, the
                    same as a man, with the exception just pointed out.</p>
                <p>The game proceeds until one of the players has all his men and kings taken, or
                    has all those left on the board <hi rend="italic">blocked,</hi> so that he has
                    no more left. If it should so happen that neither of the players has sufficient
                    advantage in force or position to enable him to win, the game is dra wn. The
                    player having the stronger force may be required to win in forty moves <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> forty on each side), computed from the move on which
                    notice was given; if he fail, the game is drawn.</p>
                <p>The game of draughts has been exhausted, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the reply
                    to every possible move is known by all proficients, and as there is no advantage
                    in moving first, every game ought to end in a draw. Under these circumstances
                    rules for playing are of but little use; the only way to become a player is to
                    study the analyses laid down in works on the subject, and to know them by heart.
                    For beginners, however, it may be stated that men should as a rule be played to
                    the middle of the board rather than to the sides, as in the middle the man
                    attacks two squares, at the side only one. It is good play to push for a king
                    early in the game. Also, as soon as a player has any advantage in force, he
                    should exchange whenever he can. When the forces are equal the position of <hi
                    rend="italic">having the move</hi> should be striven for. To have the move means
                    to occupy such a position as to be able to secure the last move. For example,
                    place kings of opposite colours at 19 and 12. If the king at 12 is next to move,
                    the king at 19 has the move and must win; but if the king at 19 is next to move,
                    the other king has the move and the game must be drawn. Having the move does not
                    always win. Thus at the beginning of a game the second player has the move, but
                    at this stage it is of no use to him. When a player is in a cramped position it
                    is often disadvantageous to have the move.</p>
                <p>In order to ascertain who has the move, divide the squares into two systems of
                    four columns each, the columns of one system being those which commence with the
                    numbers 29, 30, 31, and 32 (see diagram), and end with the numbers 5, 6, 7, and
                    8, the remainder being the columns of the other system. Add together all the men
                    and kings which stand in either system, and if their sum is odd the next player
                    has the move, if even the last player has the move. For example, white has men
                    or kings at squares 26 and 32, black at 28 and 19. There are three pieces on one
                    system and one on the other, both odd. If white is the next player he has the
                    move. An exchange generally, but not always, changes the move; so, when about to
                    exchange, the player should prefer an exchange that will keep the move, or, not
                    having it, an exchange that will gain it. To discover whether an exchange will
                    change the move add together all the capturing pieces in both systems, and if
                    they are odd and the captured pieces are also odd, the move is not changed by an
                    exchange; the same rule applies if they are both even; but if one is even and
                    the other odd, an exchange changes the move.</p>
                <p>The laws of draughts used in match play are Anderson’s, but so few matches at
                    draughts are played that there is scarcely any demand for them, and they are out
                    of print. Omitting those which relate only to match play, the following is an
                    abridgment of Anderson’s laws.</p>
                <p>1. In a series of games the players take the white and black men alternately.
                    Black has the first move, whether the previous game was won or drawn. <hi
                    rend="italic">2. A</hi> player whose turn it is to play touching a man must move
                    it, except he gives notice of adjusting the man; if it cannot be moved, he loses
                    the game. 3. If a man is moved over an angle of the square on which it is
                    stationed, the move must be completed in that direction. 4. The move is
                    completed as soon as the hand is withdrawn from the man played to another
                    square.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n465/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0465-0446"/>
                <p>6. If a player who has the option of huffing touches the man he is entitled to
                    remove, ho must huff. 6. A false move loses the game.</p>
                <p>7. If a player capture one of his own men by error, the adversary may have it
                    replaced or not. 8. When more than one man can be taken at one move, the player
                    must not remove his hand from the capturing man until he lias taken all he can;
                    if he does so the move is completed, and he is liable to be huffed. 9. When a
                    player pushes a man to king, his adversary is bound to crown it. 10. Each player
                    must move within a specified time [the time is generally three, five, or six
                    minutes by previous agreement, unless there is only one way of taking or one
                    move on the board, when only two minutes are as a rule allowed]. 11. The player
                    having the stronger force may have notice given him to win in forty moves; when
                    two kings remain against one, in twenty moves. When the odds of the draw are
                    given, and the situations may be rendered equal by repeating the same
                    manoeuvres, the player giving the odds may be required to win in twenty
                    moves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Polish Draughts</hi> was formerly played on a board of a
                    hundred squares with forty men; but it is now more frequently played with an
                    ordinary draught-board and men, the men being placed at starting as at draughts.
                    The men move and take as at draughts, except that in capturing they move either
                    forwards or backwards like a draught king. A man arriving at a crowning square
                    becomes a <hi rend="italic">queen,</hi> and has the move of a bishop at chess.
                    In her capture she takes any unguarded man or queen in any diagonal she
                    commands, leaping over the captured man or queen and remaining on any unoccupied
                    square she chooses of the same diagonal, beyond the piece taken. But if there is
                    another unguarded man she is bound to choose the diagonal on which it can be
                    taken. For example, place a queen on square 29, and adverse men at squares 22,
                    16, 24, 14. The queen is bound to move from 29 to 11, 20, 27, and having made
                    the captures to remain at 9 or 5, whichever she prefers.</p>
                <p>The capturing queen or man must take all the adverse pieces that are <hi
                    rend="italic">en prise,</hi> or that become so by the uncovering of any square
                    from which a piece has been removed during the capture, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> white queen at square 7, black at squares 10, 18, 19, 22, and 27,
                    the queen captures at 10, 22, 27, and 19, and the piece at 22 being now removed,
                    she must go to 15, take the man at 18, and stay at 22, 25, or 29. In consequence
                    of the intricacy of some of these moves, it is the rule to remove every captured
                    piece as it is taken.</p>
                <p>If a man arrives at a crowning square when taking, and he can still continue to
                    take, he must do so, and not stay on the crowning square as at draughts. Passing
                    a crowning square in taking does not entitle him to be made a queen.</p>
                <p>In capturing, the player must choose the direction by which he can take the
                    greatest number of men or queens, or he may be huffed. Numerical power is the
                    criterion, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> three men must be taken in preference to
                    two queens. If the numbers are equal and one force comprises more queens than
                    the other, the player may take whichever lot he chooses.</p>
                <p>A single queen against three queens can draw. If one player has a queen and man,
                    and the other three queens, the best play is to sacrifice the man, as the draw
                    is more certain with the queen alone.</p>
                <p>When two men of one colour are played on a diagonal with one vacant square
                    between them <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> at squares 16 and 23), the position
                    is called a <hi rend="italic">lunette.</hi> If the adversary enters the <hi
                    rend="italic">lunette</hi> he must capture one of the pieces which compose it.
                    Before entering a lunette it is advisable to calculate what the position will be
                    after a capture, as the position is sometimes intentionally left as a trap.</p>
