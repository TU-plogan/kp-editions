                    harbours, its maritime trade employing about 5000 vessels with a tonnage of
                    270,000. The docks occupy about 100 acres. It possesses sugar refineries, starch
                    manufactories, distilleries, foundries, and large ship-building yards. The
                    fisheries of the coast are valuable and extensive. The public buildings most
                    worthy of notice are the church of St Eloi, reconstructed about 1560 in the
                    Gothic style, with a Corinthian peristyle built in 1783; the lighthouse, 170
                    feet high; the Beffroi, 300 feet high, surmounted with signals for vessels in
                    distress, and containing a celebrated peal of bells; the exchange, the second
                    story of which is a gallery for pictures, statuary, medals, and curiosities; and
                    the theatre. The principal square contains the statue of Jean Bart by David of
                    Angers.</p>
                <p>Dunkirk is said to have originated in a chapel founded by St Eloi jn the 7th
                    century, round which a small village speedily sprung up. In the 10th century
                    Baldwin III., count of Flanders, raised it to the rank of a town. In 1388 it was
                    burned by the English, and in the 16th century Charles V. built a tower for its
                    defence, of which no traces now remain. In 1558 the English, who had for some
                    time held the town, were expelled from it by the French, who in the ensuing year
                    surrendered it to the Spaniards. In 1646 it once more passed into the hands of
                    the French, who, after a few years’ occupation of it, again restored it to
                    Spain. In 1658 it was retaken by the French and made over to the English. After
                    the Restoration, Charles II., being in money difficulties, sold it to the French
                    king Louis XIV., who fortified it. In 1793 it was attacked by the English under
                    the duke of York, who, however, were compelled to retire from its walls with
                    severe loss. The population in 1872 was 34,342.</p>
