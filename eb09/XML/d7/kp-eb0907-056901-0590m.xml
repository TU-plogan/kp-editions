                    as curate at Lantegloss, in Cornwall, and subsequently at Nayland, in Suffolk;
                    and, in 1827, he settled in London. His first books were <hi rend="italic"
                    >Select Translations from Quintus</hi><hi rend="italic">Smyrnoeus,</hi> an
                    edition of Collins, and <hi rend="italic">Specimens of British Poetesses.</hi>
                    He issued annotated editions of George Peele, Robert Greene, John Webster,
                    Thomas Middleton, and Beaumont and Fletcher, with lives of the authors and much
                    illustrative matter. He completed an edition of Shirley left unfinished by
                    Gifford, and contributed biographies of Shakespeare, Pope, Akenside, and Beattie
                    to Pickering’s Aldine Poets. He has also edited several of Bentley’s works, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Specimens of British Sonnets;</hi> and his carefully revised
                    edition of John Skelton, which appeared in 1843, did much to revive interest in
                    that trenchant satirist. In 1857 his edition of Shakespeare was published by
                    Moxon; and the second edition, a great improvement on the old one, was issued by
                    Chapman and Hall in 1866. Dyce’s interest in Shakespeare manifested itself
                    further in such works as <hi rend="italic">Remarks on Collier’s and Kηighcs
                    Editions of Shakespeare, A Few Notes on Shakespeare, and Strictures on Collier's
                    new Edition of Shakespeare.</hi> He was intimately connected with several
                    literary societies, and undertook the publication of Kempe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nine Days’ Wonder</hi> for the Camden Society; and the old plays of <hi
                    rend="italic">Timon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi> were
                    published by him for the Shakespeare Society. He was associated with Halliwell,
                    Collier, and Wright as one of the founders of the Percy Society, which aims at
                    publishing old English poetry. Dyce also issued <hi rend="italic">Recollections
                    oj the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers,</hi> which has been several times reprinted
                    both in Britain and iu the United States. The editions of the dramatists already
                    mentioned were re-issued with many improvements. Dyce died on the 15th May 1869.
                    His reputation rests on his contributions to English literary biography, and on
                    the untiring industry, abundant learning, and admirable critical acumen
                    displayed in his editions of the old English poets. His wide reading in
                    Elizabethan literature enabled him to explain much that was formerly obscure in
                    Shakespeare; while his sound judgment was a sure check to anything like
                    extravagance in emendation. His labours resulted in the best text of Shakespeare
                    we possess. While preserving all that is valuable in former editions, Dyce has
                    added much fresh matter. The <hi rend="italic">Glossary,</hi> which consists of
                    a large volume of 500 pages, is the most exhaustive that has appeared. Not only
                    rare words are explained, but common words w hen employed with an unusual
                    meaning, phrases, proverbs, old customs, and difficult allusions. The book is,
                    therefore, an important contribution to philology and to the history of the
                    English language, as well as to the elucidation of the text. The mere number of
                    words in Dyce’s <hi rend="italic">Glossary</hi> shows a great advance in
                    comprehensiveness. It is calculated that the <hi rend="italic">Globe
                    Glossary</hi> has about 2000 words, and Staunton’s 2500, while Dyce’s has
                    upwards of 5000. The meanings of the words, as used by the poet, are accurately
                    given, and are illustrated by literary quotation and linguistic comment.
                    Altogether Dyce’s Shakespeare is likely long to remain the standard edition of
                    our English dramatist.</p>
