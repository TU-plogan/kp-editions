                    comprehends the whole of the Indian peninsula, and in this view the mountainous
                    system, consisting of the Eastern and Western Gháts, constitutes the most

                    northern extremities with the Vindhya chain of mountains, and thus is formed a
                    vast triangle supporting at a considerable elevation the expanse of table-land
                    which stretches from Cape Comorin to the valley of the Nerbudda. The surface of
                    this table-land slopes from west to east as indicated by the direction of the
                    drainage of the country,— the great rivers the Cauvery, Godavery, Krishna, and
                    Pennaur, though deriving their sources from the base of the Western Gháts, all
                    finding their way into the Bay of Bengal through fissures in the Eastern
                    Gháts.</p>
                <p>In early times this country embraced that possessed by the five Hindu princes of
                    Telingana, Maharashta, the Tamul country, Orissa, and Carnata or Bijáyanagar. It
                    was first invaded by the Mahometans in 1294, who stormed Deogiri, the capital of
                    Maharashta, and abandoned the city to pillage. In the year 1325 the Mahometans
                    made further progress in its conquest; and having extirpated the Hindu
                    dynasties, they annexed the provinces as far south as the Krishna to the empire
                    of Delhi The imperial sway was, however, of brief duration. Telingana and
                    Carnata speedily reverted to their former masters: and this defection on the
                    part of the Hindu states was followed by a general revolt, resulting in the
                    establishment in 1347 of the independent Mahometan dynasty of Bahmani, and the
                    consequent withdrawal of the power of Delhi from the territory south of the
                    Nerbudda. In the struggles which ensued, the Hindu kingdom of Telingana fell to
                    the Mussulmans, who at a later period formed a league against the remaining
                    Hindu prince, and at the battle of Talikota in 1565 destroyed the monarchy of
                    Bijáyanagar or Carnata. On the dissolution of the Bahmani empire, its dominions
                    were distributed into the five Mahometan states of Golconda, Bijápur,
                    Ahmednagar, Beder, and Berar. Of these the larger succeeded in subverting those
                    of less importance; and in 1630, during the reign of Sháh Jahán of Delhi, the
                    greater proportion of the Deccan had been absorbed by the kingdoms of Golconda,
                    Ahmednagar, and Bijápur. During the reign of Aurungzebe (in the latter half of
                    the 17th century) all those states were reduced, and the Deccan was again
                    annexed to the empire of Delhi. In the subsequent reigns, when the great empire
                    of Aurungzebe fell into decay, the Nizám threw off his alliegiance and fixed his
                    court at Hyderabad. At the same time the Mahrattas, emerging from obscurity,
                    established a powerful monarchy, which was usurped by the Peshwa. The remainder
                    of the imperial possessions in the peninsula were held by chieftains
                    acknowledging the supremacy of one or other of these two potentates. In the
                    sequel, Mysore became the prize of the Mahometan usurper Hyder Ali. During the
                    contests for power which ensued about the middle of the last century between the
                    native chiefs, the French and the English took opposite sides. After a brief
                    course of triumph, the interests of France declined, and a new empire in India
                    was established by the British. Mysore formed one of their earliest conquests in
                    the Deccan. Tanjore and the Carnatic were shortly after annexed to their
                    dominions. In 1818 the forfeited possessions of the Peshwa added to their,
                    extent; and these acquisitions, with others which have more recently fallen to
                    the paramount power by cessitfn, conquest, or failure of heirs, form a
                    continuous territory stretching from the Nerbudda to Cape Comorin. Its length is
                    upwards of 1000 miles, and its extreme breadth exceeds 800. This vast tract
                    comprehends the chief provinces now distributed between the presidencies of
                    Madras and Bombay, together with the native states of Hyderabad and Mysore, and
                    those of Kolápur, Sawant-wárí, Travancore, Cochin, and the petty possessions of
                    France and Portugal·</p>
