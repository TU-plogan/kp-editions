                    title of duke was introduced into England when, by a charter dated 17th March
                    1337, the lordships, castles, lands, &amp;c., constituting the earldom of
                    Cornwall, were erected by King Edward III. into a duchy, and were conferred upon
                    his eldest son Prince Edward of Woodstock, afterwards so well and honourably
                    known as the Black Prince, who thus as duke of Cornwall was the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> English duke. When, in 1343, he was created to the
                    dignity of Prince of Wales, the Black Prince was invested with a coronet, a gold
                    ring, and a silver rod. And, as duke of Cornwall, he had already been invested
                    with a sword. The second of the English dukes was Henry, earl of Lancaster,
                    Derby, and Leicester, and count of Provence, who in 1351 was created duke of
                    Lancaster.</p>
                <p>Of the form and enrichment of the princely coronet of the Black Prince no
                    representation or descriptive record is known to exist; nor is it known whether
                    any distinctive coronet was ever assigned to the prince as the ensign of his
                    ducal rank. As now worn, a duke’s coronet has eight golden leaves of a
                    conventional type (commonly called, but without any reason whatever,
                    “strawberry-leaves ”), set erect upon a circlet of gold, and having their stalks
                    so connected as to form them into a wreath. In representations, three only of
                    the leaves, with two half leaves, are shown. Of late years this coronet has
                    inclosed, and in representations is shown to inclose, a cap of crimson velvet,
                    surmounted by a rich golden tassel, and lined and guarded with ermine (fig. 1);
                    but, still more recently, this coronet is commonly represented, with much better
                    taste, with neither cap or lining of any kind, as in fig. 2. The opinion is
                    prevalent that this distinctive form of coronet appears for the first time
                    placed about the basinet of Prince John of Eltham, the younger brother of Edward
                    III., who died in 1336, in his monumental effigy in Westminster Abbey. That
                    there is no foundation for such a supposed origin of the ducal coronet is
                    evident from the effigy itself; since the decorations of the headpiece and of
                    the rest of the armour are precisely the same, and they also are identical with
                    similar decorations that appear in other effigies of about the same date. The
                    decoration, however, that is carved upon the basinet of Prince John may probably
                    have suggested the crest-coronet, which in the 15th century so frequently
                    supported knightly crests. It must be added that the basinet in the effigy of
                    Prince John certainly once was encircled by a plain narrow fillet, probably of
                    gold, for the reception of which a channel still appears, slightly sunk in the
                    alabaster immediately below the band of conventional leafage that is carved in
                    low relief. The effigy of the Black Prince himself (1376), at Canterbury,
                    exhibits on the basinet a decorative accessory that may possibly have been the
                    prototype of the leaf-crowned circlet restricted to dukes in later times. From
                    the jewelled band or fillet that encompasses this basinet there rise sixteen
                    leaves, with a second series of the same number of trefoils of much smaller size
                    alternating with the larger leaves, the stalks of the whole being conjoined.
                    These larger leaves differ very slightly from those that are carved upon the
                    armour of Prince John of Eltham, and they are in exact accordance with a
                    favourite form of decorative foliage in general use when the effigy was
                    executed. In his will, Lionel, duke of Clarence, who died in 1368, bequeathed
                    the <hi rend="italic">“two golden circles,”</hi> with one of which he states
                    that he himself had been “created a duke,” while with the other his elder
                    brother, the Black Prince, had been “created a prince.” It may be accepted as
                    certain that for a considerable time the coronets of both dukes and earls were
                    decorated rather after an arbitrary taste than in accordance with any
                    established rule. Thus, more than a century after the death of the Black Prince,
                    the coronet of John de la Pole, K.G. duke of Suffolk, has the circlet heightened
                    with fleurs-de-lys alternating with clusters of three small balls. The exact
                    period at which the distinctive enrichments of the coronets of the different
                    orders in the British peerage was determined and established still remains
                    undecided.</p>
                <p>In early times, the rank, dignity, and title of duke were directly associated
                    with power, authority, and local possessions, which constituted and were
                    inseparable from his dukedom; but, after a while, these associations gradually
                    became weakened, and at length for the most part they ceased to exist of
                    necessity, so that at the present day the connection between a duke and the
                    locality that gives the title to his dukedom m⅞y be very slight indeed.</p>
                <p>This same title, duke, is borne still, with their princely rank and title, by the
                    princes of the royal family, as it was in the days of Edward III.; but these
                    royal dukedoms, notwithstanding that they constitute peerages and are
                    hereditary, are created chiefly with a view to connect the members of the
                    reigning house with the great cities or with certain provinces of the realm. The
                    old royal dukedom of York is now so far in abeyance that since the last duke of
                    York died without issue no duke of York has been created. The rival royal
                    dukedom of Lancaster since the accession of Henry IV. has been merged in the
                    crown. The dukedom of Cornwall is held by the heir apparent.</p>
                <p>At various periods also, and in different countries, this same title, duke, has
                    been in use to denote certain princes who were the actual sovereigns of small
                    states, or others who, while vassals of some great suzerain, enjoyed in an
                    approximate degree a virtual independence. The term duke, again, was introduced
                    into their English version by the translators of the Old Testament, as a
                    becoming title for certain chieftains and potentates, the Oriental sheiks of a
                    remote antiquity.</p>
                <p>A duke in the British peerage, not of royal rank, is styled “Your Grace,” and he
                    is “Most Noble;” his wife is a “duchess,” and she also is styled “Your Grace,”
                    and is “Most Noble.” All their sons are “lords,” and all their daughters are
                    “ladies;” but their eldest son bears his father’s “second title,” since each of
                    the higher ranks of nobility has one or more of the lower ranks associated with
                    it; thus a duke’s eldest son always ranks as a marquis, and generally bears that
                    title. The parliamentary mantle <pb break="no"

                    doublings of ermine. The royal dukes have coronets as princes. The coronet of a
                    duchess is the same as that of her husband.</p>
                <p>The titles arch-duke and arch-duchess, grand-duke and grand-duchess, are in use
                    on the Continent, the former in Austria and the latter in Russia, to distinguish
                    the princes and princesses of the imperial families. The title grandduke has
                    also been applied to certain of the minor Continental independent princes. (c.
