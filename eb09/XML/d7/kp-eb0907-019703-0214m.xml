                <p><label type="entry">DIE SINKING</label>. The preparation of dies for stamping
                    coins and medals is a work requiring considerable skill and care. The steel
                    selected should be of moderately fine grain and uniform texture, and, when
                    polished, should show no spots or patches under a magnifying glass. Two short
                    lengths having been cut from bars of this, and forged into rough dies, are next
                    made as soft as possible by careful annealing,—being put in an iron pot of
                    animal charcoal, heated to a cherry red, and allowed to cool gradually. After
                    being faced up flatly and smoothly in a lathe, they piss into the hands of the
                    engraver, who traces upon them their appropriate images, obverse and reverse,
                    and works these out, with steel tools, in intaglio. (The inscription is
                    generally stamped with punches and hammer.) The new <hi rend="italic"
                    >matrices,</hi> or maternal dies, when, after repeated impressions on clay,
                    &lt;fcc., and alteration, they are found correct, are ready for hardening—a
                    procass simple enough as regards plain steel, but here very critical, seeing
                    that a delicate engraving has to be kept intact. Each matrix is first protected
                    with a mask, composed of fixed oil thickened with animal charcoal, or of
                    lampblack and linseed oil. They are then placed face downwards in a crucible,
                    and burned in animal charcoal. After being heated to a cherry red, they are
                    taken out with a pair of tongs, plunged in a large body of water, moved about
                    rapidly till all noise ceases, and left in the water till quite cool. If the
                    matrix pipes or sings, there is probably a crack in it. The hardened die is next
                    polished and tempered,—the former by holding it against a running iron disc
                    coated with flouremery and oil; the latter by putting it in water, which is
                    gradually raised to the boiling point, then allowing it to cool slowly, or by
                    placing it on a heated bar of iron till it acquires a rich straw colour. To
                    increase its strength an iron ring may be shrunk upon it like a mechanical
                    jacket. The matrix, treated as here described, might now be used to multiply
                    coins or medals, but it is preferred to use it for first producing <hi
                    rend="italic">punches,</hi> or steel impressions in relief. With this view a
                    steel block is procured, softened by annealing, and turned in the lathe, being
                    made flat at the bottom and obtusely conical at the top. The block is put in
                    the. bed of a die-stamping press, and the matrix brought down on it with force
                    by means of the central screw Thus a copy is produced in relief on the conical
                    surface. Further strokes may be required to perfect it, and the punch is
                    therefore first re-annealed (its surface having beeu hardened by compression),
                    then replaced in the press; the matrix, detached from the screw, is fitted on to
                    it, and pressed in contact by the descent of a block of steel attached to the
                    screw. Thus, after repeated blows and frequent annealing, the impression is
                    completed, and after being retouched by the engraver is hardened and tempered
                    like the matrix. The matrix is now laid aside, and the punch used to produce any
                    number of steel dies by an operation substantially similar to that by which the
                    punch itself was obtained. These are, of course, <hi rend="italic"
                    >facsimiles</hi> of the matrix, and when completed are used for purposes of
                    coinage. Besides coining and medalling, dies are required for a variety of
                    purposes, such as the manufacture of buttons, steel seals, screws, and
                    ornamental articles of metal, calico printing, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">DIEBITSCH-SABALKANSKI,Hans Karl Friedrich Anton</hi>
                    (1785-1831), Count von Diebitsch and Narden, Russian field-marshal, was born in
                    Silesia, May 13, 1785. He entered the Prussian army at the age of twelve; but
                    four years later, by the desire of his father, a Prussian officer who had passed
                    into the service of Russia, he also did the same. He served in the campaign of
                    1805, and was wounded at Austerlitz, fought at Eylau and Friedland, and after
                    Friedland was promoted captain. During the next five years of peace he devoted
                    himself to the study of military science, engaging once more in active service
                    in the campaign of 1812. He distinguished himself by the recapture of Polozk;
                    and by his defence of an important post he saved Wittgenstein’s corps in
                    retreat. He was now raised to the rank of major-general. In conjunction with
                    General Yorck he took possession of Berlin. After the battle of Lützen he was
                    sent into Silesia and took part in negotiating the secret treaty of Reichenbach.
                    Having distinguished himself at the battles of Dresden and Leipsic, he was
                    promoted lieutenant-general. In 1814 Diebitsch strongly urged the march of the
                    allies on Paris; and after their entry the emperor Alexander conferred on him
                    the order of St Alexander Newski. In 1815 he married, attended the Congress of
                    Vienna, and was afterwards made adjutant-general to the emperor. As chief of the
                    imperial staff he accompanied the emperor to Taganrog, and was present at his
                    death. He obtained the confidence of the emperor Nicholas, and was created baron
                    and afterwards count. In the Turkish w ar of 1828-1829 Diebitsch had the chief
                    command; he took Varna, crossed the Balkan, and concluded peace at Adrianople.
                    His passage of the Balkan is commemorated by his surname Sabalkanski; it
                    procured him the rank of field-marshal. On the outbreak of the insurrection in
                    Poland, in 1830, he was appointed to the chief command. His good genius,
                    however, now failed him. After the battle of Ostrolenka he transferred his
                    head-quarters to Kleckzewo, near Pultusk, where he died of cholera, June 10,
                    1831.</p>
