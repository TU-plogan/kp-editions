                    wrote a pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Government,</hi> was a wine merchant at
                    Cheltenham; his mother was a daughter of Samuel Thompson, a famous political
                    reformer. When Dobell was twelve years old, the family went to Gloucestershire;
                    and the poet, ever after, with occasional breaks, kept up his connection with
                    the district. He was educated privately, and never attended either school or
                    university. He refers to this in some precocious lines, in imitation of Chaucer,
                    dating from his eighteenth year. In 1844 he married Emily Fordham, a lady of an
                    old county family in Cambridgeshire. Cheltenham was, for the most part, his home
                    in those early years, as his father’s business had to be carried on; but the
                    summer was often spent in the country. During this period his poetic vein flowed
                    freely. He wrote a number of minor poems instinct with a passionate desire for
                    political reform. <hi rend="italic">The Roman</hi> was also in progress, and was
                    written mainly among the Cots wolds. It appeared in 1850, under the <hi
                    rend="italic">nom</hi><hi rend="italic">de plume</hi> of Sydney Yendys. Next
                    year he travelled through Switzerland with his wife; and, after his return, he
                    formed friendships with Robert Browning, Philip Bailey, George Macdonald,
                    Emanuel Deutsch, Lord Houghton, Ruskin, Holman Hunt, Mazzini, Tennyson, and
                    Carlyle, and conducted an interesting correspondence with Charlotte Bronte. His
                    second large poem, <hi rend="italic">Raider,</hi> written partly at Coxhorne,
                    partly among the Alps, and finished at Amberley Hall, appeared in 1854. The
                    three following years were spent in Scotland—the winters in Edinburgh, the
                    summers in the Highlands. Here he endeared himself to an entirely new circle,
                    including Dr John Brown, Dr Hanna, Hugh Miller, Sir Noel Paton, Sir James Y.
                    Simpson, and Professor and Mrs Blackie. Perhaps his dearest friend at this time
                    was Alexander Smith, in company with whom he published, in 1855, a number of
                    sonnets on the Crimean War, which were followed by a volume on <hi rend="italic"
                    >England in Time of War.</hi> The delivery of an elaborate lecture on the
                    “Nature of Poetry” to the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution, in April 1857,
                    seriously injured Dobell’s chest. Accordingly he spent the winters of the four
                    following years in the Isle of Wight; and, after 1862, the winter generally
                    found him on the Continent, the summer in Gloucestershire. On one occasion,
                    while near Naples, he fell through a thin crust of earth into some underground
                    works, to a depth of about 12 feet. This accident proved injurious to his
                    health; and, in 1869, a mare, which he was trying to break, fell and rolled over
                    with him. After this he was, more or less, an invalid, and lived in
                    Gloucestershire, preserving his admiration for natural beauty, his keen interest
                    in public affairs, his sunny sweetness of temper, aud deep religious feeling,
                    till his death in 1874.</p>
                <p>As a poet Dobell belongs to the “spasmodic school,” as it was happily named by
                    Professor Aytoun, who parodied its style in <hi rend="italic">Firmilian.</hi>
                    The epithet, however, was first applied by Carlyle to Byron. The school includes
                    the Rev. George Gilfillan, Philip James Bailey, Stanyan Bigg, Dobell, Alexander
                    Smith, and, according to some critics, Gerald Massey. It is characterized by an
                    under-current of discontent with the mystery of existence, by vain effort,
                    unrewarded struggle, sceptical unrest, and an uneasy straining after some
                    incomprehensible end. It thus faithfully reflects a prevalent phase of 19th
                    century thought, and consequently is a perfectly legitimate exercise of the
                    muse. Poetry of this kind is marked by an excess of metaphor, which darkens
                    rather than illustrates, and a general extravagance of language. On the other
                    hand, it manifests a freshness and originality, and a rich natural beauty, not
                    often found in more conventional writings. In this school Dobell shares with
                    Bailey the foremost place; and his genius received early recognition from the
                    Rev. George Gilfillan. He is possessed by his ideal of what a poet ought to be.
                    An intensely earnest spirit pervades all his works; and, like Milton and
                    Wordsworth, he has no humour. We sometimes meet, in his writings, conceits and
                    obscurities which remind us of Cowley and Donne; and still offener his
                    intellectual subtlety, gorgeous imagery, and exquisite lyrics recall Shelley.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Roman,</hi> a poem dedicated to the interests of political
                    liberty in Italy, is marked by pathos, energy, and passionate love of freedom;
                    and its clear vivid style enchains the reader throughout. His treatment of the
                    Colosseum has been compared, not unfavourably, with Byron’s. The faults of the
                    work arise almost entirely from the author’s embarrassment in dealing with his
                    own riches. The drama, too, is overlaid with monologue, which i^ carried to such
                    a dreary excess in <hi rend="italic">Balder—</hi> a poem so intensely subjective
                    as to fail utterly in human interest. The gloomy egotism of the moody hero
                    wearies most readers, but is relieved, from time to time, by some of the finest
                    descriptions of nature in English poetry, by Amy’s exquisitely touching songs,
                    and by grander passages than any to be found in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Roman.</hi> There is a distinct falling off, however, in purity of style. The
                    purpose of <hi rend="italic">Balder</hi> has been strangely misunderstood by
                    many critics; and some have actually identified the hero with the author. The
                    object of the book is to show the evil moral effects of egotism and a lust for
                    power on a man of genius. The passage on Chamouni is unsurpassed even by
                    Coleridge. <hi rend="italic">Balder,</hi> still more than his other poems,
                    manifests Dobell’s wealth of thought, as well as the prodigal richness of his
                    imagery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">England in Time of War</hi> is the most pleasing of Dobell’s
                    works, and allows his lyrical impulse full scope. The book is steeped in
                    passion, and gives faithful and poetical, because thoroughly simple, expression
                    to the feelings of many English hearts at the time. In all Dobell’s poems a
                    great fondness for alliteration is observable.</p>
                <p>His chief prose writings have been collected and edited with an introductory note
                    by Professor Nichol <hi rend="italic">{Thoughts on Art, Philosophy, and
                    Religion.</hi> London: Smith, Elder, and Co., 1876.) The lecture on the “Nature
                    of Poetry” is an elaborate disquisition, in which a perfect poem is defined as
                    “the perfect expression of a perfect human mind.” In his pamphlet on <hi
                    rend="italic">Reform,</hi> he maintains “that a just national representation is
                    such as represents the nation at its efficient durable best.” In his memoranda
                    for <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0325-0308"/> a projected play, the character of the cardinal
                    is finely conceived. He is to have “no element <hi rend="italic">not</hi> common
                    to all men and no element <hi rend="italic">as</hi> common to all men,—a life
                    such as every man <hi rend="italic">might</hi> lead but no man <hi rend="italic"
                    >does</hi> lead,—in which the things done are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> those
                    which men do rarely, but the common acts of men done in a rare spirit.” Dobell’s
                    prose writings are studded with such suggestive sentences as we have quoted. The
                    singular truth of his observations of nature is well seejι in his description of
                    the “Symptoms ot the Dissolution of Night” <hi rend="italic">(Thoughts,</hi> p.
                    83.) His prose style lacks simplicity, both in the individual words used and in
                    the structure of the sentences. The classical element is much too prominent in
                    his vocabulary In his religious views, Dobell was a Christian of the Broad
                    Church type. Socially he was one of the most amiable and true-hearted of men. He
                    will long be remembered as an admirable song-writer, a suggestive and original
                    thinker, and an ardent lover of political liberty. The standard edition of his
                    poems is edited by Professor Nichol of Glasgow University, who has prefixed to
                    the work a beautifully written life. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">gi.)</hi></p>
