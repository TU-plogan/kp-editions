                    evil spirit, or prince of the kingdom of evil. There can be no question that
                    such an evil spirit is frequently spoken of in the New Testament. He is
                    designated by various names in addition to these mentioned, such as “the
                    Tempter,” “Beelzebub,” “the Prince of Devils,” “the Strong One,” “the Wicked
                    One,” “the Enemy,” or “the Hostile One.” Throughout the Gospels these terms are
                    used interchangeably, and in all cases seem to denote the same active power or
                    personality of evil outside man and exercising influence over him. It may be a
                    question how far Jesus Christ himself acknowledges the existence of such an evil
                    power, but there can be no question that such a being was recognized in the
                    current belief of the Jews in His time.</p>
                <p>But it is also certain that this belief amongst the Jews was one of'gradual
                    growth, and is not to be tracedin the Old Testament in any such definite form as
                    we meet with it in the New. The expression “Satan” is indeed found in the Old
                    Testament, but only five times, if so frequently, as a proper name,—thrice in
                    the book of Job (L 6, 12; ii. 1), once in the opening of the 21st chap, of 1
                    Chronicles (although here the allusion to a distinct personality may be held
                    doubtful), and in Zechariah (iii. 1). In all other places where the word occurs,
                    “Satan” is used in its common sense of “adversary,” a sense in which it also
                    occurs in the Gospels, in the well-known passage (Matt, xvi. 23) where our Lord
                    addresses St Peter, “Get thee behind me, Satan,” or “adversary.” The books of
                    Chronicles and Zechariah are indisputably amongst the latest writings of the Old
                    Testament; and, although the date of Job is unsettled, it may also be presumed
                    to belong to a late period in the history of revelation. In the earlier
                    prophetic literature of the Hebrews there is no recognition of any spirit of
                    evil at war with Jehovah. All power and dominion are, on the contrary, clearly
                    ascribed to Jehovah himself, who is supreme i∏ heaven, on earth, and under the
                    earth. The connection of Satan with the serpent in the garden of Eden in Genesis
                    (iii. 1-7) is an inference of later dogmatic opinion, arising probably out of
                    the use of the expression “Old Serpent” applied to Satan in Rev. (xx. 2), but
                    receives no countenance from the scriptural narrative itself, which speaks of
                    the serpent purely as an animal, and pronounces a curse against him with
                    reference to his animal nature solely. The idea of a distinct personality of
                    evil, therefore, is not to be found in the earlier Hebrew Scriptures, and is, in
                    fact, inconsistent with the cardinal ∙principle of the older Hebrew theology
                    that Jehovah was the sole source of all power, the author both of good and evil,
                    who hardened Pharaoh’s heart (Exod. x. 27), and sent a lying spirit among the
                    prophets of Ahab (I Kings xxii. 20-3). Even in the later Scriptures in which
                    “Satan” is spoken of as a distinct person, there is little or no analogy betwixt
                    what is said of such a person in these Scriptures and what is said of him in the
                    New Testament. The “Satan” of the book of Job is described as coming among the
                    “sons of God” to present himself before the Lord. He is the image of malice,
                    restlessness, and envy— the willing messenger of evil to Job; but he is not
                    represented as the impersonation of evil, or as a spiritual assailant of the
                    patriarch. He is really a delegated agent in the hands of Jehovah to execute His
                    will, and the evils with which he assails Job are outward evils. The picture is
                    quite different from that of the “Archangel ruined,” or the devil, or Satan, of
                    later theology.</p>
                <p>The question then arises as to the special source of the conception of the devil
                    as a fallen and evil spirit. The explanation commonly given of this conception
                    by our modern critical schools is that it sprang out of the intercourse of the
                    Jews with the Persians during their period of exile. In the Persian, or Iranian,
                    mythology it is well known that a personal power of evil was conspicuously
                    recognized. The Iranian religion divided the world betwixt two opposing
                    self-existent deities, the one good and the other evil, but both alike having a
                    share in creation and in man. Ormuzd, or Ahuramazda, was holy and true, and to
                    be honoured and worshipped. But Ahriman, or Anra-mainyu, the evil-minded, the
                    spirit of darkness, was no less powerful, and claimed an equal share of man’s
                    homage. These were the good and the evil in thought, word, and deed. Man has to
                    choose betwixt the two. He cannot serve both. With this dualistic system the
                    Jews came in contact during their captivity at Babylon, and are supposed to have
                    retained permanent traces of it in their subsequent theology. The conception of
                    the devil, and of a lower kingdom of demons, or devils, is the evident
                    illustration of this. The case is put in this way by a Christian writer of
                    moderation and knowledge :—“That the Hebrew prophets had reiterated their belief
                    in one God with the most profound conviction is not to be questioned; but as
                    little can it be doubted that, as a people, the Jews had exhibited little
                    impulse towards monotheism, and that from this time (the period of their
                    captivity) we discern a readiness to adopt the Zoroastrian demonology” (Cox’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Aryan Mythology,</hi> ii. 356). The conception of Satan in the
                    later canonical books of Chronicles and Zechariah is even attributed to this
                    source. “Thus far Satan had appeared, as in the book of Job, among the ministers
                    of God; but in later books we have a closer approximation to the Iranian creed.
                    In Zechariah and the first book of Chronicles, Satan assumes the character of
                    Ahriman, and appears as the author of evil. Still later he becomes the prince of
                    devils, the source of wicked thoughts, the enemy of the Word and Son of God” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.,</hi> p. 351).</p>
                <p>The process by which the Jewish mind worked out this conception and the whole
                    scheme of demonology found in the New Testament was of course gradual. The Book
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0152-0137"/> Wisdom, a product of Alexandriau-Jewish thought
                    in the 2d century before Christ, which speaks of the devil having “through envy
                    introduced evil into the world” (ii. 24), is supposed to represent a stage in
                    this development; and the apocryphal books of Enoch and Esdras (IV.), the former
                    of which is pre-Christian, indicate further .stages. Another stage is supposed
                    to be marked by the recognition of a “devil,” or evil spirit, under the name of
                    Asmodeus, in the book of Tobit (1Õ0 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> There is
                    certainly a remarkable analogy betwixt parts of the eschatological teaching of
                    the book of Enoch and other apocryphal books and that σf the gospels. But the
                    development of Jewish theology as a whole, in the ages immediately antecedent to
                    Christianity, is still involved in considerable obscurity; and it is difficult
                    to say how much of the. eschatology and demonology of the New Testament is to be
                    regarded as original, and how much as derived or inherited from prior modes of
                    thought.</p>
                <p>It must also be conceded that, even should we accept the modern critical theory
                    of the rise of the New Testament conception of the devil and of demons, there is
                    much in it that must be pronounced very different from the Zoroastrian or
                    Iranian conception. The devil of the gospels is in some respects very unlike the
                    Ahriman of Zoroastrianism. He is in no sense a twin-creator of man. He has no
                    original share in him, and no right to his homage. In the Persian system the
                    warfare of good or evil is a warfare of balanced forces. But the evil
                    personality of the New Testament, powerful as he is, and always the enemy of the
                    divine, is yet a subordinated and inferior being. He is the tempter of the Son
                    of God and the enemy of man. He has power on earth, and even a certain power
                    over the Son of man; and yet the Son can restrain and bid him get behind Him.
                    The subordinated forces of evil—the demons—are all subject to Christ. They hear
                    His word and obey it. In short, the devil of the New Testament is, in comparison
                    with the source of evil recognized by Zoroastrianism, a limited power. He is a
                    subordinate although insurrectionary spirit, working by spiritual means upon the
                    heart of man, and in no sense a native power having an original or creative hold
                    of him. This sets the evangelical conception on a higher level than the Persian,
                    and proves that the Jewish mind, supposing that it did borrow certain impulses
                    from the Iranian dualism with which it came in contact in the period of exile,
                    yet wrought out the conception in the depth of its own religious and moral
                    consciousness within the sphere of revealed truth which was its great
                    educational medium.</p>
                <p>The idea of an evil personality was therefore so far a native growth of the
                    Jewish mind, working upon hints contained, although not developed, in the
                    earlier Hebrew Scriptures. It is evident from various passages, both of the
                    Pentateuch (Lev. xvii. 17; Deut, xxxii. 17) and of the prophetic Scriptures and
                    the Psalms (Isa. xiii. 21, xxxiv. 14; Jer. xv. 36; Ps. cvi. 37), that the
                    Hebrews were cognizant of evil beings supposed to dwell in darkness and waste
                    places. The names applied to those beings in the passages referred to are
                    various, sometimes seirim—lit. goats (Lev. xvii. 7; Isa. xiii. 21), and
                    sometimes shedim (Deut, xxxii. 17), probably a name for demigods, both phrases
                    being translated “devils” in our authorized version of the Pentateuch. This
                    translation suggests later associations; but such expressions plainly denote a
                    belief in evil beings, the survival, probably, in the Hebrew consciousness of
                    fragments of an older native faith which deified the powers of evil as well as
                    of good. Some have traced a similar survival in the name Azazel, translated in
                    our version scape-goat (Levit, xvi. 8, 10, 26), and which has been supposed to
                    represent an evil being haunting the desert, to which was devoted the goat sent
                    away on the great day of atonement. This opinion is disputed by others on
                    grounds both philological and theological. But it may be almost certainly
                    assumed that, with all the jealous monotheism of the Jews, there was an
                    undergrowth of darker conceptions, pointing to evil existences opposed to the
                    divine, and that to some extent the later idea of the devil sprang out of this
                    natural growth in the Hebrew mind of an evil side to nature and to life. This
                    process of growth may have been greatly aided by contact with the Persian
                    dualism, and especially the idea of a kingdom and hierarchy of evil powers seems
                    to have been indebted to this source. But it was also largely original, and at
                    the end, as at the beginning, the Jewish and Christian conceptions of the devil
                    and his angels were very distinct from those of the Persian faith. They belong
                    to a higher level of thought, and are the product of a more advanced stage of
                    moral and spiritual feeling.</p>
                <p>The idea of the devil so clearly expressed in the New Testament passed as a
                    dominant factor into the early Christian theology, acquiring for many centuries
                    an always deeper hold on the popular religious imagination. In the writings of
                    the fathers of the 2d and 3d centuries the devil plays an important part. The
                    whole of the Roman imperial system, and all that opposed the progress of the
                    gospel, was identified with his kingdom. Satan was the “prince of this world,”
                    he was the rival and caricature of the divine. “Satan,” said Tertullian, “is
                    God’s ape;” and the saying passed into a proverb. He fell by pride and arrogance
                    and envy of the divine creation (Iren., <hi rend="italic">Adv. Haer.,</hi> iv.
                    40). He was, according to Cyprian <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Unitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclſt,</hi> the author of all heresies and
                    delusions; he held man by reason of his sin in rightful possession, and man
                    could only be rescued from his power by the ransom of Christ’s blood. This
                    extraordinary idea of a payment or satisfaction to the devil being made by
                    Christ as the price of man’s salvation is found both in Irenaeus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Adv. Haer.,</hi> v. 1. 1.) and in Origen, and may be said to have
                    held its sway in the church for nearly a thousand years. And yet Origen is
                    credited with the opinion that, bad as the devil was, he was not altogether
                    beyond hope of pardon. In this as in other respects the early Alexandrian school
                    showed a milder and broader type of thought than the prevailing theology of the
                    church. Occasionally in later times the milder opinion was expressed, as by
                    Gregory of Nyssa in the 4th century; but gradually it vanished, and the devil
                    was drawn by the theological pencil in darker and more terrible colours.
                    Augustine greatly helped to strengthen and confirm the darker view, and to give
                    in this as in other things a gloomier tinge to religious thought. During the
                    Middle Ages the belief in the devil was absorbing—saints conceived themselves
                    and others to be in constant conflict with him. It is hardly possible for us
                    now, as M. Reville says in his short treatise on the subject, “to imagine to
                    what a degree this belief controlled men’s whole lives. It was the one fixed
                    idea with every one, particularly from the 13th to the 15th century—the period
                    at which we may consider this superstition to have reached its climax.” The
                    superstition showed certainly but slight signs of yielding in the 15th, or even
                    in the 16th or 17th centuries. Luther lived in a constant consciousness of
                    contact and opposition with the evil one. At his study, in bed, or in his cell,
                    the devil was incessantly interfering with his work or rest. As he was going to
                    begin his studies he heard a noise which he immediately interpreted as
                    proceeding from his enemy. “As I found he was about to begin again, I gathered
                    together my books and got into bed. Another time in the night I heard him above
                    my cell walking in the cloister; but as I knew it was the devil I paid no
                    attention to him and went to sleep.” Again he says: “Early this morning, when I
                    awoke the fiend came and began disputing with <pb break="no"

                    replied, ‘ Canst thou not tell me something new, Satan? ’”</p>
                <p>This realism of belief in an evil power near to man, and constantly assailing
                    him, continued more or less all through the 17th century, and was especially
                    strong, as Mr Buckle has shown in his well-known volumes, in Scotland. He has
                    somewhat overcharged his picture; but he presents at the same time indisputable
                    facts which leave no doubt that the clergy and people alike imagined that “the
                    devil was always and literally at hand—that he was haunting them, speaking to
                    them, and tempting them. Go where they would he was there.” With the rise of a
                    rationalistic temper throughout Europe, in the 18th century, this belief in the
                    pervading influence of diabolic agency began to disappear. The sense of the
                    supernatural decayed in all directions, and especially the old belief in the
                    arbitrary control exercised by an evil power over human destiny. And while the
                    religious impulse has gained greatly since then, and shown renewed vigour both
                    in an evangelical and catholic direction, it cannot be said that the earlier
                    faith in the operations of a personal devil has acquired reascendency. It may be
                    still the prevailing opinion of Christendom that there is an evil power working
                    in the world opposed to the divine; but whether this power is personal, or how
                    far it touches the human will, or again, whether there is a subterranean kingdom
                    of demons with a prince of demons or devil at their head, and how far such a
                    kingdom has arty relation to human destiny, are all questions that must be held
                    to be very unsettled, or maintained with very doubtful confidence in any section
                    of the Christian church. It is our business simply to note such a change in the
                    attitude of Christian belief, and not to express any opinion as to its advantage
                    or otherwise. It is too much to speak with Μ. Reville of Satan as a “fallen
                    majesty;” but the idea of the devil certainly no longer bulks in Christian

                    was over human life and experience. (j. τ.)</p>
