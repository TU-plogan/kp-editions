                    when placed in contact with each other do not mix at all, but the surface of
                    separation remains distinct, and exhibits the phenomena described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Capillary Action.</hi> Other pairs of liquids, such as
                    chloroform and water, mix, but only in certain proportions. The chloroform takes
                    up a little water, and the water a little chloroform; but the two mixed liquids
                    will not mix with each other, but remain in contact separated by a surface
                    showing capillary phenomena. The two liquids are then in a state of equilibrium
                    with each other. The conditions of the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances
                    have been investigated by Professor J. Willard Gibbs in a series of papers
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of
                    Arts and Sciences,</hi> vol. iii. part i. p. 108. Other pairs of liquids, and

                <p>When two fluida are capable of being mixed, they cannot remain in equilibrium
                    with each other; if they are placed in contact with each other the process of
                    mixture begins of itself, and goes on till the state of equilibrium is attained,
                    which, in the case of fluids which mix in all proportions, is a state of uniform
                    mixture.</p>
                <p>This process of mixture is called diffusion. It may be easily observed by taking
                    a glass jar half full of water and pouring a strong solution of a coloured salt,
                    such as sulphate of copper, through a long-stemmed funnel, so as to occupy the
                    lower part of the jar. If the jar is not disturbed we may trace the process of
                    diffusion for weeks, months, or years, by the gradual rise of the colour into
                    the upper part of the jar, and the weakening of the colour in the lower
                    part.</p>
                <p>This, however, is not a method capable of giving accurate measurements of the
                    composition of the liquid at different depths in the vessel. For more exact
                    determinations we may draw off a portion from a given stratum of the mixed
                    liquid, and determine its composition either by chemical methods or by its
                    specific gravity, or any other property from which its composition may be
                    deduced.</p>
                <p>But as the act of removing a portion of the fluid interferes with the process of
                    diffusion, it is desirable to be able to ascertain the composition of any
                    stratum of the mixture without removing it from the vessel. For this purpose Sir
                    W. Thomson places in the jar a number of glass beads of different densities,
                    which indicate the densities of the strata in which they are observed to float.
                    The principal objection to this method is, that if the liquids contain air or
                    any other gas, bubbles are apt to form on the glass beads, so as to make them
                    float in a stratum of less density than that marked on them.</p>
                <p>Μ. Voit has observed the diffusion of cane sugar in water by passing a ray of
                    plane,-polarized light horizontally through the vessel, and determining the
                    angle through which the plane of polarization is turned by the solution of
                    sugar. This method is of course applicable only to those substances which cause
                    rotation of the plane of polarized light.</p>
                <p>Another method is to place the diffusing liquids in a hollow glass prism, with
                    its refracting edge vertical, and to determine the deviation of a ray of light
                    passing through the prism at different depths. The ray is bent downwards on
                    account of the variable density of the mixture, as well as towards the thicker
                    part of the prism; but by making it pass as near the edge of the prism as
                    possible, the vertical component of the refraction may be made very small; and
                    by placing the prism within a vessel of water having parallel sides of glass, we
                    can get rid of the constant part of the deviation, and are able to use a prism
                    of large angle, so as to increase the part due to the diffusing substance. At
                    the same time we can more easily control and register the temperature.</p>
                <p>The laws of diffusion were first investigated by Graham. The diffusion of gases
                    has recently been observed with great accuracy by Loschmidt, and that of liquids
                    by Fick and by Voit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diffusion as a molecular motion.—</hi> If we observe the
                    process of diffusion with our most powerful microscopes, we cannot follow the
                    motion of any individual portions of the fluids. We cannot point out one place
                    in which the lower fluid is ascending, and another in which the upper fluid is
                    descending. There are no currents visible to us, and the motion of the material
                    substances goes on as imperceptibly as the conduction of heat or of electricity.
                    Hence the motion which constitutes diffusion must be distinguished from those
                    motions of fluids which we can trace by means of floating motes. It may be
                    described as a motion of the fluids, not <hi rend="italic">in mass,</hi> but by
                    <hi rend="italic">molecules.</hi></p>
                <p>When we reason upon the hypothesis that a fluid is a continuous homogeneous
                    substance, it is comparatively easy to define its density and velocity; but when
                    we admit that it may consist of molecules of different kinds, we must revise our
                    definitions. We therefore define these quantities by considering that part of
                    the medium which at a given instant is within a certain small region surrounding
                    a given point. This region must be so small that the properties of the medium as
                    a whole are sensibly the same throughout the region, and yet it must be so large
                    as to include a large number of molecules. We then define the density of the
                    medium at the given point as the mass of the medium within this region divided
                    by its volume, and the velocity of the medium as the momentum of this portion of
                    the medium divided by its mass.</p>
                <p>If we consider the motion of the medium relative to an imaginary surface supposed
                    to exist within the region occupied by the medium, and if we define the flow of
                    the medium through the surface as the mass of the medium which in unit of time
                    passes through unit of area of the surface, then it follows from the above
                    definitions that the velocity of the medium resolved in the direction of the
                    normal to the surface is equal to the flow divided by the density. If we suppose
                    the surface itsélf to move with the same velocity as the fluid, and in the same
                    direction, there will be no flow through it.</p>
                <p>Having thus defined the density, velocity, and flow of the medium as a whole, or,
                    as it is sometimes expressed, “in mass,” we may now consider one of the fluids
                    which constitute the medium, and define its density, velocity, and flow in the
                    same way. The velocity of this fluid may be different from that of the medium in
                    mass, and its velocity relative to that of the medium is the velocity of
                    diffusion which we have to study.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diffusion of Gases according to the Kinetic Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>So many of the phenomena of gases are found to be explained in a consistent
                    manner by the kinetic theory of gases, that we may describe with considerable
                    probability of correctness the kind of motion which constitutes diffusion in
                    gases. We shall therefore consider gaseous diffusion in the light of the kinetic
                    theory before we consider diffusion in liquids.</p>
                <p>A gas, according to the kinetic theory, is a collection of particles or molecules
                    which are in rapid motion, and which, when they encounter each other, behave
                    pretty much as elastic bodies, such as billiard balls, would do if no energy
                    were lost in their collisions. Each molecule travels but a very small distance
                    between one encounter and another, so that it is every now and then altering its
                    velocity both in direction and magnitude, and that in an exceedingly irregular
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The result is that the velocity of any molecule may be considered as compounded
                    of two velocities, one of which, called the velocity of the medium, is the same
                    for all the molecules, while the other, called the velocity of agitation, is
                    irregular bath in magnitude and in direction, though the average magnitude of
                    the velocity may be calculated, and any one direction is just as likely as any
                    other.</p>
                <p>The result of this motion is, that if in any part of the medium the molecules are
                    more numerous than in a neighbouring region, more molecules will pass from the
                    first region to the second than in the reverse direction, and for this reason
                    the density of the gas will tend to become equal in all parts of the vessel
                    containing it, except in so far as the molecules may be crowded towards one
                    direction by the action of an external force such as gravity. Since the motion
                    of the molecules is very swift, the process of equalization of density in a gas
                    is a very <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0233-0216"/> rapid one, its velocity of propagation through
                    the gas being that of sound.</p>
                <p>Let us now consider two gases in the same vessel, the proportion of the gases
                    being different in different parts of the vessel, but the pressure being
                    everywhere the same. The agitation of the molcules will still cause more
                    molecules of the first gas to pass from places where that gas is dense to places
                    where it is rare than in the opposite direction, but since the second gas is
                    dense where the first one is rare, its molecules will be for the most part
                    travelling in the opposite direction. Hence the molecules of the two gases will
                    encounter each other, and every encounter will act as a check to the process of
                    equalization of the density of each gas throughout the mixture.</p>
                <p>The interdiffusion of two gases in a vessel is therefore a much slower process
                    than that by which the density of a singfe gas becomes equalized, though it
                    appears from the theory that the final result is the same, and that each gas is
                    distributed through the vessel in precisely the same way as if no other gas had
                    been present, and this even when we take into account the effect of gravity.</p>
                <p>If we apply the ordinary language about fluids to a single gas of the mixture, we
                    may distinguish the forces which act on an element of volume as follows :—</p>
                <p>1st. Any external force, such as gravity or electricity.</p>
                <p>2d. The difference of the pressure <hi rend="italic">of the particular gas</hi>
                    on opposite sides of the element of volume. [The pressure due to other gases is
                    to be considered of no account].</p>
                <p>3d. The resistance arising from the percolation of the gas through the other
                    gases which are moving with different velocity.</p>
                <p>The resistance due to encounters with the molecules of any other gas is
                    proportional to the velocity of the first gas relative to the second, to the
                    product of their densities, and to a coefficient which depends on the nature of
                    the gases and on the temperature. The equations of motion of one gas of a
                    mixture are therefore of the form</p>

                    ordinary form of the equations of equilibrium of a single fluid. Hence, when the
                    process of diffusion is complete, the density of each gas at any point of the
                    vessel is the same as if no other gas were present.</p>
                <p>If V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is the potential of the force which acts on the

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is constant, as it is when the temperature is uniform,
                    then the equation of equilibrium becomes</p>
                <p>* <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛+%⅛=0, <hi rend="italic">dx dx</hi> the solution
                    of which is</p>
                <p>Pι=A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> β <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> *ι *.</p>
                <p>Hence if, as in the case of gravity, V is the same for all gases, but <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> is different for different gases, the composition of the
                    mixture will be different in different parts of the vessel, the proportion of
                    the heavier gases, for which <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is smaller, being greater
                    at the bottom of the vessel than at the top. It would be difficult, however, to
                    obtain experimental evidence of this difference of composition except in a
                    vessel more than 100 metres high, and it would be necessary to keep the vessel
                    free from inequalities of temperature for more than a year, in order to allow
                    the process of diffusion to advance to a state even half-way towards that of
                    ultimate equilibrium. The experiment might, however, be made in a few minutes by
                    placing atube, say 10 centimetres long, on a whirling apparatus, so that one end
                    shall be close to the axis, while the other is moving at the rate, say, of 50
                    metres per second. Thus if equal volumes of hydrogen and carbonic acid were
                    used, the proportion of hydrogen to carbonic acid would be about <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> greater at the end of
                    the tube nearest the axis. The experimental verification of the result is
                    important, as it establishes a method of effecting the partial separation of
                    gases without the selective action of chemical agents.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Diffusion in Liquids.</hi></p>
                <p>The nature of the motion of the molecules in liquids is less understood than in
                    gases, but it is easy to see that if there is any irregular displacement among
                    the molecules in a mixed liquid, it must, on the whole, tend to cause each
                    component to pass from places where it forms a large proportion of the mixture
                    to places where it is less abundant. It is also manifest that any relative
                    motion of two constituents of the mixture will be opposed by a resistance
                    arising from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n234/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0234-0217"/> the encounters between the molecules of these
                    components. The value of this resistance, however, depends, in liquids, on more
                    complicated conditions than in gases, and for the present we must regard it as a
                    function of all the physical properties of the mixture at the given place, that
                    is to say, its temperature and pressure, and the proportions of the different
                    components of the mixture.</p>
                <p>The coefficient of interdiffusion of two liquids must therefore be considered as
                    depending on all the physical properties of the mixture according to laws which
                    can be ascertained only by experiment.</p>
                <p>Thus Fick has determined the coefficient of diffusion for common salt in water to
                    be 0O000116, and Voit has found that of cane-sugar to be 0O0000365.</p>
                <p>It appears from these numbers that in a vessel of the same size the process of
                    diffusion of liquids requires a greater number of days to reach a given stage
                    than the process of diffusion of gases in the same vessel requires seconds.</p>
                <p>When we wish to mix two liquids, it is not sufficient to place them in the same
                    vessel, for if the vessel is, say, a metre in depth, the lighter liquid will lie
                    above the denser, and it will be many years before the mixture becomes even
                    sensibly uniform. We therefore stir the two liquids together, that is to say, we
                    move a solid body through the vessel, first one way, then another, so as to make
                    the liquid contents eddy about in as complicated a manner as possible. The
                    effect of this is that the two liquids, which originally formed two thick
                    horizontal layers, one above the other, are now disposed in thin and excessively
                    convoluted strata, which, if they could be spread out, would cover an im mense
                    area. The effect of the stirring is thus to increase the area over which the
                    process of diffusion can go on, and to diminish the distance between the
                    diffusing liquids; and since the time required for diffusion varies as the
                    square of the thickness of the layers, it is evident that by a moderate amount
                    of stirring the process of mixture which would otherwise require years may be
                    completed in a few seconds. That the process is not instantaneous is easily
                    ascertained by observing that for some time after the stirring the mixture
                    appears full of streaks, which cause it to lose its transparency. This arises
                    from the different indices of refraction of different portions of the mixture
                    which have been brought near each other by stirring. The surfaces of separation
                    are so drawn out and convoluted, that the whole mass has a woolly appearance,
                    for no ray of light can pass through it without being turned many times out of
                    its path.</p>
                <p>Graham observed that the diffusion both of liquids and gases takes place through
                    porous solid bodies, such as plugs of plaster of Paris or plates of pressed
                    plumbago, at a rate not very much less than when no such body is interposed, and
                    this even when the solid partition is amply sufficient to check all ordinary
                    currents, and even to sustain a considerable difference of pressure on its
                    opposite sides.</p>
                <p>But there is another class of cases in which a liquid or a gas can pass through a
                    diaphragm, which is not, in the ordinary sense, porous. For instance, when
                    carbonic acid gas is confined in a soap bubble it rapidly escapes. The gas is
                    absorbed at the inner surface of the bubble, and forms a solution of carbonic
                    acid in water. This solution diffuses from the inner surface of the bubble,
                    where it is strongest, to the outer surface, where it is in contact with air,
                    and the carbonic acid evaporates and diffuses out into the atmosphere. It is
                    also found that hydrogen and other gases can pass through a layer of caoutchouc.
                    Graham showed that it is not through pores, in the ordinary sense, that the
                    motion takes place, for the ratios are determined by the chemical relations
                    between the gases and the caoutchouc, or the liquid film.</p>
                <p>According to Graham’s theory, the caoutchouc is a colloid substance,—that is, one
                    which is capable of combining, in a temporary and very loose manner, with
                    indeterminate proportions of certain other substances, just as glue will form a
                    jelly with various proportions of water. Another class of substances, which
                    Graham called crystalloid, are distinguished from these by being always of
                    definite composition, and not admitting of these temporary associations. When a
                    colloid body has in different parts of its mass different proportions of water,
                    alcohol, or solutions of crystalloid bodies, diffusion takes place through the
                    colloid body, though no part of it can be shown to be in the liquid state.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, a solution of a colloid substance is almost incapable of
                    diffusion through a porous solid, or another colloid body. Thus, if a solution
                    of gum and salt in water is placed in contact with a solid jelly of gelatine and
                    alcohol, alcohol will be diffused into the gum, and salt and water will be
                    diffused into the gelatine, but the gum and the gelatine will not diffuse into
                    each other.</p>
                <p>There are certain metals whose relations to certain gases Graham explained by
                    this theory. For instance, hydrogen can be made to pass through iron and
                    palladium at a high temperature, and carbonic oxide can be made to pass through
                    iron. The gases form colloidal unions with the metals, and are diffused through
                    them as water is diffused through a jelly. Root has lately found that hydrogen
                    can pass through platinum, even at ordinary temperatures.</p>
                <p>By taking advantage of the different velocities with which different liquids and
                    gases pass through parchment-paper and other solid bodies, Graham was enabled to
                    effect many remarkable analyses. He called this method the method of
                    Dialysis.</p>

                    Absorption.</hi></p>
                <p>The rate of evaporation of liquids is determined principally by the rate of
                    diffusion of the vapour through the air or other gas which lies above the
                    liquid. Indeed, the coefficient of diffusion of the vapour of a liquid through
                    a,ir can be determined in a rough but easy manner by placing a little of the
                    liquid in a test tube, and observing the rate at which its weight diminishes by
                    evaporation day by day. For at the surface of the liquid the density of the
                    vapour is that corresponding to the temperature, whereas at the mouth of the

                    through each other, although we cannot observe this kind of diffusion, because
                    we cannot distinguish the molecules of one portion from those of the other when
                    they are once mixed. If, however, the molecules of one portion have any property
                    whereby they can be distinguished from those of the other, then that property
                    will be communicated from one part of the medium to an adjoining part, and that
                    either By convection—that is by the molecules themselves passing out of one part
                    into the other, carrying the property with them— or by transmission—that is by
                    the property being communicated from one molecule to another during their
                    encounters. The chemical properties by which different substances are recognized
                    are inseparable from their molecules, so that the diffusion of such properties
                    can take place only by the transference of the molecules themselves, but the
                    momentum of a molecule in any given direction and its energy are also properties
                    which may be different in different molecules, but which may be communicated
                    from one molecule to another. Hence the diffusion of momentum and that of energy
                    through the medium can take place in two different ways, whereas the diffusion
                    of matter can take place only in one of these ways.</p>
                <p>In gases the great majority of the particles, at any instant, are describing free
                    paths, and it is therefore possible to show that there is a simple numerical
                    relation between the coefficients of the three kinds of diffusion,—the diffusion
                    of matter, the lateral diffusion of velocity (which is the phenomenon known as
                    the internal friction or viscosity of fluids), and the diffusion of energy
                    (which is called the conduction of heat). But in liquids the majority of the
                    molecules are engaged at close quarters with one or more other molecules, so
                    that the transmission of momentum and of energy takes place in a far greater
                    degree by communication from one molecule to another, than by convection by the
                    molecules themselves. Hence the ratios of the coefficient of diffusion to those
                    of viscosity and thermal conductivity are much smaller in liquids than in
                    gases.</p>

                <p>The temperature indicated by the wet bulb thermometer is determined in great part
                    by the relation between the coefficients of diffusion and thermal conductivity.
                    As the water evaporates from the wet bulb heat must be supplied to it by
                    convection, conduction, or radiation. This supply of heat will not be sufficient
                    to maintain the temperature constant till the temperature of the wet bulb has
                    sunk so far below that of the surrounding air and other bodies that the flow of
                    heat due to the difference of temperature is equal to the latent heat of the
                    vapour which leaves the bulb.</p>

                    formula by which the dew-point is commonly deduced from the readings of the wet

                <p>Dr Apjohn assumes that, when the temperature of the wet bulb is stationary, the
                    heat required to convert the water into vapour is given out by portions of the
                    surrounding air in cooling from the temperature of the atmosphere to that of the
                    wet bulb, and that the air thus cooled becomes saturated with the vapour which
                    it receives from the bulb.</p>

                    tables of the pressure of aqueous vapour, enables us to find the dew-point from
                    observations of the wet and dry bulb thermometers.</p>
                <p>We may call this the convection theory of the wet bulb, because we consider the
                    temperature and humidity of a portion of air brought from a distance to be
                    affected directly by the wet bulb without communication either of heat or of
                    vapour with other portions of air.</p>
                <p>Dr Everett has pointed out as a defect in this theory, that it does not explain
                    how the air can either sink in temperature or increase in humidity unless it
                    comes into absolute contact with the wet bulb. Let us, therefore, consider what

                    the effects of radiation.</p>

                    the first part to the second. By comparing actual observations of the dew-point
                    with Apjohn’s formula, it has been found that the factor should be somewhat
                    greater than unity. According to our theory it ought to be greater if the bulb
                    is larger, and smaller if there is much wind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relation, between Diffusion and Electrolytic
                    Conduction.</hi></p>
                <p>Electrolysis (see separate article) is a molecular movement of the constituents
                    of a compound liquid in which, under the action of electromotive force, one of
                    the components travels in the positive and the other in the negative direction,
                    the flow of each component, when reckoned in electrochemical equivalents, being
                    in all cases numerically equal to the flow of electricity.</p>
                <p>Electrolysis resembles diffusion in being a molecular movement of two currents in
                    opposite directions through the same liquid; but since the liquid is of the same
                    composition throughout, we cannot ascribe the currents to the molecular
                    agitation of a medium whose composition varies from one part to another as in
                    ordinary diffusion, but we must ascribe it to the action of the electromotive
                    force on particles having definite charges of electricity.</p>
                <p>The force, therefore, urging an electro-chemical equivalent of either component,
                    or <hi rend="italic">ion,</hi> as it is called, in a given direction is
                    numerically equal to the electromotive force at a given point of the
                    electrolyte, and is therefore comparable with any ordinary force. The resistance
                    which prevents the current from rising above a certain value is that arising
                    from the encounters of the molecules of the ion with other molecules as they
                    struggle forward through the liquid, and this depends on their relative
                    velocity, and also on the nature of the ion, and of the liquid through which it
                    has to flow.</p>
                <p>The average velocity of the ions will therefore increase, till the resistance
                    they meet with is equal to the force which urges them forward, and they will
                    thus acquire a definite velocity proportional to the electric force at the
                    point, but depending also on the nature of the liquid.</p>
                <p>If the resistance of the liquid to the passage of the ion is the same for
                    different strengths of solution, the velocity of the ion will be the same for
                    different strengths, but the quantity of it, and therefore the quantity of
                    electricity which passes in a given time, will be proportional to the strength
                    of the solution.</p>
                <p>Now, Kohlrausch has determined the conductivity of the solutions of many
                    electrolytes in water, and he finds that for very weak solutions the
                    conductivity is proportional to the strength. When the solution is strong the
                    liquid through which the ions struggle can no longer be considered sensibly the
                    same as pure water, and consequently this proportionality does not hold good for
                    strong solutions.</p>
                <p>Kohlrausch has determined the actual velocity in centimetres per second of
                    various ions in weak solutions under an electro-motive force of unit value. From
                    these velocities he has calculated the conductivities of weak solutions of
                    electrolytes different from those of which he made use in calculating the
                    velocity of the ions, and he finds the results consistent with direct
                    experiments on those electrolytes.</p>
                <p>It is manifest that we have here important information as to the resistance which
                    the ion meets with in travelling through the liquid. It is not easy, however, to
                    make a numerical comparison between this resistance and any results of ordinary
                    diffusion, for, in the first place, we cannot make experiments on the diffusion
                    of ions. Many electrolytes, indeed, are decomposed by the current into
                    components, one or both of which are capable of diffusion, but these components,
                    when once separated out of the electrolyte, are no longer ions—they are no
                    longer acted on by electric force, or charged with definite quantities of
                    electricity. Some of them, as the metals, are insoluble, and therefore incapable
                    of diffusion; others, like the gases, though soluble in the liquid electrolyte,
                    are not, when in solution, acted on by the current.</p>
                <p>Besides this, if we accept the theory of electrolysis proposed by Clausius, the
                    molecules acted on by the electromotive force are not the whole of the molecules
                    which form the constituents of the electrolyte, but only those which at a given
                    instant are iu a state of dissociation from molecules of the other kind, being
                    forced away from them temporarily by the violence of the molecular agitation. If
                    these dissociated molecules form a small proportion of the whole, the velocity
                    of their passage through the medium must be much greater than the mean velocity
                    of the whole, which is the quantity calculated by Kohlrausch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On Processes by which the Mixture and Separation of Fluids can
                    be effected in a Reversible Manner.</hi></p>
                <p>A physical process is said to be reversible when the material system can be made
                    to return from the final state to the original state under conditions which at
                    every stage of the reverse process differ only infinitesimally from the
                    conditions at the corresponding stage of the direct process.</p>
                <p>All other processes are called irreversible.</p>
                <p>Thus the passage of heat from one body to another is a reversible process if the
                    temperature of the first body exceeds that of the second only by an
                    infinitesimal quantity, because by changing the temperature of either of the the
                    bodies by an infinitesimal quantity, the heat may be made to flow back again
                    from the second body to first.</p>
                <p>But if the temperature of the first body is higher than that of the second by a
                    finite quantity, the passage of heat from the first body to the second is not a
                    reversible process, for the temperature of one or both of the bodies must be
                    altered by a finite quantity before the heat can be made to flow back again.</p>
                <p>In like manner the interdiffusion of two gases is in general an irreversible
                    process, for in order to separate the two gases the conditions must be very
                    considerably changed. For. instance, if carbonic acid is one of the gases, we
                    can separate it from the other by means of quicklime; but the absorption of
                    carbonic acid by quicklime at ordinary temperatures and pressures is an
                    irreversible process, for in order to separate the carbonic acid from the lime
                    it must be raised to a high temperature.</p>
                <p>In all reversible processes the substances which are in contact must be in
                    complete equilibrium throughout the process; and Professor Gibbs has shown the
                    condition of equilibrium to be that not only the temperature and the pressure of
                    the two substances must be the same, but also that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >potential</hi> of each of the component substances must be the same in both
                    compounds, and that there is an additional condition which we need not here
                    specify.</p>
                <p>Now, we may obtain complete equilibrium between quicklime and the mixture
                    containing carbonic acid if we raise the whole to a temperature at which the
                    pressure of dissociation of the carbonic acid in carbonate of lime is equal to
                    the pressure of the carbonic acid in the mixed gases. By altering the
                    temperature or the pressure very slowly we may cause carbonic acid to pass from
                    the mixture<pb break="no"

                    such a manner that the conditions of the system differ only by infinitesimal
                    quantities at the corresponding stages of the direct and the inverse processes.
                    The same thing may be done at lower temperatures by means of potash or soda.</p>
                <p>If one of the gases can be condensed into a liquid, and if during the
                    condensation the pressure is increased or the temperature diminished so slowly
                    that the liquid and the mixed gases are always very nearly in equilibrium, the
                    separation and mixture of the gases can be effected in a reversible manner.</p>
                <p>The same thing can be done by means of a liquid which absorbs the gases in
                    different proportions, provided that we can maintain such conditions as to
                    temperature and pressure as shall keep the system in equilibrium during the
                    whole process.</p>
                <p>If the densities of the two gases are different, we can effect their partial
                    separation by a reversible process which does not involve any of the actions
                    commonly called chemical. We place the mixed gases in a very long horizontal
                    tube, and we raise one end of the tube till the tube is vertical. If this is
                    done so slowly that at every stage of the process the distribution of the two
                    gases is sensibly the same as it would be at the same stage of the reverse
                    process, the process will be reversible, and if the tube is long enough the
                    separation of the gases may be carried to any extent.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> for 1876, Lord Rayleigh has
                    investigated the thermodynamics of diffusion, and has shown that if two portions
                    of different gases are given at the same pressure and temperature, it is
                    possible, by mixing them by a reversible process to obtain a certain quantity of
                    work. ’ At the end of the process the two gases are uniformly mixed, and occupy
                    a volume equal to the sum of the volumes they occupied when separate, but the
                    temperature and pressure of the mixture is lower than before.</p>
                <p>The work which can be gained during the mixture is equal to that which would be
                    gained by allowing first one gas and then the other to expand from its original
                    volume to the sum of the volumes; and the fall of temperature and pressure is
                    equal to that which would be produced in the mixture by taking away a quantity
                    of heat equivalent to this work.</p>
                <p>If the diffusion takes place by an irreversible process, such as goes on when the
                    gases are placed together in a vessel, no external work is done, and there is no
                    fall of temperature or of pressure during the process.</p>
                <p>We may arrive at this result by a method which, if not so instructive as that of
                    Lord Rayleigh, is more general, by the use of the physical quantity called by
                    Clausius the Entropy of the system.</p>
                <p>The entropy of a body in equilibrium is a quantity such that it remains constant
                    if no heat enters or leaves the body, and such that in general the quantity of
                    heat which enters the body is <hi rend="italic">fodφ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is the entropy, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> the absolute temperature.</p>
                <p>The entropy of a material system is the sum of the entropy of its parts.</p>
                <p>In reversible processes the entropy of the system remains unchanged, but in all
                    irreversible processes the entropy of the system increases.</p>
                <p>The increase of entropy involves a diminution of the available energy of the
                    system, that is to say, the total quantity of work which can be obtained from
                    the system. This is expressed by Sir W. Thomson by saying that a certain amount
                    of energy is <hi rend="italic">dissipated.</hi></p>
                <p>The quantity of energy which is dissipated in a given process is equal to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> 0(≠2~ <hi rend="italic">Φι) ∙</hi> where φ <hi

                    of the system in its ultimate state, when no more work can be got out of it.</p>
                <p>When we can determine the ultimate temperature we can calculate the amount of
                    energy dissipated by any process; but it is sometimes difficult to do this,
                    whereas the increase of entropy is determined by the known states of the system
                    at the beginning and end of the process.</p>

                    one of the portions.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that we have in a vessel two separate portions of gas of equal
                    volume, and at the same pressure and temperature, with a movable partition
                    between them. If we remove the partition the agitation of the molecules will
                    carry them from one side of the partition to the other in an irregular manner,
                    till ultimately the two portions of gas will be thoroughly and uniformly mixed
                    together. This motion of the molecules will take place whether the two gases are
                    the same or different, that is to say, whether we can distinguish between the
                    properties of the two gases or not.</p>
                <p>If the two gases are such that we can separate them by a reversible process,
                    then, as we have just shown, we might gain a definite amount of work by allowing
                    them to mix under certain conditions; and if we allow them to mix by ordinary
                    diffusion, this amount of work is no longer available, but is dissipated for
                    ever. If, on the other hand, the two portions of gas are the same, then no work
                    can be gained by mixing them, and no work is dissipated by allowing them to
                    diffuse into each other.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that the process of diffusion does not involve dissipation
                    of energy if the two gases are the same, but that it does if they can be
                    separated from each other by a reversible process.</p>
                <p>Now, when we say that two gases are the same, we mean that we cannot distinguish
                    the one from the other by any known reaction. It is not probable, but it is
                    possible, that two gases derived from different sources, but hitherto supposed
                    to be the same, may hereafter be found to be different, and that a method may be
                    discovered of separating them by a reversible process. If this should happen,
                    the process of interdiffusion which we had formerly supposed not to be an
                    instance of dissipation of energy would now be recognized as such an
                    instance.</p>
                <p>It follows from this that the idea of dissipation of energy depends on the extent
                    of our knowledge. Available energy is energy which we can direct into any
                    desired channel. Dissipated energy is energy which we cannot lay hold of and
                    direct at pleasure, such as the energy of the confused agitation of molecules
                    which we call heat. Now, confusion, like the correlative term order, is not a
                    property of material things in themselves, but only in relation to the mind
                    which perceives them. A memorandum-book does not, provided it is neatly written,
                    appear confused to an illiterate person, or to the owner who understands it
                    thoroughly, but to any other person able to read it appears to be inextricably
                    confused. Similarly the notion of dissipated energy could not occur to a being
                    who could not turn any of the energies of nature to his own account, or to one
                    who could trace the motion of every molecule and seize it at the right moment.
                    It is only to a being in the intermediate stage, who can lay hold of some forms
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n238/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0238-0221"/> energy while others elude his grasp, that energy
                    appears to be passing inevitably from the available to the dissipated state. (J.
