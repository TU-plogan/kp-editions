                <p><label type="entry">DREAM</label>. Dreams are a variety of a large class of
                    mental phenomena which may be roughly defined as states of mind which, though
                    not the result of the action of external objects, resume the form of objective
                    perceptions. To this class belong the fleeting images which occasionally present
                    themselves during waking hours, and especially before sleep, the “visions” which
                    occur in certain exalted emotional conditions, as in religious ecstasy, the
                    hallucinations of the insane, the mental phenomena observable in certain
                    artificially produced states (hypnotism), &amp;c. These and other mental
                    conditions resemble one another in many important respects, to be spoken of by
                    and by. At the same time they are roughly marked off by certain special
                    circumstances. Thus, dreaming may be distinguished from the other species of the
                    class as depending on the most complete withdrawal of the mind from the external
                    world. All products of the imagination which take the aspect of objective
                    perceptions must, it is clear, involve a partial aberration of the intellectual
                    processes. Yet in all cases except that of dreaming—including even somnambulism—
                    the mind preserves certain limited relations to external objects. In dreams, on
                    the contrary, the exclusion of the external world from consciousness is for the
                    most part complete. Sleep has under normal circumstances the effect both of
                    closing the avenues (sensory nerves) by which external impressions are conveyed
                    to consciousness, and of cutting off from the mind that mechanism (the
                    voluntarymotor nerves and muscles) through which it maintains and regulates its
                    varying relations to the outer world. Dreams cover a great variety of mental
                    states, from fleeting momentary fancies to extended series of imaginations.
                    Again, dreams have certain constant or approximately constant features, while in
                    other respects they manifest wide diversity. Among the most general
                    characteristics is to be named the apparent objectivity of dream-experience. The
                    presence of this objective element in dreams is clearly indicated in their
                    familiar appellation “visions,” which also points to the well-recognized fact
                    that a large part of our dream-imagination simulates the form of <hi
                        rend="italic">visual</hi> perception.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n472/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0472-0453"/>
                <p>The next general characteristic of dreams is that, though resembling waking
                    experience in many respects, they seem never exactly to reproduce the order of
                    this experience. Most of our dreams differ very widely from any events ever
                    known to us in waking life, and even those which most closely resemble certain
                    portions of this life introduce numerous changes in detail. These deviations
                    involve one or two distinct elements. First of all, there is a great confusion
                    of the order in time, space, &lt;fcc∙, which holds among real objects and
                    events. Widely remote places and events are brought together, persons set in new
                    relations to one another, and so on. Secondly, the objects and scenes are apt to
                    assume a greatly exaggerated intensity. They take a firmer hold of us, so to
                    speak, than our waking experience. We may when awake think of dreams as
                    unsubstantial and unreal, but to the dreamer at the moment his imagined
                    surroundings are more real, more impressive, than the actual ones which he
                    perceives when awake. Dream-fancy exaggerates the various aspects of objects,
                    makes what is large still larger, what is striking still more striking, what is
                    beautiful still more beautiful, and so ou.</p>
                <p>Having touched on these approximately universal characteristics of dreams, we
                    will now specify a few of the more variable features. For example, iu a large
                    number of our dreams we appear to be passive spectators of events which we are
                    incapable, or rather do not think, of controlling in any way. In other dreams,
                    again, we seem to be lively actors in the scene,—talking, moviug, &amp;c., as we
                    are wont to do in waking life. In a class of dreams lying midway between these
                    two extremes we appear to be impelled to act, to be struggling to seize some
                    offered good or to avert some threatening evil, yet to be unable to execute our
                    wishes. Once more, dreams differ very much as to their degree of reasonableness.
                    It is certain that in many cases the dreamer is easily imposed on, sees no
                    contradictions, does not seek to understand the events which unfold themselves
                    before his fancy, and so on. In some instances, indeed, the mind of the dreamer
                    loses even the sense of identity in objects, and metamorphizes persons in the
                    most capricious manner; and this confusion of identity may embrace the dreamer
                    himself, so that he imagines himself to be somebody else, or projects a part of
                    himself, so to speak, into another personality, which thus becomes an <hi
                        rend="italic">alter ego</hi> and an object for the contemplation of the
                    remaining self. Yet though it is true that many, probably a large proportion, of
                    our dreams, are thus unintelligible to waking thought, there is a number of well
                    authenticated dreams in which persons have proved themselves to be possessed not
                    only of their ordinary, but even of an extraordinary, power of reflection. We
                    refer to the well-known stories of the intellectual achievements of Condillac,
                    Condorcet, Coleridge, &amp;c., when dreaming. Once more, great differences are
                    observable in dreams with respect to the feelings excited by the visionary
                    experiences. Sometimes the circumstances in which we find ourselves affect us
                    much as in waking life;—danger terrifies us, beauty delights us, and so on. At
                    other times, however, we are not thus affected ;—what would puzzle, confuse, or
                    shock our miude in waking experience fails to do so in dream-life. Finally,
                    there are certain exceptional features of dream-life, as a vague consciousness
                    of dreaming, which assumes the form of a dream within a dream, and the
                    repetition of the images of previous dreams with a recognition of the
                    familiarity of the dream scenes. It need hardly be added that dreaming varies
                    greatly, both in quantity and in quality, according to individual temperament,
                    habits of thought, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theories of Dreaming.—</hi> From the slight sketch of the
                    character of the dreaming process just given, it might be conjectured that the
                    human mind at all times would be profoundly impressed with the fact of dreaming,
                    and seek to arrive at some explanation of what on the surface is undoubtedly so
                    mysterious and so wonderful a phenomenon. And as a matter of history we find
                    that men have in all the known stages of their intellectual development
                    endeavoured to account for the visions of the night. The various theories thus
                    put forward fall into two main classes—the supernatural and the natural. By the
                    former we mean all explanations which assume the action of forces unknown to our
                    waking experience; by the latter those which make no such assumption, but seek
                    to interpret dream-phenomena as products of forces familiar to waking
                    perception. The supernatural hypothesis, again, falls into two divisions,
                    according as the dream is regarded as the immediate effect of some reality
                    corresponding to the actual world of our waking experience, or as it is
                    conceived as a mediate result depending on the volition and command of some
                    absent being. We thus have three main methods of explaining dreams :—(a) The
                    naive objective explanation; (ό) the religious explanation <hi rend="italic">;
                        (c)</hi> the scientific explanation.</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">The Dream as Immediate Objective Experience.—</hi>
                    According to recent researches the savage mind regards dreaming as no less real
                    an objective experience than waking. The objects and scenes which flit before
                    the dreaming fancy of the primitive man are real material existences, the sounds
                    he seems to hear are real external sounds, the dream figures which stand before
                    his imagination and converse with him are real persons. How then does he
                    conceive the relation of this dream-world to the world of waking experience 1
                    This question has lately been answered by Mr E. B. Tylor and Mr Herbert Spencer.
                    The belief in the objective reality of dreams requires the savage to conceive a
                    double nature both for objects (animate and inanimate) external to himself and
                    for himself. The vision of dead ancestors, of material objects long since lost
                    or destroyed, easily suggests the idea of a duplicate of the original person of
                    thing, a second self or soul. On the other hand, when the savage dreams that he
                    goes forth to accustomed scenes, to hunt, to fight, and so on, he accounts for
                    the dream by the supposition that his own second self or soul leaves the body
                    and passes forth to the particular locality. Thus the dream-life shapes itself
                    to our primitive philosopher as an intercourse of souls or duplicate selves,
                    co-ordinate with, and of equal reality with, the experience of waking life. It
                    appears to follow from the unfamiliarity of dream scenes, personages, &amp;c.,
                    that the region visited during sleep will be projected by the savage mind quite
                    outside the world of waking observation. Mr Spencer connects with this fact the
                    earliest theories of another world or a spiritual state. (For a fuller account
                    of the part played by dreams in primitive ideas consult E. B. Tylor, <hi
                        rend="italic">Primitive Culture,</hi> vol. i. chap. xi.; H. Spencer, <hi
                        rend="italic">Principles of Sociology,</hi> i. ch. x. <hi rend="italic">et
                        seg.)</hi></p>
                <p>(ό) <hi rend="italic">The Dream as α Communication from α Supernatural
                        Being.—</hi> It is plain that even in the savage’s conception of dreaming
                    there is room for the thought of a divine announcement. When once the idea of
                    superior beings, deities, demons, &lt;fcc., is reached, it becomes natural to
                    regard the visit of some departed soul as the despatch of a messenger to the
                    dreamer. In this way the first mode of explanation passes insensibly into the
                    second. In higher stages of religious thought the view of a dream as a divine
                    revelation takes a less crude form. The immediate object present to the dreamer
                    is no longer conceived as possessing the same degree of materiality. Something
                    is still present, no doubt, and so the dream is in a sense objective; but the
                    reality is less like a tangible material object, and is transformed more or less
                    completely into something unsubstantial, spiritual, and phantasmal. On the other
                    hand, the dream is objective in the sense of being a message or revelation from
                    some actual divine personage. The essence of the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0473-0454"/> dream, so to speak, lies in the fact that it
                    conveys to the dreamer something which the divine personage wishes him to know,
                    whether it be the will of this being in the shape of a command or a prohibition,
                    or some fact as yet unknown (past or future), the knowledge of which will be of
                    practical utility to the recipient. We may distinguish three stages in this
                    conception of dreams :—(I) The deity sends a messenger or angel who is vaguely
                    conceived as a spiritual being clothed in a thin material vestment; (2) the
                    divine communicator, dispensing with the medium of a material appearance, lets
                    his message be heard by the dreamer as the utterance of an external voice; (3)
                    he discloses his purpose by causing to pass before the soul a vision which is
                    not distinctly conceived as objective, but rather as something mysteriously
                    imprinted on the mind.</p>
                <p>The divine communication which thus makes use of the medium of a dream will, it
                    is plain, vary considerably in the degree of its intelligibility. Sometimes the
                    meaning of the message is obvious and unmistakable. The actions to be performed
                    and the facts to be known are revealed plainly and directly. This will be the
                    case for the most part with the first and second forms of dream-communication.
                    At t’mes, too, the divinely created vision may distinctly picture some coming
                    event in the individual or national life. On the other hand, the communication
                    may be disguised and only partially divulged by symbol, in which case there
                    arises the necessity of an art of interpretation. Thus at times the oral
                    utterance may assume the form of a dim oracular declaration which calls for
                    careful attention and a certain skill in the application of verbal figures. It
                    is, however, in the last form of dream-revelation that we find the greatest
                    demands made on the interpreter’s art. It follows from what has been said
                    respecting the novelty of dream-combinations that many of the visual images
                    which make up so large a bulk of our dreams cannot easily be fitted to any
                    actual order of events. Hence, if such dreams are to be interpreted as having a
                    bearing on actual events, they must be regarded as figurative or symbolic.
                    Accordingly we find that the symbolic function of dreams has been fully
                    recognized in all the theories of dreaming now dealt with. It seems to have been
                    assumed that the normal mode of divine communication to man during sleep was
                    that of such a figurative dream. And agreeably with this supposition the task of
                    deciphering dream-symbols gradually grew into a skilled art, which became the
                    prerogative of a certain class of experts,—as prophets, divinators, or
                    magicians.</p>
                <p>A very brief historical review of this religious theory of dreams must here
                    suffice. Among the Oriental peoples this view of dreams was the prevailing one.
                    We find, however, great differences in the mode of interpretation adopted. Among
                    the ancient Hebrews, for example, we find all the three forms of
                    dream-communication mentioned above. As to interpretation there seem to have
                    been no definite rules, and the procedure followed resolves itself into an
                    attempt to discover the most natural or least forced application of the persons,
                    objects, and relations of the dream to some existing persons, social
                    circumsrtances, and events. This mode of interpretation clearly left wide scope
                    for individual skill. In the Persian scheme of interpretation, on the other
                    hand, so far as we can judge of it from the compilations of a later age, the art
                    of dream-interpretation, oneirocritics, or oneiromancy, was defined and fixed in
                    a number of rules. Thus in the work known under the name of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sifat-i-Sirozah,</hi> minute and elaborate prescriptions are
                    given for interpreting various classes of dreams according to the particular day
                    of the month on which they occur. A similar systematization of the rules of
                    dream-interpretation is to be met with among the Arabs (see <hi rend="italic"
                        >HOnirocrite Mussulman,</hi> par Gabdorrhachaman, traduction de Pierre
                    Vattier.) In such cases, it is plain, the interpretation of dreams involved less
                    of individual genius or inspiration, and became a more mechanical process,
                    involving only careful knowledge of formulae, and one which could be easily
                    communicated. Such a state of things points to the transition of dream-lore from
                    the stage of au esoteric mystery to that of a communicable science. Among the
                    Greeks and Romans the religious view of dreams is to be found in popular
                    literature as well as in philosophic writings. In Homer, dreams are distinctly
                    said to be sent by the gods and goddesses, as in the expression <hi
                        rend="italic">θcio&lt;s</hi> wαpoς, and it is implied that they may be
                    intended to deceive the subject of them <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    Agamemnon’s dream, <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> book ii.). Similarly the
                    dramatists frequently speak of foreknowledge divinely communicated by dreams <hi
                        rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Clytemnaestra’s prescience as to the fall of Troy
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon</hi> of Aeschylus is ascribed to a dream).
                    The popular view was countenanced to a certain extent by philosophers. Thus
                    Plato found room in his mystic scheme of knowledge for the idea of a divine
                    manifestation to the soul in sleep. In the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi>
                    (chaps, xlvi. and xlvii.) a prophetic character is distinctly assigned to the
                    images of dreams. These divine inspirations (divinations) are not, however,
                    given to the rational soul, but to the lower appetitive soul through the medium
                    of the sensible images of rational truths which are reflected on the liver, an
                    organ contiguous with the bodily seat of the appetitive soul. These prophetic
                    visions are received only when the reasoning faculty is fettered by sleep or
                    alienated by disease and enthusiasm. In this way the divine artificer has gi.en
                    to the inferior regions of the soul a certain substitute for rational knowledge.
                    At the same time the interpretation of the visions requires intelligence, and
                    hence the business of receiving them and of interpreting them does not properly
                    belong to the same persons. Even Aristotle treats the supposition of divine
                    revelation in dreams very considerately when he writes, in the treatise 7r∈pι
                    pαμτικ⅛ς <hi rend="italic">τηs</hi><hi rend="italic">èv</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >to?ç</hi><hi rend="italic">vπvoas,</hi> “that there is a divination
                    concerning some things in dreams is not incredible.” The Stoics, again, to judge
                    from Cicero’s account of their views in his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Divinatione,</hi> reasoned <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    that the gods, if they love men and are omniscient as well as all-powerful, will
                    certainly disclose their purposes to man in sleep. Chrysippus is, on the same
                    authority, said to have written a volume on the interpretation of dreams as
                    divine portents. Cicero’s brother Quintus, who here defends the orthodox theory
                    of dreams, speaks of a skilled interpretation of dreams which is a true
                    divination, even though, like all other arts in which men have to proceed on
                    conjecture and on artificial rules, it is not infallible. The current views of
                    dreams of classic antiquity are supposed to be to some extent embodied iu the
                        <hi rend="italic">'Ονειροκριτικά</hi> of Daldianus Artemidorus of Ephesus
                    (written about the year 170). Here the interpretation of dreams is reduced to a
                    body of elaborate rules. To dream of a particular element, as fire, air,

                    the age, social condition, &lt;fcc., of the dreamer which, in the view of
                    Artemidorus, leads to the abuse of dream-interpretation. He attempts to draw a
                    distinction between ûrapoç, a vision having a real bearing on events, and <hi

                    this does not, according to Liddell and Scott, correspond with classical usage.
                    The divine origin of dreams became a doctrine of the Christian church. It
                    appears in the writings of the fathers, being defended partly on biblical,
                    partly on classic, authority. Synesius of Cyrene (born 375) has left a treatise
                    on dreams (τr∈pι <hi rend="italic">ενυπνίων).</hi> He puts forward certain
                    psychological hypotheses drawn largely from Plato and Plotinus and ascribes to

                    the animal part) the power of accompanying the soul in its flights to the
                    celestial regions, and so of sharing in the contemplation of divine truths. Syn
                    esius exalts the rank of dreaming among the arts of divination, setting it far
                    above other modes of prophecy as being most simple and sure, open to all,
                    unencumbered with expensive and laborious preparations, and so on. He affirms
                    that he has repeatedly found dreams of service in arranging his ideas, and in
                    improving his style of composition. Mediaeval and modern Christian theologians
                    have continued to attribute dreams, or, more accurately, certain orders of
                    dream, to the intermediate agency of the divine Being. The popular theory of
                    dreams to be met with among the later European peoples bears the impress of that
                    folk-lore which developed itself in the Middle Ages under influences partly
                    Christian, partly pagan. Dreams were referred to a variety of supernatural
                    agencies, including not only God and the devil, but also subordinate beings, as
                    fairy, fiend (incubus), &amp;c. Further, the art of interpreting dreams
                    according to definite rules (oneiromancy) was developed to a very high point.
                    (See Brand, <hi rend="italic">Popular Antiquities,</hi> vol. iii. <hi
                        rend="italic">Dictionary of Dreams).</hi> In our own times certain
                    restricted classes of dreams are customarily associated with the action of
                    benevolent or malignant beings. On the other hand, people are now wont to
                    interpret dreams as omens or signs without distinctly attributing them to any
                    supernatural agent. This view of dreams forms the transition-point between the
                    religious and the scientific theories.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">The Dream as a Subjective Phenomenon Dependent on Natural
                        Causes.—</hi> While the theory of the divine or supernatural origin of
                    dreams has thus held its ground so long, there has been gradually growing up
                    from an early period of human history a more scientific conception of the
                    phenomenon as dependent on natural laws (of mind and body). Psychologists and
                    physiologists alike have approached the subject from their respective points of
                    view, and sought to explain the phenomena of dreaming as natural events. The
                    first germs of a scientific theory of dreams are to be found in antiquity. Thus
                    Democritus, from whom the Epicureans derived their theory, held that dreams are
                    the product of the simulacra or phantasms of corporeal objects which are
                    constantly floating in the atmosphere, and which attack the soul during repose.
                    Again, Plato speaks in the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> of dreaming as
                    illustrating the dominant mental impulses and habits of the individual
                    (unchecked appetite, and temperance with intellectual pursuits), and thus
                    connects it with the normal waking operations of feeling and thought. Aristotle
                    in his short treatise on dreams (πepι <hi rend="italic">ενυπνίων)</hi> refers
                    dreaming to the action of objects of outward sense which leave behind
                    impressions on the soul and bodily frame. Dreaming is said to be the function of
                    the sensitive part of the mind, but of this so far as phantastic; and a dream is
                    defined as “the phantasm arising from the motion of sensible perceptions when it
                    presents itself to him who is asleep.” Aristotle further has some correct
                    observations on the immediate bodily conditions of dreaming, and on the
                    exaggeration of sensation in this condition of mind. Thus, he says, we fancy it
                    thunders and lightens when a small sound is produced in our ears; we imagine
                    that we are eating honey in consequence of a defluxion of the least quantity of
                    phlegm. In the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divinatione</hi> of
                    Cicero we have almost an unique instance among classic writings of a complete
                    rejection of the doctrine of the supernatural origin of dreams, and of a full
                    and consistent adoption of the natural method of explaining the phenomena.
                    Cicero’s position stands in marked contrast to that of partial sceptics, as, for
                    example, Pliny, who seems content to exclude from the supernatural method of
                    explanation certain of the more obviously natural dreams, such as those
                    occurring immediately after food and wine, or when one has just fallen asleep
                    after waking <hi rend="italic">(Nat. Hist.)</hi></p>
                <p>While philosophers were thus learning to regard dreams as natural processes,
                    physicians, on the other side, had their attention called to dreaming in its
                    relation to pathological bodily conditions. It seems probable, indeed, that men
                    occupied in studying bodily diseases were among tho first to suspect the true
                    nature and origin of dreaming. Thus Hippocrates, while inclined to admit that
                    some dreams may be divine, distinctly says that others arise from the action of
                    the mind and the body. Hippocrates, too, appears to have been the first to
                    supply a scientific basis for the premonitory character of certain kinds of
                    dreams. There are dreams, he says, which announce beforehand the affections of
                    the body. This idea has, as we shall see presently, been confirmed by modern
                    pathological observations. It is easy to understand that this prognostic side of
                    dreams was in the early stages of knowledge greatly exaggerated. This appears to
                    be true of the speculations of Galen, who held that to dream one’s thigh was
                    turned into stone signified the approaching loss of this member. This belief in
                    the premonitory character of dreams was only one side of a general doctrine of
                    dreams according to which they arise from bodily disturbances, and so may serve
                    as symptoms which the physician has to include in the complete diagnosis of a
                    disease. This idea, which is recognized by modern physiologists as true within
                    certain limits, led in the first crude stages of scientific investigation to
                    exaggerated and fanciful conclusions. Thus a new system of dream-interpretation
                    came into vogue according to which to dream of a certain thing always means a
                    disturbance in one particular organ. In the doctrines of Oriental physicians
                    (the Hindus and Chinese) dreams are thus referred to pathological states of the
                    five organs— heart, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and liver. Thus to dream of war and
                    fighting signifies a bad state of the lungs; of fire, smoke, &amp;c., a bad
                    state of the heart, and so on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern. Theory of Dreams.—</hi> Under this head we shall give
                    an account of the principal results of modern investigations, psychological and
                    physiological, on the nature and conditions of dreams. Respecting many points
                    there is still considerable diversity of view. Certain questions of fact yet
                    remain unanswered, the reason of this being the inaccessibility of
                    dream-phenomena to accurate and adequate observation. Further, owing to the
                    divided condition of psychological principles, the explanation of dreaming
                    assumes very different forms with different writers. On the one hand there are
                    those who conceive the mind as an independent spiritual substance, which employs
                    the body as its instrument, but is not dependent on this. With these, dreams
                    will naturally wear the aspect of products of some spiritual faculty or
                    faculties which are not involved in the sleep of the body and the senses. At the
                    other extreme are those who regard mental phenomena as an outcome of bodily
                    changes, as a refined result of physical processes. By these, dreams will be
                    regarded as given off, so to speak, by the various organs of the body during
                    sleep. Midway between the spiritualist and materialist hypotheses is the
                    scientific view in its narrower sense, namely, the doctrine that the mental and
                    the bodily are perfectly dissimilar regions of phenomena, which are yet
                    connected in such a way that bodily events appear as the conditions of mental
                    events. In the following account of modem dream theory we shall confine
                    ourselves for the most part to the last stand-point, though indicating here and
                    there how the other theories of the relation of mind to body lead to divergent
                    conclusions.</p>

                    imperfect sleep which must cease as soon as the higher nervous centres reach a
                    complete repose <hi rend="italic">1</hi> Is it, on the other hand, something
                    wholly spiritual and independent of sleep as a bodily condition! Here we have
                    two different views arising from different theories of the relation of mind and
                    body. These distinct views of the subject have commonly appeared as answers to
                    the question of fact—Are we when asleep always dreaming <hi rend="italic">1</hi>
                    This question was first raised by philosophers in connection with certain
                    conceptions of the soul and its activity. Descartes, who regarded thought as of
                    the essence of personal existence, was naturally led to maintain that the mind
                    is always thinking. “I am,” he says, “I exist, that is certain; but for how long
                    1 as long as I think; for perhaps even it might happen that if I ceased wholly
                    to think I should cease at the same time wholly to exist” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Meditation ii.).</hi> Among the Cartesians the proposition, the mind is
                    always thinking, became a leading tenet. Locke argueä against this supposition.
                    He contends that in sleep men do not always think, or they would be conscious of
                    it. If it is asserted that they dream but they forget it, he replies it is “hard
                    to be conceived” that “the soul in a sleeping man should be this moment busy
                    a-thinking, and the next moment in a waking man not remember nor be able to
                    recollect one jot of all those thoughts.” To suppose that in sleep the soul
                    thinks apart from the body involves the absurdity of a double mind, and is
                    further contradicted by the irrationality of dreams <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Essay,</hi> book ii. ch. i.). Locke was answered by Leibnitz in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Nouveaux</hi><hi rend="italic">Essais,</hi> who upheld the
                    Cartesian affirmation, and maintained that during sleep the mind has always some
                    “little perceptions” or “confused sentiments,” though, according to his doctrine
                    of unconscious perceptions, these need not become objects of conscious
                    attention. That we never sleep without dreaming is further maintained by Kant in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Anthropologie,</hi> by Jouffroy and others. In his <hi
                        rend="italic">Lectures on Metaphysics,</hi> Sir W. Hamilton argues fully for
                    the same idea. He says that during sleep the mind “is never either inactive or
                    wholly unconscious.” He seeks to refute the argument of Locke, that we ought to
                    remember our dreams, by calling attention to the fact that the somnambulist has
                    no recollection of his dream, and that persons who betray in their expression
                    and utterance the fact of dreaming retain no recollection of the state. He
                    further holds that the continuity of dreaming is proved by the fact that
                    whenever we are suddenly roused from sleep we find ourselves dreaming.</p>
                <p>While metaphysicians have thus in the main affirmed the continuity of dreams,
                    those who regard mental phenomena as invariably connected with bodily conditions
                    have for the most part viewed dreaming as only an occasional accompaniment of
                    sleep. By some, indeed, dreaming is viewed as confined to the transition state
                    from sleeping to waking, though this view is now rejected by physiologists no
                    less than by metaphysicians. It is true that the great rapidity of dream-thought
                    has been proved, <hi rend="italic">e.g,,</hi> by the experience of Lord Holland,
                    who fell asleep when listening to somebody reading, had a long dream, and yet
                    awoke in time to hear the conclusion of the sentence of which he remembered the
                    beginning. And this takes off from the value of Hamilton’s argument that we
                    always find ourselves dreaming when wakened, for such dreaming may clearly be an
                    incident of the transition state. Yet the other facts emphasized by Hamilton, as
                    well as the results of Maury’s experiments, to be spoken of presently, show that
                    we may dream when soundly sleeping. On the other hand, we cannot, it is certain,
                    directly prove that we are always dreaming during sleep. Many physiologists are
                    disposed to regard dreaming as the accompaniment of some slight disturbance,
                    whether arising from the lower organs or from an undue excitability of the brain
                    and its nervous connect tions; and according to this view the continuity of
                    dreaming would seem to be an improbable supposition. To the physiologist the
                    idea of perfectly unconscious sleep presents no difficulties. The results of
                    experiment show him that the lower bodily (vegetative) functions are independent
                    of cerebral activity; and the phenomena of swooning, the effects of
                    anaesthetics, &lt;c., familiarize him with the temporary suspension of the
                    conscious activity of the brain. Hence the view commonly adopted by
                    physiologists seems to be that dreaming is only an occasional incident of sleep.
                    (See the article on “Sleep and Dreams” by Dr Carpenter in Todd’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Ency. of Anat. and Physiol.')</hi> At the same time certain
                    physiologists, as Sir H. Holland <hi rend="italic">(Chapters on</hi><hi

                    Brodie <hi rend="italic">(Psychological Inquiries),</hi> are disposed to think
                    that dreaming is the rule and not the exception.</p>
                <p>The question whether we are always dreaming during sleep leads up naturally to
                    the inquiry into the causes or conditions of dreams. This question has been
                    approached from different sides. On the one side, metaphysicians have sought to
                    account for dreaming by some simple theory of a suspension of certain mental
                    faculties. On the other side, writers have tried to explain dreaming as a result
                    of simple bodily operations. We will just glance at one or two of these simple
                    hypotheses. A common view among metaphysicians is that the nature of dreaming is
                    amply explained by the absence or suspension of the will. The importance of the
                    cessation of the will’s action has been emphasized by Dugald Stewart <hi
                        rend="italic">(Elements of the Phil, of the Human Mind,</hi> vol. i. chap.
                    v. sect. 5). Stewart does not mean that the will is wholly dormant in sleep, but
                    that it loses its hold on the faculties. By this supposition he seeks to account
                    not only for the incoherence but also for the apparent reality of dream-images.
                    That the absence of the normal processes of volition, especially as involved in
                    attention, constitutes one important factor in the explanation of dreaming seems
                    to be admitted by all writers,—for example, Dr Darwin <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Zoonomia),</hi> Sir Benj. Brodie, Dr Carpenter, and M. Alf. Maury <hi
                        rend="italic">(Le Sommeil</hi><hi rend="italic">et les</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Rêves).</hi> It is doubtful, however, whether this simple hypothesis
                    explains all that Stewart refers to it. Maury objects to Stewart’s theory that
                    the will does not wholly lose its command of the bodily organs, &lt;kc., in
                    dreams.</p>
                <p>While great stress has thus been laid by some writers on this negative condition,
                    the suspension of will, others have sought to construct a simple theory of
                    dreaming by supposing the unimpeded action of some special mental faculty. Thus
                    Cudworth <hi rend="italic">(Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable
                        Morality)</hi> reasons, from the orderly coherence of dream-imaginations and
                    the novelty of their combinations, that this state of mind arises from the
                    action of “the phantastical power of the soul,” and not from “any fortuitous
                    dancings of the spirits.” A very curious theory of dreaming as depending on a
                    particular circumscribed faculty of the soul is to be found in Schemer’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Das Leben</hi><hi rend="italic">des Traumes.</hi> Dreaming is
                    a decentralization of the movement of life. In waking consciousness the central
                    force, the ego spontaneity, is supreme,—in dreaming the activity of the ego
                    becomes purely receptive. The central ego is now merely the point about which
                    the peripheral life plays in perfect freedom. Thus the will (the spontaneous
                    ego) is suspended, and thought loses its categories. On the other hand, the
                    imagination now freed from the ego reaches its perfect unrestrained function.
                    And this function is seen in the symbolic representation both of the bodily
                    parts and of the mental stimuli which influence consciousness in sleep. A
                    similar conception of the action of the creative fancy in dreaming is adopted by
                    Dr Johannes Volkelt <hi rend="italic">(Die Traum-phantasie.)</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n476/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0476-0457"/> In addition to these simple metaphysical and
                    psychological theories of dreaming, there are to be found no less simple
                    physiological hypotheses. Among these we may take the opinion of Hobbes <hi
                        rend="italic">{Leviathan),</hi> that the imaginations of dreams all proceed
                    from “the agitation of the inward parts of a man’s body, <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> ’ the disturbance of which parts, owing to their connections with the
                    brain, serves to keep the latter in motion. Another simple physiological
                    hypothesis for explaining dreams is offered by Schopenhauer. According to this
                    writer, the exciting causes of dreams are impressions received from the internal
                    regions of the organism through the sympathetic nervous system. These
                    impressions are afterwards worked up by the mind into quasi-realities by means
                    of its “forms” of space, time, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>This simple and “geometric” method of explaining dreams, though it may be
                    valuable up to a certain point, must necessarily fail to account for all the
                    phenomena concerned. As we have shown in our preliminary description of dreams,
                    their contents vary within very wide limits, and cannot therefore all be
                    referred to one or two simple principles whether mental faculties or bodily
                    stimuli; also, it is by no means safe to affirm of any mental function that it
                    is universally absent in dreams, since the second mental processes, as Sir H.
                    Holland and M. Maury point out, enter in very unequal degrees into different
                    dreams.</p>
                <p>A full and exhaustive theory of dreaming would seem to include several distinct
                    lines of inquiry. Among these there are three which have already been well
                    defined by recent writers on the subject. The first relates to the sources of
                    dream-imaginations, or the stimulations which are the immediate causes of these.
                    The second question has to do with the order or form of dream-combinations, and
                    seeks to determine the conditions of the peculiar arrangements, simultaneous and
                    successive, which are observable in dreams. The last problem is that of
                    accounting for the objective reality and generally for the intensity and
                    impressiveness of dream-fancies.</p>
                <p>In briefly opening up each of these lines of inquiry we shall seek to keep in
                    mind the variable as well as the constant features of dreaming; also we shall
                    proceed, as far as possible, according to that double method of study, the
                    psychological and the physiological (subjective and objective), which offers
                    itself to those who accept the idea of a perfect parallelism between mental and
                    bodily events.</p>
                <p>(A) <hi rend="italic">The Sources of Dream Materials.—</hi> The numerous images
                    which make up the ever-renewed current of a dream appear sometimes to come from
                    the internal depths of the mind itself. In other cases, as even the ancients
                    recognized, they depend on a stimulation of the brain arising from varying
                    conditions of the bodily organs. According to the view that all mental events
                    have their physical accompaniments, the first class of imaginations must also be
                    referred to certain conditions of the brain and nervous system. These various
                    sources of dream-activity are roughly classified by Hartley in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Observations on Man.</hi> Dream-images, he tells us, are
                    deducible from three causes :—(1) impressions and ideas lately received; (2)
                    present state of the body (especially the stomach and the brain); (3)
                    association. The large part played by bodily states in our dream-life is
                    recognized not only by physiologists, as Maury, but also by those who ascribe
                    dreams in part to occult spiritual faculties, as Schemer. By help of the results
                    of recent researches we are able to improve a little on Hartley’s
                    classification. The exciting causes of dream-images fall into two main classes
                    :—(I.) peripheral, and (II.) central stimulations. The latter arise in the
                    outlying parts of the nervous system, namely, the organs of sense, the muscular
                    apparatus, the internal bodily organs, together with the external portions of
                    the nerves connected with these.</p>
                <p>Central stimulations are such as arise mainly, if not entirely, within the
                    encephalic region. These again are either (a) direct, or <hi rend="italic"
                        >{β)</hi> indirect. The first depend on the condition of the nerve-elements
                    acted upon, and the unknown influences (possibly connected with the condition of
                    the circulation) brought to bear on these at the moment. The indirect
                    stimulations arise as a result of some preceding excitation in a connected
                    region of the brain. The former underlie the apparently spontaneous imaginations
                    of dreaming, as well as those which are the echo of a recent waking experience.
                    The latter are the physical counterpart of images or ideas called up by
                    association with preceding images or thoughts.</p>
                <p>(I.) Among peripheral stimulations are to be noticed (a) those which arise from
                    the action of external objects on the organs of sensation. Recent researches
                    show that these may play an important part in dreams. Dr Beattie speaks of a man
                    who could be made to dream about a subject by whispering into his ear.
                    Experiments were made by Μ. Giron de Buzareingues <hi rend="italic">{Journal de
                        Physiol,</hi> tom. viii.) as to the effects of external impressions on
                    dreaming. Thus, by leaving his knee uncovered during sleep, he dreamt he was
                    travelling in a diligence (where knees are apt to get cold). The most elaborate
                    experiments bearing on this point have been carried on by Alf. Maury, with the
                    help of an assistant. The latter produces some external stimulation while the
                    experimenter sleeps; he is then wakened up so as to record the dream immediately
                    resulting. By this means important results were reached. When, for example, his
                    lips were tickled, he dreamt that he was subjected to horrible tortures, that
                    pitch plaster was applied to his face and then torn off. Sensations of hearing,
                    smell, and taste were also followed by appropriate though greatly exaggerated
                    images. Wundt <hi rend="italic">{Physiologische Psychologie)</hi> thinks that
                    cutaneous sensations, arising from the varying pressure and temperature of the
                    bodily surface, are frequent excitants of dream-images. <hi rend="italic"
                        >{β)</hi> Along with such objective sensations must be reckoned subjective
                    sensations which arise in the absence of external stimuli, and which have as
                    their physical basis certain actions in the peripheral as well as the central
                    regions of the nerves. Of such are the visual images <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Schlummerbilder)</hi> seen by J. Müller, Goethe, Purkinje, and others,
                    when th.e body is disposed to sleep. These are called the dreamchaos by
                    Gruithuisen, since they are supposed to form the raw material of dreams. Maury
                    gives a full account of these phenomena, which he terms “hypnagogic
                    hallucinations,” and which appear to include not only visual images but also
                    subjective sensations of sound, touch, &amp;c. He attaches great importance to
                    the action of these subjective sensations in dreams. The predominance of visual
                    imagery in dreaming appears to be connected with the great activity of the organ
                    of sight and its consequent excitability. It is to be added that one can only
                    roughly distinguish these subjective sensations, which involve the peripheral
                    regions of the nervous system, from images supposed to be confined to the
                    central regions. (γ) The conditions of our muscles during sleep, which somehow
                    convey impressions to the brain, affect consciousness, and so influence
                    dreaming. To this source we must refer the active phenomena of dreams, as
                    running, flying, resisting, struggling, &amp;c. It is probable, as Wundt
                    remarks, that the movements of the body during sleep, as those of breathing and
                    the extensions and contractions of the limbs, give rise to dream fancies, and
                    painful conditions of the muscles due to an awkward position of the limbs may
                    also serve to excite images, (δ) Among the most frequent excitants of dreams are
                    organic or systemic sensations connected with the varying states of the internal
                    bodily organs. The prominence given to this source of dreaming <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n477/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0477-0458"/> in ancient and modern systems of medicine has
                    already been referred to. States of the stomach, lungs, heart, secretory organs,
                    teeth and gums, &lt;fcc.. are, as we all know, powerful provocatives of dreams.
                    Owing to the close connection of dreams with these organic conditions they may
                    serve as important elements in the diagnosis of bodily disease. Thus M. Macario
                        <hi rend="italic">(Du Sommeil, des Rêves,</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                        du</hi><hi rend="italic">Somnambulisme')</hi> recognizes among the morbid
                    class of dreams those which are “prodromic,’’ or premonitory <hi rend="italic"
                        >(e.y.,</hi> a dream of sanguinary conflict before hemorrhage), as well as
                    those which are symptomatic of existing bodily and mental disorders.</p>
                <p>(II.) We pass to internal or cerebral excitations. Under (a), the direct
                    excitations, are to be included all dream ideas which do not arise from bodily
                    stimuli, or through association with preceding feelings and ideas. It seems
                    fairly certain that many of our dream-images are thus occasioned by a kind of
                    “automatic excitation” of the cerebral regions. The dreams which clearly arise
                    from an after-effect in the brain of recent perceptions, especially those of the
                    previous day, appear to illustrate this process. Also, many of the images which
                    correspond to persons and scenes supposed to be long since forgotten may be due
                    to some such local automatic cerebral “sub-excitation.” Maury distinctly
                    recognizes this factor in dream-stimulation. It appears from experiences
                    recorded by him that by means of these automatic central excitations images may
                    sometimes be called up of objects which have never been distinctly perceived,
                    and which yet have left a trace of their action on the cerebral substance, <hi
                        rend="italic">(β)</hi> The indirect central stimulations include, no doubt,
                    a large number of our dream-fancies. When once a starting-poiut is reached,
                    whether through a peripheral or a central automatic (direct) excitation, the
                    nervous connections which answer to mental associations provide a vast range of
                    new cerebration. It is to be added that the very same causes which excite
                    particular cerebral regions, to automatic action must affect other and connected
                    parts in a less degree, producing a powerful predisposition to activity. Hence
                    it is to be supposed that links of association which are insufficient to restore
                    an idea to consciousness in the waking, state may suffice to do so in sleep.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(B) The Order of Dream-Combinations.—</hi> Dreams are commonly
                    said to be incoherent, and this is no doubt frequently the case. On the other
                    hand many dreams appear to simulate orderly arrangements of objects and
                    successions of events. It must follow that on simple theory, such as that the
                    mind has lost the forms of thought—as space, time, and causation (which, as we
                    have seen, is contradicted by Schopenhauer)—will cover all the facts. The
                    absence of volition and voluntary attention goes far to throw light on
                    dream-combinations. In dreaming, as Maury observes, attention, instead of
                    dominating the images which present themselves, is itself dominated by these. At
                    the same time, as we shall see presently, the action of attention, though no
                    longer controlled by the will and directed to some practical end, plays an
                    important part in dreamconstruction. In order, if possible, to get at the laws
                    of dream-structure, we may roughly divide dreams into two classes :—(a) the
                    disconnected and incoherent, and <hi rend="italic">(β)</hi> the coherent.</p>
                <p>(a) The want of coherence in disorderly dreams appears to arise from the play of
                    association acting on all the heterogeneous and disconnected elements supplied
                    by peripheral and central (direct) stimulation at the time, there being no
                    volitional control (dominating attention) to interfere with the process.
                    Supposing that these two primary sources are continually sending forth new and
                    disconnected images to the dream-consciousness, and that owing to the extreme
                    excitability of the brain during sleep numerous paths of association open
                    themselves up in connection with every such image, we may see how it is that
                    objects group themselves, and events succeed one another in such a chaotic
                    manner. It is not correct to say that we here dispense with the “forms” of space
                    and time; objects are viewed in space, and events “intuited” in time, it is only
                    that the particular positions of things in space and time are overlooked. On the
                    other hand, it is true that there is in these loosely-threaded dreams, if not in
                    all dreams, a suspension of the reasoning process by which objects are intuited
                    in a causal relation. In these dreams, then, the mind is passive, and
                    consciousness is made up of a flu^∙ of images and feelings which is not analyzed
                    and rationalized as it is in the normal processes of waking perception.</p>
                <p>(/?) Let us now consider the more coherent class of dreams. These, as we have
                    seen, have by some been accounted for as the products of some occult power of
                    the soul, as the “phantastical power” of Cudworth and the symbolic plastic
                    phantasy of Schemer. There is no doubt that in many of the more elaborate and
                    pictorial of our dreams a result is reached very similar to the products of the
                    waking imagination. Can this operation be analyzed into simple processes Ί First
                    of all, the images, however disconnected their corresponding objects may be,
                    group themselves in a certain arrangement. This process would be described by
                    psychologists of the Kantian school as the superposition on the dream-materials
                    of certain mental forms. On the other hand, it may perhaps be explained as a
                    result of association. When two orders of impression— for example, the sight of
                    the human form and the sound of a human voice—have been habitually associated,
                    there arises what may be called a general associative disposition to connect
                    some variety of one order of impression with any particular variety of the order
                    which happens to present itself to the mind; and so, when dreaming, the mind is
                    disposed to add to images of colour certain relations of space, position,
                    magnitude, &amp;c., to images of human beings some form of the appropriate human
                    actions, relations, &amp;c. By this means the intuitive clearness and
                    completeness of our dream-imaginations may largely be accounted for. It is to be
                    added that these general associative tendencies do not determine what particular
                    relations or actions are to be attributed to the images of sleep. These latter
                    depend on the particular circumstances of the moment, as, for example, the
                    locality of the optic fibres involved, the varying excitability of the central
                    regions, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In this∙&gt;factor of our dream-constructions the mind seems to be wholly
                    passive. We have now to turn to a second influence, which involves to some
                    extent the active side of the mind, namely, the play of attention under the
                    influence, not of the will, but of certain vague emotional impulses. The chief
                    of these are the feeling for unity, and the instinct of emotional harmony. First
                    of all, there seems to be a tendency in the more orderly dreams to bring new
                    images into some intelligible connection or relation of unity with the
                    pre-existing ones. This vague impulse, acting through the processes of
                    expectation and attention, becomes selective, leading to a detention of those
                    members of the ever-renewed flux of images which are fitted to enter into the
                    dream-scene as consistent factors. In certain cases, indeed, this process seems
                    to rise to something like a conscious voluntary exertion. We occasionally
                    remember that we strove in our dream to discover a consistency in the variegated
                    and confused scene presented to consciousness. Secondly, the unity of
                    dream-structure is largely determined by the need of emotional harmony. A large
                    part, if not all, of our dream-fancies are attended with a feeling of pleasure
                    or of pain. Now, when a certain state of emotion has been excited in the mind,
                    there is a tendency to reject all ideas <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n478/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0478-0459"/> which conflict with this feeling, and to
                    accept any which harmonize with it. The emotion controls the movements of
                    anticipation and of intellectual attention, so that suitable ideas are at once
                    recognized and detained. The unity of our most complex dreams appears to arise
                    very largely from this source. In dreams described by Schemer, Volkelt, and
                    Wundt the successions of imaginary events are clearly strung together by a
                    thread of emotion, as joy, terror, and so on. The commonest example of such a
                    dominating emotional tone in dreaming occurs when there is a current of
                    pleasurable or painful feeling contributed by the condition of some of the
                    internal organs of the body. These bodily sensations become the basis of complex
                    groups of images, each new scene being connected with some analogous shade of
                    feeling, “bodily” or “mental.”</p>
                <p>(O') <hi rend="italic">The Objective Reality and Intensity of
                        Dream-Imaginations.—</hi> These are explained by Hartley by two
                    circumstances,—first, the absence of any other reality to oppose to the ideas
                    which offer themselves; and secondly, the greater vividness of the visible ideas
                    which occur in dreams as measured by the corresponding waking ideas. This last
                    fact may, he thinks, be partly accounted for by an increased heat of the brain.
                    As already remarked, Dugald Stewart explains the reality of dreams through the
                    suspension of the ordinary action of volition. In waking life, he says, we
                    distinguish objective impressions from ideas by finding that the former are
                    independent of volition, while the latter are dependent on the same. Hence, in
                    dreaming, when the will no longer controls ideas, these are mistaken for
                    realities. The chief influences here concerned appear to be included in
                    Hartley’s theory, though the circumstances emphasized by Stewart may be a
                    secondary element in the case. That the reality of dream-images depends in large
                    part on the absence of external impressions has been recognized by most recent
                    writers. Among others M. Taine <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >VIntelligence)</hi> dwells on the function of external sensation as a
                    corrective to internal imaginations, keeping these below the illusory stage.
                    External impressions are distinguished from ideas in the waking state, in part
                    at least, by their greater intensity. When this relation is no longer recognized
                    by reason either of the ideas acquiring preternatural vividness or of the
                    sensations being withdrawn, illusion follows. Waking hallucinations depend on
                    the first circumstance, dream-illusions on the second, perhaps also on the first
                    as well. This leads us to the reflection that during sleep the ideas arising in
                    consciousness undergo an increase of absolute as well as of relative vividness.
                    That is to say, they are in themselves more intense states of consciousness than
                    waking ideas. This seems to point, as Maury observes, to an increased
                    excitability of the nervous substance in sleep. This same circumstance, too,
                    helps to account for the preternatural impressiveness and the exaggeration which
                    meet us in dream-life. If the brain is during sleep peculiarly excitable it will
                    follow that all sensational stimuli, external and internal alike, will produce
                    an exaggerated result. Thus the intensity of sensations will be augmented, and
                    their volume, and so the apparent magnitude of dream-images be increased. Again,
                    if in dreaming the stream of fancies be a rapid one, if images simultaneously
                    and successively crowd in on consciousness, we may understand how space and time
                    may appear to swell to unusual proportions. Once more, the peculiar excitability
                    of the brain will manifest itself in an exaggeration of all feeling. Slight
                    bodily discomforts, for example, will be transformed, as in Maury’s experiments,
                    into huge sufferings, and so locally circumscribed bodily sensations of pleasure
                    may expand into preternatural forms of emotional delight.</p>
                <p>We are now perhaps in a position to explain the symbolic function of dreams so
                    much emphasized by Schemer. He considers that our dream-phantasy habitually
                    represents the seat of bodily sensations under the symbol of a house and its
                    parts, and the silent processes of thought as the audible conversation of living
                    persons. The latter remark is probably correct, and its truth follows from a
                    consideration of the close association between thought and audible speech. The
                    former observation is surely an exaggerated statement, as has been shown by his
                    friendly critic Volkelt. Yet though bodily sensations do not as a rule reveal
                    themselves under the symbol of a building or mass of buildings, they undoubtedly
                    do appear in consciousness disguised and transformed; and the reasons of this
                    aro plain. Even in the waking condition we have but a vague consciousness of the
                    seat of the bodily sensations, and in sleep this can hardly be present at all.
                    In addition to this, the exaggerating influences just referred to must tend to
                    disguise the real nature of bodily sensations, and so to remove all
                    consciousness of their locality. Hence bodily sensations do as a rule clothe
                    themselves in a disguise appearing under the form of emotional experiences. And
                    the particular pleasurable or painful images selected, which will vary with the
                    individual’s emotional nature and experience, will be apt to recur as a
                    “symbolic expression ’’ of this variety of bodily feeling. It will follow, too,
                    from the predominance of visual ideas in dreams, that these emotional fancies
                    will commonly take the shape of alluring or alarming visual perceptions.</p>
                <p>Dreaming is a subject of great interest by reason of its points of contact with
                    other mental conditions. Thus the common suspension of many of the higher
                    processes of emotion, thought, aud volition suggests an analogy between the
                    dreaming state and the instinctive stage of mental growth as observable in
                    children, primitive men, and the lower animals. This aspect of dreams lias been
                    treated by Maury.</p>
                <p>Again, dreaming has many curious resemblances to the mental states of the insane.
                    The differences which mark off dreaming from these states have already been
                    given. The resemblances between them are no less important. In the illusory
                    intensity of its internal images, in the rapidity ot its flux of ideas, and in
                    the wildness and incoherence of its combinations, the dream stands very close to
                    the whole class of hallucinations and illusions of waking life. In truth, a
                    systematic psychological treatment of dreams must connect them with other forms
                    of illusion. This is done, for example, by Wundt, who refers all these groups of
                    phenomena to an increased excitability of the sensory regions of the brain.
                    Maury seems disposed to regard dreaming as the incipient stage of a pathological
                    mental condition, of which somnambulism, insanity, &lt;fcc., are more fully
                    developed forms. Among other writers who have discussed dreams in relation to
                    these other abnormal states of mind are Macario <hi rend="italic">(op.

                <p>A good deal of random and undigested information respecting dreams and

                        >Histoire du Sonnambulism,</hi> par Austin Gauthier. For the best statement
                    of the modem theory of dreams, the student is referred to the works of Maury,
                    Wundt, Carpenter, and Volkelt, already named. Dreams have been roughly
                    classified according to the source of their images and the relative activity of
                    association and imagination involved, by Scherner, Volkelt, and others. The view
                    of the processes involved in the imaginative construction of dreams here adopted
                    has been more fully developed by the present writer in an article in the <hi
