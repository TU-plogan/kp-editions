                    a distinguished painter, was born in Aberdeen, where his father, a fellow of the
                    Royal Society, was a physician of some repute. He attended Marischal College,
                    took the degree of M.A. at sixteen years of age, and was destined for one of the
                    learned professions. Showing a turn for design instead, he studied in the school
                    of the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, then as a probationer (not a full
                    student) in the Royal Academy of London, and thence, in 1825, proceeded to Rome,
                    w here he spent nine months. He returned to Aberdeen in 1826, and painted
                    several pictures; one of these, Bacchus nursed by the Nymphs of Nysa, was
                    exhibited in 1827. In the autumn of that year he went back to Italy, showdng
                    from the first a strong sympathy with the earlier masters of the Florentine and
                    allied schools. A Virgin and Child which he painted in Rome in 1828 was much
                    noticed by Overbeck and other foreign artists. In 1829 Dyce settled in <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0591-0570"/> Edinburgh, taking at once a good rank in his
                    profession, and showing considerable versatility in subject-matter.
                    Portrait-painting for some years occupied much of his time; and he was
                    particularly prized for likenesses of ladies and children. In February 1837 he
                    was appointed master of the school of design of the Board of Manufactures,
                    Edinburgh. In the same year he published a pamphlet on the management of schools
                    of this description, which led to his transfer from Edinburgh, after eighteen
                    months’ service there, to London, as superintendent and secretary of the then
                    recently established school of design at Somerset House. Mr J. R. Herbert was
                    head-master about the same time. Dyce was sent by the Board of Trade to the
                    Continent to examine the organization of foreign schools; and a report which he
                    eventually printed, 1840, led to a remodelling of the London establishment. In
                    1842 he was made a member of the council and inspector of provincial schools, a
                    post which he resigned in 1844. In this latter year, being appointed professor
                    of fine art in King’s College, London, he delivered a noticeable lecture, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Theory of the Pine Arts.</hi> In 1835 he had been elected an
                    associate of the Royal Scottish Academy; this honour he relinquished upon
                    settling in London, and he was then made an honorary R.S.A. In 1844 he became an
                    associate, in 1848 a full member, of the London Royal Academy; he also was
                    elected a member of the Academy of Arts in Philadelphia. He was active in the
                    deliberations of the Royal Academy, and it is said that his tongue was the dread
                    of the urbane President, Sir Charles Eastlake, for Dyce was keen in speech as in
                    visage; it was on his proposal that the class of retired Academicians was
                    established. In January 1850 Dyce married Jane, daughter of Mr James Brand, of
                    Bedford Hill, Surrey. He died of a cancerous disease in his house at Streatham
                    on 14th February 1864, leaving two sons and two daughters.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief outline of the honourable and prosperous career of one of the
                    most learned and accomplished of British painters—one of the highest in aim, and
                    most consistently self-respecting in workmanship. His finest productions, the
                    frescoes in the Queen’s Robing-room in the Houses of Parliament, may rightly be
                    called great, and an honour to the country and time which produced them; these
                    frescoes, and the water-glass paintings of Maclise in the same building, would
                    find few rivals in contemporary Continental labours. Generally, however, there
                    is in Dyce’s work more of earnestness, right conception, and grave, sensitive,
                    but rather restricted powers of realization, than of authentic greatness. He has
                    elevation, draughtsmanship, expression, and on occasion fine colour; along with
                    all these, a certain leaning on precedent, and castigated semiconventionalized
                    type of form and treatment, which bespeak rather the scholarly than the
                    originating mind in art. The following are among his principal or most
                    interesting works (oil pictures, unless otherwise stated). 1829: The Daughters
                    of Jethro defended by Moses; Puck. 1830: The Golden Age; the Infant Hercules
                    strangling the Serpents (now in the National Gallery, Edinburgh); Christ crowned
                    with Thoms. 1835: A Dead Christ (large lunette altar-piece). 1836: The Descent
                    of Venus, from Ben Jonson’s “Triumph of Love;” The Judgment of Solomon, prize
                    cartoon in tempera for tapestry (National Gallery, Edinburgh). 1837: Francesca
                    da Rimini (National Gallery, Edinburgh). 1838, and again 1846: The Madonna and
                    Child. 1839: Dunstan separating Edwy and Elgiva. 1844: Joash shooting the Arrow
                    of Deliverance (the finest perhaps of the oil-paintings). 1850: The Meeting of
                    Jacob and Rachel. 1851: King Lear and the Fool in the Storm. 1855: Christabel.
                    1857: Titian’s first Essay in Colouring. 1859: The Good Shepherd. 1860: St John
                    bringing Home his Adopted Mother; Pegwell Bay (a coast scene of remarkably
                    minute detail, showing the painter’s partial adhesion to the so-called
                    “pre-Raphaelite” movement of that time). 1861: George Herbert at Bemerton. Dyce
                    executed some excellent cartoons for stained glass :—that for the choristers’
                    window, Ely Cathedral, and that for a vast window at Alnwick in memory of a duke
                    of Northumberland; the design of Paul rejected by the Jews, now at South
                    Keningston, belongs to the latter. In fresco-painting his first work appears to
                    have been the Consecration of Archbishop Parker, painted in Lambeth Palace. In
                    one of the Westminster Hall competitions for the decoration of the Houses of
                    Parliament, he displayed two heads from this composition; and it is related that
                    the great German fresco-painter Cornelius, who had come over to England to give
                    advice, with a prospect of himself taking the chief direction of the pictorial
                    scheme, told the Prince Consort frankly that the English ought not to be asking
                    for him, when they had such a painter of their own as Mr Dyce. The cartoon by
                    Dyce of the Baptism of Ethelbert was approved and commissioned for the House of
                    Lords, and is the first of the works done there, 1846, in fresco. In 1848 he
                    began his great frescos in the Robing-room—subjects from the legend of King
                    Arthur, exhibiting chivalric virtue. The whole room was to have been finished in
                    eight years; but ill-health and other vexations trammelled the artist, and the
                    series remains uncompleted. The largest picture figures Hospitality, the
                    admission of Sir Tristram into the fellowship of the Round Table. Then
                    follow—Religion, the Vision of Sir Galahad and his Companions; Generosity,
                    Arthur unhorsed, and spared by the Victor; Courtesy, Sir Tristram harping to la
                    Belle Yseult; Mercy, Sir Gawaine’s Vow. The frescos of sacred subjects in All
                    Saints’ Church, Margaret Street, London; of Cornus, in the summer-house of
                    Buckingham Palace; and of Neptune and Britannia, at Osborne House, are also by
                    this painter.</p>
                <p>Dyce was an elegant scholar in more ways than one. In 1828 he obtained the
                    Blackwell prize at Aberdeen for an essay on animal magnetism. In 1843-4 he
                    published an edition of the Book of Common Prayer, with a dissertation on
                    Gregorian music, and its adaptation to English words. He founded the Motett
                    Society, for revival of ancient church-music, was a fine organist, and composed
                    a “non nobis” which has appropriately been sung at Royal Academy banquets. His
                    last considerable writing relating to his own art was published in 1853, <hi
