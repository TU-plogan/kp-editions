                    situated between 28° 13' and 29° 13' N. lat. and 76° 53' and 77* 34" E. long. It
                    consists of a strip of territory on the right or west bank of the River Jumna,
                    75 miles in length, and varying from 15 to 23 miles in breadth, bounded on the
                    N. by the district of Karnál, on the E. by the Jumna river separating it from
                    Meerut (Mirat) and Bulandshahr districts, on the S. by Rohtak, and on the W. by
                    Gurgáon. With the exception of a low-lying alluvial tract in the north, and a
                    narrow fringe of fertile soil along the river bank to the south of Delhi city,
                    the country consists of stony or hard sandy soil, where cultivation mainly
                    depends upon artificial irrigation. This is supplied by the Western Jumna canal,
                    which has a course of 51 miles in the district; by the Ali Murdán canal,
                    constructed by a celebrated Persian nobleman of that name; by the new Agra
                    canal; <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0057-0046"/> and by the Jumna river, and a few hill streams.
                    An offshoot of the Mewát hills runs in a north-easterly direction nearly across
                    the district. This offshoot forms a sterile, rocky table-land, from two to three
                    miles in breadth, but nowhere exceeding 500 feet above the level of the
                    surrounding country.</p>
                <p>The district population, according to a census taken in 1868, numbered 608,850
                    souls, scattered over an area of 1227 square miles, showing a density per square
                    mile of 496 persons. According to their religious beliefs the inhabitants are
                    thus classified :—Hindus, 438,886, or 72O8 per cent.; Mahometans, 130,645, or
                    21*46 per cent.; Sikhs, 580, or *09 per cent.; others, 38,739, or 6*36 per cent.
                    Four towns contain a population exceeding 5000,—viz., Delhi city, population
                    154,417; Sonipát, 12,176; Faridá-bád, 7990; and Balabgarh, 6281.</p>
                <p>The principal agricultural products of the district are wheat, barley,
                    sugar-cane, and cotton. In the lands of the northern part, commanded by the
                    irrigation canals, cotton and sugar-cane are the most lucrative staples of the
                    autumn harvest, while <hi rend="italic">joár</hi> (great millet), <hi
                    rend="italic">bájrti</hi> (spiked millet), and <hi rend="italic">makái</hi>
                    (Indian corn) are grown for local consumption. The spring crops consist of the
                    better kinds of grain, such as wheat and barley, and of gram and tobacco. In
                    some irrigated villages a superior kind of rice is grown, but it nowhere forms a
                    staple product. Cotton cultivation is extending, and a ready market for the
                    fibre exists in Delhi city. The total area of the district is returned at
                    814,672 acres, of which 525,255 are cultivated, viz., 206,853 irrigated and
                    318,402 unirrigated. A tract of 1147 acres, set apart by the native rulers as a
                    hunting ground, is now inclosed by Government as a timber preserve; and other
                    plantations along the banks of the river have recently been formed and placed
                    under the Forest Department. The hills produce good building stone, and a fair
                    kind of marble of two colours, black and grey. A white clay, supposed to be
                    kaolin, is found at Arangpur, Murádpur, and Kasmpur, and has been employed with
                    success at the Government foundry at Rurkí for making crucibles. At the first
                    named village is a crystal mine, no longer worked. The East India Railway and
                    the Punjab Railway run trains into Delhi from their junction at Ghaziábád, about
                    twelve miles distant, while the Rájputáná State Railway traverses the district
                    for about twelve miles in the direction of Gurgáon. The Government revenue of
                    Delhi district in 1872-76 amounted to £383,082,—of which £89,036 was derived
                    from the land, £264,909 from salt and custom duties, and £14,086 lrom stamps.
                    The land settlement is not a permanent one, but for a term of years. For the
                    education of the people Government in 1872-73 maintained in whole or in part 72
                    schools, attended by 3645 pupils, at an outlay to the state of £7760. There were
                    also 32 unaided indigenous schools, attended by 529 pupils in 1872-73. Three
                    Government dispensaries gave gratuitous relief to 18,303 patients, at a cost of
                    £925, 8s. (1872-73). For administrative purposes, the district is subdivided
                    into three <hi rend="italic">talιAls</hi> of Delhi, Larsauli, and Balabgarh. The
                    staff consists of a deputy commissioner, with two assistants and two extra
                    assistant commissioners, a judge of the small cause court, 3 <hi rend="italic"
                    >tahsildárs</hi> and 3 <hi rend="italic">naib</hi> or assistant <hi
                    rend="italic">tahsildárs,</hi> a superintendent and an assistant superintendent
                    of police, and a civil surgeon.</p>
                <p>The early history of the district will be found noticed below. In the last
                    century, the Delhi empire fell under the Marhattás, and the emperor Sháh Alam
                    became a pensioner of the Mahárájá Sindhia. In 1803 Lord Lake broke the Marhattá
                    power. The Mughul emperor was taken under the protection of the Company, and a
                    considerable tract of country, consisting of nearly all the present districts of
                    Delhi and Hissar, was assigned for the maintenance of the royal family. This
                    tract was placed under charge of a British officer as Resident, and the revenue
                    was collected and justice administered in the name of the emperor. The annual
                    allowance to the royal family paid from this assigned territory was originally
                    £100,000; it was afterwards increased to £120,000, and subsequently to £150,000,
                    exclusive of certain crown lands which yielded about £15,000 a year. The emperor
                    received the homage of royalty; and throughout the assigned territory all
                    judicial decrees were pronounced in his name, and sentences of death were
                    referred to him for approval. The fiscal arrangements were under the entire
                    control of the resident. This continued till 1832, when the office of resident
                    was abolished, the tract being annexed to the North-Western Provinces,and a
                    British Commissioner appointed to administer it. On the outbreak of the sepoy
                    mutiny in 1857, the whole of the district was for a time lost to British rule,
                    and the southern part was not subdued until after the fall of Delhi city in
                    September 1857. In 1858 Delhi district was separated from the North-Western
                    Provinces, and annexed to the then newly constituted lieutenant-governorship of
                    the Punjab.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Delhi,</hi> the chief city of the district and division of
                    the same name, and the capital of the Mughu] empire, is situated in 28° 39' 40"
                    N. lat. and 77° 17' 45" E. long. It abuts on the right bank of the River Jumna,
                    and is inclosed on three sides by a lofty wall of solid stone constructed by the
                    Emperor Sháh Jahán, and subsequently strengthened by the English at the
                    beginning of the present century by a ditch and <hi rend="italic">glacis.</hi>
                    The eastern side, where the city extends to the river bank, has no wall; but the
                    high bank is faced with masonry, and bears from the outside the appearance of
                    one. The circuit of the wall is 5∣ miles. It has ten gates, of which the
                    principal are the Kashmir and Mori gates on the north; the Cabul and Lahore
                    gates on the west; and the Ajmír and Delhi gates on the west-The imperial
                    palace, now known as “the fort,” is situated in the east of the city, and abuts
                    directly on the river. It is surrounded on three sides by an imposing wall of
                    red granite, with small round towers, and a gateway on the west and south. Since
                    the mutiny of 1857 a great portion of the palace has been demolished in order to
                    make room for English barracks. The more beautiful buildings in the palace,
                    viz., the entrance hall, the <hi rend="italic">naubát kháná</hi> or music hall,
                    the <hi rend="italic">diwân-i-ám</hi> or hall of public audience, the <hi
                    rend="italic">diiván-i-kliás</hi> or hall of private audience, the <hi
                    rend="italic">rang mahal,</hi> and some pavilions, have been preserved intact.
                    As Mr Fergusson well says, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Architecture,</hi> however, these buildings “without the courts and corridors
                    connecting them lose all their meaning, and more than half their beauty.” South
                    of the fort, in the Dariáganj quarter of the city, is a cantonment for a
                    regiment of native infantry, which, with one wing of a European regiment
                    stationed within the fort, makes up the garrison usually stationed at Delhi. On
                    the opposite side of the river is the fortress of Salímgarh, erected in the 16th
                    century by Salim Sháb, and now in ruins. At this point the East India Railway
                    enters the city by a magnificent bridge across the Jumna, passing over
                    Salímghar, and through a corner of the fort, to the railway station within the
                    city walls. Thence the line proceeds as the Rájputáná State Railway, and, after
                    traversing the city, emerges through the wall on the northwest. In the
                    north-eastern corner of the city, within the walls, and close to the Kashmir
                    gate, are situated the treasury and other public offices. Dariáganj, the fort,
                    the public offices, and the railway form an almost continuous line along the
                    eastern and northern faces of the city,—the angle between them being devoted to
                    public gardens. The area thus occupied amounts to nearly half of that of the
                    entire city; it presents a comparatively open appearance<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0058-0047"/>, and forms a marked contrast to the south-west
                    quarter of the town, which is densely occupied by the shops and dwellings of the
                    native population.</p>
                <p>The buildings in the native town are chiefly of brick, well-built and
                    substantial. The smaller streets are narrow and tortuous, and in many cases end
                    in <hi rend="italic">culs de sac.</hi> On the other hand, no city in India has
                    finer streets than the main thoroughfares of Delhi, ten in number, thoroughly
                    drained, metalled, and lighted. The principal thoroughfare, the Chándni Chauk,
                    or Street of Silver, leads eastwards from the fort to the Lahore gate, and is
                    three-quarters of a mile long by 74 feet broad. Throughout the greater part of
                    its length, a double row of <hi rend="italic">ním</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pipâl</hi> trees runs down its centre on both sides of a raised path, which has
                    taken the place of the masonry aqueduct that in former days conducted water from
                    the canal into the palace. A little to the south of the Chándni Chauk is the
                    Jámá Masjid, or great mosque, standing out boldly from a small rocky rising
                    ground. Begun by Sháh Jahán in the fourth year of his reign, and completed in
                    the tenth, it still remains one of the finest buildings of its kind in India.
                    Its front court-yard, 450 feet square, and surrounded by a cloister open on both
                    sides, is paved with granite inlaid with marble, and commands a view of the
                    whole city. The mosque itself, a splendid structure forming an oblong 261 feet
                    in length, is approached by a magnificent flight of stone steps. Three domes of
                    white marble rise from its roof, with two tall and graceful minarets at the
                    corners in front. The interior of the mosque is paved throughout with white
                    marble, and the walls and roof are lined with the same material. Two other
                    mosques in Delhi deserve a passing notice,—the Kálá Masjid, or black mosque, so
                    called from the dark colour given to it by time, and supposed to have been built
                    by one of the early Afghan sovereigns, and the mosque of Roshán-ud-daulá. Among
                    the more modern buildings of Delhi may be mentioned the Government College,
                    founded in 1792, the Residency, and the Protestant church, built at a cost
                    £10,000, by Colonel Skinner, an officer well-known in the history of the East
                    India Company. About half-way down the Chándni Chauk is a high clock-tower, with
                    the institute and museum opposite. Behind the Chándni Chauk, to the north, lie
                    the Queen’s Gardens; beyond them the “city lines” stretch away as far as the
                    well-known rocky ridge, about a mile outside the town. From the summit of this
                    ridge the view of the station and city is very picturesque. To the west and
                    north-west, considerable suburbs cluster beyond the walls, containing the tombs
                    of the imperial family. That of Humáyun, the second of the Mughul dynasty, is a
                    noble building of granite inlaid with marble. It lies about two miles from the
                    city, amid a large garden of terraces and fountains, the whole surrounded by an
                    embattled wall, with towers and four gateways. In the centre stands a platform
                    about 20 feet high by 200 feet square, supported by cloisters, and ascended by
                    four great flights of granite steps. Above, rises the Mausoleum, also a square,
                    with a great dome of white marble in the centre. About a mile to the westward is
                    another burying-ground, or collection of tombs and small mosques, some of them
                    very beautiful. The most remarkable is perhaps the little chapel in honour of a
                    celebrated Mussulman saint, Nizám-ud-dín, near whose shrine the members of the
                    late imperial family, up to the time of the mutiny, lie buried, each in his own
                    little inclosure, surrounded by very elegant lattice-work of white marble. The
                    Kutab Minár, or Pillar, is situated about nine miles south of the city.</p>
                <p>The palaces of the nobles, which formerly gave an air of grandeur to the city,
                    have for the most part disappeared. Their sites are occupied by structures of
                    less pretension, but still of some elegance of architectural design. The city is
                    now amply supplied with water; and much attention has of late been paid to its
                    cleanliness and its sanitary condition generally. The principal local
                    institution was, until 1877, the Delhi College, founded in 1792. It was at first
                    exclusively an Oriental school, supported by the voluntary contributions of
                    Mahometan gentlemen, and managed by a committee of the subscribers. In 1829 an
                    English department was added to it; and in 1855 the institution was placed under
                    the control of the Educational Department. In the mutiny of 1857 the old college
                    was plundered of a very valuable Oriental library, and the building completely
                    destroyed. A new college was founded in 1858, and was affiliated to the
                    university of Calcutta in 1864. The old college attained to great celebrity as
                    an educational institution, and produced many excellent scholars. Under orders
                    of the Government of the Punjab (February 1877), the collegiate staff of
                    teachers was to be withdrawn, in order to concentrate the grant available for
                    higher-class education upon the central and more useful institution at Lahore,
                    the present capital of the province.</p>
                <p>The population of Delhi in 1853 was returned at 152,424, viz., 76,390 Hindus and
                    76,034 Mahometans. In 1868, the census showed that since the Mutiny the
                    Mahometan population had greatly diminished, while on the other hand the Hindus
                    had considerably increased. In that year, the population was ascertained to be
                    made up as follows :—Hindus, 85,087 (males 46,541 and females 38,546);
                    Mahometans, 61,720 (males 32,361 and females 29,359); Sikhs, 357 'males 267 and
                    females 90); other denominations, 7253 (males 4177 and females 3076): total of
                    all religions, 154,417 (males 83,346 and females 71,071). The Delhi
                    municipality, which also embraces the suburbs, contains a population of 184,840.
                    The total income (mainly derived from octroi duties) in 1871-72 amounted to
                    £25,610, or an average of 2s. 9|d. per head.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> From the earliest period of Indian history,
                    Delhi or its immediate neighbourhood has been the site of a capital city. Within
                    the circuit of a very few miles from modern Delhi, city after city has risen
                    upon the ruins of its predecessors, and the debris of ancient buildings is now
                    estimated to cover an area of 45 square miles. The first of these fallen
                    capitals, Indraprástha, is supposed to date from the 15th century B.C., when the
                    Aryan colonists of India were beginning to feel their way down the Jumna. The
                    Sanskrit epic, the <hi rend="italic">Mahábhárata,</hi> relates how the city was
                    founded by Yudhisthira and his brothers, the five Pándavas. It lay upon the
                    banks of the Jumna, near Humáyun’s tomb, about two miles south of the modern
                    city; and the Migambod <hi rend="italic">gliát,</hi> near the old Calcutta gate
                    of Delhi, is believed to be its one surviving relic. A list of monarchs brings
                    the history of Indraprástha down to the middle of the 1st century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when the name of Dilli, or Delhi, is first met with.
                    By this time the city had spread or been removed some miles to the south, as far
                    as the site now occupied by the Kutab Minár. Another blank of several centuries
                    occurs until the 3d or 4th century A.D. To this latter period belongs the carved
                    iron pillar near Delhi, one of the most curious monuments in India. It consists
                    of a solid shaft of wrought iron, upwards of 16 inches in diameter, and more
                    than 50 feet in length, of which 22 feet are above ground. The pillar bears a
                    Sanskrit inscription in six lines, recording the history of oneRájá Dháva, who
                    “obtained by his own arm an undivided sovereignty on the earth for a long
                    period.” Delhi nextmakes itsappear-ance in history at the time of the foundation
                    of the Tomára or Tuár dynasty by Anang Pal in 736 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    This ruler is said to have restored the city, and during his dynasty the capital
                    alternated between Delhi and Kanauj. About 1151 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    the Tomára dynasty was overthrown by Visala Deva, the Chohan king of Ajmír, but
                    a marriage of the daughter of the vanquished monarch to the son of the conqueror
                    united the two families. The son of this union, the famous <pb break="no"

                    In 1191 came the invasion of Muhammad of Ghor. Defeated on this occasion,
                    Muhammad returned two years later, overthrew the Hindus, and captured and put to
                    death Prithivi Rája. Delhi became henceforth the capital of the Mahometan Indian
                    empire, Kutab-ud-dín (the general and slave of Muhammad of Ghor) being left in
                    command. His dynasty is known as that of the slave kings, and it is to them that
                    old Delhi owes its grandest remains, among them Kutab-ud-dffi’s mosque and
                    pillar, a few miles south of the modern city. The slave dynasty retained the
                    throne till 1288, when it was subverted by Jalál-ud-dín Ghilzái. The most
                    remarkable monarch of this dynasty was Ala-ud-dín, during whose reign Delhi was
                    twice exposed to attack from invading hordes of Mughuls. On the first occasion,
                    Ala-ud-dín defeated them under the walls of his capital; on the second, after
                    encamping for two months in the neighbourhood of the city, they retired without
                    a battle. The house of Ghilzái came to an end in 1321, and was followed by that
                    of Taghlak. Hitherto the Pathán kings had been content with the ancient Hindu
                    capital, altered and adorned to suit their tastes. But one of the first acts of
                    the founder of the new dynasty, Ghiás-ud-dín Taghlak, was to erect a new capital
                    about four miles further to the east, which he called Taghlakábád. The ruins of
                    his fort remain, and the eye can still trace the streets and lanes of the long
                    deserted city. Ghiás-ud-dín was succeeded by his son Muhammad Taghlak, who
                    reigned from 1325 to 1351, and is described by Elphinstone as “one of the most
                    accomplished princes and most furious tyrants that ever adorned or disgraced
                    human nature.” Under this monarch the Delhi of the Taghlak dynasty attained its
                    utmost growth. His successor Firoz Sháh Taghlak transferred the capital to a new
                    town which he founded some miles off, on the north of the Kutab, and to which he
                    gave his own name, Firozábád. In 1398, during the reign of Mahmud Taghlak,
                    occurred the Tartar invasion of Timurlane. The king fled to Guzerat, his army
                    was defeated under the walls of Delhi, and the city surrendered. The town,
                    notwithstanding a promise of protection, was plundered and burned; the citizens
                    were massacred. The invaders at last retired, leaving Delhi without a
                    Government, and almost without inhabitants. At length Mahmud Taghlak regained a
                    fragment of his former kingdom, but on his death in 1412 the family became
                    extinct. He was succeeded by the Sáyyid dynasty, which held Delhi and a a few
                    miles of surrounding territory till 1444, when it gave way to the house of Lodi,
                    during whose rule the capital was removed to Agra. In 1526 Baber, sixth in
                    descent from Timurlane, invaded India, defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi at the
                    battle of Pánipat, entered Delhi, was proclaimed emperor, and finally put an end
                    to the Afghan empire. Baber’s capital was at Agra, but his son and successor,
                    Humáyun, removed it to Delhi. In 1540 Humáyun was defeated and expelled by Sher
                    Sháh, who entirely rebuilt the city, inclosing and fortifying it with a new
                    wall. In his time Delhi extended from where Humáyun’s tomb now is to near the
                    southern gate of the modern city. In 1555 Humáyun, with the assistance of
                    Persia, regained the throne; but he died within six months afterwards, and was
                    succeeded by his son, the illustrious Akbár.</p>
                <p>During Akbár’s reign and that of his son Jahángír, the capital was either at Agra
                    or at Lahore, and Delhi once more fell into decay. Between 1638 and 1658,
                    however, Sháh Jahán rebuilt it almost in its present form; and his city remains
                    substantially the Delhi of the present time. The imperial palace, the Jámá
                    Masjid or great mosque, and the restoration of what is now the western Jumna
                    canal, are the work of Sháh Jahán. The Mughul empire rapidly expanded during the
                    reigns of Akbár and his successors down to Aurungzebe, when it attained its
                    climax. After the death of the latter monarch, in 1707, came the decline.
                    Insurrections and civil wars on the part of the Hindu tributary chiefs, Sikhs
                    and Marhattás, broke out. Aurungzebe’s successors became the helpless
                    instruments of conflicting chiefs. His grandson, Jahándar Sháh was, in 1713,
                    deposed and strangled after a reign of one year; and Farrakhsiyyar, the next in
                    succession, met with the same fate in 1719. He was succeeded by Muhammad Sháh,
                    in whose reign the Marhattá forces first made their appearance before the gates
                    of Delhi, in 1736. Three years later the Persian monarch, Nádir Sháh, after
                    defeating the Mughul army at Karnál, entered Delhi in triumph. While engaged in
                    levying a heavy contribution, the Persian troops were attacked by the populace,
                    and many of them were killed. Nádir Sháh, after vainly attempting to stay the
                    tumult, at last gave orders for a general massacre of the inhabitants. For
                    fifty-eight days Nádir Sháh remained in Delhi, and when he left he carried with
                    him a treasure in money amounting, at the lowest computation, to eight or nine
                    millions sterling, besides jewels of inestimable value, and other property to
                    the amount of several millions more.</p>
                <p>From this time (1740) the decline of the empire proceeded unchecked and with
                    increased rapidity. In 1771 Sháh Alam, the son of Alamgir IL, was nominally
                    raised to the throne by the Marhattás, the real sovereignty resting with the
                    Marhattá chief, Sindhia. An attempt of the puppet emperor to shake himself clear
                    of the Marhattás, in which he was defeated in 1788, led to a permanent Marhattá
                    garrison being stationed at Delhi. From this date, the king remained a cipher in
                    the hands of Sindhia, who treated him with studied neglect, until the 8th
                    September 1803, when Lord Lake overthrew the Marhattás under the walls of Delhi,
                    entered the city, and took the king under the protection of the British. Delhi,
                    once more attacked by a Marhattá army under the Marhattá chief Holkar in 1804,
                    was gallantly defended by Colonel Ochterlony, the British resident, who held but
                    against overwhelming' odds for eight days, until relieved by Lord Lake. From
                    this date a new era in the history of Delhi began. A pension of £120,000 per
                    annum was allowed to the king, with exclusive jurisdiction over the palace, and
                    the titular sovereignty as before; but the city, together with the Delhi
                    territory, passed under British administration.</p>
                <p>Fifty-three years of quiet prosperity for Delhi were brought to a close by the
                    mutiny of 1857. Its capture by the mutineers, its siege, and its subsequent
                    recapture by the British have been often told, and nothing beyond a short notice
                    is called for here. The outbreak at Meerut occurred on the night of the 10th May
                    1857. Immediately after the murder of their officers, the rebel soldiery set out
                    for Delhi about 35 miles distant, and on the following morning entered the city,
                    where they were joined by the city mob. Mr Fraser, the commissioner, Mr
                    Hutchinson, the collector, Captain Douglas, the commandant of the palace guards,
                    and the Rev. Mr Jennings, the residency chaplain, were at once murdered, as were
                    also most of the civil and non-official residents whose houses were situated
                    within the city walls. The British troops in cantonments consisted of three
                    regiments of native infantry and a battery of artillery. These cast in their lot
                    with the mutineers, and commenced by killing their officers. The Delhi magazine,
                    then the largest in the north-west of India, was in the charge of Lieutenant
                    Willoughby, with whom were two other officers and six non-commissiohed officers.
                    The magazine was attacked by the mutineers, but the little band defended to the
                    last the enormous accumulation of munitions of war stored there, and, when
                    further defence was hopeless, fired the magazine Five of the nine were killed by
                    the explosion, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0060-0049"/> Lieutenant Willoughby subsequently died of his
                    injuries; the remaining three succeeded in making their escape. The occupation
                    of Delhi by the rebels was the signal for risings in almost every military
                    station in North-Western India. The revolted soldiery with one accord thronged
                    towards Delhi, and in a short time the city was garrisoned by a rebel army
                    variously estimated at from 50,000 to 70,000 disciplined men. The pensioned
                    king, Bahádur Sháh, was proclaimed emperor; his sons were appointed to various
                    military commands. About fifty Europeans and Eurasians, nearly all females, who
                    had been captured in trying to escape from the town on the day of the outbreak,
                    were confined in a stifling chamber of the palace for fifteen days; they were
                    then brought out and massacred in the court-yard.</p>
                <p>The siege which followed forms one of the memorable incidents of the British
                    history of India. On the 8th June, four weeks after the outbreak, Sir II.
                    Barnard, who had succeeded as commander-in-chief on the death of General Anson,
                    routed the mutineers with a handful of Europeans and Sikhs, after a severe
                    action at Badli-ka-Sârái, and encamped upon the ridge that overlooks the city.
                    The force was too weak to capture the city, and he had no siege train or heavy
                    guns. All that could be done was to hold the position till the arrival of
                    reinforcements and of a siege train. During the next three months the little
                    British force on the ridge were rather the besieged than the besiegers. Almost
                    daily sallies, which often turned into pitched battles, were made by the rebels
                    upon the over-worked handful of Europeans, Sikhs, and Gurkhás. A great struggle
                    took place on the centenary of the battle of Plassey, June 23, and another on
                    the 25th August; but on both occasions the mutineers were repulsed with heavy
                    loss. General Barnard died of cholera in July, and was succeeded by General
                    Archdale Wilson. Meanwhile reinforcements and siege artillery gradually arrived,
                    and early in September it was resolved to make the assault. The first of the
                    heavy batteries opened fire on the 8th September, and on the 13th a practicable
                    breach was reported. On the morning of the 14th the assault was delivered, the
                    points of attack being the Kashmir bastion, the water bastion, the Kashmir gate,
                    and the Lahore gate. The assault was thoroughly successful, although the column
                    which was to enter the city by the Lahore gate sustained a temporary check. The
                    whole eastern part of the city was retaken, but at a loss of 66 officers and
                    1104 men killed or wounded, out oi the total strength of 9866. Fighting
                    continued more or less during the next six days, and it was not till the 20th
                    September that the entire city and palace were occupied, and the reconquest of
                    Delhi was complete. During the siege, the British force sustained a loss of 1012
                    officers and men killed, and 3837 wounded. Among the killed was General John
                    Nicholson, the leader of one of the storming parties, who was shot through the
                    body in the act of leading his men, in the first day’s fighting. He lived,
                    however, to learn that the whole city had been recaptured, and died on the 23d
                    September. On the flight of the mutineers, the king and several members of the
                    royal family took refuge at Humáyun’s tomb. On receiving a promise that his life
                    would be spared, the last of the house of Timur surrendered to Major Hodson; he
                    was afterwards banished to Rangoon. Delhi, thus reconquered, remained for some
                    months under military authority. Owing to the murder of several European
                    soldiers wſho strayed from the lines, the native population was expelled the
                    city. Hindus were soon afterwards re-admitted, but for some time Mahometans were
                    rigorously excluded. Delhi was made over to the civil authorities in January
                    1858, but it was not till 1861 that the civil courts were regularly reopened.
                    The shattered walls of the Kashmir gateway, and the bastions of the northern
                    face of the city, still bear the marks of the cannonade of September 1857. Since
                    that date, Delhi has settled down into å prosperous commercial town, and a great
                    railway centre. The lines which start from it to the north, south, east, and
                    west bring into its bazaars the trade of many districts. But the romance of
                    antiquity still lingers around it, and Delhi was selected for the scene of the
                    Imperial Proclamation on the 1st January 1877.</p>
