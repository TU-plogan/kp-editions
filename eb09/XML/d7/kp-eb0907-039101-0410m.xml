                <p><label type="entry">DRAMA</label><hi>DRAMA</hi> (from δp&lt;iω) signifies action.
                    The term is applied to compositions which imitate action by representing the
                    personages introduced in them as real and as employed in the action itself. The
                    varieties of the drama differ more or less widely, both as to the objects
                    imitated and as to the means used in the imitation. But they all agree as to the
                    <hi rend="italic">method</hi> or <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> which is
                    essential to the dramatic art, viz., <hi rend="italic">imitation in the way of
                    action.</hi></p>
                <p>The desire to give expression to feelings and conceptions is inseparable from
                    human nature. Man expresses his thoughts and emotions by gesture and by speech,
                    or by a combination of both; and. these expressions he soon learns in the
                    society of other men—and more especially on joyous or solemn occasions—to vary
                    or regulate in dance and song. Another way of expression, often combined with
                    the other, is imitation. To imitate, says Aristotle, is instinctive in man from
                    his infancy; and from imitation all men naturally receive pleasure. Gesture and
                    voice are means of imitation common to all human beings; and the aid of some
                    sort of dress and decoration is generally within the reach of children, and of
                    the childhood of nations. The assumption of character, whether real or
                    fictitious, is therefore the earliest step towards the drama. But it is only a
                    preliminary step; nor is the drama itself reached till the imitation extends to
                    action.</p>
                <p>Action, which man is not wont to attribute (except figuratively) to any but
                    members of his own species and to the superior Being or beings in whose
                    existence and power he believes, implies an operation of the will and an
                    execution of its resolution, whether or not amounting to a fulfilment of its
                    purpose. It implies a procedure from cause to result. Action must therefore
                    present itself to the human mind as having its source in a human or superhuman
                    will. Every imitation of action by action is in germ a drama. But to this point
                    not all nations have advanced.</p>
                <p>After this step has been taken, it only remains for the drama to assume a form
                    regulated by literature, of which art it thus becomes a branch. We may then
                    speak of a dramatic literature; but this only a limited number of nations has
                    come to possess. A nation may, however, have a drama without a dramatic
                    literature; it may even continue in possession of the former after having ceased
                    to cultivate the latter. On the other hand, both before and after the drama of a
                    nation has assumed a literary.form, it may allow one or more of its adventitious
                    elements—music, dancing, decoration—predominantly to assert themselves, and thus
                    eventually to bring about the formation of new, or the revival of disused,
                    dramatic species. But as a branch of literature the drama necessarily includes
                    speech among its means of imitation; and its beginnings as such are accordingly,
                    in the history of all literatures known to us, preceded by the beginnings at
                    least of other forms of poetic composition, the lyric and the epic, or by those
                    of one of these forms at all events. It is in the combination of both that the
                    drama in its literary form takes its origin in the case of all national
                    civilizations in which it has found a place and with which we are more than
                    superficially acquainted.</p>
                <p>The art of acting is the indispensable adjunct of the dramatic art, while the aid
                    of all other arts is merely an accident. But though really inseparable from one
                    another, the courses of the dramatic and the histrionic arts do not at all times
                    run parallel. The actor is only the temporary interpreter of the dramatist,
                    though he may occasionally be left to supply some of the proper functions of his
                    textgiver. On his side, the dramatist may in practice, though he cannot in
                    theory, dispense with the actor’s interpretation; but though the term literary
                    drama is sometimes used of works kept apart from the stage, it is in truth a
                    misnomer, since, properly speaking, no drama is such till it is acted.</p>
                <p>The whole body of the laws and rules of the drama, could it be written down with
                    completeness, would indicate, together with the ends proper to the art, the
                    means by which it is able to accomplish them. But neither the great authorities
                    of dramatic theory—an Aristotle or a Lessing—nor the resolute apologists of more
                    or less transitory fashions—a Corneille or a Dryden—have exhausted the
                    exposition of the means which the drama has proved or may prove capable of
                    employing. The multitude of technical terms and formulae which has gathered
                    round the practice of the art has at no time seriously interfered with the
                    operation of creative power, whose inventive activity the existence of, accepted
                    systems has frequently—in the Greek drama, for instance, and in the
                    Spanish—served to stimulate. On the other hand, it is self-evident that no
                    dramaturgic theory has ever given rise to a single dramatic work of enduring
                    value, unless the creative force was there to animate the form.</p>
                <p>The task of this creative force begins with the beginnings of the dramatist’s
                    labours. For it is in the dramatic <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> that the germ of
                    the action of a play lies—not in the <hi rend="italic">subject,</hi> which is
                    merely its dead material. The story of the Scottish thane as it stood written in
                    the chronicle, is the subject, not the action, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macbeth.</hi> To convert a subject—whatever its kind or source—into the action
                    or fable of a play is the primary task, which in its progressive development
                    becomes the entire task, of the dramatist; and though the conception may expand
                    or modify itself with the execution, yet upon the former the latter depends. The
                    range of subjects open to a dramatist may be wide as the world itself, or it may
                    be limited by usage, by imperious fashion, by the tastes and tendencies of a
                    nation or an age, by the author’s own range of sympathies, by a thousand
                    restrictions of an historical, moral, or aesthetical origin; it may be virtually
                    confined (as with the earlier Greek tragedians) to a body of legend, or (as with
                    the English comedians of the Restoration) to the social experiences of a
                    particular epoch. But in all cases the transformation of the subject into the
                    action is equally indispensable; and an imperfect transformation is (as in the
                    old Chronicle Histories) the work of a rude, or (as in ninety-nine out of a
                    hundred modern plays “founded upon fact ”) that of a careless method of dramatic
                    production.</p>
                <p>What, then, are the laws which determine the nature of all actions properly such,
                    however they may vary either in subjects or in form? In the first place, a
                    dramatic action must possess <hi rend="italic">unity—</hi> and this requirement
                    at once distinguishes it from the subject which has suggested its idea. The
                    events of real life, the facts of history, the incidents of narrative fiction,
                    are like the waves of a ceaseless flood; that which binds a group or body of
                    them into a single action is the bond of the dramatic idea, and this it is which
                    the dramatist has to supply. Within the limits of a dramatic action all its
                    parts claim to be connected together as contributions to a single stream; and
                    upon the degree in which they are true to this purpose their primary dramatic
                    significance depends. The unity of action which a drama should possess,
                    therefore, means that everything in it should form a link in a single chain of
                    cause and effect. This law is incumbent upon every kind of drama—alike upon the
                    tragedy which solves the problems of a life, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n411/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0411-0392"/> and upon the farce which sums up the follies of
                    an afternoon.</p>
                <p>Such is not, however, the case with certain rules which have at different times
                    been set up for this or that kind of drama, but which have no absolute validity
                    for any kind. The supposed necessity that an action should consist of <hi
                    rend="italic">one event</hi> is an erroneous interpretation of the law that it
                    should be, as an action, <hi rend="italic">one.</hi> Foran event is but an
                    element in an action, though it may be an element of decisive moment. The
                    assassination of Caesar is not the action of a <hi rend="italic">Caesar</hi>
                    tragedy; the loss of his treasure is not the action of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Miser.</hi> Again, unity of action does not exclude the introduction of one or
                    even more subsidiary actions as contributing to the progress öf the main action.
                    The sole indispensable law is that these should always be treated as what they
                    are—subsidiary only; and herein lies the difficulty, which Shakespeare so
                    successfully overcame, of solving a combination of subjects into the idea of a
                    single action; herein also lies the danger in the use of that favourite device
                    of the modern drama— <hi rend="italic">bye-</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >under-plots.</hi> Ou the other hand, a really double or multiple action,
                    logically carried out as such, is inconceivable in a single drama, though there
                    is many a play which is palpably only two plays knotted into one. Every one is
                    familiar with the dramatist who towards the drop of the curtain seems to be
                    counting on his fingers whom he has killed or what couples he has to marry.
                    Thirdly, unity of action need not imply unity of hero—for hero (or heroine) is
                    merely a term signifying the principal personage of the action. And inasmuch as
                    an action may consist in the joint contention of more than one will against the
                    same obstacle—as in the instance of <hi rend="italic">The Seven against
                    Thebes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet—</hi> it is only when the
                    change in the degree of interest excited by different characters in a play
                    results from a change in the conception of the action itself, that the
                    consequent <hi rend="italic">duality</hi> (or multiplicity) of heroes recalls a
                    faulty uncertainty in the conception of the action they carry on. Such is the
                    objection applying to the crucial case of Schiller’s <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Carlos.</hi> Lastly, the entirely arbitrary exactions of <hi rend="italic">unity
                    of time</hi> and <hi rend="italic">of place</hi> are not, like that of unity of
                    action, absolute dramatic laws. Their object is by representing an action as
                    visibly continuous to render its unity more distinctly or easily perceptible;
                    but the effect of their observance cannot be to render it more really <hi
                    rend="italic">one.</hi> Thus they may in one sense be regarded as devices to
                    avoid the difficulty experienced by the human mind in regarding an action as <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> when the eye beholds its different parts occurring in
                    what are supposed to be different places, or when the process of its advance
                    from cause to effect extends over what is supposed to be a considerable period
                    of time. But the imagination is capable of constructing for itself the bridges
                    necessary to preserve to an action, conceived of as such, its character of
                    continuousness. In another sense these rules were convenient usages conducing to
                    a concise and clear treatment as actions of subjects in themselves of a limited
                    nature; for they were a Greek invention, and the repeated resort to the same
                    group of myths made it expedient for a Greek poet to seek the subject of a
                    single tragedy in a part only of one of the myths open to him. Tlιe observance
                    of unity of place, moreover, was suggested to the Greeks by certain outward
                    conditions of their stage—as assuredly as it was adopted by the French in
                    accordance with the construction and usages of theirs, and as the neglect of it
                    by the Elizabethans was in their case encouraged by the established form of the
                    English scene. The palpable artificiality of these laws needs no demonstration,
                    so long as the true meaning of the term action be kept in view. Of the <hi
                    rend="italic">action</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> part takes place at
                    Venice and part at Cyprus, and yet the whole is one in itself; while the limits
                    of time over which an action extends cannot be restricted by a revolution of the
                    earth round the sun, or of the moon round the earth.</p>
                <p>In a drama which presents its action as <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> this action
                    must be <hi rend="italic">complete in itself.</hi> This law, like the first,
                    distinguishes the dramatic action from its subject. The former may be said to
                    have a real artistic, while the latter has only an imaginary real, completeness.
                    The historian, for instance, aims indeed at a complete exposition of a body of
                    events and transactions, and may even design to show their working to a definite
                    end; but he is aλvare that this aim can never be more than partially
                    accomplished, since he may present only what he knows, and all human knowledge
                    is partial. But art is limited by no such uncertainty. The dramatist, in
                    treating an action as <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> comprehends the whole of it in
                    the form of his work, since to him who has <hi rend="italic">conceived</hi> it,
                    all its parts, from cause to effect, are equally clear. Accordingly, every drama
                    should represent in organic sequence the several stages of which a complete
                    action consists, and which are essential to it. This law of completeness
                    therefore lies at the foundation of all systems of dramatic <hi rend="italic"
                    >construction.</hi></p>
                <p>Every action, if conceived of as complete, has its causes, growth, height,
                    consequences, and close. There is no binding law to prescribe the relative
                    length at which these several stages in the action should be treated in a drama,
                    or to enforce a more or less exact correspondence between the successive
                    presentment of each, and technical divisions, such as acts or scenes, which
                    dramatic practice may find it convenient to adopt. Neither is there any law tc
                    assert any obligatory regulation of the treatment of such subsidiary actions as
                    may be introduced in aid of the main plot, or of such more or less directly
                    connected <hi rend="italic">episodes</hi> which may at the same time advance and
                    relieve its progress. But experience, as the parent of usage, has necessarily
                    from time to time established certain rules of practice, from which the
                    dramatist, working under customary forms, will find it neither easy, nor in most
                    cases advantageous, to swerve too widely; and from the adoption of particular
                    systems of division for particular species of the drama—such as that into five
                    acts for a regular tragedy or comedy, which Roman example has caused to be so
                    largely followed—has naturally resulted a certain uniformity of relation between
                    the conduct of an action and the outward sections of a play. Essentially,
                    however, there is no difference between the laws regulating the construction of
                    a Sophoclean or Shakespearean tragedy, a comedy of Molière or Congreve, and a
                    ∖vell-built modern farce. And this, because all exhibit an action complete in
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">introduction</hi> or <hi rend="italic">exposition</hi>
                    forms an integral part of the action, and is therefore to be distinguished from
                    the <hi rend="italic">prologue</hi> in the more ordinary sense of the term,
                    which, like the <hi rend="italic">epilogtie</hi> (or the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >pardbasifi),</hi> stands outside the action, and is a mere address to the
                    public from author or actor occasioned by the play. Prologue and epilogue,
                    greatly as they may have at times contributed to the success of a drama, are
                    mere external adjuncts, and have as little to do with tíie construction of a
                    play as the bill which announces it, or the musical prelude which disposes the
                    mind for its reception. The introduction or exposition belongs to the action
                    itself; it is, as the Hindu critics called it, the seed or circumstance from
                    which the business arises. Clearness being its primary requisite, many
                    expedients have been at various times adopted to secure this feature. Thus, the
                    Euripi dean prologue, though spoken by one of the characters of the play, takes
                    a narrative form, and places itself half without, half within the action of
                    which it properly is part. The same purpose is served by the separate inductions
                    in many of our old English plays, and the preludes or prologues, or by whatever
                    name they may call <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0412-0393"/> themselves, in numberless modern dramas of all
                    kinds— from <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> down to the favourites of the Ambigu
                    and the Adelphi. Another such expedient is that of the inductive dumb-shows,
                    which sought to secure rapidity together with impressiveness of exposition by
                    the process of pantomimic summary. Such, again, are <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> the opening scenes in French tragedy between hero and <hi rend="italic"
                    >confidant,</hi> and those in French comedy and its derivatives between
                    observant valet and knowing lady’s-maid. But it is clear how all such expedients
                    may be rendered unnecessary by the art of the dramatist, who is able outwardly
                    also to present the introduction of his action as what it is—an organic part of
                    that action itself; who seems to take the spectators <hi rend="italic">in medias
                    res</hi> while he is really building the foundations of his plot; who can
                    dramatically account for an Iliad of woes without going back to Leda’s egg; who
                    touches in the opening of his action the chord which is to vibrate throughout
                    its course—“Down with the Capulets I down with the Montagues! ”—“With the Moor,
                    sayest thou 1”</p>
                <p>The introduction ends with the opening of the movement of the action, a passage
                    which it may prove highly effective to mark with the utmost distinctness (as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> where it is clearly to be sought in the actual
                    meeting between the hero and the ghost), but which in other instances is
                    advantageously marked by the insertion of subsidiary action or episode (as in
                    <hi rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> where the opening of the movement of the main
                    action would follow too sharply upon its exposition, were not the beginning of
                    the subsidiary action of Gloster and his sons opportunely introduced between
                    them). From this point the second stage of the action—its <hi rend="italic"
                    >growth—</hi> progresses to that third stage which is called its <hi
                    rend="italic">height</hi> or <hi rend="italic">climax.</hi> All that has
                    preceded the reaching of this constitutes that half of the drama—usually its
                    much larger half—which Aristotle terms the 8«ns, or tying of the knot. The
                    varieties in the treatment of the growth or second stage of the action are
                    infinite, and it is here that the masters of the tragic and the comic
                    drama—notably those unequalled weavers of intrigues, the Spaniards—are able most
                    fully to exercise their <hi rend="italic">inventive</hi> faculties. If the
                    growth is too rapid, the climax will fail of its effect—and it is, therefore, at
                    this stage that subsidiary actions and episodes are most largely used; if it is
                    too slow, the interest will be exhausted before the greatest demand upon it has
                    been made—a fault to which comedy is specially liable; if it is involved or
                    inverted, a vague uncertainty will take the place of an eager or agreeable
                    suspense, the action will seem to halt, or a fall will begin prematurely. In the
                    contrivance of the <hi rend="italic">climax</hi> itself lies one of the chief
                    tests of the dramatist’s art; for while in the transactions of real life their
                    climax is often only a matter of assumption, in the action of a drama its climax
                    should present itself as self-evident. In the middle of everything, says the
                    Greek poet, lies the strength; and this strongest or highest point it is the
                    task of the dramatist to make manifest. Much here depends upon the niceties of
                    constructive instinct; much (as in all parts of the action) upon a thorough
                    dramatic transformation of the subject. The historical drama here presents
                    peculiar difficulties, and perhaps the example of <hi rend="italic">Henry
                    VIII.,</hi> as compared with Shakespeare’s other historical plays, may be held
                    to furnish an instructive example of defective (because hasty) workmanship.</p>
                <p>From the climax, or height, the action proceeds through its <hi rend="italic"
                    >fall</hi> to its <hi rend="italic">close,</hi> which in a drama with an unhappy
                    ending we still call its <hi rend="italic">catastrophe,</hi> while to
                    terminations in general we apply the term <hi rend="italic">denouement.</hi>
                    This latter name would, however, more properly be used in the sense in which
                    Aristotle employs its Greek equivalent Averts—the untying of the knot—of the
                    whole of the second part of the action, from the climax downwards. If, in the
                    management of the climax, everything depended upon making the effect, in the
                    fall everything depends upon not marring it. This may be ensured by a rapid
                    progress to the close; but neither does every action admit of such treatment,
                    nor is it in accordance with the character of those actions which are of a
                    complicated kind. With the latter, therefore, the <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> is
                    often a <hi rend="italic">return—i.e.,</hi> in Aristotle’s phrase, a change into
                    the reverse of what is expected from the circumstances of the action
                    (7r€pt7rereta),—as in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> where the Roman story
                    lends itself so admirably to dramatic demands. In any case the art of the
                    dramatist is in this part of his work called upon for the surest exercise of its
                    tact and skill. The effect of the climax has been to concentrate the interest;
                    the fall must therefore, above all, avoid dissipating it. The use of episodes is
                    not even now excluded; but they must be of a more directly significant kind than
                    is necessary in the earlier stages of the drama; even where serving the purpose
                    of relief they must help to keep alive the interest previously raised to its
                    highest pitch. This may be effected by a return or revolution; or again, by the
                    raising of obstacles between the height of the action and its expected
                    consequences, by the suggestion in tragedy of a seemingly possible recovery or
                    escape from them (as in the wonderfully powerful construction of the latter part
                    of <hi rend="italic">MacbetK),</hi> by the gradual removal in comedy, or
                    wherever the interest of the action is less intense, of such difficulties as the
                    growth and climax have occasioned. In all kinds of the drama <hi rend="italic"
                    >discovery</hi> will remain, as it was in the judgment of Aristotle, a most
                    effective expedient; but it should be a discovery which has been foreshadowed by
                    that method of treatment which in its consummate master, Sophocles, has been
                    termed liis <hi rend="italic">irony.</hi> Nowhere should the close or
                    catastrophe be other than a consequence of the action itself. Sudden revulsions
                    from the conditions of the action—such as the <hi rend="italic">deus ex
                    machina,</hi> or the revising officer of the emperor of China, or the nabob
                    returned from India bring about—condemn themselves as unsatisfactory makeshifts.
                    However sudden, and even, in manner of accomplishment, surprising, may be the
                    catastrophe, it should not be unprepared, but like every other part of the
                    action should preserve its organic connection with the whole. The sudden
                    suicides which terminate so many tragedies, and the paternal blessings which
                    close an equal number of comedies, should be something more than a signal for
                    the fall of the curtain.</p>
                <p>The action of a drama, besides being one and complete in itself, ought likewise
                    to be <hi rend="italic">probable.</hi> The probability required of a drama is
                    not that of actual or historical experience—it is a conditional probability, or
                    in other words the consistency of the course of the action with the conditions
                    under which, and with the characters by which, the dramatist has chosen to carry
                    it on. As to the former, he is fettered by no restrictions save those which he
                    imposes upon himself, whether or not in deference to the usages of certain
                    accepted species of dramatic composition. Ghosts appear neither in real life nor
                    in dramas of real life; but the introduction of supernatural agency is neither
                    enjoined nor prohibited by any general dramatic law. The use of such expedients
                    is as open to the dramatic as to any other poet; the judiciousness of his use of
                    them depends upon the effect which, consistently with the general conduct of his
                    action, they will exercise upon the spectator, whom other circumstances may or
                    may not predispose to their acceptance. The ghost in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamlet</hi> belongs to the action of the play; the ghost in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Persve</hi> is not intrinsically less probable, but the apparition
                    seems to spring, so to speak, less naturally out of the atmosphere around it.
                    Dramatic probability has, however, a far deeper meaning than this. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Eumenides</hi> is probable with all its primitive mysteriousness,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> with all its barbarous witchcraft. The
                    proceedings of the feathered builders of Cloud cuckootown <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0413-0394"/> are as true to dramatic probability as are the
                    pranks of Oberon’s fairies. In other words, it is in the consistency of the
                    action with the characters, and of the characters with themselves, that this
                    dramatic probability lies. The dramatist has to represent characters affected by
                    the progress of an action in a particular way, and contributing to it in a
                    particular way, because, if consistent with themselves, they <hi rend="italic"
                    >must</hi> be so affected, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> so act.</p>
                <p>Upon the invention and conduct of his characters the dramatist must therefore
                    expend a great proportion of his labour. His treatment of them will, in at least
                    as high a degree as his choice of subject, conception of action, and method of
                    construction, determine the effect which his work •produces. And while there are
                    aspects of the dramatic art under which its earlier history already exhibits an
                    unsurpassed degree of perfection, there is none under which its advance is more
                    perceptible than this. Many causes have contributed to this result; the chief is
                    to be sought in the multiplication of the opportunities for mankind’s study of
                    man. The theories of the Indian critics on the subject of dramatic character are
                    a scaffolding more elaborate than the edifice it surrounds. Aristotle’s remarks
                    on the subject are scanty; and it may be unhesitatingly asserted that the
                    strength of the dramatic literature from whose examples he abstracted his maxims
                    is not to be sought in the fulness or variety of its characterization. This
                    relative deficiency the outward conditions of the Greek theatre—the remoteness
                    of actor from spectator, and the consequent necessity for the use of masks, and
                    for the raising and therefore conventionalizing of the tones of the voice—
                    undoubtedly helped to occasion. Later Greek and Roman comedy, with a persistency
                    furnishing a remarkable illustration of the force of habit, limited their range
                    of characters to an accepted gallery of types. Nor is it easy to ignore the fact
                    that these examples, and the influence of national tendencies of mind and
                    temperament, have inclined the dramatists of the Romance nations to attach less
                    importance to characterization of a closer and more varied kind than to interest
                    of action and effectiveness of construction. The Italian and the Spanish drama
                    more especially, and the French during a great part of its history, have in
                    general shown a disposition to present their characters, as it were, ready
                    made—whether in the case of tragic heroes and heroines, or in that of comic
                    types, often moulded according to a long-lived system of local or national
                    selection. It is in the Germanic drama, and in its master Shakespeare above all,
                    that the individualization of characters has been carried to its furthest point,
                    and that their significance has been allowed to work itself out in closest
                    connection with the progress of the dramatic action to which they belong.</p>
                <p>But, however the method and scope of characterization may vary under the
                    influence of different historical epochs and different tendencies or tastes of
                    races or nations, the laws of this branch of the dramatic art are everywhere
                    based on the same essential requirements. What interests us in a man or woman in
                    real life, or in the impressions we form of historical personages, is that which
                    seems to us to individualize them. A dramatic character must therefore, whatever
                    its part in the action, be sufficiently marked in its distinctive features to
                    interest the imagination; with these its subsequent conduct must be consistent,
                    and to these its participation in the action must correspond. In order that such
                    should be the result, the dramatist must first have distinctly conceived the
                    character, whatever may have suggested it to him. If, for instance, he has taken
                    it, as the phrase is, from history or from contemporary life, he must transform
                    it, just as he must transform the subject of the action into the action itself.
                    His task is not to paint a copy of any particular man, but to conceive a kind of
                    man—of which a particular individual may have occurred to him as a suggestive
                    illustration—under the operation of particular circumstances. His conception,
                    growing and modifying itself with the progress of that of the action, will
                    determine the totality of the character he creates. The likeness which the
                    result bears to an actual or histori cal personage may very probably, from
                    secondary points of view, concern the success of his creation; upon its dramatic
                    effect this likeness can have no influence whatever. In a different sense from
                    that in which Shakespeare used the words, it should be possible to say of every
                    dramatic character which it is sought to identify with an actual personage,
                    “This is not the man.” The mirror of the drama is not a photographic
                    apparatus.</p>
                <p>Distinctiveness, as the primary requisite in dramatic characterization, is to be
                    demanded in the case of all personages introduced into a dramatic action, but
                    not in all cases in an equal degree. Schiller, in adding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">Fiesco</hi>
                    superscriptions of their chief characteristics, labels Sacco as “an ordinary
                    person,” and this suffices for Sacco. Between Bassanio’s two unsuccessful rivals
                    in the trial of the caskets there is difference enough for the dramatic purpose
                    of their existence. But with the great masters of characterization a few
                    touches, of which the true actor’s art knows how to avail itself, distinguish
                    even their lesser characters from one another; and every man is in his humour
                    down to the third citizen. Elaboration is necessarily reserved for characters
                    who are the more important contributors to the action, and the fulness of
                    elaboration for its heroes. Many expedients may lend their aid to the higher
                    degrees of distinctiveness. In characters designed to influence the whole of the
                    action it must be marked early, in others in due relation to their contribution
                    towards the course of the plot. Much is gained by a significant introduction of
                    hero or heroine,—so Antigone is dragged in by the watchman, Gloucester enters
                    alone upon the scene, Volpone is discovered in adoration of his golden saint.
                    Nothing marks character more clearly than the use of contrast—as of Othello with
                    Iago, of Octavio with Max Piccolomini, of Joseph with Charles Surface. Nor is
                    direct antithesis the only effective kind of contrast; Cassius is a foil to
                    Brutus, and Leonora to her namesake the Princess. But besides impressing the
                    imagination as a conception distinct in itself, each character must maintain a
                    consistency between its conduct in the action and the features it has
                    established as its own. This consistency does not imply uniformity; for, as
                    Aristotle observes, there are characters which, to be represented with
                    uniformity, must be presented as uniformly un-uniform. Of such consistently
                    complex characters the great critic cites no instances, nor indeed are they of
                    frequent occurrence in Greek tragedy; in the modern drama Hamlet is their
                    unrivalled exemplar; and Weislingen in Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Gotz,</hi> and
                    Alceste in the <hi rend="italic">Misanthrope,</hi> may be mentioned as other
                    illustrations in dramas widely different from one another. Tt should be added
                    that those dramatic literatures which freely admit of a mixture of the serious
                    with the comic element thereby enormously increase the opportunities of varied
                    characterization. The difficulty of the task at the same time enhances the
                    effect resulting from its satisfactory solution; and if the conception of a
                    character is found to bear a variety of tests resembling that which experience
                    shows life to have at hand for every man, its naturalness, as we term it,
                    becomes more obvious to the imagination. Naturalness is only another word for
                    what Aristotle terms propriety; the artificial rules by which usage has at times
                    sought to define particular species of character are in their origin only a
                    convenience of the theatre, though they have largely helped to conventionalize
                    dramatic characterization. Lastly, a character should be directly effective with
                    regard to the dramatic action in which it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n414/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0414-0395"/> takes part,—that is to say, the influence it
                    exerts upon the progress of the action should correspond to its distinctive
                    features, the conduct of the play should seem to spring from the nature of its
                    characters. Hence even the minor characters should not idly intervene, and,
                    before they intervene significantly, we should be prepared by some previous
                    notion of them. The chief characters, on the other hand, should predominate over
                    or determine the course of the action; its entire conception should harmonize k
                    ith their distinctive features; it is only a Prometheus whom the gods bind fast
                    to a rock, only a Juliet who will venture into a living death for her Romeo.
                    Thus in a sense chance is excluded from dramatic action, or rather, like every
                    other element in it, bends to the dramatic idea. And in view of this
                    predominance of character over action, we may appropriately use such expressions
                    as a tragedy of love or jealousy or ambition, or a comedy of character—by which
                    is merely meant one whose preponderating interest lies in the effectiveness with
                    which its conduct impresses upon the mind the conception of its chief character
                    or characters.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">manners</hi> (as employed in a narrower sense than the
                    Aristotelian) applies to that which colours both action and characters, but does
                    not determine the essence of either. As exhibiting human agents under certain,
                    conditions of time and place, and of the various relations of community existing
                    or conceivable among men, the action of a drama, together with the characters
                    engaged in it and the incidents and circumstances belonging to it, must be more
                    or less suited to the external conditions assumed. From the assumption of some
                    such conditions not even those dramatic species which indulge in the most
                    sovereign licence, such as Old Attic comedy or burlesque in general, can wholly
                    emancipate themselves; and even supernatural characters and actions must adapt
                    themselves to some antecedents. But it depends altogether on the measure in
                    which the nature of an action and the development of its characters are affected
                    by considerations of time and place, or of temporary social systems and the
                    transitory distinctions they produce, whether the imitation of a particular kind
                    of manners becomes a significant element in a particular play. What is of
                    vanishing importance in one may be an adjunct of inestimable value in another.
                    The Hindu caste-system is an antecedent of every Hindu drama, and the peculiar
                    organization of Chinese society of nearly every Chinese with which we are
                    acquainted. Greek tragedy itself, though treating subjects derived from no
                    historic age, had established a standard of manners from which in its decline it
                    did not depart with impunity. The imitation of manners of a particular age or
                    country may or may not be of moment in a play. The conjuncture of the Crusades
                    is merely a felicitous choice for the time of action of <hi rend="italic">Nathan
                    the IFise;</hi> but the dramatic conflict of <hi rend="italic">Minna von
                    Barnhelm</hi> derives half its life from the background of the Seven Years’ War.
                    In some dramas, and in some species of drama, time and place are so purely
                    imaginary and so much a matter of indifference that the adoption of a purely
                    conventional standard of manners, or at least the exclusion of any definitely
                    fixed one, is here desirable. The ducal reign of Theseus at Athens (when
                    ascertained) does not date <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream;</hi> nor
                    do the coasts of Bohemia localize the manners of the customers of Autolycus.
                    Where, on the other hand, as more especially in the historic drama, or in that
                    kind of comedy which directs its shafts against the ridiculous vices of a
                    particular age or country, the likeness of the manners represented to what is
                    more or less known possesses significance, there the dramatist will use care in
                    his colouring. How admirably is the French court specialized in <hi
                    rend="italic">Henry K.,</hi> how completely are we transplanted among the
                    burghers of Brussels in the opening scenes of <hi rend="italic">Egmont!</hi>
                    What a picture of a clique we have in the <hi rend="italic">Precieuses
                    ridicules</hi> of Moli&amp;re; what a reproduction of a class in the pot-house
                    politicians of Holberg 1 Yet even in such instances the dramatist will only use
                    what suits his dramatic purpose; he will select, not transfer in mass, historic
                    features, and discriminate in his use of modern instances. The details of
                    historic fidelity, and the lesser shades distinguishing the varieties of social
                    usage, he will introduce at his choice, or leave to be supplied by the actor.
                    Where the reproduction of manners becomes the primary purpose of a play, its
                    effect can only be of an inferior kind; and a drama purely of manners is a
                    contradiction in terms.</p>
                <p>No complete system of dramatic species can be abstracted from any one dramatic
                    literature. They are often the result of particular antecedents, and their
                    growth is often affected by peculiar conditions. Different nations or ages use
                    the same name, and may preserve some of the same rules, for species which in
                    other respects their usage may have materially modified from that of their
                    neighbours or predecessors. Who would undertake to define, except in their
                    successive applications, such terms as <hi rend="italic">tragi-comedy</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">melodrama?</hi> Yet this does not imply that all is confusion
                    in the terminology as to the species of the drama. In so far as they are
                    distinguishable according to the effects which their actions, or those which the
                    preponderating parts of their actions, produce, they may primarily be ranged in
                    accordance with the broad difference established by Aristotle between tragedy
                    and comedy. <hi rend="italic">Tragic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">comic</hi>
                    effects differ in regard to the emotions of the mind which they excite; and a
                    drama is tragic or comic according as such effects are produced by it. The
                    strong or serious emotions are alone capable of exercising upon us that
                    influence which, employing a bold but marvellously happy figure, Aristotle
                    termed <hi rend="italic">purification,</hi> and which a Greek comedian, after a
                    more matter-of-fact fashion, thus expressed:</p>
                <p>“For whensoe'er a man observes his fellow Bear wrongs more grievous than himself
                    has known, More easily he bears his own misfortunes;”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the petty troubles of self which disturb without
                    elevating the mind are driven out by the sympathetic participation in greater
                    griefs, which raises while it excites the mind employed upon contemplating them.
                    It is to these emotions—which are and can be no others than pity and terror—that
                    actions and characters which we call tragic appeal. Those which we term comic
                    address themselves to the sense of the ridiculous, and their subjects are those
                    vices and moral infirmities, the representation of which is capable of touching
                    the springs of laughter. Where, accordingly, a drama excludes all effects except
                    those of the former class, it may be called a pure <hi rend="italic"
                    >tragedy;</hi> when all except those of the latter, a pure <hi rend="italic"
                    >comedy.</hi> In those dramas where the effects are mixed, it is the nature of
                    the main action and of the main characters (as determined by their distinctive
                    features) which alone enables us to classify such plays as serious or humorous
                    dramas—or as tragic or comic, if we choose to preserve the terms. But the
                    classification admits of a variety of transitions, from pure tragedy to mixed,
                    from mixed tragedy to mixed comedy, and thence to pure comedy and her slighter
                    sister <hi rend="italic">farce.</hi> This method of distinction has no concern
                    with the mere question of the termination of a play, according to which
                    Philostratus and other authorities have sought to distinguish between tragic and
                    comic dramas. The serious drama which ends happily (the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schauspiet)</hi> is not a species co ordinate with tragedy and comedy, but only
                    one subordinate to the former, if, indeed, it be necessary to distinguish it as
                    a species at all. Other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n415/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0415-0396"/> distinctions may be almost infinitely varied
                    according to the point of view adopted for the classification.</p>
                <p>The historical sketch of the drama attempted in the following pages will best
                    serve to indicate the successive growth of national dramatic species, many of
                    which by asserting their influence in other countries and ages than those which
                    gave birth to them, have acquired a more than national significance.</p>
                <p>The art of acting, whose history forms an organic though a distinct part of that
                    of the drama, necessarily possesses a theory and a technical system of its own.
                    But into these it is impossible here to enter. One claim, however, should be
                    vindicated for the art of acting, viz., that though it is a dependent art, and
                    most signally so in its highest forms, yet its true exercise implies a creative
                    process. The conception of a character is determined by antecedents not of the
                    actor’s own making; and the term originality can be applied to it only in a
                    relative sense. Study and reflection enable him, with the aid of experience and
                    of the intuition which genius bestows, but which experience may in a high degree
                    supply, to interpret, to combine, and to supplement given materials. But in the
                    transformation of the conception into the represented character the actor’s
                    functions are really creative; for here he <hi rend="italic">becomes</hi> the
                    character by means which belong to his art alone. The distinctiveness he gives
                    to the character by making the principal features recognized by him in it its
                    groundwork;—the consistency which he maintains in it between groundwork and
                    details;—the appropriateness which he preserves in it to the course of the
                    action and the part borne in it by the character:—all these are produced by
                    himself, though suggested by the conception he has derived from his materials.
                    As to the means at his disposal, they are essentially of two kinds only; but not
                    all forms of the drama have admitted of the use of both, or of both in the same
                    completeness. All acting includes the use of gesture, or, as it has been more
                    comprehensively termed, of bodily eloquence. From various points of view its
                    laws regulate the actor’s bearing, walk, and movements of face and limbs. They
                    teach what is aesthetically permitted and what is aesthetically pleasing. They
                    deduce from observation what is appropriate to the expression of particular
                    affections of the mind and of their combinations, of emotions and passions, of
                    physical and mental conditions—joy and grief, health and sickness, waking,
                    sleeping, and dreaming, madness, collapse, and death—of particular ages of life
                    and temperaments, as well as of the distinctive characteristics of race,
                    nationality, or class. While under certain conditions —as in the masked
                    drama—the use of bodily movement as one of the means of expression has at times
                    been partially restricted, there have been, or are, forms of the drama which
                    have altogether excluded the use of speech (such as pantomime), or have
                    restricted the manner of its employment (such as opera). In the spoken drama the
                    laws of rhetoric regulate the actor’s use of speech, but under conditions of a
                    special nature. Like the orator, he has to follow the laws of pronunciation,
                    modulation, accent, and rhythm (the last in certain kinds of prose as well as in
                    such forms of verse as he may be called upon to reproduce). But he has also to
                    give his attention to the special laws of dramatic delivery, which vary in
                    soliloquy and dialogue, and in such narrative or lyrical passages as may occur
                    in his part.</p>
                <p>The totality of the effect produced by the actor will in some degree depend upon
                    other aids, among which those of a purely external kind will not be lost sight
                    of. But the significance of costume in the actor, like that of decoration and
                    scenery in an action, is a wholly relative one, and is to a large measure
                    determined by the claims which custom enables the theatre to make, or forbids
                    its making, upon the imagination of the spectators. The actor’s real achievement
                    lies in the transformation which the artist himself effects; nor is there any
                    art more sovereign in the use it can make of its means, or so happy in the
                    directness of the results it can accomplish by them.</p>
                <p>The origin of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Indian</hi> drama may unhesitatingly be
                    described as purely native. The Mahometans when they overran India brought no
                    drama with them; the Persians, the Arabs, and the Egyptians were without a
                    national theatre. It would be absurd to suppose the Indian drama to have owed
                    anything to the Chinese or its offshoots. On the other hand, there is no real
                    evidence for assuming any influence of Greek examples upon the Indian drama at
                    any stage of its progress. Finally, it had passed into its decline before the
                    dramatic literature of modern Europe had sprung into being.</p>
                <p>The Hindu writers ascribe the invention of dramatic entertainments to an inspired
                    sage Bharata, or to the communications made to him by the god Brahma himself
                    concerning an art gathered from the Vedas. As the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bharata</hi> signifies an actor, we have clearly here a mere personification of
                    the invention of the drama. Three kinds of entertainments, of which the <hi
                    rend="italic">ndtya</hi> (defined as a dance combined with gesticulation and
                    speech) comes nearest to the drama, were said to have been exhibited before the
                    gods by the spirits and nymphs of Indra’s heaven, and to these the god Siva
                    added two new styles of dancing.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Indian drama was thus doubtless religious; it sprang from the
                    union of song and dance in the festivals of the gods, to which w ere afterwards
                    added narrative recitation, and first sung, then spoken, dialogue. Such scenes
                    and stories from the mythology of Vishnu are still occasionally enacted by
                    pantomime or spoken dialogue in India <hi rend="italic">(jdtras</hi> of the
                    Bengalis; <hi rend="italic">rasas</hi> of the Western Provinces); and the most
                    ancient Indian play was said to have treated an episode from the history of that
                    deity,—the choice of him as a consort by Laxmi,—a favourite kind of subject in
                    the Indian drama. The tradition connecting its earliest themes with the native
                    mythology of Vishnu agrees with that ascribing the origin of a particular kind
                    of dramatic performance—the <hi rend="italic">sangita—</hi> to Krishifa and the
                    shepherdesses. The author’s later poem, the <hi rend="italic">Gitagovinda,</hi>
                    has been conjectured to be suggestive of the earliest species of Hindu dramas.
                    But while the epic poetry of the Hindus gradually approached the dramatic in the
                    way of dialogue, their drama developed itself independently out of the union of
                    the lyric and the epic forms. Their dramatic poetry arose later than their epos,
                    whose great works, the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rdmdyana,</hi> had again been long preceded by the hymnody of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vedas</hi> —just as the Greek drama followed upon the Homeric
                    poems, and these had been preceded by the early hymns. The beginnings of the
                    Indian drama may accordingly belong to the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> or to a rather earlier date. But by the time it produced the first
                    specimens with which we are acquainted, it had already reached its zenith; and
                    it was therefore looked upon as having sprung into being as a perfect art. We

                <p>The history of Indian dramatic literature may be roughly divided into the
                    following periods :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">From the \st century</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">to the \Qth century</hi> A.D.— This period belongs to the
                    pre-Mahometan age of Indian history, but to that second division of it in which
                    Buddhism had already become a powerful, factor in the social, as well as in the
                    moral and intellectual, life of the land. It is the classical period of the
                    Hindu drama, and includes the works of its two indisputably greatest masters. Of
                    these Kalidisa was by far the earlier, who lived at the <pb break="no"

                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> being accounted the brightest of its “nine gems ’’
                    of genius. He is the author of <hi rend="italic">Sakuntald,—</hi> the work Sir
                    William Jones’s translation of which first revealed to the Western world of
                    letters the existence of an Indian drama. It is a dramatic love-idyll of
                    surpassing beauty, and, in the opinion of the highest authorities, one of the
                    master-pieces of the poetic literature of the world. Kalidasa’s other drama, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vikrama and Urvasi (The Hero and the Nymph),</hi> though unequal
                    as a whole to <hi rend="italic">Sakuntald,</hi> contains one act of incomparable
                    loveliness; and its enduring effect upon Indian dramatic literature is shown by
                    the imitations of it in later plays. To Kalidasa has likewise been attributed a
                    third play—the <hi rend="italic">Mdlavikdgnimitra;</hi> but it is doubtful
                    whether this comedy, though held to be of ancient date, wa3 not composed by a
                    different poet of the same name.</p>
                <p>Another work of high merit, the pathetic <hi rend="italic">Mrichchhakati (The
                    Toy-Cart),</hi> a domestic drama with a public underplot, may possibly belong to
                    the close of the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and seems certainly
                    of an earlier date than the 10th. It is attributed (as is not uncommon with
                    Indian plays) to a royal author named Siidraka.</p>
                <p>The palm of pre-eminence is disputed with Kalidasa by the great dramatic poet
                    Babhavuti (called Qrikantha, or he in whose throat is fortune), who flourished
                    in the earlier part of the 8th century. While he is considered more artificial
                    in language than his rival, and in general more bound by rules, he can hardly be
                    deemed his inferior in dramatic genius. Of his three extant plays, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahavara-Charitra</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Uttara-Rama-Charitra</hi> are heroic dramas concerned with the adventures of
                    Rama (the seventh incarnation of Visluiu); the third, the powerful <hi
                    rend="italic">Maloti and Mddhava,</hi> has love for its theme, and has been
                    called (with more aptitude than such comparisons usually possess) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> of the Hindus. It is considered by their
                    critical authorities the best example of the <hi rend="italic">prakaraha,</hi>
                    or drama of domestic life.</p>
                <p>Among the remaining chief works of Indian dramatic literature, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Veni-Samhara</hi> is thought probably to date from about the 8th
                    or 9th century. Its author’s name seems doubtful; the play is described as one
                    in which both pathos and horror are exaggerated, and which in the violence of
                    its action recalls the manner of Shakespeare’s predecessors. The next series of
                    plays forms a transition between the first period of Indian dramatic literature
                    and</p>
                <p>II. The period of decline, which may be reckoned <hi rend="italic">from about the
                    llth to about the llth century of our era,</hi> and of which the beginning
                    roughly coincides with that of a continuous series of Mahometan invasions of
                    India. <hi rend="italic">Ilandman-Nataka,</hi> or “the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nataka”</hi> (for this play, the work of several hands, surpasses all other
                    Indian dramas in length, extending over not less than fourteen acts), dates from
                    the 10th or llth century. Its story is taken from the BAma-cycle, and a
                    prominent character in it is the mythical monkey-chief Hanumat, to whom, indeed,
                    tradition ascribed the original authorship of the play. Krishnamicra’s
                    “theosophic mystery,” as it Jias been called, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prdbodha-Chandrodaya (The Rise of the Moon of Insight, i.e.,</hi> the victory
                    of true doctrine over error), is ascribed by one authority to the middle of the
                    llth century, by another to about the end of the 12th. The dates of the famous
                    <hi rend="italic">Iiatnavall (The Necklace),</hi> a court-comedy of love and
                    intrigue, with a half-Terentian plot, and of the interesting Buddhist drama <hi
                    rend="italic">Ndgananda,</hi> which begins as an erotic play but passes into a
                    most impressive exemplification of the supreme virtue of self-sacrifice, depend
                    on the disputed question of their respective authorship. One of them belongs to
                    the first quarter of the 12th century, the other to an earlier time. Finally,
                    Vis'Akhadatta’s interesting drama of political intrigue, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mudrd-Rakshasa (The Signet of</hi><hi rend="italic">the Minister),</hi> in
                    which prince Chandragupta, presumably identifiable with Sandrocottus, makes his
                    appearance, was probably composed later than the end of the 12th century. This
                    is the only Indian play known to us with an essentially historical fable—a
                    noteworthy circumstance, if (as is most likely) it was produced at a time when
                    the Mahometan invasions had already begun.</p>
                <p>The remaining plays of which it has been possible to conjecture the dates range
                    in the time of their composition from the end of the llth to the 14th century,
                    and belong to the period of decliue. Of this period, as compared with the first,
                    the general characteristics seem to be an undue preponderance of narrative and
                    description, and an affected and over-elaborated style. As a striking instance
                    of this class is mentioned a play on the adventures of Rima, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anargha-Raghava,</hi> which in spite, or by reason, of the
                    commonplace character of its sentiments, the extravagance of its diction, and
                    the obscurity of its mythology, is stated to enjoy a higher reputation with the
                    pandits of the present age than the master-pieces of Kilidasa and Babhavuti. To
                    the close of this period, the 14th century, has likewise (but without any
                    pretension to certainty) been ascribed the only Tamil drama of which we possess
                    an English version. <hi rend="italic">Arichandra (The Martyr of Truth)</hi>
                    exemplifies—with a strange likeness in the contrivance of its plot to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Job</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Faust—</hi> in the trials
                    of a heroically enduring king the maxim “Better die than lie.”</p>
                <p>III. Isolated plays remain from <hi rend="italic">centuries later than the</hi>
                    14z/t; but these, which chiefly turn on the legends of Krishna (the last
                    incarnation of Visluiu), may be regarded as a mere aftergrowth, and exhibit the
                    Indian drama in it3 decay. Indeed, the latest of them, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chitra-Yajna,</hi> which was composed about the beginning of the present
                    century, and still serves as a model for Bengali dramatic performances, is
                    imperfect in its dialogue, which (after the fashion of Italian improvised
                    comedy) it is left to the actors to supplement. Besides these there are farces
                    or farcical entertainments, more or less indelicate, of uncertain dates.</p>
                <p>The number of the plays which have descended to us from so vast an expanse of
                    time is both relatively and absolutely small. Wilson doubts whether all the
                    plays to be found, and those mentioned by Hindu writers on the drama, amount to
                    many more than 60; and it has been seen that not more than three are ascribed to
                    either of the two great masters. To these should be, however, added the plays in
                    Tamil, stated to be about 100 in number, and to have been composed by poets who
                    enjoyed the patronage of the Pandian kings of Madura. On the other hand, there
                    is among the Hindus no dearth of dramatic theory. The sage Bharata, the reputed
                    inventor of dramatic entertainments, was likewise revered as the father of
                    dramatic criticism—a combination of functions to which the latter days of the
                    English theatre might perhaps furnish an occasional parallel. The commentators
                    (possibly under the influence of inspiration rather than as a strict mattei-of
                    memory) constantly cite his <hi rend="italic">sutras,</hi> or aphorisms. (From
                    <hi rend="italic">suira,</hi> thread, was named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sdtra-dhara,</hi> thread-holder, carpenter, a term applied to the architect and
                    general manager of sacrificial solemnities, then to the director of theatrical
                    performances). By the llth century, when the drama was already approaching its
                    decline, dramatic criticism had reached an advanced point; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dasa-Rupaka</hi> (of which the text belongs to that age)
                    distinctly defines the ten several kinds of dramatic composition. Other critical
                    works followed at later dates, exhibiting a rage for subdivision unsurpassed by
                    the efforts of Western theorists, ancient or modern; the misfortune is that
                    there should not be examples remaining (if they ever existed) to illustrate all
                    the branches of so elaborate a dramatic system.</p>

                <p>“What,” inquires the manager of an actor in the induction to one of the most
                    famous of Indian plays, “are those qualities vzhich the virtuous, the wise, the
                    venerable, the learned, and the Brahmans require in a drama ?” “Pro found
                    exposition of the various passions,” is the reply, “pleasing interchange of
                    mutual affection, loftiness of character, delicate expression of desire, a
                    surprising story, and elegant language.” “Then,” says the manager (for the
                    Indian dramatists, though not, like Ben Jonson, wont to “rail” tiie public “into
                    approbation,” are unaffected by <hi rend="italic">mauvaise honte)</hi> “I
                    recollect one.” And he proceeds to state that “Babhavuti has given us a drama
                    composed by him, replete with all qualities, to which indeed this sentence is
                    applicable: ‘ How little do they know who speak of us with censure 1 This
                    entertainment is not for them. Possibly some one exists, or will exist, of
                    similar tastes with myself; for time is boundless, and the world is wide.’” This
                    self-possessed disregard of popularity, springing from an imperturbable
                    consciousness of lofty aims, accounts for much that is characteristic of the
                    higher class of Indian plays. It explains both their paucity and their length,
                    renders intelligible the chief peculiarity in their diction, and furnishes the
                    key to their most striking ethical as well as literary qualities. Connected in
                    their origin with religious worship, they were only performed on solemn
                    occasions, chiefly of a public nature, and more especially at seasons sacred to
                    some divinity. Thus, though they might in some instances be reproduced, they
                    were always written with a view to one particular solemn representation. Again,
                    the greater part of every one of the plays of Northern India is written in
                    Sanskrit, which ceased to be a popular language by 300 B.C., but continued the
                    classical, and at the same time the sacred, form of speech of the Brahmans.
                    Sanskrit is spoken by the heroes and principal personages of the plays, while
                    the female and inferior characters use varieties, more or less refined, of the
                    Prakrit languages (as a rule not more than three, that which is employed in the
                    songs of the women being the poetic dialect of the most common Prakrit language,
                    the Qauraseni). Hence, part at least of each play cannot have been understood by
                    the large majority of the audience, except in so far as their general
                    acquaintance with the legends or stories treated enabled them to follow the
                    course of the action. Every audience thus contained an <hi rend="italic"
                    >inner</hi> audience, which could alone feel the full effect of the drama. It
                    is, then, easy to see why the Hindu critics should make demands upon the art,
                    into which only highly-trained and refined intellects were capable of entering,
                    or called upon to enter. The general public could not be expected to appreciate
                    the sentiments expressed in a drama, and thus (according to the process
                    prescribed by Hindu theory) to receive instruction by means of amusement. These
                    sentiments are termed <hi rend="italic">rasas</hi> (tastes or flavours), and
                    said to spring from the <hi rend="italic">bhdvas</hi> (conditions of mind and
                    body). A variety of subdivisions is added; but the <hi rend="italic">santa
                    rasa</hi> is logically enough excluded from dramatic composition, inasmuch as it
                    implies absolute quiescence.</p>
                <p>The Hindu critics know of no distinction directly corresponding to that between
                    tragedy and comedy, still less of any determined by the nature of the close of a
                    play. For, in accordance with the child-like element of their character, the
                    Hindus dislike an unhappy ending to any story, and a positive rule accordingly
                    prohibits a fatal conclusion in their dramas. The general term for all dramatic
                    compositions is <hi rend="italic">rtipaka</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >rupa,</hi> form), those of an inferior class being distinguished as <hi
                    rend="italic">uparupakas.</hi> Of the various subdivisions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">rupaka,</hi> in a more limited sense, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >naiaka,</hi> or play proper, represents the most perfect kind. Its subject
                    should always be celebrated and important—it is virtually either heroism or
                    love, and most frequently the latter—and the hero should be a demigod or
                    divinity (such as <hi rend="italic">Rama</hi> in Babhaviiti’s heroic plays) or a
                    king (such as the hero of <hi rend="italic">Sakuntald).</hi> But although the
                    earlier drama tists took their plots from the sacred writings or PurdnAs, they
                    held themselves at liberty to vary the incidents,—a licence from which the later
                    poets abstained. Thus, in accordance, perhaps, with the respective developments
                    in the religious life of the two peoples, the Hindu drama in this respect
                    reversed the progressive practice of the Greek. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >prakaranas</hi> agree in all essentials with the <hi rend="italic">nafakas</hi>
                    except that they are less elevated; their stories are mere fictions, taken from

                    represent the lower extreme of the dramatic scale, to which, of course, the
                    principles that follow only partially apply.</p>
                <p>Unity of action is strictly enjoined by Hindu theory, though not invariably
                    observed in practice. Episodical or prolix interruptions are forbidden; but, in
                    order to facilitate the connection, the story of the play is sometimes carried
                    on by narratives spoken by actors or “interpreters,” something after the fashion

                    one classical play.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    scenery; for the plays were performed in the open courts of palaces, perhaps at
                    times in large halls set apart for public entertainments, or in the open air.

                    should never take place on the stage. Yet such rules are made to be occasionally
                    broken. It is true that the mild humour of the <hi rend="italic">vidushaka</hi>
                    is restricted to his “gesticulating eating” instead of perpetrating the

                    of the actors, which is more or less skilfully connected with the opening of the
                    play itself. This is divided into acts <hi rend="italic">(ankas)</hi> and
                    scenes; of the former a <hi rend="italic">naiaka</hi> should have not fewer than
                    5, or more than 10; 7 appears a common number; “the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >nataka ’</hi> reaches 14. Thus the length of the higher class of Indian plays
                    is considerable—about that of an JEscliyleau trilogy; but not more thana single
                    play was ever performed on the same occasion. Comic plays are restricted to two
                    acts (here called <hi rend="italic">sandhis).</hi> In theory the scheme of an
                    Indian drama corresponds very closely to the general outline of dramatic
                    construction given above; it is a characteristic merit that the business is
                    rarely concluded before the last act. The piece closes, as it began, with a
                    benediction or prayer. Within this framework room is found for situations as
                    ingeniously devised and highly wrought as those in any modern Western play. What
                    could be more pitiful than the scene in <hi rend="italic">Sdkuntald,</hi> where
                    the true wife appears before her husband, whose remembrance of her is fatally
                    overclouded by a charm; what more terrific than that in <hi rend="italic">Mdlati
                    and Madhava,</hi> where the lover rescues his beloved from the horrors of the
                    charnel-field? Recognition—especially between parents and children—frequently
                    gives rise to scenes of a pathos which Euripides lias not surpassed.<note

                    action. With scenes of strong effectiveness contrast others of the most delicate
                    poetic grace—such as the indescribably lovely little episode of the two damsels
                    of the god of love helping one another to pluck the red and green bud from the
                    mango tree; or of gentle domestic pathos—such as that of the courtesan listening
                    to the prattle of her lover’s child, one of the prettiest scenes of a kind
                    rarely kept free from affectation in the modern drama. For the <hi rend="italic"

                    here again amuses itself with an infinitude of subdivisions. Among the heroines
                    are to be noticed the courtesans, whose social position to some extent resembles
                    that of the Greek <hi rend="italic">hetoeroe,</hi> and association with whom
                    does not seem in practice, however it may be in theory, to be regarded as a

                    which Mahometan example seems to have introduced into higher Indian society. The
                    male characters are frequently drawn with skill, and sometimes with genuine
                    force. Prince Samsthanaka<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>lb.</p></note> is a type of selfishness born in the purple worthy to rank
                    beside figures of the modern drama, of which this has at times naturally been a
                    favourite class of character; elsewhere<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hdudrd-Rakshasa.</p></note> the intrigues of ministers are
                    not more fully exposed than their characters and principles of action are
                    judiciously discriminated. Among the lesser personages common in the Indian
                    drama, two are worth noticing, as corresponding though by no means precisely to
                    familiar types of other dramatic literatures. These are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vitd,</hi> the accomplished but dependent companion (both of men and women),
                    and the <hi rend="italic">viddshaka,</hi> the humble associate (not servant) of
                    the prince, and the buffoon of the action.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    always a Brahman, or the pupil of a Brahman. His humour is to be ever intent on
                    the pleasures of a quiet life, and on that of eating in particular; his jokes
                    are always devoid of both harm and point.</p>
                <p>Thus, clothing itself in a diction always ornate and tropical, in which (as
                    Riickert has happily expressed it) the prose is the warp and the verse the weft;
                    in which (as Goethe says) words become allusions, allusions similes, and similes
                    metaphors, the Indian drama essentially depended upon its literary qualities,
                    and upon the familiar sanctity of its favourite themes, for such effect as it
                    was able to produce. Of scenic apparatus it knew but little; the simple devices
                    by which exits and entrances were facilitated it is unnecessary to describe, and
                    on the contrivances it resorted to for such “properties” as were required (above
                    all, the cars of the gods and of their emissaries)<note anchored="true"

                    the other hand, seems always to have been observed, agreeably both to the
                    peculiarities of the Indian drama and to the habits of the Indian people.</p>
                <p>The ministers of an art practised under such conditions could not but be regarded
                    with respect, and spared the contempt or worse, which, except among one other
                    great civilized people, the Greeks, has everywhere at one time or another been
                    the actor’s lot. Companies of actors seem to have been common in India at an
                    early date, and the inductions show the players to have been regarded as
                    respectable members of society. In later if not in earlier times individual
                    actors enjoyed a widespread reputation,—“all the world” is acquainted with the
                    talents of Kalaha-Kandala.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    were usually Brahmans. Female parts were in general, though not invariably,
                    represented by females. One would like to know whether such was the case in a
                    piece<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Viddha-Salabhanjika.</p></note> where—after the fashion of more than one
                    Western play—a crafty minister passes off his daughter as a boy, on which
                    assumption she is all but married to a person of her own sex.</p>
                <p>The Indian drama would, if only for purposes of comparison, be invaluable to the
                    student of this branch of literature. But from the point of view of purely
                    literary excellence it holds its own against all except the very foremost dramas
                    of the world. It is, indeed, a mere phrase to call Kdlid&amp;sa the Indian
                    Shakespeare—a title which, moreover, if intended as anything more than a synonym
                    for poetic pre-eminence, might fairly be disputed in favour of Babhavuti; while
                    it would be absolutely misleading to place a dramatic literature, which, like
                    the Indian, is the mere quintessence of the culture of a caste, by the side of
                    one which represents the fullest development of the artistic consciousness of a
                    people such as the Hellenes. The Indian drama cannot be described as national in
                    the broadest and highest sense of the word; it is, in short, the drama of a
                    literary class, though as such it exhibits many of the noblest and most refined,
                    as well as of the most characteristic, features of Hindu religion and
                    civilization. The ethics of the Indian drama are of a lofty character, but they
                    are those of a scholastic system of religious philosophy, self-conscious of its
                    completeness. To the power of Fate is occasionally ascribed a supremacy, to
                    which gods as well as mortals must bow;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Vikrama and Urvasl.</p></note> but if man’s present life is
                    merely a phase in the cycle of his destinies, the highest of moral efforts at
                    the same time points to the summit of possibilities, and self-sacrifice is the
                    supreme condition both of individual perfection and of the progress of the
                    world. Such conceptions as these seem at once to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0419-0400"/> enfold and to overshad or the moral life of the
                    Indian drama. The affections and passions forming part of self it delineates
                    with a fidelity to nature which no art can neglect; but the freedom of the
                    picture is restricted by conditions which to us are unfamiliar and at times seem
                    intolerable, but which it was impossible for the Indian poet’s imagination to
                    neglect. The sheer self-absorption of ambition or love appears inconceivable by
                    the minds of any of these poets; and their social philosophy is always based on
                    the system of caste. On the other hand, they are masters of many of the truest
                    forms of pathos, above all of that which blends with resignation. In humour of a
                    delicate kind they are by no means deficient; to its lower forms they are
                    generally strangers, even in productions of a professedly comic intention. Of
                    wit, Indian dramatL literature—though a play on words is as the breath of its
                    nostrils—furnishes hardly any examples intelligible to Western notions.</p>
                <p>The distinctive excellence of the Indian drama is to be sought in the poetic robe
                    which envelops it as flowers overspread the bosom of the earth in the season of
                    spring. In its nobler productions, at least, it is never untrue to its half
                    religious, half rural origin; it weaves the wreaths of idyllic fancies in an
                    unbroken chain, adding to its favourite aud familiar blossoms ever fresh
                    beauties from an inexhaustible garden. Nor is it unequal to depicting the
                    grander aspects of nature in her mighty forests and on the shores of the ocean.
                    A profound familiarity with its native literature can here alone follow its
                    diction through a ceaseless flow of phrase and figure, listen with understanding
                    to the hum of the bee as it hangs over the lotus, and contemplate with
                    S^kuntalVs pious sympathy the creeper as it winds round the mango tree. But the
                    poetic beauty of the Indian drama reveals itself in the mysterious charm of its
                    outline, if not in its full glow, even to the untrained; nor should the study of
                    it—for which the materials may yet increase— be left aside by any lover of
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Like the Indian drama, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chinese</hi> arose from the union
                    of the arts of dance and song. To the ballets and pantomimes out of which it
                    developed itself, and which have continued to flourish by the side of its more
                    advanced forms, the Chinese ascribe a primitive antiquity of origin; many of
                    them originally had a symbolical reference to such subjects as the harvest, and
                    war and peace. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> very ancient pantomime is said to have
                    symbolized the conquest of China by Wou-Wang; others were of a humbler, and
                    often of a very obscure, character. To their music the Chinese likewise
                    attribute a great antiquity of origin.</p>
                <p>Though some traditions declare the emperor Wan-Te (fl. about 580 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> to have invented the drama, this honour is more
                    usually given to the emperor Heun-Tsung (720 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi>
                    who is likewise remembered as a radical musical reformer. Pantomimes henceforth
                    fell into disrepute; and the history of the Chinese drama from this date is
                    divided, with an accuracy we cannot profess to control, into four distinct
                    periods, of each of which the plays composed in it are stated to bear the
                    manifest impress. These are</p>
                <p>I. That of the dramas composed <hi rend="italic">under the Tang dynasty,
                    from</hi> 720 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 907 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> These
                    pieces, called <hi rend="italic">Tchhouen-Khi,</hi> were limited to the
                    representation of extraordinary events, and were therefore, in design at least,
                    a species of heroic drama. The ensuing times of civil war interrupted the
                    “pleasures of peace and prosperity” (a Chinese phrase for dramatic
                    performances)—which, however, revived</p>

                <p>III. The best known age of the Chinese drama was <hi rend="italic">under the Kin
                    and Yuen dynasties, from</hi> 1125 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 1367. The plays of
                    this period are called <hi rend="italic">Yuen-Pen</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tsa-Ki;</hi> the latter seem to have resembled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hi-Khio,</hi> and to have treated very various subjects. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yuen-Pen</hi> are the plays from which our literary knowledge of the Chinese
                    drama is mainly derived; the short pieces called <hi rend="italic">Yen-Kia</hi>
                    were in the same style, but briefer. The list of dramatic authors under the Yuen
                    dynasty is tolerably extensive, comprising 85, among whom four are designated as
                    courtesans; the number of plays composed by these and by anonymous authors is
                    reckoned at not less than 564. In 1735 the Jesuit missionary Prdmare first
                    revealed to Europe the existence of the tragedy <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tchao-Chi-Cu-Etil (The Little Orphan of the House of Tchad),</hi> which was
                    founded upon an earlier piece treating of the fortunes of an heir to the
                    imperial throne, who was preserved in a mysterious box like another Cypselus or
                    Moses. Voltaire seized the theme of the earlier play for a rhetorical tragedy,
                    in which he coolly professes it was his intention “to paint the manners of the
                    Chinese and the Tartars.” The later play, which is something less elevated in
                    the rauk of its characters, and very decidedly less refined in treatment, was
                    afterwards retranslated by Stanislas Julien; and to the labours of this scholar,
                    of Sir J. F. Davis, and of Bazin the elder, we owe a series of translated
                    Chinese dramas, among which there cau be no hesitation whatever in designating
                    the master-piece. The justly famous <hi rend="italic">Pi-Pa-Ki (The Story of the
                    Lute)</hi> belongs to a period rather later than that of the Yuen plays, having
                    been composed towards the close of the 14th century by Kao-Tong-Kia, and
                    reproduced in 1404, under the Ming dynasty, with the alterations of Mao-Tseu, a
                    commentator of learning and taste. <hi rend="italic">Pi-Pa-Ki,</hi> which as a
                    domestic drama of sentiment possesses very high merit, long enjoyed a quite
                    exceptional popularity in China; it was repeatedly republished with laudatory
                    prefaces, and so late as the 18th century was regarded as a monument of
                    morality, and as the master-piece of the Chinese theatre. It would seem to have
                    remained without any worthy competitors, for although it had been originally
                    designed to produce a reaction against the immorality of the drama then in
                    fashion, especially of Wang-Chi-Fou’s celebrated <hi rend="italic">Si-Siang-Ki
                    (The Story of the Western Pavilion),</hi> yet</p>
                <p>IV. The period of the Chinese drama <hi rend="italic">tinder the Ming dynasty,
                    from</hi> 1368 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 1644, exhibited no improvement “What”
                    (says the preface to the 1704 edition of <hi rend="italic">Pi-Pa-Ki)</hi> “do
                    you find there? Farcical dialogue, a mass of scenes in which one fancies one
                    hears the hubbub of the streets or the ignoble language of the highways, the
                    extravagances of demons and spirits, in addition to loveintrigues repugnant to
                    delicacy of manners.” Nor would it appear that the Chinese theatre has ever
                    recovered from its decay.</p>
                <p>In theory, no drama could be more consistently elevated in purpose and in tone
                    than the Chinese. Every play, we learn, should have both a moral and a meaning.
                    A virtuous aim is imposed upon Chinese dramatists by an article of the penal
                    code of the empire; and those who write immoral plays are to expect after death
                    a purgatory which will last so long as these plays continue to be performed. In
                    practice, however, the Chinese drama falls far short of its ideal; indeed,
                    according to the native critic already cited, among ten thousand playwrights not
                    one is to be found intent upon perfecting the education of mankind by means of
                    precepts and examples.</p>
                <p>The Chinese are, like the Hindus, unacquainted with the distinction between
                    tragedy and comedy; they classify their plays according to subjects in twelve
                    categories. It may be doubted whether what seems the highest of these is
                    actually such; for the religious element in the Chinese drama is often sheer
                    buffoonery. Moreover, Chinese <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0420-0401"/> religious life as reflected in the drama seems
                    one in which creed elbows creed, and superstitions are welcome whatever their
                    origin. Of all religious traditions and doctrines, however, those of Buddhism
                    (which had reached China long before the known beginnings of its drama) are the
                    most perceptible; thus, the theme of absolute self-sacrifice is treated in one
                    play,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Self-Sacrifice
                    of Tchao-Li.</p></note> that of entire absorption in the religious life in

                    unknown to the Chinese; and although a law prohibits the bringing on the stage
                    of “emperors, empresses, and the famous princes, ministers, and generals of
                    former ages,” no such restriction is observed in practice. Tn <hi rend="italic"
                    >Han-Kong-Tseu (The Sorrows of Han),</hi> for instance, which treats a national
                    historic legend strangely recalling in parts the story of Esther and the myth of
                    the daughter of Erechtheus, the Emperor Yuen-Ti (the representative, to be sure,
                    of a fallen dynasty) plays a part, and a sufficiently sorry one. By far the
                    greater number, however, of the Chinese plays accessible in translations belong
                    to the domestic species, and t-o that sub-species which may be called the
                    criminal drama. Their favourite virtue is piety, of a formal<note

                    little to be desired by the most ardent devotees of the literature of agony.
                    Besides this description of plays, we have at least one love-comedy pure and
                    simple—a piece of a nature not “tolerably mild,” but ineffably harmless.<note

                <p>Free in its choice of themes, the Chinese drama is likewise remarkably
                    unrestricted in its range of characters. Chinese society, it is well known, is
                    not based, like Indian, upon the principle of caste; rank is in China determined
                    by office, and this again depends on the results of examination. These familiar
                    facts are constantly brought home to the reader of Chinese plays. The <hi

                    mere class the Chinese drama is no respecter, painting with noteworthy freedom
                    the virtues and the vices of nearly every phase of society. The same liberty is
                    taken with regard to the female sex; it is clear that in earlier times there
                    were few vexatious restrictions in Chinese life upon the social intercourse
                    between men and women. The variety of female characters in the Chinese drama is
                    great, ranging from the heroine who sacrifices herself for the sake of an

                <p>The conduct of the plays exhibits much ingenuity, and an aversion from
                    restrictions of time and place; in fact, the nature of the plot constantly
                    covers a long series of years, and spans wide intervals of local distance. The
                    plays are divided into acts and scenes—the former being usually four in number,
                    at times with an induction or narrative prologue spoken by some of the
                    characters <hi rend="italic">(Sie-Tsen).</hi> Favourite plays were, however,
                    allowed to extend to great length; the <hi rend="italic">Pi-Pa-Ki</hi> is
                    divided into 24 sections, and in another recension apparently comprised 42. “I
                    do not wish,” says the manager in the prologue, “that this performance should
                    last too long; finish it to-day, but cut out nothing,”—whence it appears that
                    the performance of some plays occupied more than a single day. The rule was
                    always observed that a separate act should be given up to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >denouement;</hi> while, according to a theory of which it is not always easy to
                    trace the operation, the perfection of construction was sought in the dualism or
                    contrast of scene and scene, just as the perfection of diction was placed in the
                    parallelism or antithesis of phrase and phrase. Being subject to no restrictions
                    as to what might, or might not, be represented on the stage, the conduct of the
                    plots allowed of the introduction of almost every variety of incidents. Death

                    play. It should be added that the characters save the necessity for a bill of
                    the play by persistently? announcing and re-announcing their names and
                    genealogies, and the necessity for a book by frequently recapitulating the
                    previous course of the plot.</p>
                <p>One peculiarity of the Chinese drama remains to be noticed. The chief character
                    of a play represents the author as well as the personage; he or she is hero or
                    heroine and chorus in one. This is brought about by the hero’s (or heroine’s)
                    <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> the poetical passages, or those containing maxims
                    of wisdom and morality, or reminiscences and examples drawn from legend or
                    history. Arising out of the dialogue, these passages at the same time diversify
                    it, and give to it such elevation and brilliancy as it can boast. The singing
                    character must be the principal personage in the action, but may be taken from
                    any class of society. If this personage dies in the course of the play, another
                    sings in his place. From the mention of this distinctive feature of the Chinese
                    drama it will be obvious how unfair it would ' be to judge of any of its
                    productions without a due appreciation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n421/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0421-0402"/> of the lyric passages, which do not appear to be
                    altogether restricted to the singing of the principal personage, for other
                    characters frequently “recite verses.” In these lyrical or didactic passages are
                    to be sought those flowers of diction which, as Julien has shown, consist partly
                    in the use of a metaphorical phraseology of infinite nicety in its
                    variations—such as a long series of phrases compounded with the word signifying
                    <hi rend="italic">jet</hi> and expressing severally the ideas of rarity,
                    distinction, beauty, &amp;c., or as others derived from the names of colours,
                    birds, beasts, precious metals, elements, constellations, &amp;c., or alluding
                    to favourite legends or anecdotes. These features constitute the literary
                    element <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of Chinese dramatic composition.
                    At the same time, though it is impossible for the untrained reader to be alive
                    to the charms of so unfamiliar a phraseology, it may be questioned whether even
                    in its diction the Chinese drama can claim to be regarded as really poetic. It

                    restricted to ingenuity of construction and variety of character—merits, in
                    themselves important, which no candid criticism will deny to it. Its
                    master-piece is not only truly pathetic in the conception and the main
                    situations of its action, but includes scenes of singular grace and delicacy of
                    treatment—such as that where the re married husband of the deserted heroine in
                    vain essays in the presence of his second wife to sing to his new lute, now that
                    he has cast aside the old.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>I While in the north of China houses are temporarily set apart for dramatic
                    performances, in the south these are usually confined to theatres erected in the
                    streets <hi rend="italic">(Hi-Thai).</hi> Thus scenic decorations of any
                    importance must always have been out of question in the Chinese theatre. The
                    costumes, on the other hand, are described as magnificent; they are
                    traditionally those worn before the 17th century, in accordance with the
                    historical colouring of most of the plays. The actor’s profession is not a
                    respectable one in China, the managers being in the habit of buying children of
                    slaves and bringing them up as slaves of their own. Women may not appear on the
                    stage, since the emperor Khien-Long admitted an actress among his concubines;
                    female parts are therefore played by lads, occasionally by eunuchs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Japanese</hi> drama, as all evidence seems to agree in
                    showing, still remains what in substance it has always been—an amusement
                    passionately loved by the lower orders, but dignified by no literature deserving
                    the name. Apart from its native elements of music, dance, and song, and
                    legendary or historical narrative and pantomime, it is clearly to be regarded as
                    a Chinese importation; nor has it in its more advanced forms apparently even
                    attempted to emancipate itself from the reproduction of the conventional Chinese
                    types. As early as the close of the 6th century Hada Kawatsu, a man of Chinese
                    extraction, but born in Japan, is said to have been ordered to arrange
                    entertainments for the benefit of the country, and to have written as many as
                    thirty-three plays. The Japanese, however, ascribe the origin of their drama to
                    the introduction of the dance called <hi rend="italic">Sambdso</hi> as a charm
                    against a volcanic depression of the earth which occurred in 805; and this dance
                    appears still to be used as a prelude to theatrical exhibitions. In 1108 lived a
                    woman called Iso no Zenji, who is looked upon a3 “the mother of the Japanese
                    drama.” But her performances seem to have been confined to dancing or posturing
                    in male attire <hi rend="italic">(otoko-mai);</hi> and the introduction of the
                    drama proper is universally attributed to Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who in 1624 opened
                    the first theatre <hi rend="italic">(sibaia)</hi> at Yeddo. Not long afterwards
                    (1651) the play-houses were removed to their present site in the capital; and
                    both here and in the provincial towns, especially of the north, the drama has
                    since continued to flourish. Persons of rank are never seen at these theatres;
                    but actors are occasionally engaged to play in private at the houses of the
                    nobles, who appear formerly themselves to have taken part in performances of a
                    species of opera affected by them, always treating patriotic legends and called
                    <hi rend="italic">no.</hi> The Mikado only has a court theatre.</p>
                <p>Tho subjects of the popular plays are to a large extent historical, though the
                    names of the characters are changed. An example is to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">jdturi,</hi> or musical romance, in which the universally popular
                    tale of <hi rend="italic">Chiushingura (The Loyal League}</hi> has been
                    amplified and adapted for theatrical representation. This famous narrative of
                    the feudal fidelity of the forty-seven <hi rend="italic">ronins,</hi> who about
                    the year 1699 revenged their chief’s judicial suicide upon the arrogant official
                    to whom it was due, is stirring rather than touching in its incidents, and
                    contains much bloodshed, together with a tea-house scene which suffices as a
                    specimen of the Japanese comedy of manners. One of the books of this dramatic
                    romance consists of a metrical description, mainly in dialogue, of a journey
                    which (after the fashion of Indian plays) has to be performed on the stage.
                    Other popular plays are mentioned dealing with similar themes, besides which
                    there are domestic dramas of a very realistic kind, and often highly improper,
                    though all intrigues against married women are excluded. Fairy— and demon—operas
                    and ballets, and farces and <hi rend="italic">intermezzos</hi> form an easy
                    transition to the interludes of tumblers and jugglers. As a specimen of nearly
                    every class is required to make up a Japanese theatrical entertainment—which
                    lasts from sunrise to sunset—and as the lower houses appropriate and mutilate
                    the plays of the higher, it is clear that the condition of the Japanese theatre
                    cannot be regarded as promising. In respect, however, of its movable scenery and
                    properties, it is stated to be in advance of its Chinese prototype. The
                    performers are, except in the ballet, males only. Though the leading actors
                    enjoy great popularity and very respectable salaries, the class is held in
                    contempt, and the companies were formerly recruited from the lowest sources. The
                    disabilities under which they lay have, however, been removed; nor is it
                    impossible that the reign of progress in Japan may revolutionize an agency of
                    civilization which it seems for the present to have regarded as beneath its
                    notice.</p>

                <p>No traces of a drama exist in any of the other civilized peoples of Asia—for that
                    in Siam may probably be regarded as a branch of the Indian. Among the Hebrews
                    and other Semitic peoples, as well as in at least one originally Aryan people of
                    Asia which has cultivated letters with assiduity and success—the Persians —the
                    dramatic art is either wanting, or only appears as an occasional and exotic
                    growth. It is unnecessary to dwell on the dramatic <hi rend="italic"
                    >element</hi> apparent in two of the books of the Hebrew Scripture—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Ruth</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Book of Job. Qi</hi>
                    the dramatic element in the religious rites of the Egyptians a word will be said
                    immediately; meanwhile it may be convenient at once to state that traces of
                    dramatic entertainments have been found in various parts of the New World, which
                    it cannot be part of the present sketch to pursue. Among these are the
                    performances, accompanied by dancing and intermixed with recitation and singing,
                    of the South-Sea Islanders, first described by Captain Cook, and lately
                    reintroduced to the notice of students of comparative mythology by Mr W. Wyatt
                    Gill. Of the so-called Inca drama of the Peruvians, the unique relic, <hi
                    rend="italic">Apu Olio nt ay,</hi> said to have been written down in the Quichua
                    tongue from native dictation by Spanish priests shortly after the conquest of
                    Peru, has been partly translated by Mr Clements Markham, and recently twice
                    rendered into German verse. It appears to be an historic play of the heroic
                    type, combining stirring incidents with a pathos finding expression in at least
                    one lyric of some sweetness—the lament for the lost Collyar. With it may be
                    contrasted the ferocious Aztek dramatic ballet, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rabinal-Acld</hi> (translated by the Abb6 de Bourbourg), of which the text
                    seems rather a succession of warlike harangues than an attempt at dramatic
                    treatment of character. But these are mere isolated curiosities.</p>
                <p>The civilization and religious ideas of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Egyptians
                    so</hi> vitally influenced the people of whose drama we are about to speak that
                    a reference to them cannot be altogether omitted. The influence of Egyptian upon
                    Greek civilization has probably been over-estimated by Herodotus; but while it
                    will never be clearly known how much the Greeks owed to the Egyptians in divers
                    branches of knowledge, it is certain that the former confessed themselves the
                    scholars of Egypt in the cardinal doctrine of its natural theology. The doctrine
                    of the immortality of the soul there found its most solemn expression in
                    mysterious recitations connected with the rites of sepulture, and treatiug of
                    the migration of the soul from its earthly to its eternal abode. These
                    solemnities, whose transition into the Hellenic mysteries has usually been
                    attributed to the agency of the Thracian worship of Dionysus, undoubtedly
                    contained a dramatic element, upon the extent of which it is, however, useless
                    to speculate. The ideas to which they sought to give utterance centred in that
                    of Osiris, the vivifying power or universal soul of nature, whom Herodotus
                    simply identifies with the Dionysus of the Greeks. The same deity was likewise
                    honoured by processions among the rural Egyptian population, which, according to
                    the same authority, in nearly all respects except the absence of choruses
                    resembled the Greek phallic processions in honour of the wine-god.</p>
                <p>That the Egyptians looked upon music as an important science seems fully
                    established; it was diligently studied by their priests, though not, as among
                    the Greeks, forming a part of general education, and in the. sacred rites of
                    their gods they as a rule permitted the use of flute and harp, as well as of
                    vocal music. Dancing was as an art confined to professional persons; but though
                    the higher orders abstained from its practice, the lower indulged in it on
                    festive occasions, when a tendency to pantomime naturally asserted itself, and
                    licence and wanton buffoonery prevailed, as in the early rustic festivals <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the Greek and Italian peoples. Of a dance of armed men, on
                    the other hand, there seems no satisfactory trace in the representations of the
                    Egyptian monuments.</p>
                <p>But whatever elements the <hi rend="smallcaps">Greek</hi> drama may, in the
                    sources from which it sprang, have owed to Egyptian, or Phrygian, or other
                    Asiatic influences, its development was independent and self-sustained. Not only
                    in its beginnings, but so long as the stage existed in Greece, the drama was in
                    intimate connection with the national religion. This is the most signal feature
                    of its history, and one which cannot in the same degree and to the same extent
                    be ascribed to the drama of any other people, ancient or modern. Not only did
                    both the great branches of the Greek drama alike originate in the usages of
                    religious worship, but they never lost their formal union with it, though one of
                    them (comedy) in its later growth abandoned all direct reference to its origin.
                    Hellenic polytheism was at once so active and so fluid or flexible in its
                    anthropomorphic formations, that no other religious system has ever so
                    victoriously assimilated to itself foreign elements, or so vivaciously and
                    variously developed its own. Thus, the worship of Dionysus, introduced into
                    Greece by the Phoenicians as that of the tauriform sun-god whom his worshippers
                    adored with loud cries (whence <hi rend="italic">Bacchus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Iacchus),</hi> and the god of generation (whence his <hi
                    rend="italic">phaUic</hi> emblem) and production, was brought into connection
                    with the Dorian religion of the sun-god Apollo. Apollo and his sister, again,
                    corresponded to the Pelasgian and Achaean divinities of sun and moon, whom the
                    Phoenician Dionysus and Demeter superseded, or with whose worship theirs was
                    blended. Dionysus, whose rites were specifically conducted with reference to his
                    attributes as the wine-god, was attended by deified representations of his
                    original worshippers, who wore the skin of the goat sacrificed to him. These
                    were the <hi rend="italic">satyrs.</hi> Out of the connected worships of
                    Dionysus, Bacchus, Apollo, and Demeter sprang the beginnings of the Greek
                    drama.</p>
                <p>“Both tragedy and comedy,” says Aristotle, “originated in a rude and
                    unpremeditated manner,—the first from the leaders of the dithyramb, and the
                    second from those who led off the phallic songs.” This diversity of origin, and
                    the distinction jealously maintained down to the latest times between the two
                    branches of the dramatic art, even where they might seem to come into actual
                    contact with one another, necessitate a separate statement as to the origin and
                    history of either.</p>
                <p>The custom of offering thanks to the gods by hymns and dances in the places of
                    public resort was first practised by the Greeks in the Dorian states, whose
                    whole system of life was organized on a military basis. Hence the dances of the
                    Dorians originally taught or imitated the movements of soldiers, and their hymns
                    were warlike chants. Such were the beginnings of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chorus,</hi> and of its songs (called <hi rend="italic">paeans,</hi> from an
                    epithet of Apollo), accompanied first by the phorminx and then by the flute. A
                    step in advance was taken when the poet with his trained singers and dancers,
                    like the Indian <hi rend="italic">sutra-dhara,</hi> performed these religious
                    functions as the representative of the population. From the Doric <hi
                    rend="italic">paean</hi> at a very early period several styles of choral dancing
                    formed themselves, to which the three styles of dance in scenic productions—the
                    tragic, the comic, and the satyric—are stated afterwards to have corresponded.
                    But none of these could have led to a literary growth. This was due to the
                    introduction among the Dorians of the <hi rend="italic">dithyramb,</hi>
                    —originally a song of revellers, probably led by a flute-player and accompanied
                    by the music of other Eastern instruments, in which it was customary in Crete to
                    celebrate the birth of Bacchus (the doubly-born) and possibly also his later
                    adventures. The leader of the band <pb break="no"

                    dithyramb was reduced to a definite form by the Lesbiau Arion (fl. 610), who

                    <hi rend="italic">cyclic</hi> chorus, invented a style of music adapted to the

                    with which it dealt, was <hi rend="italic">established</hi> according to fixed
                    rules by his contemporary Stesichorus. About the same time that Arion introduced
                    these improvements into the Dorian city of Corinth, the (likewise Dorian)
                    Families at Sicyon honoured the hero-king Adrastus by tragic choruses. Hence the
                    invention of tragedy was ascribed by the Sicyonians to their poet Epigenes; but
                    this step, significant for the future history of the Greek drama, of employing
                    the Bacchic chorus for the celebration of other than Bacchic themes, was soon
                    annulled by the tyrant Clisthenes.</p>
                <p>The element which transformed lyrical tragedy into the tragic drama was added by
                    the Ionians. The custom of the recitation of poetry by wandering minstrels
                    called <hi rend="italic">rhaptsodes</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">paftSos,</hi>
                    staff, or from pa7rra&gt;, to piece together) first sprang up in the Ionia
                    beyond the sea; to such minstrels was due the spread of the Homeric poems and of
                    subsequent epic cycles. These recitations, with or without musical
                    accompaniment, soon included gnomic or didactic, as well as epic, verse; if
                    Homer was a rhapsode, so was the sententious or “moral” Hesiod. The popular
                    effect of these recitations was enormously increased by the metrical innovations
                    of Archilochus (from 708), who invented the trochee and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >iambus,</hi> the latter the arrowy metre which is the native form of satirical
                    invective—the species of composition in which Archilochus excelled—though it was
                    soon used for other purposes also. The recitation of these iambics may already
                    have nearly approached to theatrical declamation. The rhapsodes were welcome
                    guests at popular festivals, where they exercised their art in mutual emulation,
                    or ultimately recited parts, perhaps the whole, of longer poems. The recitation
                    of a long epic may thus have resembled theatrical dialogue; that of alternating
                    iambic poems, the form being frequently an address in the second person, even
                    more so. The rhapsode was in some sense an actor; and when these recitations
                    reached Attica, they thus brought with them the germs of theatrical
                    dialogue.</p>
                <p>The rhapsodes were actually introduced into Attica at a very early period; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> we know, was chanted at the Brauronia, a rural
                    festival of Bacchus, whose worship had early entered Attica, and was cherished
                    among its rustic population. Meanwhile the cyclic chorus of the Dorians had
                    found its way into Attica and Athens, ever since the Athenians had recognized
                    the authority of the great centre of the Apolline religion at Delphi. It
                    therefore only remained for the rhapsodic and the cyclic—in other words, for the
                    epic and the choral—elements to coalesce; and this must have been brought about
                    by a union of the two accompaniments of religious worship in the festive rites
                    of Bacchus, and by the domestication of these rites in the ruling city. This
                    occurred in the time of Pisistratus, perhaps after his restoration in 554. To
                    Thespis (535), said to have been a contemporary of the tyrant and a native of a
                    Diacrian deme (Icaria), the invention of tragedy is accordingly ascribed.
                    Whether his name be that of an actual person or not, his claim to be regarded as
                    the inventor of tragedy is founded on the statement that he introduced an actor
                    for the sake of relieving the Dionysian chorus. This actor, the representative
                    of the rhapsodes, and doubtless, at first, generally the poet himself, instead
                    of merely alternating his recitations with the songs of the chorus, addressed
                    his speech to its leader—the <hi rend="italic">coryphaeus—</hi> with whom he
                    thus carried on a species of <hi rend="italic">dialogue.</hi> The chorus stood
                    round its leader upon the steps of the Bacchic altar <hi rend="italic"
                    >(thymele),</hi> the actor was placed upon a table. This table is the
                    predecessor of the stage, for the waggon of Thespis is a fiction, probably due
                    to a confusion between his table and the waggon of Susarion. It is a significant
                    minor invention ascribed to Thespis, that he disguised the actor’s face first by
                    means of a pigment, afterwards by a mask. In the dialogue was treated a myth
                    relating to Bacchus or some other deity or hero. Whether or not Thespis actually
                    wrote tragedies (and there seems no reason to doubt it), and although both the
                    cyclic chorus atid rhapsodic recitation continued in separate use, tragedy was
                    now in existence. The essential additions afterwards made to its simple
                    framework were remarkably few. JEschylus added a second actor, and by reducing
                    the functions of the chorus further established the dialogue as the principal
                    part of the action. Sophocles added a third actor, by which change the
                    preponderance of the dialogue was’ made complete.</p>
                <p>If the origin of Greek comedy is simpler in its nature than that of Greek
                    tragedy, the beginnings of its progress are involved in more obscurity. It is
                    said to have been invented by Susarion, a native of Megaris, whose inhabitants
                    were famed for their coarse humour, which they communicated to their colonies in
                    Sicily. In this island, to this day the home of spontaneous mimicry, comedy was
                    said to have arisen. In the rural Bacchic vintage-festivals bands of jolly
                    companions <hi rend="smallcaps">(kw/zos,</hi> properly a revel continued after
                    supper) went about in carts or afoot, carrying the phallic emblem, and indulging
                    in the ribald licence of wanton mirth. From the song sung in these processions
                    or at the Bacchic feasts, which combined the praise of the god with gross
                    personal ridicule, and was called <hi rend="italic">comus</hi> in a secondary
                    sense, the Bacchic reveller taking part in it was called a comws-singer or <hi
                    rend="italic">comoedus.</hi> These phallic processions, which were afterwards
                    held at Athens as in all Greek cities, imparted their character to Old Attic
                    comedy, whose essence was personal vilification.</p>
                <p>Thus independent of one another in their origin, Greek tragedy and comedy never
                    actually coalesced. The <hi rend="italic">satyrdrama,</hi> though in some sense
                    it partook of the nature of both, was in its origin as in its history connected
                    with tragedy alone. Pratinas of Phlius, a contemporary of .zEschylus in his
                    earlier days, is said to have restored the tragic chorus to the satyrs, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> he first produced dramas the same in form and theme as
                    the tragedies, but in which the dances were different and entirely carried on by
                    satyrs. The tragic poets, while never writing comedies, henceforth also composed
                    satyr-dramas; but neither tragedies nor satyrdramas were ever written by the
                    comic poets, and it was in conjunction with tragedies only that the satyr-dramas
                    were performed. The theory of the Platonic Socrates, that the same man ought to
                    be the best tragic and the best comic poet, was never exemplified in practice.
                    The so-called <hi rend="italic">hilaro-tragedy</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tragi-comedy</hi> of later writers, thought in some of its features to have
                    been anticipated by Euripides,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Alcestis; Orestes.</p></note> in form nowise differed from
                    tragedy; it merely contained a comic element in its characters, and invariably
                    had a happy ending. The serious and sentimental element in the comedy of
                    Menander and his contemporaries did far more to destroy the essential difference
                    between the two great branches of the Greek dramatic art.</p>
                <p>The history of Greek—which virtually always remained Attic—tragedy divides itself
                    into three periods.</p>

                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The period before jEschylus</hi> (535-499).—From this we
                    have but a few names of authors and plays—those of the former being (besides
                    Thespis) Choerilus, Phrynichus, and Prdtinas, all of whom lived to contend with
                    Aeschylus for the tragic prize. To each of them certain innovations are
                    ascribed—among the rest the introduction of female characters to Phrynichus.</p>
                <p>II <hi rend="italic">The classical period of Attic tragedy—</hi> that of
                    Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and their contemporaries (499-405).—To this
                    belong all the really important phases in the progress of Greek tragedy, which
                    severally connect themselves with the names of its three great masters. They may
                    be regarded as the representatives of different generations of Attic history and
                    life, though of course in these, as in the progress of their art itself, there
                    is an unbroken continuity. AEschylus (525-456) had not only fought both at
                    Marathon and at Salamis against those Persians whose rout he celebrated with
                    patriotic pride,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Pcrsce.</p></note> but he had been trained in the Eleusinian mysteries, and
                    was a passionate upholder of the institution most intimately associated with the
                    primitive political traditions of the past—the Areopagus.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Eumenides.</p></note> He had been born in the
                    generation after Solon, to whose maxims he fondly clung; he must have belonged
                    to that antidemocratical party which favoured the Spartan alliance, and it was
                    the Dorian development of Hellenic life and the philosophical system based upon
                    it with which his religious and moral convictions were imbued. Thus even upon
                    the generation which succeeded him the chivalrous spirit and diction of his
                    poetry, and the unapproached sublimity of hi3 dramatic imagination, fell, as it
                    falls upon later posterity, like the note of a mightier age. Sophocles (495-405)
                    was the associate of Pericles, and an upholder of hi3 authority rather than a
                    consistent pupil of his political ideas; but his manhood and perhaps the
                    maturity of his genius coincided with the great days when he could stand, like
                    his mighty friend and the community they both so gloriously represented, on the
                    sunny heights of achievement. Serenely pious, he yet treats the myths of the
                    national religion in the spirit of a conscious artist, contrasting with lofty
                    irony the struggles of humanity with the irresistible march of its destinies.
                    His art (which he described as having passed through three successive stages)
                    may in its perfection be said to typify the watchful and creative calm of his
                    city’s imperial epoch. Euripides (480-406), as is the fate of genius of a more
                    complex kind, has been more variously and antithetically judged than either of
                    his great fellow-tragedians. His art has been called thinner and tamer than
                    theirs, his genius rhetorical rather than poetical, his morality that of a
                    sophistical wit. On the other hand, lie has been recognized not only as the most
                    tragic of the Attic tragedians and the most pathetic of ancient poets, but also
                    as the most humane in his social philosophy and the most various in his
                    psychological insight. At least though far removed from the naiver age of the
                    national life, he is, both in patriotic spirit and in his choice of themes,
                    genuinely Attic; and if he was “haunted on the stage by the daemon of Socrates,”
                    he was, like Socrates himself, the representative of an age which was a
                    seed-time as well as a season of decay. To Euripides the general progress of
                    dramatic literature owes more than to any other ancient poet. Tragedy followed
                    in his footsteps in Greece and at Rome; comedy owed him something in the style
                    of the very Aristophanes who mocked him, and more in the sentiments of Menander;
                    and when the modern drama came to engraft the aucient upon its own crude growth,
                    his was directly or indirectly the most powerful influence in the establishment
                    of a living connection between them.</p>
                <p>The incontestable pre-eminence of the three great tragic poets was acknowledged
                    at Athens by the usage allowing no tragedies but theirs to be more than once
                    performed, and by the law of Lycurgus <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 330) which
                    obliged the actors to use, in the case of works of the great masters, authentic
                    copies preserved in the public archives. It is thus not impossible that the
                    value of later Attic tragedy, of which the fertility continued considerable, has
                    been under-rated. In all the names of 1400 tragedies and satyr-dramas are
                    preserved; and tragic poets are mentioned of whose plays no names are known.
                    Among the more celebrated Attic tragedians contemporary with the great writers,
                    Ion of Chios (d. before 419) seems to have followed earlier traditions of style
                    than Euripides; Agathon, who survived the latter, on the other hand, introduced
                    certain innovations of a transnormal kind into the art of tragic
                    composition.</p>
                <p>III. Of the <hi rend="italic">third period</hi> of Greek tragedy the concluding
                    limit cannot be precisely fixed. Down to the days of Alexander the Great, Athens
                    remained the chief home of tragedy. Though tragedies must have begun to be acted
                    at the Syracusan and Macedonian courts, since Aeschylus, Euripides, and Agathon
                    had sojourned there,—though the practice of producing plays at the Dionysia
                    before the allies of Athens must have led to their holding similar exhibitions
                    at home,—yet before the death of Alexander we meet with no instance of a tragic
                    poet writing or a tragedy written outside Athens. An exception should indeed be
                    made in favour of the tyrant Dionysius of Syracuse, who (like Critias in his
                    earlier days at Athens) was “addicted to” tragic composition. Not all the
                    tragedians of this period, however, were Athenians born; though the names of
                    Euphorion, the son of Aeschylus, Iophon, the son of Sophocles, and Euripides and
                    Sophocles, the nephew and the grandson respectively of their great namesakes,
                    illustrate the descent of the tragic art as an hereditary family possession.
                    Chaeremon (fl. 380) already exhibits tragedy on the road to certain decay, for
                    we learn that his plays were written for reading.</p>
                <p>Soon after the death of Alexander theatres are found spread over the whole
                    Hellenic world of Europe and Asia— a result to which the practice of the
                    conqueror and his father of celebrating their victories by scenic performances
                    had doubtless contributed. Alexandria having now become a literary centre with
                    which even Athens was in some respects unable to compete, while the latter still
                    remained the home of comedy, the tragic poets flocked to the capital of the
                    Ptolemies; and here, in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus (283-247) flourished
                    the seven tragic poets famed as the “Pleias,” who still wrote in the style and
                    followed the rules observed by the Attic masters. Tragedy and the dramatic art
                    continued to be favoured by the later Ptolemies; and about 100 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> we meet with the curious phenomenon of a Jewish poet,
                    Ezechiel, composing Greek tragedies, of one of which (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exodus</hi> from Egypt) fragments have come down to us. Tragedy, with the
                    satyrdrama and comedy, survived in Alexandria beyond the days of Cicero and
                    Varro, nor was their doom finally sealed till the Emperor Caracalla abolished
                    theatrical performances in the Egyptian capital in 217 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>During the whole of its productive age Greek tragedy seems to have adhered to the
                    lines laid down by its great Attic masters; nor were these in most respects
                    departed from by the Roman imitators of these poets and of their successors.</p>
                <p>Tragedy was defined by Plato as an imitation of the noblest life. Its proper
                    themes—the deeds and sufferings of heroes—were familiar to audiences intimately
                    acquainted with the mythology of the national religion. To such themes Greek
                    tragedy almost wholly confined itself; and in later days there were numerous

                    introduce allusions to contemporary events and persons; and the indulgence of
                    this tendency was facilitated by the revision <hi rend="italic">(διaσκeυη)</hi>
                    to which the works of the great poets were subjected by them, or by those who

                    Shakespeare as improved by Colley Cibber. The later tragedians also appear to
                    have occasionally transposed long speeches or episodes from one tragedy into
                    another—a device largely followed by the Roman dramatists, and called <hi

                    the subjects of the tragedies before Aeschylus were derived from the epos; and
                    it was a famous saying of this poet that his dramas were “but dry scraps from
                    the great banquets of Homer ”—an expression which may be understood as including
                    the poems which belong to the so-called Homeric cycles. Sophocles, Euripides,
                    and their successors likewise resorted to the Trojan, and also to the Heracleau
                    and the Thesean myths, and to Attic legend in general, as well as to Theban, to
                    which already Aeschylus had had recourse, and to the side or subsidiary myths
                    connected with these several groups. These substantially remained to the last
                    the themes of Greek tragedy, the Trojan myths always retaining so prominent a
                    place that Lucian could jest on the universality of their dominion. Purely
                    invented subjects were occasionally treated by the later tragedians; of this
                    innovation Agathon was the originator.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A nthos (The Flower).</p></note></p>
                <p>Thespis is said to have introduced the use of a <hi rend="italic">prologue</hi>
                    and a <hi rend="italic">rhesis</hi> (speech)—the former being probably the
                    opening speech recited by this solitary actor, the latter the dialogue between
                    actor and chorus. It was a natural result of the introduction of the second
                    actor that a second <hi rend="italic">rhesis</hi> should likewise be added; and
                    this tripartite division would be the earliest form of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >trilogy,—</hi> three sections of the same myth forming the beginning, middle,
                    and end of a single drama, marked off from one another by the choral songs. From
                    this Aeschylus proceeded to the treatment of these several portions of a myth in
                    three separate plays, connected together by their subject and by being performed
                    in sequence on a single occasion. This is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeschylean</hi><hi rend="italic">trilogy,</hi> of which we have only one extant
                    example, the <hi rend="italic">Orestea,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> as to which
                    critics may differ whether Aeschylus adhered in it to his principle that the
                    strength should lie in the middle—in other words, that the interest should
                    centre in the second play. In any case, the symmetry of the trilogy was
                    destroyed by the practice of performing after it a satyr-drama, probably, as a
                    rule, if not always, connected in subject with the trilogy, which thus became a
                    <hi rend="italic">tetralogy,</hi> though this term, unlike the other, seems to
                    be a purely technical expression invented by the learned.<note anchored="true"

                    vehicle of personal ridicule, applied it to a purpose like that of Old Attic
                    comedy.</p></note></p>
                <p>Sophocles, a more conscious and probably a more self-critical artist than
                    Aeschylus, may be assumed from the first to have elaborated his tragedies with
                    greater care; and to this, as well as to his innovation of the third actor,
                    which materially added to the fulness of the action, we may attribute his
                    introduction of the custom of contending for the prize with single plays. It
                    does not follow that he never produced connected trilogies, though we have no
                    example of such by him or any later author; on the other hand, there is no proof
                    that either he or any of his successors ever departed from the Aeschylean rule
                    of producing three tragedies, followed by a satyr-drama, on the same day. This
                    remained the third and last stage in the history of the construction of Attic
                    tragedy. The tendency of its action towards complication was a natural progress,
                    and is approved by Aristotle. This complication, in which Euripides excelled,
                    led to his use of prologues, in which one of the characters opens the play by an
                    exposition of the circumstances under which its action begins. This practice,
                    though ridiculed by Aristophanes, was too convenient not to be adopted by the
                    successors of Euripides, and Menander transferred it to comedy. As the dialogue
                    increased in importance, so the dramatic significance of the chorus diminished.
                    While in Aeschylus it mostly, and in Sophocles occasionally, takes part in the
                    action, its songs could not but more and more approach the character of lyrical
                    <hi rend="italic">intermezzos;</hi> and this they openly assumed when Agathon
                    began the practice of inserting choral songs <hi rend="italic">(embolima)</hi>
                    which had nothing to do with the action of the play. In the general contrivance
                    of their actions it was only natural that, as compared with Aeschylus, Sophocles
                    and Euripides should exhibit an advance in both freedom and ingenuity; but the
                    palm due to a treatment at once piously adhering to the substance of the ancient
                    legends and original in an effective dramatic treatment of them must be given to
                    Sophocles. Euripides was, moreover, less skilful in untying complicated actions
                    than in weaving them; hence his frequent resort<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ion; Supplices; Iphigenia in Tauris; Electra;
                    Helena; Hippolytus; Andromache.</p></note> to the expedient of the <hi

                <p>The other distinctions to be drawn between the dramatic qualities of the three
                    great tragic masters must be mainly based upon a critical estimate of the
                    individual genius of each. In the characters of their tragedies, AEschylus and
                    Sophocles avoided those lapses of dignity with which from one point of view
                    Euripides has been charged by Aristophanes and other critics, but which from
                    another connect themselves with his humanity. If his men and women are less
                    heroic and statuesque, they are more like men and women. Aristotle objected to
                    the later tragedians that, compared with the great masters, they were deficient
                    in the drawing of character—by which he meant the lofty drawing of lofty
                    character. In diction, the transition is even more perceptible from the
                    “helmeted phrases” of Aeschylus, who had Milton’s love of long words and
                    sonorous proper names, to the play of Euripides’s “smooth and diligent tongue;”
                    but to a sustained style even he remained essentially true, and it was reserved
                    for his successors to introduce into tragedy the “low speech ”— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the con-, versational language—of comedy. Upon the
                    whole, however, the Euripidean diction seems to have remained the standard of
                    later tragedy, the flowery style of speech introduced by Agathon finding no
                    permanent favour.</p>
                <p>Finally, AEschylus is said to have made certain reforms in tragic costume of
                    which the object is self-evident,—to have improved the mask, and to have
                    invented the <hi rend="italic">cothurnus</hi> or buskin, upon which the actor
                    was raised to <pb break="no"

                    and tatters; but the sarcasms of Aristophanes on this head seem feeble to those
                    who are aware that they would apply to King Lear as well as to Telephus.</p>
                <p>The history of Greek comedy is likewise that of an essentially Attic growth,
                    although Sicilian comedy was earlier in date than her Attic sister or
                    descendant. The former is represented by Epicharmus (fl. 500), and by the names
                    of one or two other poets. It probably had a chorus, and, dealing as it did in a
                    mixture of philosophical discourse, antithetical rhetoric, and wild buffoonery,
                    necessarily varied in style. Though in-some respects it seems to have resembled
                    the Middle rather than the Old Attic comedy, its subjects sometimes, like those
                    of the latter, coincided with the myths of tragedy, of which they were doubtless
                    parodies. The so-called <hi rend="italic">mimes</hi> of Sophron (fl. 430) were
                    dramatic scenes from Sicilian life, intended, not for the stage, but for
                    recitation.</p>
                <p>Attic comedy is usually divided into three periods or species, viz. :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Old Comedy,</hi> which dates from the complete establishment
                    of democracy by Pericles, though a comedy directed against Themistocles is
                    mentioned. The Megarean farcical entertainments had long spread in the rural
                    districts of Attica, and were now introduced into the city, where Cratinus and
                    Crates (fl. 450) first moulded them into the forms of Attic art. The final
                    victory of Pericles and the democratic party may be reckoned from the ostracism
                    of Thucydides (444); and so eagerly was the season of freedom employed by the
                    comic poets that already four years afterwards a law—which was, however, only a
                    short time in force—limited their licence. Cratinus,<note anchored="true"

                    and broad satirist, apparently of conservative tendencies, was followed by
                    Eupolis (446-after 415), every one of whose plays appears to have attacked some

                    Phrynichus, and others; but the representative of old comedy in its fullest
                    development is Aristophanes (c. 444-c. 380), a comic poet of unique and
                    unsurpassed genius. Dignified by the acquisition of a chorus (though of a less
                    costly kind than the tragic) of masked actors, and of scenery and machinery, and
                    by a corresponding literary elaboration and elegance of style, Old Attic comedy
                    nevertheless remained true both to its origin and to the purposes of its
                    introduction into the free imperial city. It borrowed much from tragedy, but it
                    retained the phallic abandonment of the old rural festivals, the licence of word
                    and gesture, and the audacious directness of personal invective. These
                    characteristics are not features peculiar to Aristophanes. He was twitted by
                    some of the older comic poets with having degenerated from the full freedom of
                    the art by a tendency to refinement, aud he took credit to himself for having
                    superseded the time-honoured <hi rend="italic">cancan</hi> and the stale
                    practical joking of his predecessors by a nobler kind of mirth. But in boldness,
                    as he likewise boasted, he had no peer; and the shafts of his wit, though dipped
                    in wine-lees and at times feathered from very obscene fowl, flew at high
                    game.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Knights.</p></note> He has been accused of seeking to degrade what he ought

                    ><p>Clouds.</p></note> and it has been shown with complete success that he is
                    not to be taken as an impartial or accurate authority on Athenian history. But
                    partisan as he was, he was also a genuine patriot; and his very political
                    sympathies—which were conservative—were such as have often stimulated the most
                    effective political satire, because they imply au antipathy to every species of
                    excess. Of the conservative quality of reverence he was, however, altogether
                    devoid; and his love for Athens was that of the most free-spoken of sons.
                    Flexible even in his religious notions, he was in this as in other respects
                    ready to be educated by his times; and, like a true comic poet, he could be
                    witty at the expense even of his friends, and, it might almost be said, of
                    himself. In wealth of fancy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Birds.</p></note> and in beauty of lyric melody, he ranks
                    high among the great poets of all times.</p>
                <p>The distinctive feature of Old, as compared with Middle Comedy, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">parabasis,</hi> the speech in which the chorus, moving towards and
                    facing the audience, addressed it in the name of the poet, often abandoning all
                    reference to the action of the play. The loss of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >parabasis</hi> was involved in the loss of the chorus, of which comedy was
                    deprived in consequence of the general reduction of expenditure upon the comic
                    drama, culminating in the law of Cinesias (396).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strattis, Chorieidα.</p></note> But with the
                    downfall of the independence of Athenian public life, the ground had been cut
                    from under the feet of its most characteristic representative. The catastrophe
                    of the city (405) had been preceded by the temporary overthrow of the democracy
                    (411), and was followed by the establishment of an oligarchical “tyranny” under
                    Spartan protection; and when liberty was restored (404), the citizens for a time
                    addressed themselves to their new life in a soberer spirit and continued (or
                    passed) the law prohibiting the introduction by name of any individual as one of
                    the personages of a play. The change to which comedy had to accommodate itself
                    was one which cannot be defined by precise dates, yet it was not the less
                    inevitable in its progress aud results. Comedy, in her struggle for existence,
                    now chiefly devoted herself to literary and social themes— such as the criticism
                    of tragic poets,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    years of Athenian freedom, thus differed in substance as well as in form from
                    its predecessor. It is represented by the names of thirty-seven writers (more
                    than double the number of poets attributed to Old Comedy) among whom Eubulus,
                    Antiphanes, and Alexis are stated to have been pre-eminently fertile and
                    successful. It was a comedy of manners as well as character, although its
                    ridicule of particular classes of men tended to the creation of standing types,
                    such as parasites, courtesans, revellers, and—a favourite figure already drawn
                    by Aristophanes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Aeolosicon.</p></note> —the self-conceited cook. In style it necessarily
                    inclined to become more easy and conversational; while in that branch which was
                    devoted to the parodying of tragic myths, its purpose may have been to
                    criticise, but its effect must have been to degrade. This species of the comic
                    art had found favour at Athens already before the close of the great civil war;
                    its inventor was the Thasian Hegemon, at whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gigantomachia</hi> the Athenians were laughing on the day when the news arrived
                    of the Sicilian disaster.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">New Comedy,</hi> which is dated from the establishment of
                    the Macedonian supremacy (338) is merely a further development of <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle.</hi> If its favourite types were more numerous, including
                    the captain (of mercenaries)—the original of a long line of comic favourites—the
                    cunning slave, &amp;c., they were probably also more conventional. New Comedy
                    appears to have first constituted love intrigues the main subject of dramatic
                    actions. The most famous of the 64 writers said to have belonged to this period
                    of comedy were Philemon (fl. from 330), Menander (342-29), <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n427/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0427-0408"/> and his contemporary Diphilus. Of these authors
                    we know something from fragments, but more from their Latin adapters Plautus and
                    Terence. As comedians of character, they were limited by a range of types which
                    left little room for originality of treatment; in the construction of their
                    plots they were skilful rather than varied. In style, as well as to some extent
                    in construction, Menander took Euripides as his model, infusing into his comedy
                    an element of moral and sentimental reflection, which refined if it did not
                    enliven it. Yet it may be doubted whether either a high moral or a high artistic
                    purpose animated this school of writers, and whether Epicurus in Lan dor’s
                    dialogue does injustice to Menander in suspecting him of “enjoying the follies
                    of men in our rotten state as flies enjoy fruit in its decay.” Fate or chance
                    were the directing powers of his dramatic actions.</p>
                <p>New Comedy, and with it Greek comedy proper, is regarded as having come to an end
                    with Posidippus (fl. c 280). Other comic writers of a later date are, however,
                    m'entioned, among them Rhinthon of Tarentum (fl. c. 300), whose mixed
                    compositions have been called by various names, among them by that of <hi
                    rend="italic">phlyacographies</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">phlyax,</hi> useless
                    chatter). But Greek comedy ceased to be productive after it had been
                    transplanted from Athens to Alexandria; and though even in its original form it
                    long continued to be acted in imperial Rome, these are phases of its history
                    which may here be passed by.</p>
                <p>The religious origin of the Attic drama impresses itself upon all its most
                    peculiar features. Theatrical performances were held at Athens only at fixed
                    seasons in the early part of the year—at the Bacchic festivals of the country
                    Dionysia (vintage), the Lenaea (wine-press), probably at the Anthesteria, and
                    above all, at the Great Dionysia, or the Dionysia <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence,</hi> at the end of March and beginning of April, when in her most
                    glorious age Athens was crowded with visitors from the islands and cities of her
                    federal empire. As a part of religious worship, the performances took place in a
                    sacred locality— the <hi rend="italic">Lenaeum</hi> on the south-eastern
                    declivity of the Acropolis, where the first wine-press <hi rend="italic"
                    >lleηos)</hi> was said to have been set up, and where now an altar of Bacchus
                    <hi rend="italic">(jthymele)</hi> formed the centre of the theatre. For the same
                    reason, the exhibitions claimed the attendance of the whole population, and room
                    was therefore provided on a grand scale— according to the Platonic Socrates, for
                    “more than 30,000” spectators. The performances lasted all day, or were at
                    least, in accordance with their festive character, extended to as great a length
                    as possible. To their religious origin is likewise to be attributed the fact
                    that they were treated as a matter of state concern. The expenses of the chorus,
                    which in theory represented the people at large, were defrayed on behalf of the
                    state by the <hi rend="italic">liturgies</hi> (public services) of wealthy
                    citzens, chosen in turn by the tribes to be <hi rend="italic">choragi</hi>
                    (leaders, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> providers of the chorus), the duty of
                    training being, of course, deputed by them to professional persons <hi
                    rend="italic">(chorodidascali).</hi> Publicly appointed and sworn judges decided
                    between the merits of the dramas produced in competition with one another; the
                    successful poet, performers, and choragus were crowned with ivy, and the
                    last-named was allowed at his own expense to consecrate a tripod in memory of
                    his victory in the neighbourhood of the sacred Bacchic enclosure. Such a
                    monument—one of the moβt graceful relics of ancient Athens—still stands in the
                    place where it was erected, aud recalls to posterity the victory of Lysicrates,
                    achieved in the same year as that of Alexander on the Granicus. The dramatic
                    exhibitions being a matter of religion and state, the entrance money, <hi
                    rend="italic">{theoricum)</hi> which had been introduced to prevent
                    overcrowding, was from the time of Pericles provided out of the public treasury.
                    The whole υopulation had a right to its Bacchic holiday; neither women, nor
                    boys, nor slaves were excluded from theatrical spectacles at Athens.</p>
                <p>The religious character of dramatic performances at Athens, and the circumstances
                    under which they accordingly took place, likewise determined their externals of
                    costume and scenery. The actor’s dress was originally the festive Dionysian
                    attire, of which it always retained the gay and variegated hues. The use of the
                    mask was due to the actor’s appearing in the open air and at a distance from
                    most of the spectators; its several species were elaborated with great care, and
                    adapted to the different types of theatrical character. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >cothurnus,</hi> or thick-soled boot, which further raised the height of the
                    tragic actor (while the comedian wore a thin-soled boot), was likewise a relic
                    of Bacchic costume. The scenery was, in the simplicity of its original
                    conception, suited to open-air performances; but in course of time the art of
                    scene-painting came to be highly cultivated, and movable scenes were contrived,
                    together with machinery of the ambitious kind required by the Attic drama,
                    whether for bringing gods down from heaven, or for raising mortals aloft.</p>
                <p>On a stage and among surroundings thus conventional, it might seem as if little
                    scope could have been left for the actor’s art. But though the demands made upon
                    the Attic actor differed in kind even from those made upon his Roman successor,
                    aud still more from those which the histrionic art has to meet in modern times,
                    they were not the less rigorous. Mask and buskin might increase his stature, and
                    the former might at once lend the appropriate expression to his appearance and
                    the necessary resonance to his voice. But in declamation, dialogue, and lyric
                    passage, in gesticulation and movement, he had to avoid the least violation of
                    the general harmony of the performance. At the same time, the refinements of
                    bye-play must, from the nature of the case, have been impossible on the Attic
                    stage; the gesticulation must have been broad and massive; the movement slow and
                    the grouping hard in tragedy; and the recitation must have surpassed in its
                    weighty sameness that half-chant of which the echoes have never wholly died out
                    from the stage. Not more than three actors, as has been seen, appeared in any
                    Attic tragedy. The actors were provided by the poet; perhaps the performer of
                    the first parts <hi rend="italic">{protagonist')</hi> was paid by the state. It
                    was again a result of the religious origin of Attic dramatic performances, and
                    of the public importance attached to them, that the actor’s profession was held
                    in high esteem. These artists were as a matter of course free Athenian citizens,
                    often the dramatists themselves, and at times were employed in other branches of
                    the public service. In later days, when tragedy had migrated to Alexandria, and
                    when theatrical entertainments had spread over all the Hellenic world, the art
                    of acting seems to have reached an unprecedented height, and to have taken an
                    extraordinary hold of the public mind. Synods or companies of Dionysian artists
                    abounded, who were in possession of various privileges, and in one instance at
                    least (at Pergamus) of rich endowments. The most important of these was the
                    Ionic company, established first in .Teos, and afterwards in Lebedos, near
                    Colophon, which is said to have lasted longer than many a famous state. We
                    likewise hear of strolling companies performing <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">partibus.</hi> Thus it came to pass that the vitality of some of
                    the master-pieces of the Greek drama is without a parallel in theatrical
                    history; while Greek actors were undoubtedly among the principal and most
                    effective agents of the spread of literary culture through a great part of the
                    known world.</p>
                <p>The theory and technical system of the drama exercised the critical powers both
                    of dramatists, such as Sophocles, aud of the greatest among Greek philosophers:
                    If Plato <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"

                    in his <hi rend="italic">Poetics</hi> (after 334) included an exposition of it,
                    which, mutilated as it is, has formed the basis of all later systematic
                    enquiries. The specialities of Greek tragic dramaturgy refer above all to the
                    chorus; its general lawβ are those of the regular drama of all times. The
                    theories of Aristotle and other earlier writers were elaborated by the
                    Alexandrians, many of whom doubtless combined example with precept; they also
                    devoted themselves to commentaries on the old masters, such as those in which
                    Didymus (c. 30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> abundantly excelled, and
                    collected a vast amount of learning on dramatic composition in general, which
                    was doomed to perish, with so many other treasures, in the flames kindled by
                    religious fanaticism.</p>
                <p>“The history of the Greek stage,” says Sir Walter Scott, “is that of the dramatic
                    art in general;” and herein no doubt lies the broad distinction to be drawn
                    between the drama of the Greeks and the isolated growths previously treated in
                    this sketch. Yet though such is the case,—though iu the Roman drama the native
                    elements sink into insignificance when compared with those borrowed from the
                    Greeks, and though the literary element in the modern drama of the West is
                    directly or indirectly derived from the same source,—the Greek drama, both
                    tragic and comic, had features of its own which it has been the principal aim of
                    the foregoing brief account of it to mark. Tragedy never lost the traces of its
                    religious origin; and the festive purposes of comedy are most signally apparent
                    in precisely that period of its productivity whose works are least congenial to
                    modern feeling and taste. But such is the wonderful power of the highest kind of
                    art, that the tragedy of the three great masters, though its themes are so
                    peculiar to itself that they have never been treated with the same effect by the
                    numberless writers of other peoples who have essayed them, “hath ever been held
                    the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other poems;” and such is the
                    commanding claim of genius, that Aristophanes, who cultivated a species of
                    comedy of an altogether eccentric kind, occupies an eminence in his branch of
                    the drama hardly more contestable than that of the great tragic triad in theirs.
                    What is Hecuba to us that we should weep for her,—or Antigone that our sympathy
                    should accompany her on her holy errand, forbidden by human laws, but enjoined
                    upon her by the behest of Zeus and of Justice dwelling with the gods below,—or
                    Agamemnon that we should thrill with horror when his cries announce the wreaking
                    of his doom? Why can we laugh at the ribald repartees of hide-seller and
                    sausage-seller, careless of the merits of the former of these advanced
                    politicians, and catch something of the dew of the rain-bringing maidens as it
                    falls upon their beloved land, where the Bromian joy greets the advent of spring
                    1 Because in all these instances, and in every other, the art of the Greek
                    drama, while winged by the individual power of genius, is at the same time true
                    to its purposes as an art, and in harmony with Nature, who will not teach her
                    laws or surrender her secrets of a sudden or to all.</p>
                <p>In its most productive age, as well as in the times of its decline and decay, the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman</hi> drama exhibits the continued coexistence of
                    native forms by the side of those imported from Greece—either kind being
                    necessarily often subject to the influence of the other. Italy has ever been the
                    native land of actmg and of scenic representation; and though Roman dramatic
                    literature is in the main but a faint reflex of Greek examples, yet there is
                    perhaps no branch of Roman literary art more congenial than this to the soil
                    whence it sprang.</p>
                <p>The beginnings of dramatic performances in Italy are to be sought in the rural
                    festivities which doubtless from a very early period developed in lively
                    intermixture the elements of the dance, of jocular and abusive improvisations of
                    song, speech, and dialogue, and of an assumption of character such a3 may be
                    witnessed in any ordinary conversation among southern Italians at the present
                    day. The occasions of these festivities were religious celebrations, public or
                    private—among the latter more especially weddings, which have in all ages been
                    provocative of mirth ful demonstrations. The so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fescennine</hi> verses (from <hi rend="italic">fascinum,</hi> or from
                    Fescennium in southern Etruria), which were afterwards confined to weddings, and
                    ultimately gave rise to an elaborate species of artistic poetry, never merged
                    into actual dramatic performances. In the <hi rend="italic">saturas,</hi> on the
                    other hand—a name originally due to the goatskins of the shepherds, but from
                    primitive times connected with the <hi rend="italic">fullness</hi> of both
                    performers and performance—there seems from the first to have been a dramatic
                    element; they were probably comic songs or stories recited with gesticulation
                    and flute accompaniment. Introduced into the city, these entertainments received
                    a new impulse from the performances of the Etruscan players <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ludiones),</hi> who had been brought into Rome when scenic games <hi
                    rend="italic">(ludi scenici)</hi> were, in 364 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    for purposes of religious propitiation, first held there. These <hi

                    >(istri</hi> had been their native name), who have had the honour of
                    transmitting their appellation to the entire <hi rend="italic">histrionic</hi>
                    art and its professors, were at first only dancers and pantomimists in a city
                    where their speech was unintelligible. But their performances encouraged and
                    developed those of other players and mountebanks, so that after the
                    establishment of the regular drama at Rome on the Greek model, the <hi
                    rend="italic">saturoe</hi> came to be performed as farcical after-pieces <hi
                    rend="italic">(exοdia),</hi> until they gave way to other species. Of these the
                    <hi rend="italic">mimi</hi> were at Rome probably coeval in their beginnings
                    with the stage itself, where those who performed them were afterwards known
                    under the same name, possibly in the place of an older appellation <hi
                    rend="italic">(planipedes,</hi> bare-footed) These loose farces, after being
                    probably at first performed independently, were then played as after-pieces,
                    till in the imperial period, when they reasserted their predominance, they were
                    again produced by themselves. At the close of the republican period the <hi
                    rend="italic">mirnus</hi> had found its way into literature (through D. Laberius
                    and others), and had been assimilated in both form and subjects to other
                    varieties of the comic drama—preserving, however, as its distinctive feature, a
                    preponderance of the mimic or gesticulatory element. Together with the <hi
                    rend="italic">pantomimus</hi> (v. <hi rend="italic">infra)</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">mimus</hi> continued to prevail in the days of the empire, having
                    transferred its innate grossness (for it was originally a representation of low
                    life) to its treatment of mythological subjects, with which it dealt in
                    accordance with the demands of a “lubrique and adulterate age.” As a matteι of
                    course, the <hi rend="italic">mimus</hi> freely borrowed from other species,
                    among which, so far as they were of native Italian origin, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atellane</hi><hi rend="italic">fables</hi> (from Atelia in Campania) call for
                    special mention. Usually supposed to be of Oscan birth, they originally
                    consisted in delineations of the life of small towns, in which dramatic and
                    other satire has never ceased to find a favourite butt. The principal personages
                    in these living sketches gradually assumed a fixed and conventional character,
                    which they retained even when, after the final overthrow of Campanian
                    independence (210), the <hi rend="italic">Atellanae</hi> had been transplanted
                    to Rome. Here the heavy father or husband <hi rend="italic">(pappus),</hi> the

                    similar kind were handed down, to reappear in the modern Italian drama. In these
                    characters lay the essence of the <hi rend="italic">Atellanas;</hi> their plots
                    were extremely simple; the dialogue (perhaps interspersed with songs in <pb

                    performers to improvise, In course of time these plays also assumed a literary
                    form, being written out at length by their authors; but under the empire they
                    were gradually absorbed in the pantomimes.</p>
                <p>The regular Roman drama, on the other hand, was of foreign <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> Greek) origin; and its early history, at all events, attaches
                    itself to more or less fixed dates. It begins with the year 240 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when at the <hi rend="italic">ludi Romani,</hi> held
                    with unusual splendour after the first Punic war, the victory was, according to
                    Macedonian precedent, celebrated by the first production of a tragedy and a
                    comedy on the Roman stage. The author of both, who appeared in person as an
                    actor, was Livius Andronicus (b. 278 or earlier), a native of the Greek city of
                    Tarentum, where the Dionysiae festivals enjoyed high popularity. His models were
                    in tragedy the later Greek tragedians and their revisions of the three great
                    Attic masters, in comedy no doubt Menander aud his school. These continued the
                    examples of the regular Roman drama during the whole of its course, even when it
                    resorted to native themes.</p>
                <p>The nature of Roman tragedy admits of no doubt, although our conclusions
                    respecting its earlier progress are only derived from analogy, from scattered
                    notices especially of the titles of plays, and from such fragments—mostly very
                    brief—as have come down to us. Of the known titles of the tragedies of Livius
                    Andronicus, six belong to the Trojan cycle, and this preference consistently
                    maintained itself among the tragedians of the “Trojugenae;” next in popularity
                    seem to have been the myths of the house of Tantalus, of the Pelopidae, and of
                    the Argonauts. The distinctions drawn by later Roman writers between the styles
                    of the tragic poets of the republican period must in general be taken on trust.
                    The Campanian Cn. Naevius (fl. from 236) wrote comedies as well as tragedies, so
                    that the rigorous separation observed among the Greeks in the cultivation of the
                    two dramatic species was at first neglected at Rome. His realistic tendency,
                    displayed in that fondness for political allusions which brought upon him the
                    vengeance of a noble family (the Metelli) incapable of understanding a joke of
                    this description, might perhaps under more favourable circumstances have led him
                    more fully to develop a new tragic species invented by him. But the <hi
                    rend="italic">fabula praetexta</hi> or <hi rend="italic">praetextata</hi> (from
                    the purple-bordered robe worn by higher magistrates) was not destined to become
                    the means of emancipating the Roman serious drama from the control of Greek
                    examples. In design, it was national tragedy on historic subjects of patriotic
                    interest—which the Greeks had only treated in isolated instances; and one might
                    at first sight marvel why, after Naevius and his successors had produced skilful
                    examples of the species, it should have failed to overshadow and outlast in
                    popularity a tragedy telling the oft-told foreign tales of Thebes and Mycenae,
                    or even the pseudo-ancestral story of Troy. But it should not be forgotten to
                    how great an extent so-called early Roman history consisted of the traditions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi> and how little the party-life of later
                    republican Rome lent itself to a dramatic treatment likely to be acceptable both
                    to the nobility and to the multitude. As for the emperors, the last licence they
                    would have permitted to the theatre was a free popular treatment of the national
                    history; if Augustus prohibited the publication of a tragedy by his adoptive
                    father on the subject of <hi rend="italic">Oedipus,</hi> it was improbable that
                    he or his successors should have sanctioned the performance of plays dealing
                    with the earthly fortunes of Divus Julius himself, or with the story of Marius,
                    or that of the Gracchi, or any of the other tragic themes of later republican or
                    imperial history. The historic drama at Rome thus had no opportunity for a
                    vigorous life, even could tragedy have severed its main course from the Greek
                    literature of which it has been well called a “free-hand copy.” The <hi

                <p>Q. Ennius (239-168), the favourite poet of the great families, was qualified by
                    his Tarentine education, which taught the Oscan youth the Greek as well as the
                    Latin tongue (so that he boasted “three souls ”), to become the literary
                    exponent of the Hellenizing tendencies of his age of Roman society. Nearly half
                    of the extant names of his tragedies belong to the Trojan cycle; and Euripides
                    was clearly his favourite source and model. M. Pacuvius (b. c. 229), like Ennius
                    subject from his youth up to the influences of Greek civilization, and the first
                    Roman dramatist who devoted himself exclusively to the tragic drama, was the
                    least fertile of the chief Roman tragedians, but was regarded by the ancients as
                    indisputably superior to Ennius. He again was generally (though not uniformly)
                    held to have been surpassed by L. Accius (b. 170), a learned scholar and
                    prolific dramatist, of whose plays 50 titles and a very large number of
                    fragments have been preserved. The plays of the three last-named poets
                    maintained themselves on the stage till the close of the republic; and Accius
                    was quoted by the emperor Tiberius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Oderint dum metuant” Atreus.</p></note> Of the other tragic
                    writers of the republic several were <hi rend="italic">dilettanti</hi> —such as
                    the great orator and eminent politician C. Julius Strabo; the cultivated officer
                    Q. Tullius Cicero, who made an attempt, disapproved by his illustrious brother,
                    to introduce the satyr-drama into the Roman theatre; L. Cornelius Balbus, a
                    Caesarean partisan; and finally C. Julius Caesar himself. Tragedy continued to
                    be cultivated under the earlier emperors; and of one author, the famous and
                    ill-fated L. Annaeus Seneca (4 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.-65 a.d.),</hi> a series
                    of works has come down to us. In accordance with the character of their author’s
                    prose-work, they exhibit a strong predominance of the rhetorical element, and a
                    pomposity of style far removed from that of the poets Sophocles and Euripides,
                    from whom Seneca derived his themes. The metrification of his plays is very
                    strict, and they were doubtless intended for recitation, whether or not also
                    designed for the stage. A few tragic poets are mentioned after Seneca, till
                    about the reign of Domitian (81-96) the list comes to an end. The close of Roman
                    tragic literature is obscurer than its beginning; and, w hile there are traces
                    of tragic performances at Rome as late as even the 6th century, we are ignorant
                    how long the works of the old masters of Roman tragedy maintained themselves on
                    the stage.</p>
                <p>It would obviously be an error to draw from the plays of Seneca—unfortunately the
                    only examples of Roman tragedy we possess—conclusions as to the method and style
                    of the earlier writers. In general, however, no important changes seem to have
                    occurred in the progress of Roman tragic composition. The later Greek plays
                    remained, so far as can be gathered, the models in treatment; and inasmuch as at
                    Rome the single plays were performed by themselves, there was every inducement
                    to make their action as full and complicated as possible. The dialogue-scenes
                    <hi rend="italic">(deverbid)</hi> appear to have been largely interspersed with
                    musical passages <hi rend="italic">(cantica);</hi> but the effect of the latter
                    must have suffered from the barbaj∙∩us custom of having the songs sung by <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n430/mode/1up"

                    rend="italic">(cantor),</hi> while the actor accompanied them with
                    gesticulations. The chorus (unlike the Greek) stood on the stage itself and
                    seems occasionally at least to have taken part in the action. But the whole of
                    the musical element can hardly have attained to so full a development as among
                    the Greeks. The divisions of the action appear at first to have been three; from
                    the addition of prologue and epilogue may have arisen the invention (probably
                    due in tragedy to Varro) of the fixed number of five acts. In style, such
                    influence as the genius of Roman literature could exercise must have been in the
                    direction of the rhetorical and the pathetic; a surplus of energy on the one
                    hand, and a defect of poetic richness on the other, can hardly have failed to
                    characterize these, as they did all the other productions of earlier Roman
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>In Roman comedy two different kinds—respectively called <hi rend="italic"
                    >palliata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">togata</hi> from the names of dress—were
                    distinguished,—the former treating Greek subjects and imitating Greek originals,
                    the latter professing a native character. The <hi rend="italic">palliata</hi>
                    sought its originals especially in New Attic comedy; and its authors, as they
                    advanced in refinement of style, became more and more dependent upon their
                    models, and unwilling to gratify the coarser tastes of the public by local
                    allusions or gross seasonings. But that kind of comedy which shrinks from the
                    rude breath of popular applause usually has in the end to give way to less
                    squeamish rivals; and thus, after the species had been cultivated for about a
                    century (c. 250-150 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), <hi rend="italic"
                    >palliatae</hi> ceased to be composed except for the amusement of small circles,
                    though the works of the most successful authors, Plautus and Terence, kept the
                    stage even after the establishment of the empire. Among the earlier writers of
                    <hi rend="italic">palliatae</hi> were the tragic poets Andronicus, Naevius, and
                    Ennius, but they were alike surpassed by T. Maccius Plautus (254-184), nearly
                    all of whose comedies esteemed genuine by Varro—not less than 20 in number—have
                    been preserved. He was exclusively a comic poet, and though he borrowed his
                    plots from the Greeks—from Diphilus and Philemon apparently in preference to the
                    more refined Menander—there was in him a genuinely national as well as a
                    genuinely popular element. Of the extent of his originality it is impossible to
                    judge; probably it lies in his elaboration of character and the comic details of
                    his dialogue rather than in his plots. Modern comedy is indebted to him in all
                    these points; and in consequence of this fact, as well as of the attention his
                    text has for linguistic reasons received from scholarship both ancient and
                    modern, his merits have met with their full share of recognition. Statius
                    Caecilius (an Insubrian brought to Rome as a captive <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    200) stands midway between Plautus and Terence, but no plays of his remain. P.
                    Terentius Afer (c. 185-159) was, as his cognomen implies, a native of Carthage,
                    of whose conqueror he enjoyed the patronage. His six extant comedies seem to be
                    tolerably close renderings of their Greek originals, nearly all of which were
                    plays of Menander. It was the good fortune of the works of Terence to be
                    preserved in an exceptionally large number of MSS. in the monastic libraries of
                    the Middle Ages, and thu3 (as will be seen) to become a main link between the
                    ancient and the Christian drama. As a dramatist he is distinguished by
                    correctness of style rather than by variety in his plots or vivacity in his
                    characters; his chief merit— and at the same time the quality which has rendered
                    him so suitable for modern imitation—is to be sought in the polite ease of his
                    dialogue. In general, the characteristics of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >palliatae,</hi> which were divided into five acts, are those of the New Comedy
                    of Athens, like which they had no chorus; for purposes of explanation from
                    author to audience the prologue sufficed; the Roman versions were probably
                    terser than their originals, which they often altered by the process called <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">togatae,</hi> in the wider sense of the term, included all

                    Afranius, who, though still choosing national subjects, seems to have treated
                    them in the spirit of Menander. His plays continued to be performed under the
                    empire, though with an admixture of elements derived from that lower species,
                    the pantomime, to which they also were in the end to succumb. The Romans
                    likewise adopted the burlesque kind of comedy called from its inventor <hi

                <p>The end of Roman dramatic literature was dilettantism and criticism; the end of
                    the Roman drama was spectacle and show, buffoonery and sensual allurement. It
                    was for this that the theatre had passed through all its early troubles, when
                    the political puritanism of the old school had upheld the martial games of the
                    circus against the enervating influence of the stage. In those days the
                    guardians of Roman virtue had sought to diminish the attractions of the theatre
                    by insisting upon its remaining as uncomfortable as possible; but as was usual
                    at Rome, the privileges of the upper orders were at last extended to the
                    population at large, though a separation of classes continued to be
                    characteristic of a Roman audience. The first permanent theatre erected at Rome
                    was that of Gn. Pompeius (55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> which contained
                    nearly 18,000 seats; but even of this the portion allotted to the performers <hi
                    rend="italic">(scoena)</hi> was of wood; nor was it till the reign of Tiberius
                    (22 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> that, after being burnt down, the edifice
                    was rebuilt in stone. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre.</hi></p>
                <p>Though a species of amateur literary censorship, introduced by Pompeius, became
                    customary in the Augustan age, in general the drama’s laws at Rome were given by
                    the drama’s patrons—in other words, the production of plays was a matter of
                    private speculation. The exhibitions were contracted for with the officials
                    charged with the superintendence of public amusements <hi rend="italic"
                    >(curatores ludorum)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the actors were slaves trained
                    for the art, mostly natives of Southern Italy or Greece. Many of them rose to
                    reputation and wealth, purchased their freedom, and themselves became directors
                    of companies; but though Sulla might make a knight of Roscius, and Caesar and
                    his friends defy ancient prejudice, the stigma of civil disability <hi
                    rend="italic">(infamia)</hi> continued to adhere to the profession. The actor’s
                    art was carried on at Rome under conditions differing in other respects from
                    those of the Greek theatre. The Romans loved a full stage, and from the later
                    period of the republic liked to see it crowded with supernumeraries. This
                    accorded with their military instincts, and with the general grossness of their
                    tastes, which led them in the theatre as well as in the circus to delight in
                    spectacle and tumult, and to applaud Pompeius when he furnished forth the return
                    of Agamemnon in the <hi rend="italic">Clytaemnestra</hi> with a grand total of
                    600 heavily-laden mules. On the other hand, the actors were nearer to the
                    spectators in the Roman theatre <pb break="no"

                    orchestra occupied by the chorus; and this led in earlier time3 to the absence
                    of masks, variously-coloured wigs serving to distinguish the age of the
                    characters. Roscius, however, is said (in consequence of an obliquity of vision
                    disfiguring his countenance) to have introduced the use of masks; and the
                    innovation, though disapproved of, afterwards maintained itself. The tragic
                    ⅛ctors wore the <hi rend="italic">crepida,</hi> corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">cothurnus,</hi> and a heavy toga, which in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >p&gt;rcetexta</hi> had the purple border giving its name to the species. The
                    conventional costumes of the various kinds of comedy are likewise indicated by
                    their names. The comparative nearness of the actors to the spectators encouraged
                    the growth of that close criticism of acting for which Italy has always been
                    famous, and which manifested itself in all the ways familiar to modern
                    audiences. Where there is criticism, devices are apt to spring up for
                    anticipating or directing it; and the evil institution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >claque</hi> is modelled on Roman precedent. In fine, though the art of acting
                    at Rome must have originally formed itself on Greek example and precept, it was
                    doubtless elaborated with a care unknown to the greatest Attic artists. Its most
                    famous representatives were Gallus, called after his emancipation Q. Roscius
                    Gallus (d. c. 62 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> who, like the great “English
                    Roscius,” excelled equally in tragedy and comedy, and his younger contemporary
                    Clodius Aesopus, a Greek by birth, likewise eminent in both branches of his art,
                    though in tragedy more particularly. Both these great actors are said to have
                    been constant hearers of the great orator Hortensius; and Roscius wrote a
                    treatise on the relations between oratory and acting. In the influence of
                    oratory upon the drama are perhaps to be sought the chief among the nobler
                    features of Roman tragedy to which a native origin may be fairly ascribed.</p>
                <p>The ignoble end of the Roman—and with it of the ancient classical—drama has been
                    already foreshadowed. The elements of dance and song, never integrally united
                    with the dialogue in Roman tragedy, were now altogether separated from it. While
                    it became customary simply to recite tragedies to the small audiences who
                    continued (or, as a matter of courtesy, affected) to appreciate them, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pantomimus</hi> commended itself to the heterogeneous multitudes
                    of the Roman theatre by confining the performance of the actor to gesticulation
                    and dancing, a chorus singing the accompanying text. The species was developed
                    with extraordinary success already under Augustus by Pylades and Bathyllus; and
                    so popular were these entertainments, that even eminent poets, such as Lucan (d.
                    65 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> wrote the librettos for them, of which the
                    subjects were generally mythological, only now and then historical, and chiefly
                    of an amorous kind. A single masked performer was able to enchant admiring
                    crowds by the art of gesticulation and movement only. In what direction this art
                    tended, when suiting itself to the demands of a recklessly sensual age, may be
                    gathered from the remark of one of the last pagan historians of the empire, that
                    the introduction of pantomimes was a sign of the general moral decay of the
                    world which began with the beginning of the monarchy. Comedy more easily lost
                    itself in the cognate form of the <hi rend="italic">mimus,</hi> which survived
                    all other kinds of comic entertainments because of its more audacious immorality
                    and open obscenity. Women took part in these performances, by means of which, as
                    late as the 6th century, a <hi rend="italic">mima</hi> acquired a celebrity
                    which ultimately raised her to the imperial throne. Meanwhile the regular drama
                    had lingered on, enjoyiug in all its forms imperial patronage in the days of the
                    literary revival under Hadrian (117-138); but the perennial taste for the
                    spectacles of the amphitheatre, which reached its climax in the days of
                    Constantine the Great (306-337), hastened the downfall of the dramatic art in
                    general. It was not absolutely extinguished even by the irruptions of the
                    northern barbarians; but a bitter adversary had by this time risen into power.
                    The whole authority of the Christian church had, without usually caring to
                    distinguish between the nobler and the looser elements in the drama, involved
                    all its manifestations in a consistent condemnation; and when the faith of that
                    church was acknowledged as the religion of the Roman empire, the doom of the
                    theatre was sealed. This doom was not undeserved; for the remnants of the
                    literary drama had long been overshadowed by entertainments such as both earlier
                    and later Roman emperors—Domitian and Trajan as well as Galerius and
                    Constantine—had found themselves obliged to prohibit in the interests of public
                    morality and order, by the bloody spectacles of the amphitheatre, and by the
                    maddening excitement of the circus; the art of acting had become the pauder of
                    the lewd or frivolous itch of eye and ear; and the theatre had contributed its
                    utmost to the demoralization of a world. The attitude taken up by the Christian
                    church towards the stage was in general as unavoidable as its particular
                    expressions were at .times heated by fanaticism or distorted by ignorance. Had
                    she not visited with her anathema a wilderness of decay, she could not herself
                    have become—what she little dreamt of becoming—the nursing mother of the new
                    birth of an art which seemed incapable of regeneration.</p>
                <p>Though already in the 4th century actors and mountebanks had been excluded from
                    the benefit of Christian sacraments, and excommunication had been extended to
                    those who visited theatres instead of churches on Sundays and holidays, and
                    though similar enactments had followed at later dates, yet the entertainments of
                    the condemned profession had never been entirely suppressed, and had even
                    occasionally received imperial patronage. Gradually, however, the <hi
                    rend="italic">mimes</hi> and their fellows became a wandering fraternity, who
                    doubtless appeared at festivals when they were wanted and vanished again into
                    the deepest obscurity which has ever covered that mysterious existence —a
                    stroller’s life. It was thus that these strange intermediaries of civilization
                    carried down such traditions as survived of the acting drama of pagan antiquity
                    into the succeeding ages.</p>
                <p>While the scattered and persecuted strollers thus kept alive something of the
                    popularity, if not of the loftier traditions, of their art, neither, on the
                    other hand, was there an utter absence of written compositions to bridge the gap
                    between ancient and modern dramatic literature. In the midst of the condemnation
                    with which the Christian church visited the stage, its professors, and votaries,
                    we find individual ecclesiastics resorting in their writings to both the tragic
                    and the comic form of the ancient drama. These isolated productions, which
                    include (in the latter part of the 4th century) the <hi rend="italic">Passion of
                    Christ,</hi> usually attributed to St Gregory Nazianzen, were doubtless mostly
                    written for educational purposes, whether Euripides and Lycophron, or Menander,
                    Plautus, and Terence served as the outward models. The same was probably the
                    design of the famous “comedies” of Hrotsvitha, the Benedictine nun of
                    Gandersheim, in Eastphalian Saxony, which associate themselves in the history of
                    Christian literature with the spiritual revival of the 10th century in the days
                    of Otto the Great. While avowedly imitated in form from the comedies of Terence,
                    these religious exercises derive their themes—martyrdoms,<note anchored="true"

                <p>from the legends of Christian saints. Thus from perhaps the 9th to the 12th
                    centuries Germany and France, and through the latter, by means of the Norman
                    Conquest, England, became acquainted with what may be called the literary
                    monastic drama. It was no doubt occasionally performed by the children under the
                    care of monks or nuns, or by the religious themselves; an exhibition of the
                    former kind was that of the <hi rend="italic">Play of St Katharine,</hi> acted
                    at Dunstable about the year 1110 in “copes” by the scholars of the Norman
                    Geoffrey, afterwards abbot of St Albans. Nothing is known of it except the fact
                    of its performance, which was certainly not regarded as a novelty.</p>
                <p>These efforts of the cloister came in time to blend themselves with more popular
                    forms of the early Christian drama. To what extent the mimes, or <hi
                    rend="italic">joculatores</hi> (as in the early Middle Ages they came to be more
                    generally called), kept alive the usage of entertainments more essentially
                    dramatic than the minor varieties of their performances, we cannot say; but we
                    know that in Northern France they at a very early date appropriated the
                    beginnings of the religious drama to secular uses. Doubtless in both Celtic and
                    Teutonic populations there survived the remnants of religious rites containing
                    dramatic elements, and the heathen festivals, of Roman or other origin,
                    communicated something of their character to the Christian, at which the <hi

                    entertainers suited themselves to different tastes, and with the rise of native
                    literatures to different literary tendencies. The literature of the <hi

                    Roland and Charlemague, and tossing his sword in the air and catching it again.
                    In England such accomplished minstrels easily outshone the less versatile
                    gleemen of pre-Norman times; while here as elsewhere the humbler members of the
                    craft strolled from castle to convent, to village-green and city-street,
                    exhibiting as <hi rend="italic">jugglers</hi> their pantomimic and other
                    tricks.</p>
                <p>Both the literary and the professional element had thus survived to become
                    tributaries to the main stream of the early Christian drama, which had its
                    source in the <hi rend="italic">liturgy</hi> of the church itself. The service
                    of the mass contains in itself dramatic elements, and combines with the reading
                    out of portions of Scripture by the priest, its <hi rend="italic">epical</hi>
                    part, a <hi rend="italic">lyrical</hi> one in the anthems and responses of the
                    congregation. At a very early period—certainly already in the 5th century—it was
                    usual to increase the attractions of public worship on special occasions by
                    living pictures illustrating the Gospel narrative and accompanied by songs; and
                    thus a certain amount of action gradually introduced itself into the service.
                    When the epical part of the liturgy was connected with its spectacular and to
                    some degree mimical adjuncts, the lyrical accompaniment being of course
                    retained, the <hi rend="italic">liturgical mystery—</hi> the earliest form of
                    the Christian drama—was in existence. This had certainly been accomplished as
                    early as the 10th century, when on great ecclesiastical festivals it was
                    customary for the priests to perform in the churches the <hi rend="italic"
                    >offices</hi> (as they were called) of the Shepherds, the Innocents, the Holy
                    Sepulchre, tfcc., in connection with the gospel of the day. In France in the
                    12th, or perhaps already in the 11th century, short Latin texts were written for
                    these liturgical mysteries; these included passages from the popular legend of
                    St Nicholas as well as from scriptural story. In the same century the further
                    step was taken of composing these texts in the vernacular—the earliest example
                    being the mystery of the Resurrection. In time a whole series of mysteries was
                    joined together; a process which was at first roughly and then more elaborately
                    pursued in France and elsewhere, and finally resulted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >collective mystery—</hi> a mere scholars’ term of course, but one to which the
                    principal examples of the English mystery-drama correspond.</p>
                <p>The productions of the mediaeval religious drama it is usual technically to
                    divide into three classes. The <hi rend="italic">mysteries</hi> proper deal with
                    scriptural events only, their purpose being to set forth, with the aid of the
                    prophetic or preparatory history of the Old Testament, and more especially of
                    the fulfilling events of the New, the central mystery of the Redemption of the
                    world, as accomplished by the Nativity, the Passion, and the Resurrection. But
                    in fact these were not kept distinctly apart from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >miracle-plays,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">miracles,</hi> which are strictly
                    speaking concerned with the legends of the saints of the church; and in England
                    the name <hi rend="italic">mysteries</hi> was not in use. Of these species the
                    miracles must more especially have been fed from the resources of the monastic
                    literary drama. Thirdly, the <hi rend="italic">moralities,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">moral-plays,</hi> teach and illustrate the same truths; not,
                    however, by direct representation of scriptural or legendary events and
                    personages, but allegorically, their characters being personified virtues or
                    qualities. Of the moralities the Norman <hi rend="italic">trouvères</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">had</hi> been the inventors; and doubtless this innovation
                    connects itself with the endeavour, which in France had almost proved victorious
                    by the end of the 13th century, to emancipate dramatic performances from the
                    control of the church.</p>
                <p>The attitude of the clergy towards the dramatic performances which had arisen out
                    of the elaboration of the services of the church, but which soon admitted
                    elements from other sources, was not, and could not be, uniform. As the plays
                    grew longer, their paraphernalia more extensive, and their spectators more
                    numerous, they began to be represented outside as well as inside the churches,
                    and the use of the vulgar tongue came to be gradually preferred. Miracles were
                    less dependent on this connection with the church services than mysteries
                    proper; and lay associations, guilds, and schools in particular, soon began to
                    act plays in honour of their patron saints in or near their own halls. Lastly,
                    as scenes and characters of a more or less trivial description were admitted
                    even into the plays acted or superintended by the clergy, as some of these
                    characters came to be depended on by the audiences for conventional extravagance
                    or fun, every new Herod seeking to out-Herod his predecessor, and the devils and
                    their chief asserting themselves as indispensable favourites, the comic element
                    in the religious drama increased; and that drama itself, even where it remained
                    associated with the church, grew more, and more profane. The endeavour to
                    sanctify the popular tastes to religious uses, which connects itself with the
                    institution of the great festival of Corpus Christi (1264, confirmed 1311), when
                    the symbol of the mystery of the Incarnation was borne in solemn procession, led
                    to the closer union of the dramatic exhibitions (hence often called <hi
                    rend="italic">processus)</hi> with this and other religious feasts; but it
                    neither limited their range, nor controlled their development.</p>
                <p>At times favoured, at times denounced by the clergy, dramatic entertainments thus
                    lustily flourished for a series of centuries, in some countries -more, in others
                    less, religious in their character, and variously reinforced by the efforts <pb

                    France, where they had always preserved a secular side, they soonest advanced
                    into forms connecting themselves with later growths of the drama. At Paris the
                    fraternity of the <hi rend="italic">Bazoche</hi> (clerks of the Parliament and
                    the Châtelet) in 1303 acquired the right of conducting the popular festivals;
                    but after the <hi rend="italic">Confrérie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Passion,</hi> who devoted themselves originally to the performance of
                    passion-plays, had obtained a royal privilege for this purpose in 1402, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bazoche</hi> gave itself up to the production of moralities. A
                    third association, calling itself the <hi rend="italic">∑nfans</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sans souci</hi> (the Devilmay-cares), having about the same time
                    acquired the right of acting <hi rend="italic">sοtties—</hi> short comic plays
                    with allegorical figures— the other companies took a leaf out of their book,
                    interwove their mysteries and moralities with comic scenes from popular life,
                    and gradually began to confine themselves to secular themes. Thus the transition
                    to the regular drama here easily prepared itself; already in 1395 we find the
                    brethren of the <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> performing a serious play on the
                    story of <hi rend="italic">Griseldis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and among the
                    abundant literature of <hi rend="italic">sotties</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >farces</hi> (from Italian <hi rend="italic">farsa,</hi> Latin ∕αmiα), which
                    after mingling real types with allegorical personages had come to exclude the
                    latter, the immortal <hi rend="italic">Maistre</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pierre</hi><hi rend="italic">Patelin</hi> (acted in 1480 by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bazoche)</hi> is, however slight in plot, in all essentials a
                    comedy. No Italian mystery has been preserved from an earlier date than 1243,
                    about which time associations were in this country also founded for the
                    production of religious plays. These seem to have differed little from those of
                    Northern Europe except by a less degree of coarseness in their comic characters.

                    spectacular magnificence of theatrical displays accorded with that of the
                    processions, both ecclesiastical and lay,—the <hi rend="italic">trionfi</hi> as
                    they were called in the days of Dante,—and the religious drama gradually
                    acquired an academical character assimilating it to the classical attempts which
                    gave rise to the regular Italian drama. The poetry of the Troubadours, which had
                    come from Provence into Italy, here frequently took a dramatic form, and perhaps
                    suggested his early experiments in this to Petrarch, the father of the Italian
                    Renaissance. After his death there are traces of similar literary efforts in the
                    <hi rend="italic">volgare Provenzale</hi> dialect. Meanwhile remnants of the
                    ancient popular entertainments had survived in the improvised farces acted at
                    the courts, in the churches <hi rend="italic">(farsa spirituale),</hi> and among
                    the people; the Roman carnival had preserved its waggon plays <hi rend="italic"
                    >(caτri);</hi> and numerous links remained to connect the popular modern comedy
                    of the Italians with the <hi rend="italic">Atellanes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mimes</hi> of their ancestors. In Spain, where all traces of the ancient Roman
                    theatre (except its architectural remains) had disappeared after the Moorish
                    conquest, the extant remains of the religious drama date from a still later
                    period than the Italian—the 13th or 14th century. Its beginnings presented
                    themselves in an advanced form, which aroused the opposition of the clergy, who
                    sought to take the plays under their own control. In the secular literature of
                    Spain nothiug dramatic can be proved to have existed till the latter part of the
                    15th century. It had probably been customary from early times to insert in the
                    mysteries so-called <hi rend="italic">entremeses</hi> or interludes; but it is
                    not till 1472 that in the couplets of <hi rend="italic">Mingo B,evulgo
                    (i.e.,</hi> Domingo Vulgus, the common people), and about the same time, in
                    another dialogue by the same author, we have attempts of a kind resembling the
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">contrasti</hi> (v. <hi rend="italic">infra).</hi> In
                    Germany, on the other hand (the history of whose drama so widely differs from
                    that of the Spanish), religious plays were performed probably as early as the
                    12th century at the Christmas and Easter festivals. Other festivals were
                    afterwards celebrated in the same way, but up to the Reformation Easter enjoyed
                    the preference. About the 14th century miracle-plays began to be frequently
                    performed; and as these often treated subjects of historical interest, local or
                    other, the transition to the barren beginnings of the German historical drama
                    was afterwards easy. Though these early German plays often have an element of
                    the moralities, they were not as in France blended with the drolleries of the
                    professional strollers <hi rend="italic">(fahrende Leute),</hi> which, carried
                    on chiefly in carnival time, gave rise to the Shrove-Tuesday plays <hi
                    rend="italic">(Fastnachtsspiele),</hi> scenes from common life largely
                    interspersed with practical fun. To these last a more enduring literary form was
                    first given in the 15th century by Hans Rosenplüt, called Schnepperer—or Hans
                    Schnepperer, called Rosenblüt—the predecessor of Hans Sachs. By this time a
                    connection was establishing itself in Germany between the dramatic amusements of
                    the people and the literary labours of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >master-singers;</hi> but the religious drama proper survived in Catholic
                    Germany far beyond the times of the Reformatioü, and was not suppressed in
                    Bavaria and Tyrol till the end of the 18th century.<note anchored="true"

                    account for its having been allowed to survive.</p></note></p>
                <p>Omitting any notice of traces remaining of the religious drama in other European
                    countries, we come to our own, from whose literature a fair idea may be derived
                    of the general character of these mediaeval productions. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >miracle-plays, miracles,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plays</hi> (these being the
                    terms used in England) of which we hear in London in the 12th century, were
                    probably written in Latin and acted by ecclesiastics; but already in the
                    following century mention is made—in the way of prohibition—of plays acted by
                    professional players. (Isolated moralities of the 12th century are not to be
                    regarded as popular productions.) In England as elsewhere, the clergy either
                    sought to retain their control over the religious plays, which continued to be
                    occasionally acted in churches even after the Reformation, or else reprobated
                    them with or without qualifications. In Cornwall miracles in the native Cymric
                    dialect were performed at an early date; but those which have been preserved are
                    apparently copies of English (with the occasional use of French) originals; they
                    were represented, unlike the English plays, in the open country, in extensive
                    amphitheatres constructed for the purpose.</p>
                <p>The flourishing period of English miracle-plays begins with the practice of their
                    performance by trading-companies in the towns. Of this practice Chester is said
                    to have set the example (1268-1276); it was followed in the course of the 13th
                    and 14th centuries by many other towns, including Wakefield, Coventry, York,
                    Newcastle-on-Tyne, Leeds, Lancaster, Preston, Kendal, Wymondham, Dublin, and
                    London, in which last the performers were the parish clerks. Three collections,
                    in addition to some single examples, of such plays have come down to us—viz.,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Towneley</hi> plays, which were probably acted at the
                    fairs of Woodkirk, near Wakefield, and those bearing the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">Chester</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Coventry.</hi> Their dates,
                    in the forms in which they have come down to us, are more or less uncertain ,
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">Towneley</hi> may be even earlier than the 14th
                    century; the <hi rend="italic">Chester</hi> may be ascribed to the close of the
                    14th or the earlier part of the 15th; the body of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coventry</hi> probably belongs to the 15th or 16th. Many of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0434-0415"/> the individual plays in these collections were
                    doubtless founded on French originals; others are taken direct from Scripture,
                    from the apocryphal gospels, or from the legends of the saints. Their
                    characteristic feature is the combinar tion of a whole series of plays into one
                    <hi rend="italic">collective</hi> whole, exhibiting the entire course of Bible
                    history from the creation to the day of judgment. For this combination it is
                    unnecessary to suppose that they were generally indebted to foreign examples,
                    though there are several remarkable coincidences between the Chester plays and
                    the French <hi rend="italic">Mystère du Vieil</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Testament.</hi></p>
                <p>“The manner of these plays,” we read in a description of those at Chester, dating
                    from the close of the 16th century, “were :— Every company had his pageant,
                    which pageants were a high scaffold with two rooms, a higher and a lower, upon
                    four wheels. In the lower they apparelled themselves, and in the higher room
                    they played, being all open at the top, that all beholders might hear and see
                    them. The places where they played them was in every street. They began first at
                    the abbey gates, and when the first pageant was played, it was wheeled to the
                    high cross before the mayor, and so to every street, and so every street had a
                    pageant playing before them at one time till all the pageants appointed for the
                    day were played; and when one pageant was near ended, word was brought from
                    street to street, that so they might come in place thereof, exceedingly orderly,
                    and all the streets have their pageants afore them all at one time playing
                    together; to see which plays was great resort, and also scaffolds and stages
                    made in the streets in those places where they determined to play their
                    pageants.”</p>
                <p>Each play, then, was performed by the representative of a particular trade or
                    company, after whom it was called the fishers’, glovers’, &amp;c., <hi
                    rend="italic">pageant;</hi> while a general prologue was spoken by a herald. As
                    a rule the movable stage sufficed for the action, though we find horsemen riding
                    up to the scaffold, and Herod instructed to “rage in the pagond and in the
                    strete also.” There is no probability that the stage was, as in France, divided
                    into three platforms with a dark cavern at the side of the lowest, appropriated
                    respectively to the Heavenly Father and His angels, to saints and glorified men,
                    to mere men, and to souls in hell. But the last-named locality was frequently
                    displayed in the English miracles, with or without fire in its mouth. The
                    costumes were in part conventional,—divine and saintly personages being
                    distinguished by gilt hair and beards, Herod being clad as a Saracen, the demons
                    wearing hideous heads, the souls black and white coats according to their kind,
                    and the angels gold skins and wings.</p>
                <p>Doubtless these performances abounded in what seem to us ludicrous features, and
                    though their main purpose was serious, they were not in England at least
                    intended to bo devoid of fun. But many of these features are in truth only
                    homely and <hi rend="italic">naif,</hi> and the simplicity of feeling they
                    exhibit is at times not without its pathos. The occasional excessive grossness
                    is due to an absence of refinement of taste rather than to an obliquity of moral
                    sentiment. In this, as in other respects, the <hi rend="italic">Coventry
                    Plays,</hi> which were possibly written by clerical hands, show an advance upon
                    the others. In the same plays is already to be observed an element of abstract
                    figures, which connects them with a different species of the mediaeval
                    drama.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">moralities</hi> corresponded to the love for moral allegory
                    which manifests itself in so many periods of our literature, and which, while
                    dominating the whole field of mediaeval literature, was nowhere more assiduously
                    and effectively cultivated than in England. It is necessary to bear this in
                    mind, in order to understand what to us seems r&gt;o strange, the <hi
                    rend="italic">popularity</hi> of the moral-plays, which indeed never equalled
                    that of the miracles, but sufficed to maintain the former species till it
                    received a fresh impulse from the connection established between it and the “new
                    learning,” together with the new political and religious ideas and questions, of
                    the Reformation age. Moreover, a specially popular element was supplied to these
                    plays, which in manner of representation differed in no essential point from the
                    miracles, in a character borrowed from the latter, and, in the moralities,
                    usually provided with a companion whose task it was to lighten the weight of
                    such abstractions as Sapience and Justice. These were the Devil and his
                    attendant the <hi rend="italic">Vice,</hi> of whom the latter seems to have been
                    of native origin, and, as he was usually dressed in a fool’s habit, was probably
                    suggested by the familiar custom of keeping an attendant fool at court or in
                    great houses. The Vice had many <hi rend="italic">aliases {Shift, Ambidexter,
                    Sin, Fraud, Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.), but his usual duty is to torment and teaze
                    the Devil his master for the edification and diversion of the audience. He was
                    gradually blended with the domestic fool, who survived in the regular drama.</p>

                    the earlier part of Elizabeth’s reign, and connects itself with political
                    feeling in a famous morality,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The transition from the morality to the regular drama in England was effected on
                    the one hand by the intermixture of historical personages with abstractions—as
                    in Bishop Bale’s <hi rend="italic">Kyng Johan {c.</hi> 1548)—which easily led
                    oveι to the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle History;</hi> on the other by the
                    introduction of types of real life by the side of abstract figures. This latter
                    tendency, of which instances occur in earlier plays, is observable in several of
                    the 16th century moralities;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in advance had been taken by a man of genius, John Heywood (d. 1565), whose <hi

                    a keen eye for the vices as well as the folies of his age, and not the least for
                    those of the clerical profession. Other writers, such as T. Ingeland,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Disobedient
                    Child.</p></note> took the same direction; and the allegory of abstractions was
                    thus undermined on the stage, very much as in didactic literature the ground had
                    been cut from under its feet by the <hi rend="italic">Ship of Fooles.</hi> Thus
                    the <hi rend="italic">interludes—</hi> a name which had been used for the
                    moralities themselves from an early date—facilitated the advent of comedy,
                    without having superseded the earlier form. Both moralities and miracle-plays
                    survived into the Elizabethan age, after the regular drama had already begun its
                    course.</p>

                <p>Such, in barest outline, w as the progress of dramatic entertainments in the
                    principal countries of Europe, before the revival of classical studies brought
                    about a return to the examples of the classical drama, or before this return had
                    distinctly asserted itself. It must not, however, be forgotten that from an
                    early period iu England as elsewhere had flourished a species of entertainments,
                    not properly speaking dramatic, but largely contributing to form and foster a
                    taste for dramatic spectacles. The <hi rend="italic">pageants—</hi> as they were
                    called in England—were the successors of those <hi rend="italic">ridings</hi>
                    from which, when they gladdened “Chepe,” Chaucer’s idle apprentice would not
                    keep away; but they had advanced in splendour and ingenuity of device under the
                    influence of Flemish and other foreign examples. Costumed figures represented
                    before gaping citizens the heroes of mythology and history, and the abstractions
                    of moral, patriotic, or municipal allegory; and the city of London clung with
                    special fervour to these exhibitions, which the Elizabethan drama was neither
                    able nor—as represented by most of its poets who composed devices and short
                    texts for these and similar shows—willing to oust from popular favour. Some of
                    the greatest and some of the least of our dramatists were the ministers of
                    pageantry; and perhape it would have been an advantage for the the future of the
                    theatre, if the legitimate drama and the <hi rend="italic">Triumphs of Old
                    Drapery</hi> had been more jealously kept apart.</p>
                <p>The literary influence which finally transformed the growths noticed above into
                    the national dramas of the several countries of Europe, was in a word the
                    influence of the Renaissance. Among the remains of classical antiquity which
                    were studied, translated, and imitated, those of the drama necessarily held a
                    prominent place. Never altogether lost sight of, they now became subjects of
                    devoted research and models for careful copies, first in one of their own, then
                    in modern, tongues; and these essentially literary endeavours came into more or
                    less direct contact with, and acquired more or less control over, the already
                    existing entertainments of the stage. Thus the stream of the modern drama, whose
                    source and contributories have been described, was brought back into the ancient
                    bed, from which its flow diverged into a number of national courses, unequal in
                    impetus and strength, and varying in accordance with the manifold conditions of
                    their progress. Of these it remains to pursue the most productive or
                    important.</p>
                <p>The priority in this as in most of the other aspects of the Renaissance belongs
                    to <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy.</hi> In ultimate achievement, the Italian drama
                    fell short of the fulness of the results obtained elsewhere—a surprising fact
                    when it is considered, not only that the Italian language had the vantage-ground
                    of closest relationship to the Latin, but tħat the genius of the Italian people
                    has at all times inspired it with a predilection for the drama. The cause is
                    doubtless to be sought in the absence from Italian national life during a long
                    period, and more especially during that contemporary with the rise and earlier
                    promise of Italian dramatic literature, of those loftiest and most potent
                    impulses of popular feeling to which a national drama owes so much of its
                    strength. This absence was due partly to the peculiarities of the Italian
                    character, partly to the political and ecclesiastical experiences Italy was
                    fated to undergo. The Italians were strangers to the enthusiasm of patriotism,
                    which was as the breath in the nostrils of our Elizabethan age, as well as to
                    the single-minded religiosity which identified Spain with the spirit of the
                    Catholic Revival· The clear-sightedness of the Italians had something to de with
                    this—for they were too intelligent to believe in their tyrants, and too free
                    from illusions to deliver up their minds to their priests. The chilling and
                    enervating effects of a pressure of foreign domination, such as no Western
                    people with a history and a civilization like those of Italy has ever
                    experienced, did the rest, and for many generations rendered impotent the higher
                    efforts of the dramatic art. No basis was permanently found for a really
                    national tragedy; while literary comedy, after turning from the direct imitation
                    of Latin models to a more popular form, lost itself in an abandoned immorality
                    of tone and in reckless insolence of invective against particular classes of
                    society. Though its productivity long continued, the poetic drama more and more
                    concentrated its efforts upon subordinate or subsidiary species, artificial in
                    origin and decorative in purpose, and surrendered its substance to the
                    overpowering aids of music, dancing, and spectacle. Only a single form of the
                    Italian drama, the improvised comedy, remained truly national; and this was of
                    its nature dissociated from higher literary effort. The revival of Italian
                    tragedy in later times is due partly to the imitation of French models, partly
                    to the endeavour of a brilliant genius to infuse into his art the historical and
                    political spirit. Comedy likewise attained to new growths of considerable
                    significance, when it was sought to accommodate its popular forms to the
                    representation of real life in a wider range, and again to render it more
                    poetical in accordance with the tendencies of modern romanticism.</p>
                <p>The regular Italian dςama, in both its tragic and its comic branches, began with
                    a reproduction, in the Latin language, of classical models; but tragedy in its
                    beginnings showed a tendency which it was before long to treat themes of
                    national historical interest. Two earliest tragedies of which we hear, written
                    by the Paduan historian Mussato about 1300, were both copies of Seneca; but
                    while the one <hi rend="italic">(Achilleis)</hi> treated a classical theme, the
                    other dealt with the history of a famous tyrant of the author’s native city (<hi

                    dramas were doubtless written to suit the tastes of the friends and patrons of
                    the Italian Renaissance, who, like Lorenzo the Magnificent, wished to
                    domesticate the heathen gods and goddesses on a stage hitherto occupied by the
                    sacred figures of Christian belief. Such were the Latin imitations and
                    translations of Greek and Latin tragedies and comedies by Bishop Martirano, the
                    friend of Lorenzo’s son Pope Leo X., on the adventure of Danaë<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Irnber Aureus.</p></note> and
                    other subjects; the famous <hi rend="italic">Progne</hi> of G. Corraro (d.
                    1464), the nephew of an earlier Pope; and the efforts of Pomponius Laetus, who,
                    with the aid of Cardinal Riaro, sought to revive the ancient theatre, especially
                    that of Plautus and Terence, at Rome. Many Latin comedies are mentioned from the
                    15th century, during which, as during its predecessor, Latin continued the
                    dominant language of the stage in Italy. Nor was the representation even of
                    Greek plays altogether unknown; it was by her performance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Electra</hi> of Sophocles that Alexandra Scala caused Politian to
                    envy Orestes.</p>
                <p>Early in the 16th century, tragedy began to be written in the native tongue; but
                    it retained from the first, and never wholly lost, the impress of its origin.
                    Whatever the source of its subjects—which, though mostly of classical origin,
                    were occasionally derived from native romance, or even due to invention—they
                    were all treated with a predilection for the horrible, inspired by the example
                    of Seneca, though no doubt encouraged by a perennial national taste. The chorus,
                    stationary on the stage as in old Roman <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n436/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0436-0417"/> tragedy, was not reduced to a merely occasional
                    appearance between the acts till the beginning of the 17th century, or ousted
                    altogether from the tragic drama till the earlier half of the 18th. Thus the
                    changes undergone by Italian tragedy were for a long series of generations
                    chiefly confined to the form of versification and the choice of themes; nor was
                    it, at all events till the last century of the course it has hitherto run, more
                    than the after-growth of an aftergrowth. The honour of having been the earliest
                    tragedy in Italian seems to belong to Galeotto’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sofonisba</hi> (1502), a piece in 15 or 20 acts, regardless of unity of scene.
                    A. da Pistoia’s <hi rend="italic">Pamfila</hi> (1508) followed, of which the
                    subject was taken from Boccaccio, though the names of the characters were Greek.
                    The play usually associated with the beginning of Italian tragedy—that with
                    which “th’ Italian scene first learned to glow ”—was another <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sofonisba,</hi> acted before Leo X. in 1515, and written in blank verse <hi

                    to which Shakespeare was indebted for so many of his subjects, was (supposing
                    him to have invented these) the first Italian who was the author of the fables
                    of his own dramas; he introduced some novelties into dramatic construction,
                    separating the prologue and probably also the epilogue from the action, and has
                    by some been regarded as the inventor of the pastoral drama. In the latter half

                <p>The tragedians of the 17th century continued to pursue the beaten track, at times
                    in vain, seeking by the introduction of musical airs to compromise with the
                    danger with which their art was threatened of being (in Voltaire’s phrase)
                    extinguished by the beautiful monster, the opera, now rapidly gaining ground in
                    the country of its origin. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Opera.) To</hi> Count P.
                    Bonarelli (1589-1659), the author of <hi rend="italic">Solimano,</hi> is on the
                    other hand ascribed the first disuse of the chorus in Italian tragedy. The
                    innovation of the use of rhyme attempted in the learned Pallavicino’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Errniηigildo</hi> (1655), and defended by him in a discourse
                    prefixed to the play, was in Italy no more than in England able to achieve a
                    permanent success; its chief representative was afterwards Martelli (d. 1727),
                    whose rhymed Alexandrian verse <hi rend="italic">(Martelliαno)</hi>, though on
                    one occasion used in comedy by Goldoni, failed to commend itself to the popular
                    taste. By the end of the 17th century Italian tragedy seemed destined to expire,
                    and the great tragic actor Cotta had withdrawn in disgust at the apathy of the
                    public towards the higher forms of the drama. The 18th century was, however, to
                    witness a change, the beginning of which are attributed to tbe institution of
                    the Academy of the Arcadians at Rome (1690). The principal efforts of the new
                    school of writers and critics were directed to the abolition of the chorus,
                    arffl. to a general increase of freedom in treatment. Before long the Marquis S.
                    Maffei with his <hi rend="italic">Merope</hi> (first printed 1713) achieved one
                    of the most brilliant successes recorded in the history of dramatic literature.
                    This play, which is devoid of any love-story, long continued to be considered
                    the master-piece of Italian tragedy; Voltaire, who declared it “worthy of the
                    most glorious days of Athens,” adapted it for the French stage, and it inspired
                    a, celebrated production of the English drama.<note anchored="true"

                    <hi rend="italic">parody;</hi> and by the highly esteemed productions of
                    Granelli (d. 1769) and his contemporary Bettinelli. The influence of Voltaire
                    had now come to predominate over the Italian drama; and, in accordance with the
                    spirit of the times, greater freedom prevailed in the choice of tragic themes.
                    Thus the greatest of Italian tragic poets, Count V. Alfieri (1749-1803), found
                    his path prepared for him. Alfieri’s grand and impassioned treatment of his
                    subjects caused his faultiness of form, which he never altogether overcame, to
                    be forgotten. The· spirit of a love of freedom which his creations<note

                    Spurning the usages of French tragedy, his plays, which abound in soliloquies,
                    owe part of their effect to an impassioned force of declamation, part to those
                    “points” by which Italian acting seems pre-eminently capable of thrilling an
                    audience. He has much—besides the subjects of two of his dramas<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Filippo; Maria
                    Siuarda.</p></note> —in common with Schiller; but his amazon-muse (as Schlegel
                    called her) was not schooled into serenity, like the muse of the German poet.
                    Among his numerous plays (21), <hi rend="italic">Merope</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Saul,</hi> and perhaps <hi rend="italic">Mirra,</hi> are accounted
                    his master-pieces.</p>
                <p>The political colouring given by Alfieri to Italian tragedy reappears in the
                    plays of U. Foscolo (c. 1760-1827) and A. Manzoni (1784-1873), both of whom are
                    under the influence of the romantic school of modern literature; and to these
                    names must be added those of S. Pellico (1789-1854) and G. B. Niccolini
                    (1785-1861), whose most celebrated dramas<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Pellico, Francesca da Rimini; Niccolini, Giovanni da
                    Procida.; Beatrice Ccnci.</p></note> treat national themes familiar to all
                    students of modern history and literature. While Italian tragedy has upon the
                    whole adhered to its love of strong situations and passionate declamation, its
                    later growths have shown a capability of development precluding the supposition
                    that its history is closed. The art of tragic acting at the present day probably
                    stands higher in Italy than in any other European country; if the tragic muse
                    were to be depicted with the features of a living artist, it is those of
                    Adelaide Ristori which she would assume.</p>
                <p>In comedy, the efforts of the scholars of the Italian Renaissance for a time went
                    side by side with the progress of the popular entertainments noticed above.

                    that “they shut the door in Italy to good harlequins.” Distinct from this growth
                    is that of the <hi rend="italic">masked</hi> comedy, the action of which was
                    chiefly carried on by certain typical figures in masks, speaking in local
                    dialects,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The masked
                    characters, each of which spoke the dialect of the place lie represented, were
                    (according to Baretti) <hi rend="italic">Ραηtαloηe,</hi> a Venetian merchant;

                    a wag of Apulia; <hi rend="italic">Giangurgulo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    such personages (of whom four at least appeared in each play), there were the
                    <hi rend="italic">Arnorosos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Innarnoratos,</hi> men or
                    women (the latter not before 1560, up to which time actresses were unknown in
                    Italy) with serious parts, and <hi rend="italic">Smeraldina, Colombina,
                    Spilletta,</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">servettas</hi> or waiting-maids. All
                    these spoke Tuscan or Roman, and wore no masks.</p></note> but which was not
                    improvised, and indeed from the nature of the case hardly could have been. Its
                    inventor was A. Beolco of Padua, who called himself Ruzzante (joker), and who
                    published six comedies in various dialects, including the Greek of the day
                    (1530). This was the masked comedy to which the Italians so tenaciously cluug,
                    and in which, as all their own and imitable by no other nation, they took so
                    great a pride that even Goldoni was unable to overthrow it.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Latin imitations of Roman, varied by occasional translations of
                    Greek, comedies early led to the production of Italian translations, several of
                    which were performed at Ferrara in the 15th century, and before its close to the
                    composition of what is regarded as the first original Italian comedy—in other
                    words, as the first of the modern drama. But the claim to this honour of
                    Boiardo’s <hi rend="italic">Timone</hi> (before 1494) is doubtful—not in

                    that it is not taken from Plautus, is thought to have -been composed not long
                    before its representation in 1508.</p></note> but because this play is only in
                    part original, being founded upon, and in a great measure taken from, a dialogue
                    of Lucian’s; since moreover its personages are abstractions, it represents at
                    most the transition from the moralities. The “first Italian comedy in verse,”
                    Ricchi’s <hi rend="italic">I Tre Tirαηηi</hi> (before 1530), is likewise a
                    morality, and Trissino’s comedy, which followed, a mere adaptation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Menoechmi</hi> of Plautus. About this time, however, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commedia emιdita,</hi> or scholarly comedy, began to be cultivated
                    by a succession of eminent writers, among whom th.6 title of the father of
                    modern comedy, if it belongs to any man, belongs to Ariosto (1474-1533). His
                    comedies (though the first two were originally written in prose) are in blank
                    verse, to which he gave a singular mobility by the dactylic ending of the line
                    <hi rend="italic">{sdrucciold).</hi> Ariosto’s models were the masterpieces of
                    the <hi rend="italic">palliata,</hi> and his morals those of his age, which

                <p>Byzantium in looseness, and surpassed them in effrontery. He chose his subjects
                    accordingly; but his dramatic genius displayed itself in the effective drawing

                    mythological and allegorical elements—was purely literary, and arose directly
                    out of the classical studies and tastes of the Renaissance. Its first example
                    was the renowned scholar A. Poliziano’s <hi rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> (1472),
                    which begins like an idyll and ends like a tragedy. Intended to be performed
                    with music—for the pastoral drama is the parent of the opera—this beautiful work
                    tells its story simply. N. da Correggio’s (1450-1508) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cefalo,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aurora,</hi> and others followed, before in
                    1554 A. Beccari produced, as totally new of its kind, his Arcadian pastoral
                    drama <hi rend="italic">II Sagmfizio,</hi> in which the comic element
                    predominates. But an epoch in the history of the species is marked by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aminta</hi> of Tasso (1573), in whose Arcadia is allegorically
                    mirrored the Ferrara court. Adorned by choral lyrics of great beauty, it
                    presents an allegorical treatment of a social and moral problem; and since the
                    conception of the characters, all of whom think and speak of nothing but love,
                    is artificial, the charm of the poem lies not in the interest of its action, but
                    in the passion and sweetness of its sentiment. This work was the model of many
                    others, and the pastoral drama reached its height of popularity in the famous
                    <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi> (written before 1590) of B. Guarini, which,
                    while founded on a tragic love-story, introduces into its complicated plot a
                    comic element, partly with a satirical intention. Thus, both in Italian and in
                    other literatures, the pastoral drama became a distinct species, characterized
                    like the great body of modern pastoral poetry in general by a tendency either
                    towards the artificial or towards the burlesque. Its artificiality-affected the
                    entire growth of Italian comedy, including the <hi rend="italic">Commedia
                    dell'arte,</hi> and impressed itself in an intensified form upon the opera. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Opera).</hi> The foremost Italian masters of the last-named
                    species, so far as it can claim to be included in the poetic drama, were A. Zeno
                    (1668-1750) and P. Metastasio (1698-1782).</p>
                <p>The comic dramatists of the 17th century are grouped as followers of the
                    classical and of the romantic school, G. B. Porta and G. A. Cicognini (whom
                    Goldoni describes as full of whining pathos and common-place drollery, but as
                    still possessing a great power to interest) being regarded as the leading
                    representatives of the former. But neither of these largely intermixed groups of
                    writers could, with all its fertility, prevail against the competition on the
                    one hand of the musical drama, and on the other of the popular farcical

                    into decay, when its reform was undertaken by the wonderful theatrical genius of
                    C. Goldoni (1707-1793). One of the most fertile and rapid of playwrights (of his
                    150 comedies 16 were written and acted in a single year), he at the same time
                    pursued definite aims as a dramatist. Disgusted with the conventional
                    buffoonery, and ashamed of the rampaut immorality, of the Italian comic stage,
                    he drew his characters from real life, whether of his native city (Venice)<note

                    school, and Gozzi’s efforts, which though successful found hardly any imitators
                    in Italy, have a family resemblance to those of Tieck. During the latter part of
                    the 18th and the early years of the present century comedy continued to follow
                    the course marked out by its acknowledged master Goldoni, under the influence of
                    the sentimental drama of France and other countries. Villi, Nelli, the Marquis
                    Albergati Capacelli, Sografi, Federici, and Signorelli (the historian of the
                    drama) are mentioned among the writers of this school; to the present century
                    belong Count Giraud, Marchisio (who took his subjects especially from commercial
                    life), and Nota, a fertile writer, among whose plays are three treating the
                    lives of poets. Of still more recent date are Bon and Brofferio. Though no
                    recent Italian comedies have acquired so wide a celebrity as that which has been
                    obtained by the successful productions of the recent French stage, there seems
                    no reason to predict a barren future for Italian comedy any more than for
                    Italian tragedy. Both the one and the other have survived periods of a seemingly
                    hopeless decline; tragedy has been rescued from the pedantry of a timid
                    classicism, and comedy from the conventionalism of its most popular but least
                    progressive form; and neither the opera nor the ballet has succeeded in ousting
                    from the national stage the legitimate forms of the national drama.</p>
                <p>To the above summary of the history of the modern Italian drama it would not have
                    been inappropriate to append a brief account of that of the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of the literary movement which preceded their glorious struggle for
                    independence, or which may be said to form part of that struggle. After
                    beginning with dramatic dialogues of a patriotic tendency, it took a step in
                    advance with the tragedies of J. R. Nerulos<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    having introduced the use of prose into Greek tragedy, while preserving to it
                    that association with sentiments and aspirations which will probably long
                    continue to pervade the chief productions of modern Greek literature. The love
                    of the theatre is ineradicable from Attic as it is from Italian soil; and the
                    tendencies of the young dramatic literature of Hellas seem to justify the hope
                    that a worthy future awaits it.</p>
                <p>Italy produced many brilliant growths, from which the dramatic literatures of
                    other nations largely borrowed; but <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi> is the only
                    country of modern Europe which shares with England the honour of having
                    achieved, at a relatively early date, the creation of a genuinely national form
                    of the regular drama. So proper to Spain was the form of the drama which she
                    produced and perfected, that to it the term <hi rend="italic">romantic</hi> has
                    been specifically applied, though so restricted a use of the epithet is clearly
                    unjustifiable. The influences which from the Romance peoples—in whom Christian
                    and Germanic elements mingled with the legacy of Roman law, learning, and
                    culture—spread to the Germanic nations were represented with the most signal
                    force and fulness in the institutions of chivalry,—to which, in the words of
                    Scott, “it was peculiar to blend military valour with the strongest passions
                    which actuate the human mind, the feelings of devotion and those of love.” These
                    feelings, in their combined operation upon the national character, and in their
                    reflection in the national literature, were not peculiar to Spain; but nowhere
                    did they so long or so late continue to animate the moral life of a nation.
                    Outward causes contributed to this result. For centuries after the crusades had
                    become a mere memory, Spain was a battle ground between the cross and the
                    crescent. And it was precisely at the time when the Renaissance was establishing
                    new starting-points for the literary progress of Europe, that Christian Spain
                    rose to the height of Catholic as well as national self-consciousness by the
                    expulsion of the Moors and the conquest of the New World. From their rulers or
                    rivals of so many centuries the Spaniards had derived that rich glow of colour
                    which became permanently distinctive of their national life, and more especially
                    of its literary and artistic expressions; they had also perhaps derived from the
                    same source an equally characteristic refinement in their treatment of the
                    passion of love. The ideas of Spanish chivalry—more especially religious
                    devotion and a punctilious sense of personal honour—asserted themselves
                    (according to a process often observable in the history of civilization) with
                    peculiar distinctness in literature and art, after the great achievements to
                    which they had contributed in other fields had already been wrought. The ripest
                    glories of the Spanish drama belong to an age of national decay—mindful, it is
                    true, of the ideas of a greater past. The chivalrous enthusiasm pervading so
                    many of the master-pieces of its literature is indeed a characteristic of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n439/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0439-0420"/> the Spanish nation in all, even in the least
                    hopeful, periods of its later history; and the religious ardour breathed by
                    these works, though associating itself with what is called the Catholic
                    Reaction, is iu truth only a manifestation of the spirit which informed the
                    noblest part of the Reformation movement itself. The Spanish drama neither
                    sought nor could seek to emancipate itself from views and forms of religious
                    life more than ever sacred to the Spanish people since the glorious days of
                    Ferdinand and Isabella; and it is not in the beginnings but in the great age of
                    Spanish dramatic literature thatthere is often mostdifficulty in distinguishing
                    between what is to betermed a religious and what a secular play. After Spain had
                    thus, the first after England among modern European countries, fully unfolded
                    that incomparably richest expression of national life and sentiment in an
                    artistic form—a truly national dramatic literature,—the terrible decay of her
                    greatness and prosperity gradually impaired the strength of a brilliant but, of
                    its nature, dependent growth. In the absence of high original genius the Spanish
                    dramatists began to turn to foreign models, though little supported in such
                    attempts by popular sympathy; and it is only in more recent times that the
                    Spanish drama has sought to reproduce the ancient forms from whose master-pieces
                    the nation had never become estranged, while accommodating them to tastes and
                    tendencies shared by later Spanish literature with that of Europe at large.</p>
                <p>The earlier dramatic efforts of Spanish literature may without inconvenience be
                    briefly dismissed. The reputed author of the <hi rend="italic">Couplets of Mingo
                    Pevulgo</hi> (R. Cota the elder) likewise composed the first act of a story of
                    intrigue and character, purely dramatic but not intended for representation.

                    >Meliboea,</hi> which was completed (in 21 acts) by 1499, afterwards became
                    famous under the name of <hi rend="italic">Celestina;</hi> it was frequently
                    imitated and translated, and was adapted for the Spanish stage by R. de Zepeda
                    in 1582. But the father of the Spanish drama was J. de la Enzina (b. c. 1468),
                    whose <hi rend="italic">represcntacion.es</hi> under the name of “eclogues” were
                    dramatic dialogues of a religious or pastoral character. His attempts were
                    imitated more especially by Gil Vicente (fl. 1502-1536), a Portuguese who wrote
                    both in Spanish and in his native tongue—the dramatic literature of which is
                    stated to have produced nothing of equal merit afterwards. (The Portuguese
                    literary drama is held to have begun with the prose comedies of Vicente’s
                    contemporary, F. de Sa de Miranda.) A further impulse came, as was natural, from
                    Spaniards resident in Italy, and especially from B. de T. Naharro, who in 1517
                    published, as the chief among the “firstlings of his genius <hi rend="italic">”

                    generally applied in Spanish literature to any kind of drama. He claimed some
                    knowledge of the theory of the ancient drama, divided his plays into <hi

                    audacious in tone, and were soon prohibited by the Inquisition. The church
                    remained unwilling to renounce her control over such dramatic exhibitions as she
                    permitted, and sought to suppress the few plays on not strictly religious
                    subjects which appeared in the early part of the reign of Charles I. The few
                    translations published from the classical drama exercised no effect.</p>
                <p>Thus the foundation of the Spanish national theatre was reserved for a man of the
                    people. Cervantes has vividly sketched the humble resources which were at the
                    command of Lope de Rueda (fl. 1544-1567), a mechanic of Seville, who with his
                    friend the bookseller Timoneda, and two brother authors and actors in his
                    strolling company, succeeded in bringing dramatic entertainments out of the
                    churches and palaces into the public places of the towns, where they were
                    produced on temporary scaffolds. The manager carried about his properties in a
                    com sack; and the “comedies” were still only “dialogues, and a species of
                    eclogues between two or three shepherds and a shepherdess,” enlivened at times
                    by intermezzos of favourite comic figures, such as the negress or the Biscayan,
                    “played with inconceivable talent and truthfulness by Lope.” One of his plays at

                    Rueda and his friends a considerable dramatic activity began in the years
                    1560-1590 in geveral Spanish cities, and before the close of this period
                    permanent theatres began to be fitted up at Madrid. Yet Spanish dramatic
                    literature might still have been led to follow Italian in turning to an
                    imitation of classical models. Two plays by G. Bermudez (1577), called by their
                    learned author “the first Spanish tragedies,” treating the national subject of
                    Inez de Castro, but divided into five acts, composed in various metres, and
                    introducing a chorus; a <hi rend="italic">Dido (c.</hi> 1580) by C. de Virues
                    (who claimed to have first divided dramas into three <hi rend="italic"

                    praised in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote)</hi> alike pointed in this
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Such were the alternatives which had opened for the Spanish drama, when at last,
                    about the same time as that of the English, its future was determined by writers
                    of original genius. The first of these was the immortal Cervantes, who, however,
                    failed to anticipate by his earlier plays (1584-1588) the great (though to him
                    unproductive) success of his famous romance. In his endeavour to give a poetic
                    character to the drama he fell upon the expedient of introducing personifiîd
                    abstractions speaking a “divine ’’ or elevated language-—a device which was for
                    a time favourably received. But these plays exhibit a neglect or ignorance of
                    the laws of dramatic construction; their action is episodical; and it is from
                    the realism of these episodes (especially in the A <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> Mwzαnciα, which is crowded with both figures and incidents), and from the
                    power and flow of the declamation, that their effect must have been derived.
                    When in his later years (1615) Cervantes returned to dramatic composition, the
                    style and form of the national drama bad been definitively settled by a large
                    number of writers, the brilliant success of whose acknowledged chief may
                    previously have diverted Cervantes from his labours for the theatre. His
                    influence upon the general progress of dramatic literature is, however, to be
                    sought, not only in his plays, but also in those <hi rend="italic"
                    >novelas</hi><hi rend="italic">exemplares</hi> to which more than one drama is
                    indebted for its plot, and for much of its dialogue to boot.</p>
                <p>Lope de Vega (1562-1635), one of the most astonishing geniuses the world has
                    known, permanently established the national forms of the Spanish drama. Some of
                    these were in their beginnings taken over by him from ruder predecessors; some
                    were cultivated with equal or even superior success by subsequent authors; but
                    in variety, as in fertility of dramatic production, he has no rivals. His <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n440/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0440-0421"/> fertility, which was such that ho wrote about
                    1500 plays, besides 300 dramatic works classed as <hi rend="italic">autos
                    sacramentales</hi> and <hi rend="italic">entremeses,</hi> and a vast series of
                    other literary compositions, has indisputably prejudiced his reputation with
                    those to whom he 13 but a name and a number. Yet as a dramatist Lope more fully
                    exemplifies the capabilities of the Spanish theatre than any of his successors,
                    though as a poet Calderon may deserve the palm. Nor would it be possible to
                    imagine a truer representative of the Spain of his age than a poet who, after
                    suffering the hardships of poverty and exile, and the pangs of passion, sailed
                    against the foes of the faith in the Invincible Armada, subsequently became a
                    member of the Holy Inquisition and of the Order of St Francis, and after having
                    been decorated by the Pope with the cross of Malta and a theological doctorate,
                    honoured by the nobility, and idolized by the nation, ended with the names of
                    Jesus and Mary on his lips. From the plays of such a writer we may best learn
                    the manners and the sentiments, the ideas of religion and honour, of the Spain
                    of the Philippine age, the age when she was most prominent in the eyes of Europe
                    and most glorious in her own. For, with all its inventiveness and vigour, the
                    genius of Lope primarily set itself the task of pleasing his public,—the very
                    spirit of whose inner as well as outer life is accordingly mirrored in his
                    dramatic works. In them we have, in the words of Lope’s French translator Baret,
                    “the movement, the clamour, the conflict of unforeseen intrigues suitable to
                    unreflecting spectators; perpetual flatteries addressed to an unextinguishable
                    national pride; the painting of passions dear to a people never tired of
                    admiring itself; the absolute sway of the point of honour; the deification of
                    revenge; the adoration of symbols; buffoonery and burlesque, everywhere beloved
                    of the multitude, but here never defiled by obscenities, for this people has a
                    sense of delicacy, and the foundation of its character is nobility; lastly, the
                    flow of proverbs which at times escape from the <hi rend="italic">gracicso”</hi>
                    (the comic servant domesticated in the Spanish drama by Lope)—“the commonplace
                    literature of those who possess no other.”</p>
                <p>The plays of Lope, and those of the national Spanish drama in general, are
                    divided into classes which it is naturally not always easy, and which there is
                    no reason to suppose him always to have intended, to keep distinct from one
                    another. After in his early youth composing eclogues, pastoral plays, and
                    allegorical moralities in the old style, he began his theatrical activity at
                    Madrid about 1590, and the plays which he thenceforth produced have been
                    distributed under the following heads. The <hi rend="italic">comedias,</hi> all
                    of which are in verse, include (1) the so-called c. <hi rend="italic">de

                    proper, but dramas the principal personages in which are taken from the class of
                    society which wears cloak and sword. Gallantry is their main theme, an
                    interesting and complicated, but well-constructed and perspicuous intrigue their
                    chief feature; and this is usually accompanied by an underplot in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">gracioso</hi> plays his part. Their titles are frequently taken
                    from the old proverbs or proverbial phrases of the people,<note anchored="true"

                    the theme suggested by which the plays often (as Mr Lewes admirably expresses
                    it) constitute a kind of gloss <hi rend="italic">(glosai)</hi> in action. This
                    is the favourite species of the national Spanish theatre; and to the plots of
                    the plays belonging to it the drama of other nations owes a debt almost
                    incalculable in extent. (2) The <hi rend="italic">c.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Lope condescended in the opposite direction, to (3) plays of which the scene is
                    laid in common life, but for which no special name appears to have existed.<note

                    national drama. This claim she had never relinquished, even when she could no
                    longer retain an absolute control over the stage. For a time, indeed, she was
                    able to reassert even this; for the exhibition of all secular plays was in 1598
                    prohibited by the dying Philip IL, and remained so for tw o years; and Lope with
                    his usual facility proceeded to supply religious plays of various kinds. After a
                    few dramas on scriptural subjects he turned to the legends of the saints; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">comedias de santos,</hi> of which he wrote a great number,
                    became an accepted later Spanish variety of the miracle-play. True, however, to
                    the popular instincts of his genius, he threw himself with special zeal and
                    success into the composition of another kind of religious plays—a development of
                    the Corpus Christi pageants, in honour of which all the theatres had to close
                    their doors for a month. These were the famous <hi rend="italic">autos
                    sacramentales (i.e.,</hi> solemn “acts” or proceedings in honour of the
                    Sacrament), which were performed in the open air by actors who had filled the
                    cars of the sacred procession. Of these Lope wrote about 400. These
                    entertainments were arranged on a fixed scheme, comprising a prologue in
                    dialogue between two or more actors in character <hi rend="italic">(lοa),</hi> a
                    farce <hi rend="italic">(entremes),</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">auto</hi>
                    proper, an allegorical scene of religious purport, as an example of which
                    Ticknor cites the <hi rend="italic">Bridge of the World,—</hi> in which the
                    Prince of Darkness in vain seeks to defend the bridge against the Knight of the
                    Cross, who finally leads the Soul of Man in triumph across it. Not all the <hi
                    rend="italic">entremeses</hi> of Lope and others were, however, composed for
                    insertion in these <hi rend="italic">aτdos.</hi> This long-lived popular
                    species, together with the old kind of dramatic dialogue called <hi
                    rend="italic">eclogues,</hi> completes the list of the varieties of his dramatic
                    works.</p>
                <p>The example of Lope was followed by a large number of writers, and Spain thus
                    rapidly became possessed of a dramatic literature almost unparalleled in
                    quantity—for in fertility also Lope was but the first among many. Among the
                    writers of Lope’s school, his friend G. de Castro (1569-1631) must not be passed
                    by, for his <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was the basis of Corneille’s; nor J. P. de Montalvan (1612-1638), “the
                    first-born of Lope’s genius,” the extravagance of whose imagination, like that
                    of Lee, culminated in madness. Soon after him died (1639) Ruiz de Alarcon, in
                    whose plays, as contrasted with those of Lope, has been recognized the
                    distinctive element of a moral purpose. To G. Tellez, called Tirso de Molina (d.
                    1648), no similar praise seems due; but the frivolous gaiety of the inventor of

                    of Philip II. had been recalled two years after his death and was never renewed;
                    and the activity of the theatre spread through the towns and villages of the
                    land, everywhere under the controlling influence of the school of writers who
                    had established so complete a harmony between the drama and the tastes and
                    tendencies of the people.</p>
                <p>The glories of Spanish dramatic literature reached their height in P. Calderon de
                    la Barca (1600-1681), though in the history of the Spanish theatre he holds only
                    the second place. He elaborated some of the forms of the national drama, but
                    brought about no changes of moment in any of them. Even the brilliancy of his
                    style, glittering with a constant reproduction of the same family of tropes, and
                    the variety of his melodious versification, are mere intensifications of the
                    poetic qualities of Lope, while in their moral and religious sentiments, and
                    their general views of history and society, there is no difference between the
                    two. Like Lope, Calderon was a soldier in his youth and an ecclesiastic in his
                    later years; like him he suited himself to the tastes of both court and people,
                    and applied his genius with equal facility to the treatment of religious and of
                    secular themes. In fertility he was inferior to Lope (for he wrote not many more
                    than 100 plays); but he surpasses the elder poet in richness of style, and more
                    especially in fire of imagination. In his <hi rend="italic">autos</hi> (of which
                    he is said to have left not less than 73), Calderon probably attained to his
                    most distinctive excellence; some of these appear to take a wide range of
                    allegorical invention,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>During the life of the second great master of the Spanish drama there was little
                    apparent abatement in the productivity of its literature; while the <hi

                    representation was prohibited by royal decree. In the world of fashion, the
                    opera had reached Spain already during Calderon’s lifetime, together with other
                    French influences, and the great dramatist had himself written one or two of his
                    plays for performance with music. But the regular national drama continued to
                    command popular favour; and with A. Moreto (1618-1669) may be said to have even
                    taken a fresh step. "While he wrote in all the forms established by Lope and
                    cultivated by Calderon, his manner seems most nearly to approach the
                    master-pieces of French and later English comedy of character; he was the
                    earliest writer of the <hi rend="italic">comedias de figuron,</hi> in which the
                    most prominent personage is (in Congreve’s phrase) “a character of affectation,”

                    Spanish drama in all its forms retained its command over the nation, because
                    they were alike popular in origin and character; nor is there any other example
                    of so complete an adaptation of a national art to the national taste and
                    sentiment in its ethics and aesthetics, in the nature of the plots of the plays
                    (whatever their origin), in the motives of their actions, in the conduct and
                    tone and in the very costume of their characters.</p>
                <p>National as it was, and because of this very quality, the Spanish drama was fated
                    to share the lot of the people it so fully represented. At the end of the 17th
                    century, when the Spanish throne at last became the declared apple of discord
                    among the Governments of Europe, the Spanish people lay, in the words of a
                    historian of its later days, “like a corpse, incapable of feeling its own
                    impotence.” That national art to which it had so faithfully clung had fallen
                    into decline and decay with the spirit of Spain itself. By the time of the close
                    of the great war, the theatre had sunk into a mere amusement of the populace,
                    which during the greater part of the 18th century, while allowing the old
                    masters the measure of favour which accords with traditional esteem, continued
                    to uphold the representatives of the old drama in its degeneracy—authors on the
                    level of their audiences. But the Spanish court was now French, and France in
                    the drama, even more than in any other form of art, was the arbiter of taste in
                    Europe. With the restoration of peace accordingly began isolated attempts to
                    impose the French canons of dramatic theory, and to follow the example of French
                    dramatic practice; and in the middle of the century these endeavours assumed
                    more definite form. Montiano’s bloodless tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Virginia</hi> (1750), which was never acted, was accompanied by a discourse
                    endeavouring to reconcile the doctrines of the author with the practice of the
                    old Spanish dramatists; the play itself was in blank verse (a metre never used
                    by Calderon, though occasionally by Lope), instead of the old national
                    ballad-measures (the romance-measure with assurance and the rhymed <hi
                    rend="italic">redondillα</hi> quatrain) preferred by the old masters among the
                    variety of metres employed by them. The earliest Spanish comedy in the French

                    others (including Ayala, who ventured in 1775 to compete with Cervantes on the
                    theme of Numantia), and in comedy by Yriarte and Jovellanos (afterwards minister
                    under Godoy), who produced a sentimental comedy in Diderot’s manner.<note

                    dramatists of his age. In tragedy N. de Cienfuegos (d. 1809) likewise showed
                    some originality. After, however, the troubles of the French domination and the
                    war had come to an end, the precepts and examples of the new school failed to
                    reassert themselves. The Spanish dramatists of the present century, after
                    passing, as in the instances of F. Martinez de la Rosa and Breton de los
                    Horreros, from the system of French comedy to the manner of the national drama,
                    appear either to have stood under the influence of the French romantic school,
                    or to have returned once more to the old national models. Among the former class
                    A. Gil y Zarate, among the latter J. Zorilla, are mentioned as specially
                    prominent. Meanwhile the old popular religious performances are not wholly
                    extinct in Spain, and their relics may long continue to survive there. Whatever
                    may be the future history of one of the most remarkable of dramatic literatures,
                    it may confidently be predicted that so long as Spain is Spain, her theatre will
                    not be permanently denationalized, and that the revolutions it may be destined
                    to undergo are unlikely to extinguish, in whatever degree they may repress, its
                    conservative elements.</p>
                <p>The beginnings of the regular drama in <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> which
                    here, without absolutely determining, potently swayed its entire course, sprang
                    directly from the literary movement of the Renaissance. Du Bellay sounded the
                    note of attack which converted that movement in France into an endeavour to
                    transform the national literature; and in Ronsard the classical school of poetry
                    put forward its conquering hero and sovereign lawgiver. Among the disciples who
                    gathered round Ronsard, and with him formed the “Pleiad” of French literature,
                    Stephen Jodelle (1532-1572), the reformer of the French theatre, soon held a
                    distinguished place. The stage of this period left ample room for the enterprise
                    of this youthful writer. The popularity of the old entertainments had reached
                    its height when Louis XII., in his conflict with Pope Julius II., had not
                    scrupled to call in the aid of Pierre Grégoire (Gringore), and when the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mère Sotte</hi> had mockingly masqueraded in the petticoats of
                    Holy Church. Under Francis I. the Inquisition had to some extent succeeded in
                    repressing the audacity of the actors, whose follies were at the same time an
                    utter abomination in the eyes of the Huguenots. For a time the very mysteries
                    had been prohibited. Meanwhile, isolated translations of Italian<note

                    transferred to the stage itself. His tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Cleopatre
                    Captive,</hi> was produced there on the same day as his comedy, <hi
                    rend="italic">HEugene,</hi> in 1552, his <hi rend="italic">Didon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">se sacrifiant</hi> following in 1558. Thus at a time when a
                    national theatre was perhaps impossible in a country distracted by civil and
                    religious conflicts, whose monarchy had not yet welded together a number of
                    provinces attached each to its own traditions, and whose population, especially
                    in the capital, was enervated by frivolity or enslaved by fanaticism, was born
                    that long-lived artificial growth, the so-called classical tragedy of France.
                    For French comedy, though subjected to the same influences as tragedy, had a
                    national basis upon which to proceed, and its history is partly that of a
                    modification of old popular forms.</p>
                <p>The history of French tragedy begins with the <hi rend="italic">Cleopatre
                    Captivefra</hi> the representation of which the author, together with other
                    members of the “Pleiad,” took part. It is a tragedy in the manner of Seneca,
                    devoid of action and provided with a ghost and a chorus. Though mainly written
                    rn the five-foot Iambic couplet, it already contains passages in the Alexandrine
                    metre, which soon afterwards La Péruse by his <hi rend="italic">Μedee</hi> (pr.
                    1556) established in French tragedy, and which Jodelle employed in his <hi

                    various authors, among whom Bounyn produced the first French regular tragedy on

                    distinguished themselves by their style. Though in the reign of Charles IX. a
                    vain attempt was made by Filleul to introduce the pastoral style of the Italians
                    into French tragedy<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    entertainments, and the religious drama making its expiring efforts), the
                    classical school, in spite of all difficulties, prevailed. Monchrestien
                    exhibited unusual vigour of rhetoric;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    R. Garnier (1545-1601) French tragedy reached the greatest height in nobility
                    and dignity of style, as well as in the exhibition of dramatic passion, to which
                    it attained before Corneille. In his tragedies<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>La Juive, kc.</p></note> choruses are still
                    interspersed among the long Alexandrine tirades of the dialogue.</p>
                <p>During this period, comedy had likewise been influenced by classical models; but
                    the distance was less between the national farces and Terence, than between the
                    mysteries and moralities, and Seneca and the Greeks. <hi rend="italic"
                    >HEugene</hi> differs little in style from the more elaborate of the old farces;
                    and while it satirizes the foibles of the clergy without any appreciable
                    abatement of the old licence, its theme is the favourite burden of the French

                    and was ready to coalesce with French actors, without, however, relinquishing
                    all remembrance of its origin. R. Belleau( 1528-1577), a member of the “Pleiad,”

                    solace or distract its weariness and its sufferings with the help of the
                    ministers of that half-cynical gaiety which has always lighted up the darkest
                    hours of French popular life. In the troublous days preceding Richelieu’s
                    definitive accession to power (1624) the <hi rend="italic">Tabarinades—</hi> a
                    kind of street dialogue recalliug the earliest days of the popular drama—had
                    made the Pont-Neuf the favourite theatre of the Parisian populace. Meanwhile the
                    influenβe of Spain, which Henry IV. had overcome in politics, had throughout his
                    reign and afterwards been predominant in other spheres, and not the least in
                    that of literature. The <hi rend="italic">stilo culto,</hi> of which Gongora was
                    the native Spanish, Marino the Italian, and Lyly the English representative,
                    asserted its dominion over the favourite authors of French society; the pastoral
                    romance of Honoré d’Urfé—the text-book of pseudo-pastoral gallantry—was the
                    parent of the romances of the Scudérys and De la Calprenède; the Hôtel de
                    Rambouillet was in its glory; the true (not the false) <hi rend="italic"
                    >précieuses</hi> sat on the heights of intellectual society; and Balzac

                    Voiture were the dictators of its literature. Much of the French drama of this
                    age is of the same kind as its romance-literature, like which it fell under the
                    polite castigation of Boileau’s satire. Heroic love (quite a technical passion),
                    “fertile in tender sentiments,” seized hold of the theatre as well as of the
                    romances; and Calprenède (1610-1663), G. de Scudéry<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>P Amour Tyrannique.</p></note> (1601-1667)
                    and his sister (1607-1701), and others were equally fashionable in both species.
                    Meanwhile Spanish and Italiau models continued to influence both branches of the
                    drama. Everybody knew by heart Gongora’s version of the story of “young Pyramus
                    and his love Thisbe” as dramatized by Th. Viaud (1590-1626); and the sentiment
                    of Tristan<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Marianne,</p></note> (1601-1655) overpowered Herod on the stage, and drew
                    tears from Cardinal Richelieu in the audience. Even Duryer’s (1609-1659) style,
                    otherwise superior to that of his contemporaries, is stated to have been Italian
                    in its defects. A mixture of the forms of classical comedy with elements of
                    Spanish and of the Italian pastoral was attempted with great temporary success
                    by A. Hardi (1560-1631), a playwright who thanked Heaven that he knew the
                    precepts of his art while preferring to follow the demands of his trade. The
                    mixture of styles begun by him was carried on by Racan (1589-1670), Rotrou
                    (1609-1650), and others; and among these comedies of intrigue in the Spanish

                <p>P. Corneille (1606-1684) is justly revered as the first, and in some respects the
                    unequalled, great master of French tragedy, whatever may have been unsound in
                    his theories, or defective iu his practice. The attempts of his predecessors had
                    been without life, because they lacked really tragic characters and the play of
                    really tragic passions; while their style had been either pedantically imitative
                    or a medley of plagiarisms. He conquered tragedy at once for the national
                    theatre and for the national literature, and this not by a long tentative
                    process of production, but by a few master-pieces,—for in his many later
                    tragedies he never again proved fully equal to himself. The French tragedy, of
                    which the great age begins with the <hi rend="italic">Cid, Horace,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cinna,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polyeucte,</hi> was not,
                    whatever it professed to be, a copy of the classical tragedy of Greeks or
                    Romans, or an imitation of the Italian imitations of these; nor, though in his
                    later tragedies Corneille depended less and less upon characters, and more and
                    more, after the fashion of the Spaniards, upon situations, were the forms of the
                    Spanish drama able to assert their dominion over the French tragic stage. The
                    mould of French tragedy was cast by Corneille; but the creative power of his
                    genius was unable to fill it with more than a few examples. His range of
                    passions and characters was limited; he preferred, he said, the reproach of
                    having made his women too heroic to that of having made his men effeminate. His
                    actions inclined too much to the exhibition of conflicts political rather than
                    broadly ethical in their significance. The defects of his style are of less
                    moment; but in this, as in other respects, he was, with all his strength and
                    brilliancy, not one of those rarest of artists who are at once the example and
                    the despair of their successors.</p>
                <p>In comedy also Corneille begins the first great original epoch of French dramatic
                    literature; for it was to him that Molière owed the inspiration of the tone and
                    style which he made those of the higher forms of French comedy. But <hi

                    tragicomedy Corneille can hardly be said to have invented; and of the mongrel
                    growth of sentimental comedy, domestic drama or <hi rend="italic">drame,</hi> he
                    rather suggested than exemplified the conditions.</p>
                <p>The tragic art of Racine (1639-1699) supplements rather than surpasses that of
                    his older contemporary. His works reflect the serene and settled formality of an
                    age in which the sun of monarchy shone with an effulgence no clouds seemed
                    capable of obscuring, and in which the life of a nation seemed reducible to the
                    surroundings of a court. The tone of the poetic literature of such an age is not
                    necessarily unreal, because the range of its ideas is limited, and because its
                    forms seem to exist by an immutable authority. Madame de Sévigné said of Racine,
                    whose plays so well suit themselves to the successive phases in the life of
                    Louis XIV., that in his later years he loved God as he had formerly loved his
                    mistresses; aud this sally at all events indicates the range of passions which
                    inspired his tragic muse. His heroes are all of one type—that of a gracious
                    gloriousness; his heroines vary in their fortunes, but they are all the
                    “trophies of love,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Andromaque; Phèdre; Bérénice, &amp;c.</p></note> with the exception of the
                    scriptural figures, which stand apart from the rest.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Esther; Athalic.</p></note></p>
                <p>T. Corneille (1625-1709), Campistron, Duché, Lafosse, and Quinault (1637-1688)
                    were mere followers of one or both of the great masters of tragedy, though the
                    last-named achieved a reputation of his own in the bastard species of the opera.
                    The form of French tragedy thus established, like everything else which formed
                    part of the “age of Louis XIV.,” proclaimed itself as the definitively settled
                    model of its kind, and was accepted as such by a submissive world. Proud of its
                    self-imposed fetters, French tragedy dictatorially denied the liberty of which
                    it had deprived itself to the art of which it claimed to furnish the highest
                    examples. Yet, though calling itself classical, it had not caught the essential
                    spirit of the tragedy of the Greeks. The elevation of tone which characterizes
                    the serious drama of the age of Louis XIV. is a real elevation, but its heights
                    do not lose themselves in a sphere peopled by the myths of a national religion.
                    Its personages are conventional like its themes, but the convention is with
                    itself only; Orestes and Iphigenia have not brought with them the cries of the
                    stern goddesses and the flame on the altar of Artemis; their passions like their

                    construction, the simplicity and regularity of the ancient models are
                    stereotyped into a rigid etiquette by the exigencies of the court-theatre, which
                    is but an apartment of the palace. The unities of time and place, with the
                    Greeks mere rules of convenience, French tragedy imposes upon itself as a
                    permanent yoke. The Euripidean prologue is judiciously exchanged for the
                    exposition of the first act, and the lyrical element essential to Greek tragedy
                    is easily suppressed in its would-be copy; lyrical passages still occur in some
                    of Corneille’s early master-pieces,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Le Cid; Polyeuete.</p></note> but the chorus is consistently
                    banished, to reappear only in Racine’s latest works<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Esther; Athαlie.</p></note> as a scholastic
                    experiment appropriate to a conventual atmosphere. Its uses for explanation and
                    comment are served by the expedient, which in its turn becomes conventional, of
                    the conversations with <hi rend="italic">confidants</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >confidantes,</hi> which more than sufficiently supply the foil of general
                    sentiments. The epical element is allowed full play in narrative passages, more
                    especially in those which relate parts of the catastrophe,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Corneille, <hi rend="italic">Rodogune;</hi>

                    stage intact from realisms, suit themselves to the generally rhetorical
                    character of this species of the tragic drama. This character impresses itself
                    more and more upon the tragic art of a rhetorical nation in an age when the
                    loftiest themes are elsewhere (in the pulpit) receiving the most artistic
                    oratorical treatment, and develops in the style of French tragedy the qualities
                    which cause it to become something between prose and poetry—or to appear (in the
                    phrase of a French critic) like prose in full dress. The force of this
                    description is borne out by the fact that the distinction between the
                    versification of French tragedy and that of French comedy is at times an
                    imperceptible one.</p>
                <p>The universal genius of Voltaire (1694-1778) found it necessary to shine in all
                    branches of literature, and in tragedy to surpass, predecessors whom his own
                    authority declared to have surpassed the efforts of the Attic muse. He succeeded
                    in impressing the v orld with the belief that his innovations had imparted a
                    fresh vitality to French tragedy; in truth, however, they represent no essential
                    advance in art, but rather augmented the rhetorical tendency which paralyzes
                    true dramatic life. Such life as his plays possess lies in their political and
                    social sentiments, their invective against tyranny,<note anchored="true"

                    tragedy where it was weakest—in character; and where it was strongest—in
                    diction—he never equalled Corneille in fire or Racine in refinement. While the
                    criticism to which French tragedy in*this age at last began to be subjected has
                    left unimpaired the real titles to immortality of its great masters, the French
                    theatre itself has all but buried in respectful oblivion the dramatic works
                    bearing the name of Voltaire—a name second to none in the history of modern
                    progress and of modern civilization.</p>
                <p>As it is of relatively little interest to note the ramifications of an art in its
                    decline, the contrasts need not be pursued among the contemporaries of Voltaire,
                    between his imitator Saurin (1706-1781), Saurin’s royalist rival De Belloy
                    (1727-1775), Racine’s imitator Lagrange-Chancel (1676-1758), and Voltaire’s own
                    would-be rival, the “terrible” Crébillon the elder (1674-1762), who professed to
                    vindicate to French tragedy, already mistress of the heavens through Corneille,
                    and of the earth through Racine, Pluto’s supplementary realm, but who, though
                    thus essaying to carry tragedy lower, failed to carry it further. In the latter
                    part of the 18th century French classical tragedy as a literary growth was dying
                    a slow death, however numerous might be the leaves which sprouted from the
                    decaying tree. Its form had been permanently fixed; and even Shakespeare, as
                    manipulated by Ducis<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Hamlet; Le Loi Lêar, Ac.</p></note> (1733-1816)·—an author whose tastes were
                    better than his times—failed to bring about a change. ‘ * It is a Moor, not a
                    Frenchman, who has written this play,” cried a spectator of Ducis’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Othello</hi> (1791); but though Talma might astonish the theatre,
                    Shakespeare’s influence over the French drama was only gradually preparing
                    itself, by means more especially of Letourneur’s translation (1776- 1782), which
                    attracted the sympathy of Diderot and the execrations of the aged Voltaire. The
                    command which classical French tragedy continued to assert over the stage was
                    due in part, no doubt, to the love of Roman drapery which in more than one sense
                    characterized the Revolution, and which was by the Revolution handed down to the
                    Empire. It was likewise, and more signally, due to the great actors who freed
                    the tragic stage from much of its artificiality and animated it by their genius,
                    No great artist has ever more generously estimated the labours of a predecessor
                    than Talma (1763-1826) judged those of Le Kain (1728- 1778); but it was Talma
                    himself whose genius was preeminently fitted to reproduce the great figures of
                    antiquity in the mimic world, which, like the world outside, both required and
                    possessed its Caesar. He, like Rachel (1821-1858) after him, reconciled French
                    classical tragedy with nature; and it is upon the art of great original actors
                    such as these that the theatrical future of this form of the drama in France
                    depends. Mere whims of fashion—even when inspired by political feeling—will not
                    ’ waft back to it a real popu larity; nor will occasional literary aftergrowths,
                    however meritorious, such as the effective <hi rend="italic">Lucrèce</hi> of F.
                    Ponsard, and the attempts of even more recent writers, suffice to reestablish a
                    living union between it and the progress of the national literature.</p>
                <p>The rival influences under which classical tragedy has become a thing of the past
                    in French literature connect themselves with the history of French comedy, which
                    under the co-operation of other influences produced a wide variety of growths.
                    The germs of most of these—though not of all—are to be found in the works of the
                    most versatile, and, in some respects, the most consummate comic dramatist the
                    world has known,—Molière (1622-1693). What Molière found in existence was a
                    comedy of intrigue, derived from Spanish or Italian examples, and the elements
                    of a comedy of character, in French and more especially in Italian farce and
                    ballet-pantomime. Corneille’s <hi rend="italic">Menteur</hi> had poiuted the way
                    to a fuller combination of character with intrigue, and in this direction
                    Molière’s genius exercised the height of its creative powers. After beginning
                    with farces, he produced in the earliest of his plays (from 1652), of which more
                    than fragments remain, comedies of intrigue which are at the same time
                    marvellously lively pictures of manners, and then proceeded with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecole</hi><hi rend="italic">des Maris</hi> (1661) to begin a long
                    series of masterpieces of comedy of character. Yet even these, the chief of
                    which are altogether unrivalled in dramatic literature, do not exhaust the
                    variety of his productions. To define the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n445/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0445-0426"/> range of his art is as difficult as to express in
                    words the essence of his genius. For though he has been copied ever since he
                    wrote, neither his spirit nor his manner has descended in full to any of his
                    copyists, whole schools of whom have missed elements of both. A Molière can only
                    be judged in his relations to the history of comedy at large. He was indeed the
                    inheritor of many forms and styles— remaining a stranger to those of Old Attic
                    comedy only, rooted as it was in the political life of a free imperial city;
                    though even the rich extravagance of Aristophanes’s burlesque was not left
                    wholly unreproduced by him. Molière is both a satirist and a humourist; he
                    displays at times the sentiments of a loyal courtier, at others that gay spirit
                    of opposition which is all but indispensable to a popular French wit. His
                    comedies offer elaborate and subtle—even tender—pictures of human character in
                    its eternal types, lively sketches of social follies and literary extravagances,
                    and broad appeals to the ordinary sources of vulgar merriment. Light and
                    perspicuous in construction,'he is master of the delicate play of irony, the
                    penetrating force of wit, and the expansive gaiety of frolicsome fun. Faithful
                    to the canons of artistic taste, and under the safe guidance of true natural
                    humour, his style suits itself to every species attempted by him. His morality
                    is the reverse of rigid, but its aberrations are not those of prurience, nor its
                    laws those of pretence; and wholly free as he was from the didactic aim which is
                    foreign to all true dramatic representation, the services he rendered to his art
                    are not the less services rendered to society, concerning which the laughter of
                    true comedy tells the truth. He raised the comedy of character out of the lower
                    sphere of caricature, and in his greatest creations subordinated to the highest
                    ends of all dramatic composition the plots he so skilfully built, and the
                    pictures of the manners he so faithfully reproduced.</p>
                <p>Even among the French comic dramatists of this age there must have been many who
                    “were not aware” that Molière was its greatest poet. For though he had made the
                    true path luminous to them, their efforts were still often of a tentative kind,
                    and one was reviving <hi rend="italic">Patelin</hi> while another was
                    translating the <hi rend="italic">Andma.</hi> A more unique attempt was made in
                    one of the very few really modern versions of an Aristophanic comedy, which
                    deserves to be called an original copy— <hi rend="italic">Les Plaideurs</hi> of
                    Racine. The tragic poets Quinault and Campistron likewise wrote comedies,
                    one<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quinault, H Amour

                    which furnished materials to contemporary English dramatists, as did one of the
                    felicitous plays in which Boursault (1638-1701) introduced Mercury and Aesop
                    into the theatrical <hi rend="italic">salon</hi><note anchored="true"

                    of Molière can be said to have fallen upon any of his contemporaries or

                    threatened to become the chosen walk of comedy, though Gresset (1709- 1777)
                    still attempted comedy of character,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    ruled or was to rule supreme in so many dramatic literatures of Europe, more and
                    more firmly established its hold on that of France. In the hands of Diderot
                    (1713-1784) it sought to proclaim itself as an agent of social reform, and as an
                    apostle of the gospel of philanthropy; but the execution of these works fell
                    short of their aims;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Le
                    Fils Naturel ou les Épreuves de la Vertu; Le Père de Famille</p></note> it was,
                    in Mme. de Staël’s words, “the affectation of nature,” not nature itself which
                    they exhibited. Their author announced them as examples of a third dramatic
                    form-—the <hi rend="italic">genre sérieux</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> which he
                    declared to be the consummation of the dramatic art. Making war upon the frigid
                    artificiality of classical tragedy, he banished verse from the new species. The
                    effect of these plays was intended to spring from their truth to nature—a truth
                    such as no spectator could mistake, and which should bring home its moral
                    teachings to the business as well as the bosoms of all. The theatre was to
                    become a real and realistic school of the principles of society and of the
                    conduct of life—it was, in other words, to usurp functions with which it has no
                    concern, and to essay the reformation of mankind. The idea was neither new nor
                    just, but its speciousness will probably continue to commend it to many
                    benevolent minds, whensoever and in whatsoever shape it is revived.</p>
                <p>From this point the history of the French drama becomes that of a conflict
                    between an enfeebled artistic school and a tendency which is hardly to be
                    dignified by the name of a school at all. Beaumarchais (1732-1799), who for his
                    early sentimental plays, in which he imitated Diderot, invented the appellation
                    <hi rend="italic">drame</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> so convenient in its
                    vagueness that it became the accepted name of the hybrid species to which they
                    belonged—in two works of a very different kind, the famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbier de Seville</hi> and the still more famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mariage</hi><hi rend="italic">de Figaro,</hi> boldly carried comedy back into
                    its old Spanish atmosphere of intrigue; but while surpassing all his
                    predecessors in the skill with which he constructed his frivolous plots, he drew
                    his characters with a lightness and sureness of touch peculiar to himself,
                    animated his dialogue with an unparalleled brilliancy of wit, and seasoned
                    action as well as dialogue with a political and social meaning, which caused his
                    epigrams to become proverbs, and which marks his <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>
                    as a herald of the Revolution. Such plays as these were ill suited to the rule
                    of the despot whose vigilance could not overlook their signifiance. The comedy
                    of the empire is, in the hands of Collin d’Harleville, Picard, A. Duval,
                    Étienne, and others, mainly a harmless comedy of manners; nor was the attempted
                    innovation of N. Lemercier (1771-1840)—who was fain to invent a new species,
                    that of historical comedy— more than a flattering self-delusion. The theatre had
                    its share in all the movements and changes which ensued in <pb break="no"

                    revolution the drama itself was to undergo was not one of native origin. Those
                    branches of the drama which belong specifically to the history of the opera, or
                    which associate themselves with it, are here passed by. (See <hi

                    had been removed from it, was cultivated by Ponsard (1690-1765) and Marmontel
                    (1723-1799). The latter,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The chief home of the regular drama, however, demanded efforts of another kind.
                    At the Théâtre Français, or Comédie Française, whose history as that of a single
                    company of actors had begun in 1680, the party-strife of the times made itself
                    audible; and the most prominent tragic poet of the Revolution, Μ. J. de Chenier
                    (1764-1811), a disciple of Voltaire in dramatic poetry as well as in political
                    philosophy, wrote for the national stage the historical drama—with a political
                    moral<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Charles IX. ou
                    l'École des Rois.</p></note> —in which in the memorable year 1789 Talma achieved
                    his first complete triumph. But the victorious Revolution proclaimed among other
                    liberties that of the theatres in Paris, of which soon not less than 50 were
                    open. In 1807 the empire restricted the number to 9, and reinstated the Théâtre
                    Français in sole possession (or nearly such) of the right of performing the
                    classic drama. No writer of note was, however, tempted or inspired by the
                    rewards and other encouragements offered by Napoleon to produce such a classic
                    tragedy as the emperor would have willingly stamped out of the earth. The
                    tragedies of C. Delavigne (1794-1844) represent the transition from the expiring
                    efforts of the classical to the ambitious beginnings of the romantic school of
                    the French drama. Of this it must suffice to say that it derives some of its
                    characteristics from the general movement of romanticism which in various ways
                    and at various points of time transformed nearly every modern European
                    literature, others from the rhetorical tendency which is a French national
                    feature. Victor Hugo was its conquering founder; A. Dumas the elder (1803-1870)
                    its middleman. The marvellous energy and poetic genius of the former, always in
                    extremes, was nowhere more signally so than in the drama; the latter was a
                    Briareus, working with many hands besides his own. The name of A. de Vigny
                    (1799-1863), “George Sand” (1804-1876), A. de Musset (1810-1857), whose dramatic
                    “proverbes” and other pieces of a similar kind have a delicate flavour all their
                    own, and perhaps that of P. Mérimée (1803-1870), who invented not only Spanish
                    dramas but a Spanish dramatist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Théâtre de Clara Gazul.</p></note> may be all with more or
                    less precision classed in the romantic school, which in its turn has come to an
                    end as a productive body of writers. It was not, however, the brief classical
                    revival begun by F. Ponsard, and continued, in closer relation to modern ideas,
                    both by him and by E. Augier, which overthrew the Romanticists. While the
                    theatrical ability of E. Scribe (1791-1858) supplied a long series of
                    productions attesting the rapid advance of the playwright’s mastery over the
                    secrets of his craft, and while the name of his competitors, with the aid of
                    some of whom he held his own against the rest, is legion, the latest
                    developments of the French drama possess a social and often a moral interest of
                    greater depth, while they are not inferior in technical skill to anything that
                    has preceded them. After a fashion which would have startled even Diderot, the
                    younger A. Dumas has undertaken to reform society by means of the stage; O.
                    Feuillet and others have, with perhaps fewer prefaces, applied themselves to the
                    solution of the same “problems;” and whatever style will best succeed with the
                    public is the style of V. Sard ou.</p>
                <p>That the theatre will lose the hold it possesses over the intellectual and moral
                    sympathies of nearly the whole of the educated, and of a great part of the
                    uneducated population of France, seems hardly within the range of probability.
                    But this is not tantamount to a prophecy that the creative activity of French
                    dramatic literature is certain to endure. The art of acting is not dependent
                    upon a contemporary literary productivity; Talma and Mdlle. Mars (1779-1847)
                    flourished in one of the most barren ages of the French literary drama; the
                    authors and actors of the <hi rend="italic">sotties,</hi> like those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palais Royal</hi> farces of our own day, could strike their roots
                    in the lightest of soils. The constantly accumulating experience and the
                    apparently inexhaustible fertility of the art of acting in France may ensure to
                    it a future not less brilliant than its past; and the judicious policy of not
                    leaving the leading theatres at the mercy of shifting fashion will at all events
                    supply the possibility of maintaining a high histrionic standard. So long as the
                    French nation continues to maintain its ascendency over other nations in much
                    that adorns and brightens social life, the predominant influence of the French
                    theatre over the theatres of other nations is likewise assured. But in the end
                    its own future must be ruled by that progress or decay of French dramatic
                    literature. The history of that literature shows periods of marvellously rapid
                    advance, of hardly less swift decline, and of frequent though fitful recovery.
                    Its future may be equally varied; but it will not be less dependent on the
                    conditions which in every people, ancient or modem, are indispensable to
                    national vigour and vitality. Should the calamity—for it would be nothing
                    less—befall modern civilization of a hopeless degeneration of the French drama,
                    the fault will lie in the severance of self-consciousness from self-control;
                    and, under other circumstances, but with even deeper regret, the story of the
                    Roman theatre of the later Empire may have to be told again.</p>
                <p>Among the nations of Germanic descent, but one—our own—succeeded under the
                    influence of the Renaissance movement in transforming the last growths of the
                    mediaeval drama into the beginnings of a great and enduring national dramatic
                    literature. This transformation connects itself with one of the greatest epochs
                    of the national history, or, more properly speaking, forms part of it; the
                    Elizabethan drama and the Elizabethan age are, it is no exaggeration to assert,
                    equally inconceivable the one without the other.</p>
                <p>It has been seen how already in the reign of Edward VI., the breath of a new age
                    with its “new learning” had quickened the relatively inanimate species of the
                    morality into the first <hi rend="italic">chronicle history</hi> (still
                    intermingled witlι remnants of the earlier species); and how at an even earlier
                    date John Heywood’s <hi rend="italic">interludes</hi> had bridged the distance
                    separating from only partially relieved abstractions the concrete directness of
                    comedy proper. Soon afterwards, the study and imitation of the ancient classical
                    drama were introduced into the English world of letters; and under their
                    influence tragedy and comedy, which might otherwise have from the first
                    coalesced, were in their early growths in our literature kept asunder, though
                    not absolutely so. Already, ia Queen Mary’s reign, translation was found the
                    readiest form of expression offering itself to literary scholarship<pb

                    the most modern of the ancient tragedians, as a favourite author for such
                    exercises. With the year of Elizabeth’s accession began a series of translations
                    of his plays by Jasper Heywood (John Heywood’s son) and others; and to the
                    direct influence of one of Seneca’s tragedies<note anchored="true"

                    or indirectly exercised, of classical literature, that of Italian, both dramatic
                    and narrative, asserted itself; early works from this source were the first <hi

                <p>From the double danger which threatened our tragic drama in the days of its

                    happy association with the traditions of the national history. The crude growth
                    of the chronicle history proved strong enough to assert itself by the side of
                    tragedy based on classical and Italian models; and in a series of works of more
                    or less uncertain dates, a vein was worked from which »Shakespeare was to draw
                    the richest ore. Among these rude compositions, which intermixed the blank verse

                    not so much on account of the relative nearness of the subject to the time of
                    its treatment, as because of the tragic responsibility of character here already
                    clearly worked out.</p>
                <p>Such had been the beginnings of tragedy in England up to the time when the genius
                    of dramatists worthy to be called the predecessors of Shakespeare, under the
                    influence of a creative literary epoch, seized the form ready to their hands.
                    The birth of comedy, at all times a process of less labour, had slightly
                    preceded that of tragedy in the history of our drama. Isolated Latin comedies
                    had been produced in the original or in English versions or reproductions as
                    early as the reign of Henry VIII., and the morality and its descendant, the
                    interlude, pointed the way towards nationalizing and popularizing types equally
                    fitted to divert Roman aud Italian and English audiences. Thus the earliest
                    extant English comedy, N. Udall’s <hi rend="italic">Ralph Roister Doister,</hi>
                    which cannot be dated later than 1551, may be described as a genuinely English
                    adaptation of Plautus, while its successor, <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurton</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">s Needle,</hi> printed 1575, and probably written by

                    means unamusing, plot. In the main, however, our early English comedy, while
                    occasionally introducing characters of genuinely native origin, and appealing to
                    the traditional humour3 of Will Summer, the court-fool of Henry VIII.,<note

                    and stories from classical mythology; and the rapid and versatile influence of
                    Italian corned seemed likely to continue to control the progress of the lighter
                    branch of the English drama.</p>
                <p>Out of such promises as these the glories of our drama were ripened by the warmth
                    and light of the great Elizabethan age—of which the beginnings may fairly be
                    reckoned from the third decennium of the reign to which it owes its name. The
                    queen’s steady love of dramatic entertainments could not of itself have led,
                    though it undoubtedly contributed, to such a result. Against the attacks which a
                    nascent puritanism was already directing against the stage by the hands of
                    Northbrooke, the repentant playwright Gosson, Stubbes, and others, were to be
                    set not only the barren favour of royalty, aud the more direct patronage of
                    great nobles, but the fact that literary authorities were already weighing the
                    endeavours of the English drama in the balance of respectful criticism, and that
                    in the abstract at least the claims of both tragedy and comedy were upheld by
                    those who shrunk from the desipience of idle pastimes. As the popularity of the
                    stage increased, the functions of playwright and actor, whether combined or not,
                    began to hold out a reasonable promise of personal gain. Nor, above all, was
                    that higher impulse, which leads men of talent and genius to attempt forms of
                    art in harmony with the tastes and tendencies of their times, wanting to the
                    group of writers who can be remembered by no nobler name than that of
                    Shakespeare’s predecessors.</p>
                <p>The lives of all of these are, of course, in part contemporary with the life of
                    Shakespeare himself; nor was there any substantial difference in the
                    circumstances under which most of them, and he, led their lives as dramatic
                    authors. A distinction was manifestly kept up between poets and playwrights. Of
                    the contempt entertained for the actor’s profession some fell to the share of
                    the dramatist; “even Lodge,” says Dr Ingleby, “who had indeed never trod the
                    stage, but had written several plays, and had no reason to be ashamed of his
                    antecedents, speaks of the vocation of the play-maker as sharing the odium
                    attaching to the actor.” Among the dramatists themselves good fellowship and
                    literary partnership only at times asserted themselves as stronger than the
                    tendency to mutual jealousy and abuse; of all chapters of dramatic history, the
                    annals of the early Elizabethan stage perhaps least resemble those of
                    Arcadia.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the theatre had hardly found its strength as a powerful element in the
                    national life, when it was involved in a bitter controversy, with which it had
                    originally no connection, on behalf of an ally whose sympathy with it can only
                    have been of a very limited <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n448/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0448-0429"/> kind. The Marprelatc controversy in 1589 led to a
                    stoppage of stage plays which proved only temporary; but the general result of
                    the attempt to make the Stage a vehicle of political abuse and invective was
                    beyond a doubt to coarsen and degrade both plays and players. The true remedy
                    was at last applied, when from about the year 1591 the chief London actors
                    became divided into two great rival companies—the Lord Chamberlain’s and the
                    Lord Admiral’s—which alone received licences. Instead of half-a-dozen or more
                    companies whose jealousies communicated themselves to the playwrights belonging
                    to them, there were now, besides the Children of the Chapel, two established
                    bodies of actors, directed by steady and, in t·he full sense of the word,
                    respectable men. To the Lord Chamberlain’s Company, which, after being settled
                    at “the Theater,” moved to the Globe on the Bankside in 1599, Shakespeare and
                    Richard Burbadge, the greatest of the Elizabethan actors, belonged; the Lord
                    Admiral’s was managed by Philip Henslowe, the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diary,</hi> and Edward Alleyn, the founder of Dulwich College, and was
                    ultimately, in 1600, settled at the Fortune. In these and other houses were
                    performed the plays of our Elizabethan dramatists, with few adventitious aids,
                    the performance being crowded into a brief afternoon, when it is obvious that
                    only the idler sections of the population could attend. No woman might appear at
                    a playhouse unless masked; on the stage, down to the Restoration, women’s parts
                    continued to be acted by boys.</p>
                <p>It is futile to take no account of such outward circumstances as these and many
                    which cannot here be noted in surveying the progress of the literature of the
                    Elizabethan drama. No dramatic literature which has any claim to rank beside
                    it—not that of Athens nor those of modern Italy and Spain, nor those of France
                    and Germany in their classic periods—had to contend against such odds; a mighty
                    inherent strength alone ensured to it the vitality which it so triumphantly
                    asserted, and which enabled it to run so unequalled a course.</p>
                <p>Among Shakespeare’s predecessors John Lyly (1554- 1660), whose plays were all
                    written for the Children of the Chapel and the Children of St Paul’s, holds a
                    position apart in our dramatic literature. The euphuism, to which his famous
                    romance gave its name, likewise distinguishes his mythological,<note

                    progress of our drama is to be sought neither in his choice of subjects nor in
                    his imagery—though to his fondness for fairylore and for the whole
                    phantasmagoria of legend, classical as well as romantic, his contemporaries, and
                    Shakespeare in particular, were indebted for a stimulative precedent. It lies in
                    his adoption of Gascoigne’s innovation of writing plays in prose; and in his
                    having, though under the fetters of an affected and vicious style, given the
                    first example of brisk and vivacious dialogue—an example to which even such
                    successors as Shakespeare and Jonson were indebted. Thomas Kyd (d. <hi

                    the greatest tragic dramatist who preceded Shakespeare. No slighter tribute than
                    this is assuredly the due of Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), whose violent end
                    prematurely closed a poetic career of dazzling brilliancy. His earliest play,

                    the use of blank verse was introduced upon the English public stage, while full
                    of the “high astounding terms” of an extravagant and often bombastic diction, is
                    already marked by the passion which was this poet’s most characteristic feature,
                    and which was to find expression so luxuriant in his <hi rend="italic">Doctor
                    Faustus</hi> and so surpassingly violent in his <hi rend="italic">Jew of
                    Malta.</hi> His master-piece, <hi rend="italic">Edward II.,</hi> is a tragedy of
                    singular pathos and of a dramatic power unapproached by any of his
                    contemporaries. George Peele (1552-1596-7) was a far more versatile writer even
                    as a dramatist; but though his plays contain passages of exquisite beauty, not
                    one of them is worthy to be ranked by the side of Marlowe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edward II.,</hi> compared with which, if indeed not absolutely, Peele’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle of Edward I.</hi> still stands on the level of the
                    species to which its title and character alike assign it. His finest play is
                    undoubtedly <hi rend="italic">David and Bethsabβ,</hi> which resembles <hi
                    rend="italic">Edward I.</hi> in construction, but far surpasses it in beauty of
                    language and versification, besides treating its subject with greatly superior
                    dignity. If the difference between Peelo and Shakespeare is still in many
                    respects besides that of genius an immeasurable one, we seem to come into
                    something like a Shakespearian atmosphere in more than one passage of the plays
                    of the unfortunate Robert Greene (1561-1592), unfortunate perhaps in nothing
                    more enduringly than in his notorious enmity to Shakespeare himself. His genius,
                    which shone most brightly in plays treating English life and scenes, was in the
                    main free from the pedantry which occasionally besets the flight of Peele’s and
                    even of Marlowe’s muse; and his most delightful work<note anchored="true"

                    generally known writers of the early Elizabethan drama, though not all of them
                    can strictly speaking be called predecessors of Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>The common characteristics of nearly all these dramatists were in accordance with
                    those of the great age to which they belonged. Stirring times called for
                    stirring themes, such as those of “Mahomet, Scipio, and Tamerlane;” and these
                    again for a corresponding vigour of treatment. Neatness and symmetry of
                    construction were neglected for fulness and variety of matter. Novelty and
                    grandeur of subject seemed well matched by a swelling amplitude and often
                    reckless extravagance of diction. As if from an inner necessity, the balance of
                    rhymed couplets gave way to the impetuous march of blank-verse; “strong lines”
                    were as inevitably called for as strong situations and strong characters.
                    Distinct as the chief of these poets are from one another by the marks impressed
                    upon both form and matter by individual genius, yet the stamp of the age is upon
                    them all. Writing for the stage only, of which some of them possessed a personal
                    experience, they acquired an instinctive insight into the laws of dramatic cause
                    and effect, and infused a warm vitality into the dramatic literature which they
                    produced, so to speak, for immediate consumption. On the other hand, the same
                    cause made rapidity of workmanship indispensable to a successful playwright. <hi
                    rend="italic">How</hi> a play was produced, how many hands had been at work upon
                    it, what loans and what spoliations had been made in the process, were
                    considerations of less moment than the question <hi rend="italic">whether</hi>
                    it was produced, and whether it succeeded. His harness—frequently double or
                    triple—was inseparable from the lusty Pegasus of the early English drama, and
                    its genius toiled, to borrow the phrase of the Attic comedian, “like an Arcadian
                    mercenary.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0449-0430"/> This period of our drama, though it is far from
                    being one of crude effort, could not therefore yet be one of full consummation.
                    In tragedy the advance which had been made in the choice of great themes, in
                    knitting closer the connec tion between the theatre and the national history, in
                    vindicating to passion its right to adequate expression, was already enormous.
                    In comedy the advance had been less decisive and less independent; much had been
                    gained in reaching greater freedom of form and something in enlarging the range
                    of subjects; but artificiality had proved a snare in the one direction, while
                    the licence of the comic stage, upheld by favourite “clowns,” such as Kemp or
                    Tarleton, had not succumbed before more exacting demands. The way of escaping
                    the dilemma had, however, been already recognized to lie in the construction of
                    suitable plots, for which a full storehouse was open in the popular traditions
                    preserved in national ballads, and in the growing literature of translated
                    foreign fiction, or of native imitations of it. Meanwhile, the aberration of the
                    comic stage to political and religious controversy, which it could never hope to
                    treat with real freedom in a country provided with a strong monarchy and a
                    dogmatic religion, seemed likely to extinguish the promise of the beginnings of
                    English romantic comedy.</p>
                <p>These were the circumstances under which the greatest of dramatists began to
                    devote his genius to the theatre. Shakespeare’s career as a writer of plays can
                    have differed little in its beginnings from those of his contemporaries and
                    rivals. Before or while he was proceeding from the re-touching and re-writing of
                    the plays of others to original dramatic composition, the most gifted of those
                    we have termed his predecessors had passed away. He had been decried as an actor
                    before he was known as an author; and after living through days of darkness for
                    the theatre, if not for himself, attained, before the close of the century, to
                    the beginnings of his prosperity and the beginnings of his fame. But if we call
                    him fortunate, it is not because of such rewards as these. As a poet Shakespeare
                    was no doubt happy in his times, which intensified the national character,
                    expanded the national mind, and were able to add their stimulus even to such a
                    creative power as his. He was happy in the antecedents of the form of literature
                    which commended itself to his choice, and in the opportunities which it offered
                    in so many directions for an advance to heights yet undiscovered and unknown.
                    What he actually accomplished was due to his genius, whose achievements are
                    immeasurable like itself. His influence upon the progress of our national drama
                    divides itself in very unequal proportions into a direct and an indirect one. To
                    the former alone reference can here be made.</p>
                <p>Already the first editors of Shakespeare’s works in a collected form recognized
                    so marked a distinction between his plays taken from English history and those
                    treating other historical subjects (whether ancient or modern) that, while they
                    included the latter among the tragedies at large, they grouped the former as <hi
                    rend="italic">histories</hi> by themselves. These <hi rend="italic"
                    >histories</hi> are in their literary genesis a development of the <hi
                    rend="italic">chronicle histories</hi> of Shakespeare’s predecessors and
                    contemporaries, the taste for which had greatly increased towards the beginning
                    of his own career as a dramatist, under influences naturally connecting
                    themselves with the general current of national life and sentiment in this
                    epoch. Though it cannot be assumed that Shakespeare composed his several dramas
                    from English history in the sequence of the chronology of their themes, his
                    genius gave to the entire series an inner harmony which has not unnaturally
                    inspire commentators with the wish to prove it a symmetrically constructed
                    whole. He thus brought this peculiarly national species to a perfection which
                    made it difficult, if not impossible, for his later contemporaries and
                    successors to add to it more than an occasional supplement. None of them was
                    found able or ready to take up the thread where Shakespeare had left it, after
                    perfunctorily attaching the present to the past by a work (probably not all his
                    own) which must be regarded as the end rather than the crown of the series of
                    his <hi rend="italic">historiés.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Henry VIII.</p></note> But to furnish such supplements
                    accorded, little with the tastes and tendencies of the later Elizabethans; and
                    with the exception of an isolated work,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ford, Perkin Warbeck.</p></note> the national historical
                    drama in Shakespeare reached at once its perfection and its close. The ruder
                    form of the old chronicle history for a time survived the advance made upon it;
                    but the efforts in this field of T. Heywood,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Edward IV.; If You Know Not Me, &amp;c.</p></note> S.

                    VIII.</p></note> and others are, from a literary point of view,
                    anachronisms.</p>
                <p>Of Shakespeare’s other plays the several groups exercised a more direct influence
                    upon the general progress of our dramatic literature. His Roman tragedies,
                    though following their authorities with much the same fidelity as that of the
                    English <hi rend="italic">histories,</hi> even more effectively taught the great
                    lesson of free dramatic treatment of historic themes, and thus pre-eminently
                    became the perennial models of the modern historic drama. His tragedies on other
                    themes, which necessarily admitted of a more absolute freedom of treatment,
                    established themselves as the examples for all time of the highest kind of
                    tragedy. Where else is exhibited with the same fulness the struggle between will
                    and obstacle, character and circumstance? Where is mirrored with equal power and
                    variety the working of those passions in the mastery of which over man lies his
                    doom <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> Here, above all, Shakespeare as compared with his
                    predecessors, as well as with his successors, “<hi rend="italic">is</hi> that
                    nature which they paint and draw.” He threw open to modern tragedy a range of
                    hitherto unknown breadth and depth and height, and emancipated the national
                    drama in its noblest forms from limits to which it could never again restrict
                    itself without a consciousness of having renounced its enfranchisement. Happily
                    for the variety of his creative genius on the English stage, no divorce had been
                    proclaimed between the serious and the comic, and no division of species had
                    been established such as he himself ridicules as pedantic when it professes to
                    be exhaustive. The comedies of Shakespeare accordingly refuse to be tabulated in
                    deference to any method of classification deserving to be called precise; and
                    several of them are comedies only according to a purely technical use of the
                    term. In those in which the comic interest asserts itself to the instinct of
                    reader or spectator as supreme, it is still of its nature incidental to the
                    progress of the action; for it seems a just criticism (and one agreeing with
                    what we can conclude as to Shakespeare’s process of construction) that of all
                    his comedies but one<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Merry Wives of H7iidsor</p></note> is in both design and effect a comedy of
                    character proper. Thus in this direction, while the unparalleled wealth of his
                    invention renewed or created a ∙^hole gallery of types, he left much to be done
                    by his successors; while the truest secrets of his comic art, which interweaves
                    fancy with observation, draws wisdom from the lips of fools, and imbues with
                    character what all other hands would have left shadowy, monstrous, or trivial,
                    are among the things inimitable belonging to the individuality of his poetic
                    genius.</p>
                <p>The influences of Shakespeare’s diction and versification upon th03e of the
                    English drama in general can hardly be over-rated, though it would be next to
                    impossible to state them definitely. In these points, Shakespeare’s manner as a
                    writer was progressive; and this progress has been deemed sufficiently well
                    traceable in his plays to be used as an aid in seeking to determine their
                    chronological sequence. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n450/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0450-0431"/> general laws of this progress accord with those
                    of the natural advance of creative genius; artificiality gives way to freedom,
                    and freedom in its turn submits to a greater degree of regularity and care. In
                    versification as in diction the earliest and the latest period of Shakespeare’s
                    dramatic writing are more easily recognizable than what lies between and may be
                    called the normal period, the plays belonging to which in form most resemble one
                    another, and are least affected by distinguishable peculiarities—such as the
                    rhymes and intentionally euphuistic colouring of style which characterize the
                    earliest, or the feminine endings of the lines and the more condensed manner of
                    expression common to the latest plays. But such distinctions apart, there can be
                    on doubt but that in verse and in prose alike, Shakespeare’s style, so far as it
                    admitted of reproduction, is itself to be regarded as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >norm</hi> of that of the Elizabethan drama, that in it the prose form of
                    English comedy possesses its first accepted model, and that in it the chosen
                    metre of the English versified drama established itself as irremovable unless at
                    the risk of an unnatural experiment.</p>
                <p>It may seem paradoxical to assert that it is by their construction that
                    Shakespeare’s plays exerted the most palpable influence upon the English drama,
                    as well as upon the modern drama of the Germanic nations in general, and upon
                    such forms of the Romance drama as have been in more recent times based upon it.
                    For it was not in construction that his greatest strength lay, or that the
                    individuality of his genius could raise him above the conditions under which he
                    worked in common with his immediate predecessors and contemporaries. Yet the
                    fact that he reconciled these conditions with creations of matchless strength
                    and of unequalled fidelity to the demands of nature and art, established them as
                    the conditions of what a popular (and consequently often abused) term has
                    instinctively come to designate as the Shakespearian drama. The great and
                    irresistible demand on the part of Shakespeare’s public was for incident—a
                    demand which of itself necessitated a method of construction different from that
                    of the Greek drama, or of those modelled more or less closely upon it. To no
                    other reason is to be ascribed the circumstance that Shakespeare so constantly
                    combined two actions in the course of a single play, not merely supplementing
                    the one by means of the other as a bye or under-plot. In no respect is the
                    progress of his technical skill as a dramatist more apparent,—an assertion which
                    a comparison of plays clearly ascribable to successive periods of his life would
                    satisfactorily establish.</p>
                <p>Should it, however, be sought to express in one word the greatest debt of the
                    drama to Shakespeare, this word must be the same as that which expresses his
                    supreme gift as a dramatist. It is in <hi rend="italic">characterization—</hi>
                    in the drawing of characters ranging through almost every type of humanity which
                    furnishes a fit subject for the tragic or the comic art —-that he remains
                    absolutely unapproached; and it was in this direction that he pointed the way
                    which the English drama could not henceforth desert without becoming untrue to

                    have been surpassed by others in particular fields of characterization (which,
                    forsooth, regarded him as supremely excellent in male but not in female
                    characters). But it was a sure sign of decay when our writers began to shrink
                    from following him in the endeavour to make the drama a mirror of humanity, and
                    when, in self-condemned arrogance, they thrust unreality back upon a stage which
                    he had animated with the warm breath of life, where Juliet had blossomed like a
                    flower of spring, and where Othello’s noble <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> had
                    suffered and sinned.</p>
                <p>By the numerous body of poets who, contemporary with Shakespeare or in the next
                    generation, cultivated the wide field of the national drama, every form
                    commending itself to the tastes and sympathies of the national genius was
                    essayed. None were neglected except those from which the spirit of English
                    literature had been estranged by the Reformation, and those which had from the
                    first been artificial importations of the Renaissance. The mystery could not
                    here, as in Spain, produce such an aftergrowth as the <hi rend="italic"

                    essentials; experiments like W. Alexander’s (afterwards Earl of Stirling) <hi

                    rend="italic">Agonistes</hi> at a later date (1677). At the opposite end of the
                    dramatic scale, the light gaiety of the Italian and French force could not
                    establish itself on the English popular stage without more solid adjuncts; the
                    Englishman’s festive digestion is robust, and he likes his amusements
                    substantial. In the pastoral drama and the mask, however, many of our dramatists
                    found special opportunities for the exercise of their lyrical gifts and of their
                    inventive powers. The former could never become other than an exotic, so long as
                    it retained the artificial character of its origin. Shakespeare had accordingly
                    only blended elements derived from it into the action of his romantic comedies.
                    In more or less isolated works Jonson, Fletcher, Daniel, Randolph, and others
                    sought to rival Tasso and Guarini,— Jonson<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    an essentially foreign growth by the fresh simplicity of his treatment,
                    Fletcher<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Faithful
                    Shepherdess.</p></note> bearing away the palm for beauty of poetic execution.
                    The mask was a more elastic kind of composition, mixing in varying proportions
                    its constituent elements of declamation and dialogue, music and dancing,
                    decoration and scenery. In its least elaborate literary form—which, of course,
                    externally was the most elaborate— it closely approached the pageant; in other
                    instances the distinctness of its characters or the fullness of the action
                    introduced into its scheme, brought it nearer to the regular drama. A frequent
                    ornament of Queen Elizabeth’s progresses, it was cultivated with increased
                    assiduity in the reign of James I., and in that of his successor outshone, by
                    the favour it enjoyed with court and nobility, the attractions of the regular
                    drama itself. Most of the later Elizabethan dramatists contributed to this
                    species, upon which Shakespeare only incidentally in the course of his dramas
                    expended the resources of his fancy; but by far the most successful writer of
                    masks was Ben Jonson, of whose numerous compositions of this kind many hold a
                    permanent place in our poetic literature, and “next” whom, in his own judgment,
                    “only Fletcher and Chapman could write a mask.” From a poetic point of view,
                    however, they were at least rivalled by Dekker and Ford; in productivity and
                    favour T. Campion (d. 1623) seems for a time to have excelled. Inasmuch,
                    however, as the history of the mask in England is to a great extent that of
                    “painting and carpentry” and of Inigo J ones, it need not here be further
                    pursued. The <hi rend="italic">Microcosmus</hi> of T. Nabbes (printed 1637),
                    which is very like a morality, seems to have been the first mask brought upon
                    the public stage. It was the performance of a mask by Queen Henrietta Maria and
                    her ladies at Whitehall which had some years previously (1632) been thought to
                    have supplied to the invective of <hi rend="italic">Histrio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mastix</hi> against the stage the occasion for disloyal innuendo;
                    and it was for the performance of a mask in a great nobleman’s castle that a

                    of English poems. <hi rend="italic">Comus</hi> has been judged and condemned as
                    a drama,—unjustly, for the dramatic qualities of a mask are not essential to the
                    species. Nor need its history in England have here been referred to, were it not
                    so inseparably connected with that of the Elizabethan drama. In later times the
                    mask merged into the opera, or continued a humble life of its own apart from
                    contact with higher literary effort. It is strange that our later poets should
                    have done so little to restore to its nobler uses, and to invest with a new
                    significance, a form of so proved a flexibility as the poetic mask.</p>
                <p>The annals of our drama proper in the period reaching from the closing years of
                    Elizabeth to the outbreak of the great Revolution include, together with
                    numerous names relatively insignificant, many illustrious in the history of our
                    poetic literature. Among Shakespeare’s contemporaries and successors there is,
                    however, but one who by the energy of his genius, not less than by the
                    circumstances of his literary career, stands in a position of undisputed primacy
                    among his fellows. Ben Jonson (1573-1635), to whom in his latter days a whole
                    generation of younger writers did homage as to their veteran chief, was alone in
                    full truth the founder of a school or family of dramatists. Yet his pre-eminence
                    did not (whatever he or his followers may have thought) extend to both branches
                    of the regular drama. In tragedy he fell short of the highest success; the
                    weight of his learning lay too heavily upon his efforts to draw from deeper
                    sources than those which had sufficed for Shakespeare. Such as they are, his
                    tragic works<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sejanus his
                    Fall; Catiline his Conspiracy.</p></note> stand almost, though not quite, alone
                    in this period as examples of sustained effort in historic tragedy proper. G.
                    Chapman (1557 or 1559-1634) treated stirring themes, more especially from modern
                    French history,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bussy

                    times with genuine effectiveness; but though rich in beauties of detail, he
                    failed in this branch of the drama to follow Shakespeare even at a distance in
                    the supreme art of fully developing a character by means of the action. Mention
                    has already been made of Ford’s isolated effort in the direction of historic
                    tragedy and of those excursions into the still popular domain of the chronicle
                    history by T. Heywood, Dekker, and others, which are to be regarded as nothing
                    more than retrogressions. With the great body of the English dramatists of this
                    and of the next period, tragedy had passed into a phase where its interest
                    depended mainly upon plot and incident. The romantic tragedies and
                    tragi-comedies which fill our literature in this period constitute together a
                    growth of at first sight astonishing exuberance, aud in mere externals of
                    theme—ranging from Byzantium to ancient Britain, and from the Caesars of ancient
                    Rome to the tyrants of the Renaissance—of equally astonishing variety. The
                    sources from which these subjects were derived had been constantly on the
                    increase. Besides Italian, Spanish, and French fiction, original or translated,
                    besides British legend in its Romance dress, and English fiction in its humbler
                    or in its more ambitious and artificial forms, the contemporary foreign drama,
                    especially the Spanish, offered opportunities for resort. To the English, as to
                    the French and Italian drama, of both this and the following century, the
                    prolific dramatists clustered round Lope de Vega and Calderon supplied a whole
                    arsenal of plots, incidents, and situations—among others to Middleton, to
                    Webster, and most signally to Beaumont and Fletcher. And in addition to these
                    materials, a new field of resources was at hand since our dramatists had begun
                    to regard events aud episodes of English domestic life as fit subjects for
                    tragic treatment.</p>
                <p>Domestic tragedy of this description was indeed no novelty on the Engιish stage;
                    Shakespeare himself may have touched, with his master-hand, more than one effort
                    of this kind;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A rden of
                    Favorsham; A Yorkshire Tragedy.</p></note> but T. Heywood (c. 1570-c. 1605) may
                    be regarded as the first who achieved any work of considerable literary value of
                    this class,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A Woman
                    killed with Kiddn&amp;ss.</p></note> to which some of the plays of T. Dekker (c.
                    1570—c. 1640), T. Middleton, and others likewise more or less belong. Yet in
                    contrast to this wide variety of sources, and consequent apparent variety of
                    themes, the number of <hi rend="italic">motives</hi> employed—at least as a
                    rule—in the tragic drama of this period was comparatively small and limited.
                    Hence it is that, notwithstanding the diversity of subjects among the tragic
                    dramas of such writers as Marston, Webster, Fletcher, Ford, and Shirley, an
                    impression of sameness is left upon us by a connected perusal of these w orks.
                    Politic ambition, conjugal jealousy, absolute female devotion, unbridled
                    masculine passion, such are the motives which constantly recur in the Decameron
                    of our later Elizabethan drama. And this impression is heightened by the want of
                    moderation, by the excess of passion, which these dramatists so habitually
                    exhibit in the treatment of their favourite themes. All the tragic poets of this
                    period are not equally amenable to this charge; in J. Webster<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vittoria Coromboni; The
                    Duchess of Malfi.</p></note> (d. c. 1650), master as he is of the effects of the

                    ><p>’ Tie Pity She ’s a Whore; The Broken Heart.</p></note> (1586-c. 1640),
                    surpassingly seductive in his sweetness, the monotony of exaggerated passion is
                    broken by those marvellously sudden and subtle touches through which their
                    tragic genius creates its most thrilling effects. Nor will the tendency to
                    excess of passion which F. Beaumont (1586-1616) and J. Fletcher (1576-1625)
                    undoubtedly exhibit be confounded with their distinctive power of sustaining
                    tenderly pathetic characters and situations in a degree unequalled by any of
                    their contemporaries—a power seconded by a beauty of diction and softness of
                    versification which for a time raised them to the highest pinnacle of
                    popularity, and which entitles them in their conjunction, and Fletcher as an
                    independent worker, to an enduring pre-eminence among their fellows. In their
                    morals Beaumont and Fletcher are not above the level of their age. The manliness
                    of sentiment which ennobles the rhetorical genius of P. Massinger (1584- 1640),
                    and the gift of poetic illustration which entitles J. Shirley (1595-1666) to be
                    remembered as something besides the latest and the most fertile of this group of
                    dramatists, have less direct bearing upon the general character of the tragic
                    art of the period. The common features of the romantic tragedy of this age are
                    sufficiently marked, but not capable of obscuring the distinctive features in
                    its individual writers which it is the highest function of criticism to discover
                    and establish.</p>
                <p>In comedy, on the other hand, the genius and the insight of Jonson pointed the
                    way to a steady and legitimate advance. His theory of “humours” (which found the
                    most palpable expression in two of his earliest plays<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Every Man in his Jl·umowr; Every Man out of
                    his Humour.</p></note>), if trarrslated into the ordinary language of dramatic
                    art, signifies the paramount importance in the comic drama of the creation of
                    distinctive human types. In the actual creation of these it was impossible that
                    Jonson should excel Shakespeare; but in the consciousness with which be
                    recognized and indicated the highest sphere of a comic dramatist’s labours, he
                    rendered to the drama a direct service which Shakespeare had left unperformed.
                    By the rest of his contemporaries and his successors, some of whom (such as
                    Brome) were content avowedly to follow in his footsteps, Jonson was only
                    occasionally rivalled in individual <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0452-0433"/> instances of comic creations; in the entirety of
                    its achievements his genius as a comic dramatist remained unapproached. The
                    favourite types of Jonsonian comedy, to which Dekker, J. Marston (1575-1624),
                    and Chapman had, though to no large extent, added others of their own, were
                    elaborated with incessant zeal and remarkable effect by their contemporaries and
                    successors. It was after a very different fashion from that in which the Roman
                    comedians reiterated the ordinary types of the New Attic comedy, that the
                    inexhaustible <hi rend="italic">verve</hi> of T. Middleton (1574—1624), the
                    buoyant productivity of Fletcher, the observant humour of N. Field (c. 1590-c.
                    1640), and the artistic versatility of Shirley—not to mention many later and
                    lesser names— mirrored in innumerable pictures of contemporary life the undying
                    follies and foibles of mankind. As comedians of manners more than one of these
                    surpassed the old master, not indeed in distinctness and correctness,—the fruits
                    of the most painstaking genius that ever fitted a learned sock to the living
                    realities of life,—but in a lightness which did not impair their sureness of
                    touch; while in the construction of plots the access of abundant new materials,
                    and the greater elasticity in treatment which is the result of accumulated
                    experience, enabled them to maintain a steady progress. Thus our comic dramatic
                    literature from Jonson to Shirley is unsurpassed as a comedy of manners, while
                    as a comedy of character it at least defies comparison with any other national
                    literary growth preceding or contemporaneous with it. Though the younger
                    generation, of which W. Cartwright (1611 or 1615-1643) may be taken as an
                    example, was unequal in originality or force to its predecessors, yet so little
                    exhausted was the vitality of the species, that its traditions survived the <hi
                    rend="italic">interregmιm</hi> of the Revolution, and connected themselves in
                    some measure with later growths of English comedy.</p>
                <p>The rivals against which in its closing period the old English drama had to
                    contend have been already noticed. From the masks and triumphs at court and at
                    the houses of the nobility, with their Olympuses and Parnassuses built by Inigo
                    Jones, and filled with goddesses and nymphs clad in the gorgeous costumes
                    designed by his inventive hand, to the city pageants and shows by land and
                    water,—from the tilts and tournaments at Whitehall to the more philosophical
                    devices at the Inns of Court and the academical plays at the universities,—down
                    even to the brief but thrilling theatrical excitements of Bartholomew Fair and
                    the “Ninevitical motions” of the puppets,—in all these ways the various sections
                    of the theatrical public were tempted aside. Foreign performers—French and
                    Spanish actors, and even French actresses—paid visits to London. But the
                    national drama held its ground. The art of acting maintained itself at least on
                    the level to which it had been brought by Shakespeare’s associates and
                    contemporaries, Burbadge and Heminge, Alleyn, Lewin, Taylor, and others “of the
                    older sort.” The profession of actor came to be more generally than of old
                    separated from that of playwright, though they were still (as in the case of
                    Field) occasionally combined. But this rather led to an increased appreciation
                    of artistic merit in actors who valued the dignity of their own profession and
                    whose co-operation the authors learnt to esteem as of independent significance.
                    The stage was purged from the barbarism of the old school of clowns. Women’s
                    parts were still acted by boys, many of whom attained to considerable celebrity;
                    and a practice was thus continued which placed the English theatre at a
                    considerable disadvantage as compared with the Spanish (where it never
                    obtained), and which probably to some extent reacted upon the licence of
                    expression assumed by our dramatists. The arrangement of the stage, which
                    facilitated a rapid succession of scenes without any necessity for their being
                    organically connected with oue another, remained essentially the same as in
                    Shakespeare’s days, though the primitive expedients for indicating locality had
                    begun to be occasionally exchanged for scenery more or less appropriate to the
                    place of action. Costume was apparently cultivated with much greater care; and
                    there is no reason to suppose that the English stage of this period had not gone
                    as far as was expedient in a direction in which in feebler times so vast an
                    amount of effort has come to be spent. The drama still depended in the main upon
                    its literary essentials and upon the actor’s art; but the system of prologues
                    and epilogues, and of dedications to published plays, was more uniformly
                    employed than it had been by Shakespeare as the conventional method of
                    recommending authors and actors to the favour of individual patrons, and to that
                    of their chief patron, the public.</p>
                <p>Up to the outbreak of the Civil War the drama in all its forms continued to enjoy
                    the favour or good-will of the court, although a close supervision was exercised
                    over all attempts to make the stage the vehicle of political references or
                    allusions. The regular official agent of this supervision was the Master of the
                    Revels; but under James I. a special ordinance, in harmony with the king’s ideas
                    concerning the dignity of the throne, was passed “against representing any
                    modern Christian king in plays on the stage.” The theatre could hardly expect to
                    be allowed a liberty of speech in reference to matters of state denied to the
                    public at large; and occasional attempts to indulge in the freedom of criticism
                    dear to the spirit of comedy met with more or less decisive repression and
                    punishment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Chapman,

                    entirely on the side of the court, that the real difficulties against which the
                    theatre had to contend came from a directly opposite quarter. With the growth of
                    Puritanism the feeling of hostility to the stage increased in a large part of
                    the population, well represented by the civic authorities of the capital. This
                    hostility found many ways of expressing itself. The attempts to suppress the
                    Blackfriars theatre (1619,1631, 1633) proved abortive; but the representation of
                    stage plays continued to be prohibited on Sundays, and during the prevalence of
                    the plague in London in 1637 was temporarily suspended altogether. The desire of
                    the Puritans of the more pronounced type openly aimed at a permanent closing of
                    the theatres. The war between them and the dramatists was accordingly of a
                    life-and-death kind. On the one hand, the drama heaped its bitterest and often
                    coarsest attacks upon whatever savoured of the Puritan spirit; gibes, taunts,
                    caricatures in ridicule and aspersion of Puritans and Puritanism make up a great
                    part of the comic literature of the later Elizabethan drama and of its
                    aftergrowth in the reigns of the first two Stuarts. This feeling of hostility,

                    Puritan life. On the other hand, the moral defects, the looseness of tone, the
                    mockery of ties sanctioned by law and consecrated by religion, the tendency to
                    treat middle-class life as the hunting-ground for the amusements of the upper
                    classes, which degraded so much of the dramatic literature <pb break="no"

                    all and any stage plays. A patient endeavour to reform instead of suppressing
                    the drama was not to be looked for from such adversaries, should they ever
                    possess the means of carrying out their views; and so soon as Puritanism should
                    victoriously assert itself in the state, the stage was doomed. Among the attacks
                    directed against it in its careless heyday of prosperity Prynne’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Histrio</hi><hi rend="italic">Mastix</hi> (1632), while it
                    involved its author in shamefully cruel persecution, did not remain wholly
                    without effect upon the tone of the dramatic literature of the subsequent
                    period; but the quarrel between Puritanism and the theatre was too old and too
                    deep to end in any but one way, so soon as the latter was deprived of its
                    protectors. The Civil War began in August 1642; and early in the following month
                    was published the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, which, after a brief and
                    solemn preamble, commanded “that while these sad causes and set-times of
                    humiliation do continue, public stage plays shall cease and be forborne.” Many
                    actors and playwrights followed the fortunes of the royal cause in the field;
                    some may have gone into a more or less voluntary exile; upon those who lingered
                    on in the familiar haunts the hand of power lay heavy; and though there seems
                    reason to believe that dramatic entertainments of one kind or another continued
                    to be occasionally presented, stringent ordinances gave summary powers to
                    magistrates against any players found engaged in such proceedings (1647), and
                    bade them treat all stage-players as rogues, and pull down all stage galleries,
                    seats, and boxes (1648). A few dramatic works were published in this period;
                    while at fairs about the country were acted farces called “drolls,” consisting
                    of the most vulgar scenes to be found in popular plays. Thus, the life of the
                    drama was not absolutely extinguished; and its darkest day proved briefer than
                    perhaps either its friends or its foes could have supposed.</p>
                <p>Already “in Oliver’s time” private performances took place from time to time at
                    noblemen’s houses and (though not undisturbed) in the old haunt of the drama,
                    the Red Bull. In 1656 the ingenuity of Sir William Davenant (1606-1669), whose
                    name, though not otherwise eminent in our dramatic literature, is memorable as
                    connecting together two distinct periods in it, ventured on a bolder step in the
                    production of a quasi-dramatic entertainment “of declamation and music;” and in
                    the following year he brought out with scenery and music a piece which was
                    afterwards in an enlarged form acted and printed as the first part of his opera,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Siege of Rhodes.</hi> This entertainment he afterwards
                    removed from the private house where it had been produced to the Cockpit, where
                    he soon ventured upon the performance of regular plays written by himself. Thus,
                    under the cover of two sister arts, whose aid was in the sequel to prove by no
                    means altogether beneficial to its progress, the English drama had boldly
                    anticipated the Restoration, and was no longer hiding its head when that much
                    desired event was actually brought about. Soon after Charles II.’s entry into
                    London, two theatrical companies are known to have been acting in the capital.
                    For these companies patents were soon granted, under the names of “the Duke (of
                    York)’s” and “the King’s Servants,” to Davenant and one of the brothers
                    Killigrew respectively,—the former from 1662 acting at Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
                    then at Dorset Garden in Salisbury Court, the latter from 1663 at the Theatre
                    Royal near Drury Lane. These companies were united from 1682, a royal licence
                    being granted in 1695 to a rival company which performed in Lincoln’s Inn
                    Fields, and which migrated to Covent Garden in 1733. Meanwhile Vanbrugh had in
                    1705 built the theatre in the Haymarket; and a theatre in Goodman’s
                    Fields—afterwards rendered famous by the first appearance of Garrick—led a
                    fitful existence from 1729 to 1733. The Act of 1737 deprived the Crown of the
                    power of licensing any more theatres; so that the history of the English stage
                    for a long period was confined to a limited area. The rule which prevailed after
                    the Restoration, that neither of the rival companies should ever attempt a play
                    produced by the other, operated beneficially both upon the activity of dramatic
                    authorship and upon the progress of the art of acting, which was not exposed to
                    the full effects of that deplorable spirit of personal rivalry which leads
                    actors, in order to outshine their fellows, to attempt parts for which they
                    often have no special qualification. There can be little doubt that the actor’s
                    art has rarely flourished more in England than in the days of T. Betterton
                    (1635-1710) and his contemporaries, among whose names those of Hart, Mohun,
                    Kynaston, Nokes, Mrs Barry, Mrs Betterton, Mrs Bracegirdle, and Mrs Eleanor
                    Gwynne have, together with many others, survived in various connections among
                    the memories of the Restoration age. No higher praise has ever been given to an
                    actor than that which Addison bestowed upon Betterton, in describing his
                    performance of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> as a proof that Shakespeare could
                    not have written the most striking passages of the character otherwise than he
                    has done.</p>
                <p>It may here be noticed, that the fortunes of the Irish theatre in general
                    followed those of the English, of which of course it was merely a branch. Of
                    native dramatic compositions in earlier times not a trace remains in Ireland;
                    and the drama was introduced into that country as an English exotic—apparently
                    already in the reign of Henry VIII., and more largely in that of Elizabeth. The
                    first theatre in Dublin was built in 1635; but in 1641 it was closed, and even
                    after the Restoration the Irish stage continued in a precarious condition till
                    near the end of the century.</p>
                <p>Already in the period preceding the outbreak of the civil war the English drama
                    had perceptibly sunk from the height to which it had been raised by the great
                    Elizabethans. When it had once more recovered possession of that arena with
                    which no living drama can dispense, it would have been futile to demand that the
                    dramatists should return altogether into the ancient paths, unaffected by the
                    influences, native or foreign, in operation around them. But there was no reason
                    why the new drama should not, like the Elizabethan, be true in spirit to the
                    higher purposes of the dramatic art, to the nobler tendencies of the national
                    life, and to the eternal demands of moral law. Because the later Stuart drama
                    was as a whole untrue to· these, and, while following its own courses, never
                    more than partially returned from the aberrations to which it condemned itself,
                    its history is that of a decay which the indisputable brilliancy, borrowed or
                    original, of many of its productions is incapable of concealing.</p>
                <p>Owing in part to the influence of the French theatre, which by this time had
                    taken the place of the Spanish as the ruling drama of Europe, the separation
                    between tragedy and comedy is clearly marked in our post-Restoration plays.
                    Comic scenes are still occasionally introduced into tragedies by some of our
                    dramatists who adhered more closely to the Elizabethan models (such as Otway and
                    Crowne), but the practice fell into disuse; while the endeavour to elevate
                    comedy by pathetic scenes and motives is one of the characteristic marks of the
                    beginning of another period in our dramatic literature. The successive phases
                    through which English tragedy passed in the later Stuart times cannot be always
                    kept distinct from one another; and the guidance offered by the theories put
                    forth by some of the dramatists in support of their practice is often delusive.
                    Following the example of Corneille, Dryden and his contemporaries <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n454/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0454-0435"/> and successors were fond of proclaiming their
                    adherence to this or that principle of dramatic construction or form, and of
                    upholding, with much show of dialectical acumen, maxims derived by them from
                    French or other sources, or elaborated with modifications and variations of
                    their own, but usually amounting to little more than what Scott calls “certain
                    romantic whimsical imitations of the dramatic art.” The student of the drama
                    will find much both to entertain and to instruct him in these prefaces,
                    apologies, dialogues, and treatises; he will acknowledge that Dryden’s
                    incomparable vigour does not desert him either in the exposing or in the
                    upholding of fallacies; and that even Rymer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A Short View of Tragedy (1693).</p></note> usually regarded
                    as having touched the nadir of dramatic criticism, is not wholly without grains
                    of salt. But Restoration tragedy itself must not be studied by the light of
                    Restoration criticism. So long as any dramatic power remained in our tragic
                    poets —and it is absent from none of the chief among them from Dryden to
                    Rowe—the struggle between fashion (disguised as theory) and instinct (tending in
                    the direction of the Elizabethan traditions) could never wholly determine itself
                    in favour of the former.</p>
                <p>Lord Orrery (1621-1679), in deference, as he declares, to the expressed tastes of
                    his sovereign King Charles II. himself, was the first to set up the standard of
                    <hi rend="italic">heroic plays.</hi> This new species of tragedy (for such it
                    professed to be) commended itself by its novel choice of themes, to a large
                    extent supplied by recent French romance—the <hi rend="italic">romans de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">longue haleine</hi> of the Scudérys and their contemporaries— and
                    by French plays treating similar themes. It likewise borrowed from France that
                    garb of rhyme which the English drama had so long abandoned, and which now
                    reappeared in the heroic couplet. But the themes which to readers of novels
                    might seem of their nature inexhaustible could not long suffice to satisfy the
                    more capricious appetite of theatrical audiences; and the form, in the
                    application it was sought to enforce for it, was doomed to remain an exotic. In
                    conjunction with his brother-in-law Sir R. Howard (1626-1698),<note

                    brilliancy of his genius into the; cale, which soon rose to the full height of

                    change proved stronger than the love of consistency—which in Dryden was never
                    more than theoretical. After summoning tragedy to rival the freedom (without
                    disdaining the machinery) of opera, he came to recognize in characterization the
                    truest secret of the master-spirit of the Elizabethan drama,<note

                    itself as well as of the rhymed heroic drama; and though he put an end to the
                    species to which he had given temporary vitality, he failed effectively to point
                    the way to a more legitimate development of English tragedy. Among the other
                    tragic poets of this period, N. Lee (1650-1690), in the outward form of his
                    dramas, accommodated his practice to that of Dryden, with whom he occasionally
                    co-operated as a dramatist, and like whom he allowed political partisanship to
                    intrude upon the stage. His rhetorical genius was not devoid of genuine energy,
                    nor is he to be regarded as a mere imitator. T. Otway (1651-1695), the most
                    gifted tragic poet of the younger generation contemporary with Dryden, inherited
                    something of the spirit of the Elizabethan drama; he possessed a real gift of
                    tragic pathos and of expressive tenderness; but his genius had an alloy of
                    impurity, and though he was often happy in his novel choice of themes, his
                    efforts were as incomplete as his end was pre· mature. T. Southerne (1660-1746)
                    was likewise possessed of pathetic power; but his success was primarily due to
                    his skill in the choice of “sensational” plots;<note anchored="true"

                    singled out from the list of the tragic dramatists of this period, many of whom
                    were, like their comic contemporaries, mere translators or adapters from the
                    French. The tragedies of Rowe, whose direct services to the study of Shakespeare
                    are not to be forgotten, indicate with singular distinctness the transition from
                    the fuller declamatory style of Dryden to the calmer and thinner manner of
                    Addison. In tragedy (as to a more marked degree in comedy) the excesses (both of
                    style and subject) of the past period of the English drama had produced an
                    inevitable reaction; decorum was asserting its claims on the stage as in
                    society; and French tragedy had set the example of sacrificing what passion—and
                    what vigour—it retained in favour of qualities more acceptable to the “reformed”
                    court of Louis XIV. Addison (1672-1719), in allowing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cato</hi> to take its chance upon the stage, when a moment of political
                    excitement (April 1713) ensured it an éxtraordinary success, to which no feature
                    in it corresponds, except an unusual number of lines predestined to become
                    familiar quotations, sealed the doom of English national tragedy. The “first
                    reasonable English tragedy,” as Voltaire called it, had been produced, and the
                    oscillations of the tragic drama of the Restoration were at an end.</p>
                <p>English comedy in this period displayed no similar desire to cut itself off from
                    the native soil, though it freely borrowed the materials for its plots and many
                    of its figures from Spanish, and afterwards more generally from French,
                    originals. The spirit of the old romantic comedy-had long since fled; the
                    graceful artificialities of the pastoral drama, even the light texture of the
                    mask, ill suited the demands of an age which made no secret to itself of the
                    grossness of its sensuality. With a few unimportant exceptions, such poetic
                    elements as admitted of being combined with the poetic drama were absorbed by
                    the opera and the ballet. No new species of the comic drama formed itself,
                    though towards the close of the period may be noticed the beginnings of modern
                    English farce. Political and religious partisanship, generally in accordance
                    with the dominant reaction against Puritanism, were allowed to find expression
                    in the directest and coarsest forms upon the stage, and to hasten the necessity
                    for a more systematic control than even the times before the Revolution had
                    found requisite. At the same time the unblushing indecency which the Restoration
                    had spread through court and capital had established its dominion over the comic
                    stage, corrupting the manners, and with them the morals, of its dramatists, and
                    forbidding them, at the risk of seeming <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0455-0436"/> dull, to be anything but improper. Much of this
                    found its way even into the epilogues, which, together with the prologues,
                    proved so important an adjunct of the Restoration drama. These influences
                    determine the general character of what is with a more than chronological
                    meaning termed the comedy of the Restoration. In construction, the national love
                    of fulness and solidity of dramatic treatment induced its authors to alter what
                    they borrowed from foreign sources, adding to complicated Spanish plots
                    characters of native English directness, and supplementing single French plots
                    by the addition of others. At the same time the higher efforts of French comedy
                    of character, as well as the refinement of expression in the list of their
                    models, notably in Molière, were alike seasoned to suit the coarser appetites
                    and grosser palates of English patrons. The English comic writers often
                    succeeded in strengthening the borrowed texture of their plays, but they never
                    added comic humour without at the same time adding coarseness of their own. Such
                    were the productions of Sir George Etherege (c. 1636-c. 1694), Sir Charles
                    Sedley (c. 1639- c. 1728), and the ether “gentlemen who wrote at ease;” nor was
                    there any signal difference between their productions and those of a
                    playwright-actor, such as J. Lacy (d. 1681), and a professional dramatist of
                    undoubted ability, such as J. Crowne. Such, though often displaying the
                    brilliancy of a genius which even where it sank could never wholly abandon its
                    prerogative, were, it must be confessed, the comedies of Dryden himself. On the
                    other hand, the lowest literary deeps of the Restoration drama were sounded by
                    T. D’Urfey (1630-1723), while of its moral degradation the “divine Astraea,” the
                    “unspeakable” Mrs Aplιra Behn (1642-1689) has an indefeasible title to be
                    considered the most faithful representative. T. Shadwell (1640—1692), fated like
                    the tragic poet Elkanah Settle (1648-1724), to be chiefly remembered as a victim
                    of Dryden’s satire, deserves more honourable mention. Like J. Wilson (d. 1690),
                    whose plays seem to class him with the pre-Restoratidn dramatists, Shadwell had
                    caught something not only of the art, but also of the spirit, of Ben Jonson; but
                    in most of his works he was, like the rest of his earlier contemporaries, and
                    like the brilliant group which succeeded them, content to take his moral tone
                    from the reckless society for which, or in deference to the tastes of which, he
                    wrote. The absence of a moral sense, which, together with a grossness of
                    expression often defying exaggeration, characterizes our comic dramatists from
                    the days of Dryden to those of Congreve, is the main cause of their failure to
                    satisfy the demands which are legitimately to be made upon their art. They
                    essayed to draw character as well as to paint manners, but they rarely proved
                    equal to the former and higher task; and while choosing the means which most
                    readily commended their plays to the favour of their immediate public, they
                    achieved but little as interpreters of those essential distinctions which their
                    art is capable of illustrating. Within these limits, though occasionally passing
                    beyond them, and always with the same deference to the immoral tone which seemed
                    to have become an indispensable adjunct of the comic style, eveu the greatest
                    comic authors of this age moved. W. Wycherley (1640-1715) was a comic dramatist
                    of real power, who drew his characters with vigour and distinctness, and
                    constructed his plots and chose his language with natural ease. He lacks gaiety
                    of spirit, and his wit is of a cynical turn. But while he ruthlessly uncloaks
                    the vices of his age, his own moral tone is affected by their influence in as
                    marked a degree as that of the most light-hearted of his contemporaries. The
                    most brilliant of these was indisputably W. Congreve (1672-1728), who is not
                    only one of the very wittiest of English writers, but equally excels in the
                    graceful ease of his dialogue, and draws his characters and constructs his plots
                    with the same masterly skill. His chief fault as a dramatist is one of
                    excess—the brilliancy of the dialogue, whoever be the speaker, overpowers the
                    distinction between the “humours” of his personages. Though he is less brutal in
                    expression than “manly” Wycherley, and less coarse than the lively Sir J.
                    Vanbrugh (c. 1666- 1726), licentiousness in him as in them corrupts the spirit
                    of his comic art; but of his best though not most successful play<note

                    it must be allowed that the issue of the main plot is on the side of virtue. G.
                    Farquhar (1678— 1707), whose morality is on a par with that of the other members
                    of this group, is inferior to them in brilliancy; but as pictures of manners in
                    a wider sphere of life than that which contemporary comedy usually chose to
                    illustrate, two of his plays deserve to be noticed, in which we already seem to
                    be entering the atmosphere of the 18th century novel.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The improvement which now begins to manifest itself in the moral tone and spirit

                    the theatre in England has had to undergo the best-founded, and that which
                    produced the most perceptible results. The comic poets, who had always been more
                    or less conscious of their sius, and had at all events not defended them by the
                    ingenious sophistries which it lias pleased later literary criticism to suggest
                    on their behalf, now began with uneasy merriment to allude in their prologues to
                    the reformation which had come over the spirit of the town. Writers like Mrs
                    Centlivre (c. 1678-1722) became anxious to reclaim their offenders with much
                    emphasis in the fifth act; and Colley Cibber (1671-1757)—whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apology for his Life</hi> furnishes a useful view of this and the subsequent
                    period of the history of the stage, with which he was connected as author,
                    manager, and actor (excelling in this capacity as representative of those fools
                    with which he peopled the comic stage<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    kept in view throughout his career as a dramatist. Sir R. Steele (1671-1729), in
                    accordance with his general tendencies as a writer, pursued a still more
                    definite moral purpose in his comedies; but his geuius perhaps lacked the
                    sustained vigour necessary for a dramatist, and his humour naturally sought the
                    aid of pathos. Accordingly, taking a hint from Colley Cibber, who so well
                    understood the public taste, Steele, passing from partial<note anchored="true"

                    depressing an influence upon the progress of our drama. Thus the two writers
                    whose associated efforts so largely contributed to open a new and productive
                    vein in our literature, both signally helped to hasten the decline of its
                    dramatic branch. With <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> English tragedy committed
                    suicide, though its pale ghost survived; with <hi rend="italic">The Conscious

                <p>It seems superfluous within the limits of a summary like the present to attempt
                    to classify with any degree of minuteness the remaining phenomena in the history

                    as a rule legitimately designed to meet the demands of the stage, from which its

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0456-0437"/> to so large an extent became dissociated. But the
                    de mauds of the stage and those of its patrons and of the public of the
                    “Augustan” age, and of that which succeeded it, in general were fast bound by
                    the trammels of a taste with which a revival of the poetic drama remained
                    irreconcilable during a long period of our literature. There is every reason to
                    conclude that the art of acting progressed in the same direction of
                    artificiality, and stiffened into apparently immutable forms in such actors as
                    Macklin and Quin. The genius of Garrick, whose theatrical career extended from
                    1741 to 1776, opened a new era in his art. His unparalleled success was due in
                    the first instance to his incomparable natural gifts; but these were
                    indisputably enhanced by a careful and continued literary training, and ennobled
                    by a purpose which prompted him to essay the noblest, as he was capable of
                    performing the most various, range of English theatrical characters. By devoting
                    himself as actor and manager with special zeal to the production of Shakespeare,
                    Garrick permanently popularized on the national stage the greatest creations of
                    our drama, and indirectly helped to seal the doom of the surviving tendency to
                    maintain in the most ambitious walks of our dramatic literature the nerveless
                    traditions of the pseudo-classical school. A generation of celebrated actors and
                    actresses, many of whom live for us in the drastic epigrams of Churchill’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Bosciad</hi> (1761), were his helpmates or his rivals; but their
                    fame has paled, while his is destined to endure as that of one of the typical
                    masters of his art.</p>
                <p>The contrast between the tragedy of the 18th century and those plays of
                    Shakespeare and one or two other Elizabethans which already before Garrick were
                    known to the English stage, was indeed weakened by the mutilated form in which
                    these generally, if not always, made their appearance there. Even so, however,
                    there are perhaps few instances in theatrical history in which so strange a
                    competition was so long sustained. In the hands of the tragic poets of the age
                    of Pope, as well as of that of Johnson, tragedy had hopelessly stiffened into
                    the forms of its accepted French models. Direct reproductions of these
                    continued, as in the case of Ambrose Philips’s (c. 1671— 1749) and Charles
                    Johnson’s (1679-1748) translations from Racine, and Aaron Hill’s (1685-1750)
                    from Voltaire. Among other tragic dramatists of the earlier part of the century
                    may be mentioned J. Hughes (1677-1720), who, after assisting Addison in his <hi

                    besides translations of Greek dramas, produced a few more or less original
                    plays, one of which he was daring enough to father upon Shakespeare.<note

                    tragedies are, however, barely remembered by the side of his poems. The literary
                    genius of E. Young (1681-1765), on the other hand, possessed vigour and variety
                    enough to distinguish his tragedies from the ordinary level of Augustan plays;
                    in one of them he seems to challenge comparison in the treatment of his theme
                    with a very different rival;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Revenge (Othello).</p></note> but by his main
                    characteristics as a dramatist he belongs to the school of his contemporaries.
                    The endeavours of G. Lillo (1693- 1739) to bring the lessons of tragedy home to
                    his fellowcitizens were destined to exercise a powerful influence upon the early
                    progress of the German drama, and not to remain without significance for the
                    history of our own; but his pedestrian muse failed in the end to satisfy higher
                    artistic demands than those met in his most popular play,<note anchored="true"

                    tragedy in the generation of Johnson pursued the even tenor of its way, the
                    dictator himself treading with solemn footfall in the accustomed path<note

                    kinsman, David Hume, had advised him “to read Shakespeare, but to get Racine and
                    Voltaire by heart.” The indisputable merits of the play cannot blind us to the
                    fact that <hi rend="italic">Douglas</hi> is the child of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Merope.</hi></p>
                <p>While thus no high creative talent arose to revive the poetic genius of English
                    tragedy, comedy, which had to contend against the same rivals, naturally met the
                    demands of the conflict with greater buoyancy. The history of the most
                    formidable of those rivals forms no part of this sketch (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Opera);</hi> but the points of contact between its progress and
                    the history of our dramatic literature cannot be altogether left out of sight.
                    H. Purcell’s (1658-1695) endeavours to unite English music to the words of
                    English poets were now a thing of the past; the isolated efforts of Addison<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>R,osamunda.</p></note> and
                    others to recover the operatic stage for the native tongue had proved powerless.
                    Italian texts, which had first made their entrance piecemeal, in the end
                    asserted themselves in their entirety; and the German genius of Handel completed
                    the triumphs of a form of art which no longer had any connection with the
                    English drama, and which reached the height of its fashionable popularity about
                    the time when Garrick began to adorn the national stage. In one form, however,
                    the English opera was preserved as a pleasing species of the popular drama. The
                    pastoral drama had (in 1725) produced an isolated aftergrowth in Allan Ramsay’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Gentle Shepherd,</hi> which, with genuine freshness and
                    humour, but without a trace of burlesque, transferred to the scenery of the
                    Pentland Hills the lovely tale of Florizel and Perdita. The dramatic form of
                    this poem is only an accident, but it doubtless suggested an experiment of -a
                    different kind to the most playful of London wits. Gay’s “Newgate Pastoral” of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Beggar’s Opera</hi> (1728), in which the amusing text of a
                    burlesque farce was interspersed with songs set to popular airs, caught the
                    fancy of the town by this novel combination, and became the ancestor of a series
                    of agreeable productions, none of which, however, have ever rivalled it in
                    celebrity. Among these the pieces of J. Bickerstaff<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Love in a Village, &amp;c.</p></note> (ç.

                    type="authorial"><p>The Waterman, &amp;c.</p></note> ° (1745-1814) may be
                    signalized. The opera in England as elsew here thus absorbed what vitality
                    remained to the pastoral drama, while to the ballet and the pantomime (whose
                    glories in England began at Covent Garden in 1733, and to whose popularity even
                    Garrick was obliged to defer) was left (in the 18th century at all events) the
                    inheritance of the external attractions of the mask and the pageant.</p>
                <p>In the face of such various rivalries it is not strange that comedy, instead of
                    adhering to the narrow path which Steele and others had marked out for her,
                    should have permitted herself some vagaries of her own. Gay’s example pointed
                    the way to a fatally facile form of the comic art; and burlesque began to
                    contribute its influence to the decline of comedy. In an age when
                    party-government was severely straining the capabilities of its system, dramatic
                    satire had not far to look for a source of effective seasonings. The audacity of
                    H. Fielding (1707-1754), whose regular comedies (original or adapted) have
                    secured no enduring remembrance, but whose love of parody was <pb break="no"

                    first of the novels which have made his name immortal, accordingly ventured in

                    them in these days) upon a larger admixture of political with literary and other
                    satire. A third attempt<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The Golden Rump.</p></note> (which never reached the stage) furnished the
                    offended minister, Sir Robert Walpole, with the desired occasion for placing a
                    curb upon the licence of the theatre, such as had already been advocated by a
                    representative of its old civic adversaries. The famous Act of 1737 asserted no
                    new principle, but converted into legal power the customary authority hither
                    exercised by the Lord Chamberlain (to whom it had descended from the Master of
                    the Revels). The regular censorship which this Act established has not
                    appreciably affected the literary progress of the English drama, and the
                    objections which have been raised against it seem on candid consideration
                    untenable. The liberty of the stage is a question differing in its conditions
                    from that of the liberty of speech in general, or even from that of the liberty
                    of the press; and occasional lapses of official judgment weigh lightly in the
                    balance against the obvious advantages of a system which in a free country needs
                    only the vigilance of public opinion to prevent its abuse. The policy of the
                    restraint which the Act of 1737 put upon the number of playhouses is a
                    different, but has long become an obsolete, question.</p>
                <p>Brought back into its accustomed grooves, English comedy seemed inclined to leave
                    to farce the domain of healthy ridicule, and to coalesce with domestic tragedy
                    in the attempt to make the stage a vehicle of home-spun didactic morality. Farce
                    had now become a genuine English species, and has as such retained its vitality
                    through all the subsequent fortunes of the stage; it was actively cultivated by
                    Garrick as both actor and author, but the very best farce of this age is
                    ascribed to clerical authorship.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    into comic acting the abuse of personal mimicry, for the exhibition of which he
                    ingeniously invented a series of entertainments, the parents of a long progeny
                    of imitations. Meanwhile the domestic drama of the sentimental kind had achieved

                    that this species was extinguished, as it is sometimes assumed to have been, by
                    O. Goldsmith (1728-1774); but his admirable character-comedy of <hi

                    The most successful efforts of the elder G. Colman (1733-1794)<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Jealous Wife; The

                    comedy, besides a finish which, however playwrights may shut their eyes to the
                    fact, is one of the qualities which ensure a long life to a play. And in the
                    masterpieces of R. B. Sheridan (c. 1752-1816) some of the happiest features of
                    the comedy of Congreve were revived, together with its too uniform brilliancy of
                    dialogue, but without its indecency of tone. The varnish of the age is indeed
                    upon the style, and the hollowness of its morality in much of the sentiment
                    (even where that sentiment is meant for the audience) of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rivals</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The School for Scandal;</hi> but in tact of
                    construction, in distinctness of characters, and in pungency of social satire,
                    they are to be ranked among the glories of English comedy. Something in
                    Sheridan’s style, but quite without his brilliancy, is the most successful

                    consulted.</p>
                <p>The decline of dramatic composition of the higher class, perceptible in the
                    history of the English theatre about the beginning of the 19th century, is
                    attributed by Scott to the wearing out of the French model that had been so long
                    wrought upon; while, as he points out, the new impulse which was sought in the
                    dramatic literature of Germany was derived from some of its worst, instead of
                    from its noblest, productions—from Kotzebue rather than from Lessing, Schiller,
                    and Goethe. But the change which was coming over English literature was in truth
                    of a wider and deeper nature than it was possible for even one of its chief
                    representatives to perceive. As that literature freed itself from the fetters so
                    long worn by it as indispensable ornaments, and threw aside the veil which had
                    so long obscured both the full glory of its past and the lofty capabilities of
                    its future, it could not resort except tentatively to a form which like the
                    dramatic is bound by a hundred bonds to the life of the age itself. Soon, the
                    poems with which Scott and Byron, and the uurivalled^prose fictions with which
                    Scott both satisfied and stimulated the imaginative demands of the public,
                    diverted the attention of the cultivated classes from dramatic literature, which
                    was unable to escape, with the light foot of verse or prose fiction, into “the
                    new, the romantic land.” New themes, new ideas, new forms occupied a new
                    generation of writers and readers; nor did the drama readily lend itself as a
                    vessel into which to pour so many fermenting elements. In Byron (1788-1824) the
                    impressions produced upon a mind not less open to impulses from without than
                    subjective in its way of recasting them, called forth a series of dramatic
                    attempts betraying a more or less wilful ignorance of the demands of dramatic
                    compositions; his beautiful <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> partly suggested by
                    Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> and his powerful <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cain,</hi> have but the form of plays; his tragedies on Italian historical
                    subjects show some resemblance in their political rhetoric to the contemporary
                    works of Alfieri; his <hi rend="italic">JFcrner</hi> is a hastily-dramatized
                    sensation novel. To Coleridge (1772-1834), who gave to English literature a fine

                    characterization such as have been given to few dramatists, cast in a formally
                    dramatic mould studies of character of which the value is far from being
                    confined to their wealth in beauties of detail. Of these the magnificent, but in
                    construction altogether undramatic, <hi rend="italic">Count Julian</hi> is the

                    treatment. A humbler niche in the temple of our dramatic literature belongs to

                    (1791-1868). Divorced, except for moments, from the stage, English dramatic
                    literature in its higher forms can in the present century no longer be regarded
                    as a connected national growth, though it would be rash to deny that with the
                    isolated efforts of individual poets future developments may connect themselves.
                    Among living poets Sir H. Taylor has perhaps approached nearest to the objective
                    spirit and the fullness of style of the Elizabethan drama; R. H. Horne survives
                    as a worthy representative of the modern Romantic school; Matthew Arnold has the
                    dignity of form of his classic models, Longfellow the graceful facility of a
                    mellow literary culture; while R. Browning’s insight into the secrets of human
                    character, and A. C. Swinburne’s gift of passionate poetic speech, are true
                    dramatic qualities. By his <hi rend="italic">Hannibal</hi> J. Nichol has
                    likewise made a noteworthy contribution to the higher literature of our drama.
                    The latest English dramatic poet is Tennyson, whose homage to the national form
                    of the historic drama may be hopefully interpreted as a promise of the future
                    possibly awaiting it. Far greater is the number of those English writers of the
                    present century who, while seeking to preserve a connection between the demands
                    of the stage and their dramatic productions, have addressed themselves to the
                    theatrical rather than the literary public—since such a distinction must needs
                    be drawn. The respect paid by her contemporaries to the modestly simple and
                    judiciously concentrated efforts of Mrs Joanna Baillie (1762-1851) entitles her
                    to remembrance in the annals of literature as well as those of the stage; but it
                    woιdd be going too far to make a similar exception in favour of the plays of
                    Sheridan Knowles (1784-1862) or of the late Lord Lytton (1806-1873). At the
                    present day the theatre commands the services of many authors of talent, a few
                    of whose most successful productions may peradventure be destined to survive the
                    age which gave birth to them. But here, if anywhere, the task of selection must
                    be left to time.</p>
                <p>The history of the English stage in the present century has been one of gradual
                    decline and decay, not (especially at the present day) without prospects of
                    recovery, of which a praiseworthy hopefulness is ever willing to make the most.
                    At the beginning of the century the greatest tragic actress of the English
                    theatre, Mrs Siddυns, had passed her prime; and before its second decade had
                    closed, not only she (1812), but her brother John Kemble (1817), the
                    representative of a grand style of acting upon which the present generation
                    would hardly dare to look, had withdrawn from the boards. Mrs Siddons was soon
                    followed into retirement by her successor Miss O’Ncill (1819); while Kemble’s
                    brilliant later rival, Edmund Kean, an actor the intuitions of whose genius seem
                    to have supplied, so far as intuition ever can supply, the absence of a steady
                    self-culture, remained on the stage till his death in 1833. Young, Macready, and
                    others handed down some of the traditions of the older school of acting to the
                    very few who remain to suggest its semblance to the living generation. But even
                    these—among whom a tribute of gratitude is specially due to Helen Faucit and S.
                    Phelps—are now lost (or all but lost) as active members to the theatre, and they
                    have left no school behind them. The comic stage has been fortunate in an ampler
                    aftergrowth, from generation to generation, of the successors of the old actors
                    who live for us in the reminiscences of Charles Lamb; nor are the links all
                    snapped which bind the humours of the present to those of the past. It is least
                    of all in any spirit of depreciation that the efforts of the actors of our day,
                    in any branch of the art, should be discussed. But it is right to point out that
                    these efforts are carried on under conditions of a partly novel character, to
                    which the actors are forced to submit. No art stands in greater need of the help
                    of training,—an advantage with which the modern English actor is virtually
                    obliged to dispense. No art stands in greater need of the relief of change in
                    the subjects of its exercise,—but the modern English actor is made to look
                    forward, as to the height of success, to playing the same character for three
                    hundred nights. No art stands in greater need of the guidance of criticism,—but
                    the modern English actor is too often left to criticise himself. Finally, none
                    stands in greater need of the protection of self-respect,—but there are few
                    theatres in England which are not from time to time degraded in deference to
                    tastes which in earlier days not Puritan censors only would have called by a
                    simpler name.</p>
                <p>The reaction against the theatre, which set in with the spread of the religious
                    movement at the close of the last century, had the natural effect of lowering
                    instead of raising its tone and manners, as well as those of the literature
                    designed to supply its immediate demands. With the growth of that enlightenment
                    which is inseparable from tolerance, this reaction seems to be giving place to a
                    counter-reaction; while on the other hand, a larger section of the educated
                    classes have begun to take an interest in the progress of the national drama,
                    and the world of fashion is condescending to follow the impulse. Dramatic
                    criticism, too—a branch of English literature to which from the days of Steele
                    to those of Hazlitt so many writers of mark were ready to devote their efforts,
                    but which had more recently often fallen into hands either unequal to the task
                    or disdainful of it—seems here and there awakening to a sense of its higher
                    duties. But all this will not permanently recover the stage for its higher
                    tasks, or reunite to it a Jiving dramatic literature, unless an object of
                    serious moment for the future of the nation is pursued in a serious spirit, and
                    unless it is thought worth while to devise means suited to this end. In a word,
                    so long as there is no national theatre which, removed above the conditions of a
                    commercial speculation, can cultivate the art to which it is dedicated for the
                    sake of that art itself, the future of the English drama will be at the mercy of
                    the likings of London, and of the adoption of those likings by the London which
                    is not London, and by the “provinces,” as in theatrical matters they are only
                    too appropriately called. The time may come when it will be recognized that the
                    progress and culture of a people depend upon its diversions as well as upon its
                    occupations; and that the interests of a national art are not unworthy the
                    solicitude of thoughtful statesmen.</p>

                <p>The history of the <hi rend="smallcaps">German</hi> drama differs widely from
                    that of our own, though a close contact is observable between them at an early
                    point, and again at relatively recent points, in their annals. The dramatic
                    literature of Germany, though in its beginnings intimately connected with the
                    great national movement of the Reformation, soon devoted its efforts to a
                    sterile imitation of foreign models; while the popular stage, persistently
                    suiting itself to a robust but gross taste, likewise largely due to the
                    influence of foreign examples, seemed destined to a hopeless decay. The literary
                    and the acted drama were thus estranged from one another during a period of
                    extraordinary length; nor was it till the middle of the 18th century that, with
                    the opening of a more hopeful era for the life and literature of the nation, the
                    reunion of dramatic literature and the stage began to accomplish itself. Before
                    the end of the same century the progress of the German drama in its turn began
                    to influence that of other nations, and by the widely comprehensive character of
                    its literature, as well as by the activity of its stage, to invite a steadily
                    increasing interest.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the Middle Ages, as has been seen, dramatic performances had
                    in Germany as in England largely fallen into the hands of the civic guilds, and
                    the composition of plays was more especially cultivated by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >master-singers</hi> of Nuremberg and other towns. Thus, while the scholars of
                    the German Renaissance, who so largely became the agents of the Reformation,
                    eagerly dramatized, both in the Latin and the native tongue, the narratives of
                    the Bible, and sought to suit the scholastic drama to the demands of the times
                    (P. Rebhun,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Susanna
                    {Geistliches Spiel} (1536), &amp;c.</p></note> a protegee of Luther, standing
                    foremost among those religious dramatists), it was under the influence of the
                    Reformation also, and of the impulse given by Luther and others to the use of
                    High German as the popular literary tongue, that Hans Sachs, the immortal
                    shoemaker of Nuremberg, seemed destined to become the father of the popular
                    German drama. In his plays, “spiritual,” secular,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fastnachtsspiele</hi> alike, the interest indeed lies in the dialogue rather
                    than in the action, nor do they display any attempt at development of character.
                    In their subjects, whether derived from Scripture, or from popular legend and
                    fiction,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Siegfried;
                    Eulenspiegel, &amp;c.</p></note> there is no novelty, and in their treatment no
                    originality. But the healthy vigour and fresh humour of this marvellously
                    fertile author, and his innate sympathy with the views and sentiments of the
                    burgher class to which he belonged, were elements of genuine promise—a promise
                    which the event was signally to disappoint. Though the manner of Hans Sachs
                    found a few followers, and is recognizable in the German popular drama even of
                    the beginning of the 17th century, the literature of the Reformation, of which
                    his works may claim to form part, was soon absorbed in labours of a very
                    different kind. The stage, after admitting novelties introduced from Italy or
                    (under Jesuit supervision) from Spain, was subjected to another and enduring
                    influence. Among the foreign actors of various nations who flitted through the
                    innumerable courts of the empire, or found a temporary home there, special
                    prominence was acquired, towards the close of the 16 th and in the early years
                    of the 17th century, by the “English comedians,” who appeared at Cassel,
                    Wolfenbüttel, Berlin, Dresden, Cologne, &lt;fcc, Through these players a number
                    of early English dramas found their way into Germany, where they were performed
                    in more or less imperfect versions, and called forth imitations by native
                    authors. Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Lüneburg<note anchored="true"

                    playwrights, reappears no small part of what we may conclude to have been the

                    from such a source.) But though welcome to both princes and people, the
                    exertions of these foreign comedians, and of the native imitators who soon arose
                    in the earliest professional companies of actors known in Germany, instead of
                    bringing about a union between the stage and literature, led to a directly
                    opposite result. The popularity of these strollers was owing partly to the (very
                    real) blood and other horrors with which their performances were deluged, partly
                    to the buffoonery with which they seasoned, and the various tricks and feats
                    with which they diversified them. The representatives of the English clowns had
                    learnt much on their way from their brethren in the Netherlands, where in this
                    period the art of grotesque acting greatly flourished. Nor were the aids of
                    other arts neglected,—to this day in Germany professors of the “equestrian
                    drama” are known by the popular appellation of “English riders.” From these true
                    descendants of the mimes, then, the professional actors in Germany inherited a
                    variety of tricks and traditions; and soon the favourite figures of the popular
                    comic stage became conventional, and were stereotyped by the use of masks. Among
                    these, an acknowledged supremacy was acquired by the native <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hans Wurst</hi> (Jack Pudding)—of whose name Luther disavowed the invention,
                    and who is known already to Hans Sachs—the privileged buffoon, and for a long
                    series of generations the real lord and master, of the German stage. If that
                    stage, with its grossness and ribaldry, seemed likely to become permanently
                    estranged from the tastes and sympathies of the educated classes, the fault was
                    by no means entirely its own and that of its patron the populace. The times were
                    evil times for a national effort of any kind; and poetic literature was in all
                    its branches passing into the hands of scholars who were often pedants, and
                    whose language was a jargon of learned affectations. Thus things continued, till
                    the awful visitation of the Thirty Years’ War cast a general blight upon the
                    nation, and the traditions of the popular theatre were left to the guardianship

                <p>When, in the midst of that war, German poets once more began to essay the
                    dramatic form, the national drama was left outside their range of vision. M.
                    Opitz (1597-1639), who holds an honoured place in the history of the German
                    language and literature, in this branch of his labours contented himself with

                    of Chr. Weise (1642-1708) were brought upon the stage; while the religious plays
                    of J. Klay (1616-1656) are mere recitations connected with the Italian growth of

                    contemporary events, with which the learned from time to time supplied the
                    theatre, and the pastoral dramas with which the idyllic poets of Nuremberg—“the
                    shepherds of the Pegnitz”-—after the close of the war gratified the peaceful
                    longings of their fellow-citizens, were alike mere scholastic efforts. These
                    indeed continued in the universities and <hi rend="italic">gymnasia</hi> to keep
                    alive the love of both dramatic composition and dramatic representation, and to
                    encourage the theatrical taste which led so many students into the professional
                    companies. But neither these dramatic exercises nor the <hi rend="italic"

                    the pomp and pageantry, and the mixture of classical and Christian symbolism, of
                    the Italian Renaissance, had any influence upon the progress of the popular
                    drama.</p>
                <p>The history of the German stage remains to about the second decennium of the 18th
                    century one of the most melancholy, as it is in its way one of the most
                    instructive, chapters of theatrical history. Ignored by the world of letters,
                    the actors in return deliberately sought to emancipate their art from all
                    dependence upon literary material. Improvisation reigned supreme, not only in
                    farce, where <hi rend="italic">Hans Wurst,</hi> with the aid of Italian
                    examples, never ceased to charm his public, but in the serious drama likewise
                    (in which, however, he also played his part) in those <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haupt-und Staαtsactionen</hi> (high-matter-of-state-dramas), the plots of which
                    were taken from the old stores of the English comedians, from the religious
                    drama and its sources, and from the profane history of all times. The hero of
                    this period is “Magister” J. Velthen, who at the head of a company of players
                    for a time entered the service of the Saxon court, and by producing comedies of
                    Molière and other writers sought to restrain the licence which he had himself
                    carried beyond all earlier precedent, but who had to fall back into the old ways
                    and the old life. Hi3 career exhibits the climax of the efforts of the art of
                    acting to stand alone; after his death (c. 1693) chaos ensues. The strolling
                    companies, which now included actresses, continued to foster the popular love of
                    the stage, and even under its most degraded form to uphold its national
                    character against the rivalry of the opera, and that of the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">Commedia deWarte.</hi> From the latter was borrowed Harlequin,
                    with whom <hi rend="italic">Hans Wurst</hi> was blended, and who became a
                    standing figure in every kind of popular play. He established his rule more
                    especially at Vienna, where from about 1712 the first permanent German theatre
                    was maintained But for the actors in general there was little permanence , and
                    amidst miseries of all sorts, and under the growing ban of clerical intolerance,
                    the popular stage seemed destined to hopeless decay.</p>
                <p>The first endeavours to reform what had thus apparently passed beyond all reach
                    of recovery were neither wholly nor generally successful; but this does not
                    diminish the honour due to two names which should never be mentioned without
                    respect in connection with the history of the drama. Friderica Caroline Neuber’s
                    (1690-1760) biography is the story of a long-continued effort which,
                    notwithstanding errors and weaknesses, and though, so far aβ her personal
                    fortunes were concerned, it ended in failure, may almost be described as heroic.
                    As directress of a company of actors which from 1727 had its headquarters at
                    Leipsic (hence the new school of acting is called the Leipsic school), she
                    resolved to put an end to the formlessness of the existing stage, to separate
                    tragedy and comedy, and to extinguish Harlequin. In this endeavour she was
                    supported by the Leipsic professor J. Chr. Gottsched (1672-1766), who induced
                    her to establish French tragedy and comedy as the sole models of the regular
                    drama. Literature and the stage thus for the first time joined hands, and no
                    temporary mischance or personal misunderstanding can obscure the enduring
                    significance of the union. Not only were the abuses of a century swept away from
                    a representative theatre, but a large number of literary works, designed for the
                    stage, were produced on it. It is true that they were but versions or imitations
                    from the French (or in the case of Gottsched’s <hi rend="italic">Dying Cato</hi>
                    from the French and English),<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Deschamps and Addison.</p></note> and that at the moment of
                    the regeneration of the German drama new fetters were thus imposed upon it, and
                    upon the art of acting at the same time. But the impulse had been given, and the
                    beginning made. On the one hand men of letters began to subject their dramatic
                    compositions to the test of performance; the tragedies and comedies of J. E.
                    Schlegel (1718-1749), the artificial and sentimental comedies of Chr. F. Gellert
                    (1715-1769) and others, together with the vigorous popular comedies of the
                    Danish dramatist Holberg, were brought into competition with translations from
                    the French. On the other hand, the Leipsic school exercised a continuous effect
                    upon the progress of the art of acting, and before long the Garrick of Germany,
                    C. Eckhof (1720- 1778), began a career, outwardly far humbler than that of the
                    great English actor, but which made his art a fit subject for the critical study
                    of scholars, and his profession one for the equal esteem of honourable men.</p>
                <p>Among the authors contributing to Mme. Neuber’s Leipsic enterprise had been a
                    young student destined to complete, after a very different fashion and with very
                    different aims, the work which she and Gottsched had begun. The critical genius
                    of G. E. Lessing (1729-1781) is peerless in its comprehensiveness, as in its
                    keenness and depth; but' if there was any branch of literature and art which by
                    study and practice he made pre-eminently his own, it was that of the drama. As
                    bearing upon the progress of the German theatre, his services to its literature,
                    both critical and creative, can only be described as inestimable. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Hamburgische Dramaturgie,</hi> a series of criticisms Of plays and
                    (in its earlier numbers) of actors, was undertaken in furtherance of the attempt
                    to establish at Hamburg the first national German theatre (1767-9). This alone
                    would invest these papers with a high significance; for though the theatrical
                    enterprise proved abortive, yet it established the principle upon which the
                    future of the theatre in all countries depends, that for the dramatic art the
                    immediate theatrical public is no sufficient court of appeal. But the direct
                    effect of the <hi rend="italic">Dramaturgie</hi> was to complete the task
                    Lessing had in previous writings begun, and to overthrow the dominion of the
                    arbitrary French rules and the French models established by Gottsched. Lessing
                    vindicated its real laws to the drama, made clear the difference between the
                    Greeks and their would-be representatives, and established the claims of
                    Shakespeare as the modem master of both tragedy and comedy. His own dramatic
                    productivity was cautious, tentative, progressive. His first step was, by his
                    <hi rend="italic">Miss Sara Sampson</hi> (1755), to oppose the realism of the
                    English domestic drama to the artificiality of the accepted French models, in
                    the forms of which Chr. F. Weisse (1726-1804) was seeking to treat the subjects
                    of Shakespearian plays.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    he essayed a national comedy drawn from real life, and appealing to patriotic

                    the nascent dramatic literature of Germany is astonishing both in the efforts
                    inspired by his teachings and in those which continued to controvert, or which
                    aspired to transcend them. On the stage, Harlequin and his surroundings proved
                    by no means easy to suppress, more especially at Vienna, the chosen home of
                    frivolous amusement; but even here a reform was gradually effected, and, under
                    the intelligent rule of the emperor Joseph IL, a national stage grew into being.
                    The mantle of Eckhof fell upon the shoulders of his eager younger rival, F. L.
                    Schröder (1743-1816), who was the first to domesticate Shakespeare upon the
                    German stage. In dramatic literature few of Lessing’s earlier contemporaries
                    produced any works of permanent value, unless the religious dramas of F. G.
                    Klopstock (1724-1803)—a species in which he had been preceded by J. J. Bodmer
                    (1698-1783) —and the patriotic <hi rend="italic">Bardietten</hi> of the same
                    author be excepted. S. Gessner (1730-1787), J. W. L. Gleim (1719- 1803), and G∙
                    K. Pfeffel (1736-1809) composed pastoral plays. But a far more potent stimulus
                    prompted the efforts of the younger generation. The translation of Shakespeare,
                    begun in 1762 by C. M. Wieland (1733-1813), whose own plays possess no special
                    significance, and completed in 1775 by Eschenburg, which furnished the text for
                    many of Lessing’s criticisms, helps to mark an epoch in German literature. Under
                    the influence of Shakespeare, or of their conceptions of his genius, arose a
                    youthful group of writers who, while worshipping their idol as the
                    representative of nature, displayed but slight anxiety to harmonize their
                    imitations of him with the demands of art. The notorious <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ugolino</hi> of H. W. von Gerstenberg (1737— 1823) seemed a premonitory sign
                    that the coming flood might make a circular motion back to the extravagances and
                    horrors of the old popular stage; and it was with a sense of this danger in
                    prospect that Lessing in his third important drama, the prose tragedy <hi
                    rend="italic">Emilia Galοtti</hi> (1772), set the example of a work of
                    incomparable nicety in its adaptation of means to end. But successful as it
                    proved, it could not stay the excesses of the <hi rend="italic">Sturm und
                    Drang</hi> period which now set in. Lessing’s last drama, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nathan the Wise</hi> (1779), was not measured to the standard of the
                    contemporary stage, but it was to exercise its influence in the progress of
                    time,—not only through causing a reaction in tragedy from prose to blank verse
                    (first essayed in Brawe’s <hi rend="italic">Brutus,</hi> 1770), but through
                    ennobling and elevating by its moral and intellectual grandeur the branch of
                    literature to which in form it belongs.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the young geniuses of the <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> had
                    gone forth, as worshippers rather than followers of Shakespeare, to conquer new
                    worlds. The name of this group of writers, more remarkable for their collective
                    significance than for their individual achievements, was derived from a drama by
                    one of the most prolific of their number, M. F. von Klinger<note anchored="true"

                    (1750-1792), and F. Müller<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Genoveva, &amp;c.</p></note> the “painter” (1750-1825). The youthful genius
                    of the greatest of German poets was itself under the influences of this period,
                    when it produced the first of its masterpieces. But Goethe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gi)tz von Berlichingen</hi> (1773), both by the choice and treatment of its
                    national theme, and by the incomparable freshness and originality of its style,
                    holds a position of its own in German dramatic literature. Though its defiant
                    irregularity of form prevented its complete success upon the stage, yet its
                    influence is far from being represented by the series of mostly feeble
                    imitations to which it gave rise. The <hi rend="italic">Ritterdramen</hi> (plays
                    of chivalry) had their day like similar fashions in drama or romance; but the
                    permanent effect of <hi rend="italic">Gotz</hi> was to have crushed with an iron
                    hand the last remnants of theatrical conventionality (those of costume and
                    scenery included), and to have extinguished with them the lingering respect for
                    rules and traditions of dramatic composition which even Lessing had treated with
                    consideration. Its highest significance, however, lies in its having been the
                    first great dramatic work of a great national poet, and having definitively
                    associated the national drama with the poetic glories of the national
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Thus in the classical period of that literature, of which Goethe and Schiller
                    were the ruling stars, the drama had a full share of the loftiest of its
                    achievements. Of these, the dramatic works of Goethe vaιy so widely in form and
                    character, and connect themselves so intimately with the different phases of the
                    development of his own self-determined poetic genius, that it was impossible for
                    any of them to become the starting-points of any general growths in the history
                    of the German drama. His way of composition was, moreover, so peculiar to
                    himself—conception often preceding execution by many years, part being added to
                    part under the influence of new sentiments and ideas and views of art, flexibly
                    followed by changes of form—that the history of his dramas cannot be severed
                    from his general poetic and personal biography. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Claνigο</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stella,</hi> which succeeded <hi
                    rend="italic">Gotz,</hi> are domestic dramas in proce; but neither by these, nor
                    by the series of charming pastorals and operas which he composed for the Weimar
                    court, could any influence be exercised upon the progress of the national drama.
                    In the first conception of his <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> he had indeed
                    sought the suggestion of his theme partly in popular legend, partly in a
                    domestic motive familiar to the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Sturm und
                    Drang</hi> (the story of Gretchen); the later additions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >First Part,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Second Part</hi> generally, are the
                    results of metaphysical and critical studies and meditations belonging to wholly
                    different spheres of thought and experience. The dramatic unity of the whole is
                    thus, at the most, external only; and the standard of judgment to be applied to
                    this wondrous poem is not one of dramatic criticism. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Egmont,</hi> originally designed as a companion to <hi rend="italic">Gotz,</hi>
                    was not completed till many years later; there are few dramas more effective in
                    parts, but the idea of a historic play is lost in the elaboration of the most
                    graceful of love episodes. In <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tasso,</hi> Goethe exhibited the perfection of form of which his
                    classical period had enabled him to acquire the mastery; but the sphere of the
                    action of the former (perfect though it is as a dramatic action), and the nature
                    of that of the latter, are equally remote from the demands of the popular stage.
                    Schiller’s genius, unlike Goethe’s, was naturally and consistently suited to the
                    claims of the theatre. His juvenile works, <hi rend="italic">The Robbers,
                    Ficsco,</hi><hi rend="italic">Kabale und Liebe</hi><hi rend="italic">(Intrigue
                    and Love),</hi> vibrating under the influence of an age of social revolution,
                    mingled in their prose form the truthful expression of passion with no small
                    element of extravagance. But with true insight into the demands of his art, and
                    with unequalled single-mindedness and self-devotion to it, Schiller gradually
                    emancipated himself from his earlier style; and with his earliest tragedy in
                    verse, <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos,</hi> the first period of his dramatic
                    authorship ends, and the promise of the second announces itself. The works which
                    belong to this—from the <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> trilogy to <hi
                    rend="italic">Tell—</hi> are the acknowledged master-pieces of the German poetic
                    drama, treating historic themes reconstructed by conscious dramatic workmanship,
                    and clothing their dialogue in a noble vestment of rhetorical verse. In one of
                    these, <hi rend="italic">The Bride of Messina,</hi> Schiller attempted a new use
                    of the chorus of Greek tragedy; but the endeavour was a splendid error, and
                    destined to exercise no lasting effect.</p>
                <p>Schiller’s later dramas gradually conquered the stage, <pb break="no"

                    passed, but on which his <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi> had met with a cold
                    welcome. For a long time, however, its favourites were authors of a very
                    different order, who suited themselves to the demands of a public little
                    concerned with the literary progress of the drama. After popular tastes had
                    oscillated between the imitators of <hi rend="italic">Götz</hi> and those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Emilia Galotti,</hi> they entered into a more settled phase as the
                    establishment of standing theatres at the courts and in the large towns
                    increased the demand for good “acting" plays. Famous actors, such as Schröder
                    and A. W. Iffland (1759-1814), sought by translations or compositions of their
                    own to meet the popular likings, which largely took the direction of that
                    irrepressible favourite of theatrical audiences, the εentimental domestic drama.
                    But the most successful purveyor of such wares was an author who, though not
                    himself an actor, understood the theatre with professional instinct,—A. von
                    Kotzebue (1761-1819). His productivity ranged from the domestic drama and comedy
                    of all kinds to attempts to rival Schiller and Shakespeare in verse; and though
                    his popularity (which ultimately proved his doom) brought upon him the bitterest
                    attacks of the Romantic school and other literary authorities, his self-conceit
                    is not astonishing, and it seems time to say that there is some exaggeration in
                    the contempt which has been lavished upon him by posterity. Nor should it be
                    forgotten that German literature had hitherto failed to furnish the comic stage
                    with any successors to <hi rend="italic">Minna von Barnhelm;</hi> for Goethe’s
                    efforts to dramatize characteristic events or figures of the Revolutionary

                    (Cagliostro); Der Burgergeneral.</p></note> must be dismissed as failures, not
                    from a theatrical point of view only. The joint efforts of Goethe and Schiller
                    for the Weimar stage, important in many respects for the history of the German
                    drama, at the same time reveal the want of a national dramatic literature
                    sufficient to supply the needs of a theatre endeavouring to satisfy the demands
                    of art.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the so-called Romantic school of German literature was likewise
                    beginning to extend its labours to original dramatic composition. From the

                    expected; while much might be hoped for the future of the national drama
                    (especially in its mixed and comic species) from the alliance between poetry and
                    real life which they preached, and which some of them sought personally to
                    exemplify. But in practice universality presented itself as peculiarity or even
                    as eccentricity; and in the end the divorce between poetry and real life was
                    announced as authoritatively as their union had been. Outside this school, the
                    youthful talent of Th. Körner (1791-1813), whose early promise as a
                    dramatist<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Zriny,

                    unworthily to occupy the seat left vacant by his father’s friend Schiller, was
                    extinguished by a patriotic death. The efforts of M. von Collin (1776-1823) in
                    the direction of the historical drama remained isolated attempts. But of the

                    the foremost later dramatic poets of his country, few of whom equal him in
                    intensity.. Other names of literary mark are those of Chr. D. Grabbe
                    (1801-1836), J. Mosen (1803-1867), 0. Ludwig (1813-1865), and “F. Halm”
                    (1806-1871),and, among living writers, K. Gutzkow, G. Freytag, and H. Laube. The
                    last of these names recalls in one of their most noteworthy examples the
                    long-continued and systematic efforts which have raised the modern German stage
                    to the position at present occupied by it among the theatres of Europe. These
                    efforts have not been confined to fostering the art of acting in a succession of
                    eminent representatives, among whom the sons of L. Devrient in various ways
                    acquired a reputation worthy of their name, and B. Dawison was accounted the
                    equal of the most brilliant of the brotherhood, or to maintaining as intimate a
                    relation as possible between the stage and literatüre. Happily contrasting with
                    other countries by the number and variety of its centres of intellectual
                    life—rivals in artistic effort even where political or social rivalry is out of
                    the question—Germany has not only cherished its own national drama, but with a
                    catholicity of taste, aided by the powers of a language admirably adapted for
                    translation, has opened its theatre to the dramatic masterpieces of other
                    nations also, and more especially of our own. The German theatre ha3 its weak
                    points, and has not maintained itself wholly free from vicious influences; but
                    upon the whole its efforts are on a level with the demands of the national
                    culture, and in harmony with the breadth and variety of the national
                    intelligence. No other stage furnishes the same opportunities for the study of
                    dramatic literature.</p>
                <p>With this summary of the history of the German drama it is necessary to close
                    this survey. To be even nominally complete, it would have had to take into
                    account the fortunes of more than one other modern European drama. Among these
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dutch</hi> is interesting both in its beginnings, <pb

                    of the so-called chambers of the <hi rend="italic">rederykers</hi>
                    (rhetoricians), from the early years of the 15th century onwards, resembling
                    that of the master-singers of contemporary Germany. The earliest of their
                    efforts, which so effectively tempered the despotism of both church and state,
                    seem to have been of a dramatic kind; and a manifold variety of allegories,
                    moralities, and comic entertainments <hi rend="italic">{esbatementen</hi> or
                    comedies, <hi rend="italic">kluiten</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fαdieη</hi> or
                    farces) enhanced the attractions of those popular pageants in which the
                    Netherlands surpassed all other countries of the North. The art of acting
                    flourished in the Low Countries even during the troubles of the great revolt;
                    but the birth of the regular drama was delayed till the advent of quieter times.
                    Dutch dramatic literature begins, under the influence of the classical studies
                    cherished in the seats of learning founded before and after the close of the
                    war, with the classical tragedies of S. Koster (c. 1585-c. 1650). The romantic
                    dramas and farces of Gerbrand Bredero and the tragedies of Hooft belong to the
                    same period; but its foremost dramatic poet was J. van den Vondel (1587-1659),
                    who from an imitation of classical models passed to more original forms of
                    dramatic composition, including a patriotic play<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gysbreeht ναη Aernstel.</p></note> and a
                    dramatic treatment of part of what was to form the theme of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradise Lost.</hi> But Vondel had no successor of equal mark. The older form
                    of Dutch tragedy—in which the chorus still appeared—was, especially under the
                    influence of the critic A. Pels, exchanged for a close imitation of the French
                    models, Corneille and Racine; nor was the attempt to create a national comedy
                    successful. Thus no national Dutch drama was permanently called into life. Still
                    more decidedly the dramatic literature of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Scandinavian</hi> peoples springs from foreign growths; but Denmark, where the
                    beginnings of the drama in the plays of the schoolmaster Chr. Hansen recall the
                    mixture of religious and farcical elements in contemporary German efforts, at a
                    later date produced a comic dramatist· of thorough originality and of a wholly
                    national cast. L. Holberg (1684-1754), one of the most noteworthy comic poets of
                    modern literature, not only marks an epoch in the dramatic literature of his
                    native land, but he contributed to overthrow the trivialities of the German
                    stage in its worst period, which he satirized with merciless humour,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ulysses of Ithaca.</p></note>
                    and set an example, never surpassed, of a series of comedies<note

                    which are the proper theme of the most widely effective species of the comic
                    drama. Among his followers P. A. Heiberg (1758- 1860) is specially noted. Under
                    the influence of the Romantic school, whose influence has nowhere proved so
                    long-lived as in the Scandinavian north, A. Oehlenschläger (1779-1850) began a
                    new era of Danish literature. His productivity, which belongs partly to his
                    native and partly to German literary history, turned from foreign<note

                    endeavours to revive the figures of Northern heroic legend. The reaction
                    recently observable in Danish literary criticism against the supremacy of the
                    Romantic school may be expected to produce results in the drama, in the
                    direction perhaps of those already attested by the success of two living
                    Norwegian dramatists, H. Ibsen and Björnsteme Björnson.</p>

                    civilization. A species of popular puppet-show called <hi rend="italic"

                    the Russian regular drama characteristically enough had its origin in the cadet
                    corps at St Petersburg, a pupil of which, A. Sumarokoff (1718-1777), is regarded
                    as the founder of the modern Russian theatre. As a tragic poet he seems to have
                    imitated Racine and Voltaire, though treating themes from the national history,
                    among others the famous dramatic subject of the False Demetrius. He also
                    translated <hi rend="italic">Hamlet.</hi> As a comic dramatist he is stated to
                    have been less popular than as a tragedian; yet it is in comedy that he would
                    seem to have had the most noteworthy successors. Among these it is impossible to
                    pass by the empress Catharine IL (1729-1796), whose comedies seem to have been
                    satirical sketches of the follies and foibles of her subjects, and who in one
                    comedy as well as in a tragedy had the courage to imitate Shakespeare. Comedy
                    aiming at social satire has continued to flourish in Russia to the present day,
                    and possesses (or recently possessed) a representative of mark in A. N.
