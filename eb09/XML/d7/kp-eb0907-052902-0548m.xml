                    his birth his father died, leaving a widow and four children wholly unprovided
                    for. But the widow, though placed in such destitute circumstances, found means
                    to send Étienne to the college of Geneva, where he distinguished himself both by
                    his ability and by his independent spirit. In a short time he not only defrayed
                    the cost of his own education, but even contributed to the support of the
                    family, by acting as <hi rend="italic">répétiteur,</hi> or private tutor to his
                    comrades. Having completed his academical course, he took clerical orders; and
                    in the year 1781 he was chosen one of the pastors of the city, where his talents
                    as a preacher soon attracted general notice, and gave promise of his becoming
                    one of the most brilliant and persuasive of pulpit orators. But the political
                    troubles which disturbed Geneva in 1782 suddenly turned the course of his life
                    into a different channel. He belonged to the liberals or democrats, and the
                    triumph of the aristocratical party, through the interference of the courts of
                    France and Sardinia, made residence in his native town impossible to him, though
                    he was not among the number of the proscribed. He therefore became a voluntary
                    exile, and went to join his mother and sisters at St Petersburg, a city to which
                    many Genevese had resorted. In this he was probably influenced in part by the
                    example of his townsman Lefort, who was the first tutor, minister, and general
                    of the czar. At St Petersburg he filled for eighteen months with great
                    acceptance the office of pastor of the French church. In 1785 he removed to
                    London, Lord Shelburne, then a minister of state, having invited him to
                    undertake the education of his sons. It was at the house of Lord Shelburne,
                    afterwards marquis of Lansdowne, where he was treated as a friend or rather
                    member of the family, that he became acquainted with some of the most
                    illustrious men of the country, amongst whom may be mentioned Fox, Sheridan,
                    Lord Holland, and Sir Samuel Romilly. With the last of these he formed a close
                    and enduring friendship, which had an important influence on his life and
                    pursuits.</p>
                <p>In 1788 Dumont visited Paris in company with Romilly. During a sojourn of two
                    months in that city he had almost daily intercourse with Mirabeau; and a certain
                    affinity of talents and pursuits led to an intimacy between two persons
                    diametrically opposed to each other in habits and in character. On his return
                    from Paris Dumont formed that connection with Jeremy Bentham which exercised a
                    powerful influence over his future opinions, and, as it were, fixed his career
                    as a writer on legislation. Filled with admiration for the genius of Bentham,
                    and profoundly impressed with the truth of his theory, and the important
                    consequences to which it immediately led, Dumont made it one of the chief
                    objects of his life to recast and edit the writings of the great English jurist
                    in a form suitable for the ordinary reading public. This literary relationship
                    was, according to Dumont’s own account, one of a somewhat peculiar character.
                    All the fundamental ideas and most of the illustrative material were supplied in
                    the manuscripts of Bentham; Dumont’s task was chiefly to abridge by striking out
                    repeated matter, to supply <hi rend="italic">laminae,</hi> to secure uniformity
                    of style, and to improve the French. The following works of Bentham were
                    published under the editorship of Dumont :— <hi rend="italic">Traité de la
                    Législation</hi> (1802), <hi rend="italic">Théorie des peines et des
                    Récompenses</hi> (1811), <hi rend="italic">Tactique des Assemblées
                    législatives</hi> (1815), <hi rend="italic">Preuves Judiciaires</hi> (1823), and
                    <hi rend="italic">Organization</hi><hi rend="italic">Judiciaire et
                    Codification</hi> (1828).</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1789, that season of promise and of hope, especially to a
                    Genevese exile, Dumont suspended his labours in England in order to proceed to
                    Paris along with his friend Duroverai, ex-attomey-general of the republic of
                    Geneva. The object of the journey was to obtain through Necker, who had just
                    returned to office, an unrestricted restoration of Genevese liberty, by
                    cancelling the treaty of guarantee between France and Switzerland, which
                    prevented the republic from enacting new laws without the consent of the parties
                    to this treaty. The proceedings and negotiations to which this mission gave rise
                    necessarily brought Dumont into connection with most of the leading men in the
                    Constituent Assembly, and made him an interested spectator, sometimes even a
                    participator, indirectly, in the events of the French Revolution.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0549-0530"/>
                <p>The same cause also led him to renew his acquaintance with Mirabeau, whom he
                    found occupied with his duties as a deputy, and with the composition of his
                    journal, the <hi rend="italic">Courier de Provence,</hi> in which he was
                    assisted by Duroverai, Clavière, and other Genevese patriots. For a time Dumont
                    took an active and very efficient part in the conduct of this journal, supplying
                    it with reports as well as original articles, and also furnishing Mirabeau
                    withspeeches to be delivered or rather read in the assembly, as related in his
                    highly instructive and interesting posthumous work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souvenirs sur Mirabeau</hi> (1832). In fact his friend George Wilson used to
                    relate that one day, when they were dining together at a <hi rend="italic">table
                    d'hote</hi> at Versailles, he saw Dumont engaged in writing the most celebrated
                    paragraph of Mirabeau’s address to Mie king for the removal of the troops. He
                    also reported such of Mirabeau’s speeches as he did not write, embellishing them
                    from his own stores, which were inexhaustible. But this co-operation, so
                    valuable for Mirabeau, and so self-devoted on the part of Dumont, was destined
                    soon to come to an end; for, being attacked in pamphlets as one of Mirabeau’s
                    writers, he felt hurt at the notoriety thus given to his name in connection with
                    a man occupying Mirabeau’s peculiar position, and resolved to return to England,
                    which he accordingly did in 1791.</p>
                <p>In the eventful years which followed he continued to live chiefly at Lansdowne
                    House, or at Bowood, where the most remarkable men of Europe were frequent
                    guests. Latterly, he formed an intimate friendship with Lord Holland, whom he
                    Jιad known from childhood; and he became a member of the society of familiar
                    friends, the habitual visitors at Holland House, where, during many years,
                    celebrated guests were welcomed of every country, party, religion, and of every
                    liberal profession or station. In 1801 Dumont travelled over various parts of
                    Europe with Lord Henry Petty, afterwards marquis of Lansdowne, and brought back
                    a fresher acquaintance with the mental occupations of the Continental nations,
                    from whom England had for years been widely separated. But Dumont had then
                    opened a new course of more serious occupations, in the editorship of the works
                    of Bentham already mentioned. In 1801 he published the <hi rend="italic">Traité
                    de la Législation,</hi> the first fruits of his zealous labours to give order,
                    clearness, and vivacity to the profound and original meditations of Bentham,
                    hitherto praised .only by a very few patient readers, and but little better
                    known, even by name, to the English than to the European public. In 1814 the
                    restoration of Geneva to independence induced Dumont to return to his native
                    place, and he soon became at once the leader and ornament of the supreme
                    council. He devoted particular attention to the judicial and penal systems of
                    his native state, and many improvements on both are due to him. At the time of
                    his death, he was on the eve of proposing a complete code of law, by which he
                    fondly hoped to make the legislation of Geneva an example to Europe. He died at
                    Milan when on an autumn tour of relaxation in October 1829, in the seventy-first
                    year of his age.</p>
