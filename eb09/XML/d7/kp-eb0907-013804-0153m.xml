                    Plymouth, the seat of one of the royal dockyards, and an important naval and
                    military station. It is situated immediately above Plymouth Sound, occupying a
                    triangular peninsula formed by Stonehouse Pool on the east and the Hamoaze on
                    the west. The town proper is inclosed by a line of ramparts 12 feet <pb

                    depth, excavated out of the solid limestone. Three gates—the Stonehouse gate,
                    the Stoke barrier, and the North barrier— afford communication respectively with
                    East. Stonehouse, Stoke, and Morice Town, the last two being suburbs of
                    Devonport. The streets are laid out with regularity, and are paved with a
                    peculiarly white limestone that gives an air of great cleanliness to the town. A
                    copious supply of water is provided by means of a conduit from Dartmoor. The
                    public buildings are both handsome and numerous. The town hall, erected in
                    1821-22 partly after the design of the Parthenon, is distinguished by an elegant
                    Doric portico; while near it are the public library, in the Egyptian style of
                    architecture, and a conspicuous column or Doric pillar built of Devonshire
                    granite. This monument, which is 100 feet high, was raised in commemoration of
                    the naming of the town in 1824. There are numerous churches belonging to the
                    different religious denominations. Besides the parish church, which is small,
                    several chapels of ease have within the present century been erected in various
                    parts of the town. One of them, a handsome edifice built in 1814-15 at a cost of
                    £24,000, is situated in the dockyards, and was erected for the special use of
                    those employed there. Of the Government buildings the principal are a spacious
                    hospital outside the barriers, the Raglan barracks, and the residences of the
                    military and naval chief officers. On Mount Wise, which is defended by a
                    battery, stands the military residence, or Government house, which is occupied
                    by the commander of the western district; and near at hand is the other
                    residence, the port admiral’s house. Mount Wise itself and the parade form
                    interesting features of the place, and tend greatly to the amenity of the town—
                    the prospect from the former being one of the finest in the south of England.
                    The most noteworthy object, however, in connection with Devonport is the royal
                    dockyard, which extends along the shore of the Hamoaze from Mutton Cove to
                    Keyham Lake, a distance of about If miles. The naval dockyard, which formed the
                    nucleus of the town, is situated within the ramparts, and covers an area of 75
                    acres, with a wharfage of 1160 yards; while beyond the ramparts, and higher up
                    the Hamoaze, is the more recently constructed Keyham steam yard, connected with
                    the former by means of a tunnel 900 yards long. Keyham steam yard occupies an
                    area of 100 acres; and its docks are built of granite. In connection with the
                    dockyards are the gun wharf, and extensive store-houses and factories. The
                    number of hands employed in the works is very large, varying from 3000 to 4000,
                    according to circumstances; and it may be said that, with the exception of a
                    brewery in the suburb of Morice Town, the only manufactory of the place is that
                    belonging to the Government. The history of Devonport is of comparatively recent
                    date. After the outbreak of war with France in 1689 William III. established an
                    arsenal there in connection with the neighbouring naval station of Plymouth, and
                    it received the name of Plymouth Dock. Its proportions were, however, somewhat
                    limited until in 1761 and in 1771 extensive additions were made, and since then
                    it has steadily increased in importance. In 1824 it received its present
                    distinctive name, and by the Reform Act of 1832 it was erected into an
                    independent borough returning 2 members to Parliament. The municipal borough,
                    which is co-extensive with the parish of Stoke-Damerel, is subdivided into 6
                    wards, and covers an area of 1760 acres; while the area of the parliamentary
                    borough, which includes East Stonehouse, extends to 1950 acres. The town is
                    governed by a mayor, 12 aidermen, and 35 councillors, and has a separate
                    commission of the peace. The ground on which Devonport stands is for the most
                    part the property of the St Aubyn family, whose steward holds a court leet and a
                    court baron annually. The population of the municipal borough was, in 1851,
                    38,180; in 1861, 50,440; and in 1871, 49,449—the males being slightly more
                    numerous than the females. The population of the parliamentary borough in 1871
                    was 64,034. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plymouth</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
