                    and bought the estate of Shustoke, near Coleshill, in Warwickshire, was born on
                    the 12 th September 1605. He received the early part of his education from
                    Thomas Sibley, a curate near Shustoke, and attended from his tenth to his
                    fifteenth year the Free School at Coventry, whence returning to his father, he
                    read with him for some time law and history. In compliance with his father’s
                    wish, who was old and infirm, and desired to see him married before he died, he
                    was married at the early age of seventeen to the daughter of a gentleman in the
                    county of Stafford. He lived in his wife’s father’s house until the death of his
                    own father in 1624, and soon thereafter went to reside at Fillongley, near
                    Shustoke, an estate formerly purchased for him by his father. In 1625 he
                    purchased the manor of Blyth, in the parish of Shustoke, and, preferring it as a
                    place of residence, removed thither in 1626. His inclination to the study of
                    antiquities manifested itself at an early age, and received its first
                    encouragement from Samuel Roper, a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn. After his
                    settlement at Blyth Hall he made the acquaintance of some gentlemen interested
                    in antiquities, who enabled him to obtain a sight of the old “deeds and
                    evidences” of the county families of Warwickshire, and “divers antient writings
                    of consequence,” with the view of his writing a history of that county. In 1635
                    he accompanied Sir Simon Archer to London, and was by him introduced to Sir
                    Henry Spelman, which led to his acquaintance with Thomas, earl of Arundell, then
                    earl marshal of England, by whom he was, in 1638, created a pursuivant of arms
                    extraordinary by the name of Blanche Lyon, and in 1639 rouge-croix pursuivant in
                    ordinary. About this time he agreed to write his work on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monastery Foundations,</hi> and, having a lodging in the Herald’s Office, he
                    now spent much of his time in London in order to augment his collections out of
                    the record j of the Tower and other places in the city. In 1641 Sir Christopher
                    Hatton, a member of the House of Commons, dreading the near approach of the
                    revolutionary storm which soon thereafter broke over England, and the ruin that
                    might then ensue, got him to make exact drafts of all the monuments in
                    Westminster Abbey and the principal churches in England, including Peterborough,
                    Ely, Norwich, Lincoln, Newark, Beverley, Southwell, Kingston-upon-Hull, York,
                    Selby, Chester, Lichfield, Tamworth, and Warwick. He received and obeyed, in
                    June 1642, the summons of Charles I. to attend him at York, whither, on the
                    outbreak of the revolution, the king had betaken himself for the sake of greater
                    security. Learning the spread of the revolution in Warwickshire, Charles deputed
                    him to summon to surrender the castle of Banbury, in Oxford, and the castle of
                    Warwick, which were being rapidly filled with ammunition and rebels. Banbury
                    obeyed, but Warwick, being better prepared, contemned the summons and its
                    inmates were proclaimed traitors. He also summoned the city of Coventry; and,
                    accompanying Sir Richard Willys as guide, he was present at the battle of
                    Cudworth Field, the result of which he communicated to the king. He remained at
                    Oxford with the king till the surrender of the garrison in 1646, and witnessed
                    the battle of Edgehill, of the field of which he made afterwards an exact
                    survey, noting how the armies were drawn up, and where and in what direction the
                    various movements took place, and marking the graves of the slain. In November
                    1642 he was admitted M.A. of the university, and in 1644 the king created him
                    Chester-Herauld. While at Oxford he made a journey to Worcester, where—with the
                    purpose of increasing his collections for his history of Warwickshire—he perused
                    the registers of the bishop and of the dean and chapter; and during his Oxford
                    leisure he applied himself also to the search for antiquities in the libraries
                    and in the private houses. When Oxford surrendered he continued his antiquarian
                    researches in London along with Richard Dodsworth for their joint work on the
                    monasteries, which was published successively in single volumes in 1655, 1664,
                    and 1673. At the Restoration he obtained the office of Norroy king-at-arms, and
                    in 1677 was created garter principal king-at-arms, and was knighted. He died at
                    Blyth Hall, 10th February 1686.</p>
