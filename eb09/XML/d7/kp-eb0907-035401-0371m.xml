                    >Dominique,</hi> a British West India island, the largest in the Leeward group
                    of the Lesser Antilles, lying between the French islands of Martinique and
                    Guadaloupe, 24 miles north of the former and about the same distance south of
                    the latter, at the intersection of 15° 30' N. lat. by 6Γ 30' W. long. It has a
                    length of 29 miles with a maximum breadth of 16, and its area is estimated at
                    291 square miles. The longer axis is formed by a chain of mountains, which
                    attains in some parts a height of upwards of 5000 feet, and gives the whole
                    island a strongly marked profile and great irregularity of surface. The results
                    and symptoms of volcanic activity are abundant, in the shape of solfataras,
                    emissions of subterranean vapours, and hot springs; and in the southern part of
                    the island there exists a boiling lake of unascertained depth, in which the
                    water is frequently projected 3 feet or more above the surface by the force of
                    the ebullition. Besides a large number of minor rivulets, upwards of thirty
                    streams of considerable size might be mentioned, and this abundance of natural
                    irrigation develops great fertility in the rich volcanic soil. The hills are in
                    many parts covered with valuable timber trees of the kinds commonly found in the
                    West Indies; and the sugar-cane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, Indigo, oranges,
                    plantains, and arrow-root are grown in the lowlands. The island is botanically
                    remarkable for the great number of peculiar species which it possesses in
                    comparison with the poverty in this respect of Guadaloupe, Martinique,
                    Montserrat, and Antigua: as many as 24 are mentioned by Grisebach. Game is
                    abundant; the fisheries on the coast are productive; and large quantities of
                    honey and wax are furnished by the wild bees, which were originally introduced
                    from Europe. The coasts of the island are not much indented, and the only
                    anchorages of importance are Prince Rupert’s Bay aud Roseau, both on the west
                    side. The total tonnage of the ships that annually enter and clear amounts to
                    18,018 tons, according to the average of the fifteen years from 1860 to 1874
                    inclusive; and of this total only 37 42 tons belong to foreign vessels. The
                    imports in 1874 were valued at £56,714, and the exports of the same year at
                    £67,720,—being a decrease since 1860 of £11,087 and £12,738 respectively. Since
                    1872 Dominica has formed part of the colony of the Leeward Islands, and sends
                    its representatives to the general legislative council; but at the same time it
                    retains its lieutenant-governor or president, a separate treasury, and its local
                    legislature, consisting of seven elective members and seven nominees of the
                    crown. In 1874 its public revenue amounted to £15,022, its expenditure to
                    £17,456, and its debt to £4813. In common with the Virgin Islands it has
                    attained complete religious equality by the abolition of the salaries paid from
                    the public funds to the clergymen of the Church of England, who had a much
                    smaller portion of the population under their jurisdiction than the Roman
                    Catholic priests. Of the Carib aborigines there are no representatives; and the
                    present inhabitants, numbering, according to the census of 1871, 27,178, consist
                    mainly of descendants of the former negro slaves, with a certain number of
                    Spanish and English families. The capital is Roseau, or Charlotteville, a
                    fortified port near the southern end of the island, with about 5000 inhabitants.
                    Dominica was so named on its discovery by Columbus in 1493, in commemoration of
                    the date, which happened to be Sunday <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dies Dominica</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> the 3d of November. It was ceded to
                    England by France at the Peace of Paris in 1763, was captured by the French in
                    1778, regained by the English in 1783, again seized by the French in 1802, and
                    finally surrendered to Britain in 1814. It was in the neighbouring sea that
                    Rodney obtained his victory over Count de Grasse in 1782.</p>
