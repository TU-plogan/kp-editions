                <p><label type="entry">DECLARATION OF PARIS</label>, a diplomatic instrument or
                    protocol signed by the representatives of all the powers present at the Congress
                    of Paris in 1856, and subsequently accepted as a binding engagement of public
                    law by all the other powers (except the United States of America, Spain, and
                    Mexico), for the purpose of settling and defining certain rules of maritime law,
                    in time of war, on points of great moment to belligerent and neutral
                    states—points, it must be added, upon which the ancient law of nations had
                    gradually undergone some change, and on which great differences of opinion and
                    practice prevailed. The four propositions agreed to by the plenipotentiaries
                    were embodied in the following terms :—</p>
                <p>1. Privateering is and remains abolished.</p>
                <p>2. The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of contraband of
                    war.</p>
                <p>3. Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable to
                    capture under an enemy’s flag.</p>
                <p>4. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective,—that is to say,
                    maintained by a force sufficient readily to prevent access to the coast of the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>By most of the modern writers on international law these principles are regarded
                    as a distinct gain to the cause of civilization, international justice,
                    commerce, and peace. But a feeble and ineffectual attempt has been made to
                    repudiate these new rules of maritime law, though they received the tacit assent
                    of Parliament, and have been acted upon by all nations in the six wars which
                    have occurred since 1856, including the American civil war, although the United
                    States had not concurred in the Declaration. The American Government withheld
                    its assent, not because it objected to these principles, but because it held
                    that they did not go far enough, and that they ought to be extended to secure
                    from capture all private property at sea. It is argued by the opponents of the
                    Declaration that the British envoy at Paris exceeded his powers; that the form
                    of the instrument itself is declaratory, but not binding either as a contract or
                    a legislative act; that it is not competent to a congress to change the rights
                    of belligerents founded on ancient law and usage; and that Great Britain
                    committed a fatal error in renouncing the right to seize enemy’s goods in
                    neutral ships and to equip privateers.</p>
                <p>To these arguments it is said in reply that the British envoy at Paris had full
                    powers to pledge the faith of the Crown, with the concurrence of the Cabinet,
                    and that if Parliament disapproved his conduct, it ought to have been pressed to
                    a division at the time, and not when Great Britain has enjoyed the benefit of
                    the Declaration, as a neutral, for twenty years. It is a part of the prerogative
                    of the Crown to fix our international relations, and to determine the conditions
                    of maritime warfare. The most fitting and binding expression of international
                    law (which cannot assume the form of positive law by sovereign enactment) is to
                    be found in instruments recording in solemn form the consent of all civilized
                    nations. On the ground of expediency, it is contended by the supporters of the
                    Declaration of Paris, that Great Britain is, of all countries in the world, that
                    which has most to gain by it, because shq is not only the greatest naval power,
                    but the power which has the largest number of merchant vessels and the largest
                    amount of property afloat on the seas, and liable to attack.</p>
                <p>The primary advantage of the Declaration no doubt accrues to neutrals, as it
                    secures to them a larger carrying trade in time of war, and exempts them from
                    the seizure of enemy’s goods in neutral ships. Hence, if a belligerent were now
                    to violate the rules of the Declaration, he would have to encounter the
                    opposition of all neutral states, and would speedily find them arrayed on the
                    side of the enemy. But in the event of war, Great Britain is the state most
                    exposed, by reason of the magnitude of her maritime trade, to the depredations
                    of hostile cruisers; the injury done is to be measured by the amount of the
                    shipping and property exposed to it; and a single cruiser of a small state may
                    cause enormous losses to the commerce of a great power, as was seen in the
                    American civil war. Since the establishment of a general system of railroads,
                    the greater part of the trade of all the states of continental Europe can be
                    carried on by land, either by direct communication or through neutral ports. The
                    power of a naval state to inflict serious injury on an enemy by the interruption
                    of her trade is therefore by the nature of things greatly diminished, and the
                    same remark applies to commercial blockades. To England all foreign commodities
                    must be brought by sea, and England is more dependent than any other country on
                    foreign trade for the raw material of her manufactures, and even for the food of
                    her inhabitants. It is therefore the paramount interest of England to keep open
                    all the channels of trade, as much as possible, both in peace and war; and
                    injuries done to the trade of an enemy are often equally prejudicial to the
                    state which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0031-0022"/> inflicts them. These are some of the leading
                    arguments which have been advanced in defence of the Declaration of Paris, and
                    which no doubt actuated the authors of it.</p>
                <p>A full account of the controversy will be found in the third volume of Sir Robert
                    Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on International Law,</hi> where the
                    learned author supports and advocates the old traditions of the Court of
                    Admiralty, and also in Hall’s <hi rend="italic">Rights and Duties of
                    Neutrals</hi> (1874). The principles on which the Declaration of Paris is based
                    are explained and defended in an article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review,</hi> No. 296. (H. R.)</p>
