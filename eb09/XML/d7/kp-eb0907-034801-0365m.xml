                    name by which he is known indicates his short stature. He was placed, when
                    young, under the tuition of Denis Calvart; but having been treated with great
                    severity by that master, he left him, and became a pupil in the academy of the
                    Caracci, under Agostino. Towards thebeginning of the 17th century he went to
                    Rome, at the invitation of his fellow-pupil and intimate Albano, and prosecuted
                    his studies under Annibale Caracci. The faculty of Domenichino was slow in its
                    development. He was at first timid and distrustful of his powers; while his
                    studious, unready, and reserved manners were misunderstood by his companions for
                    dulness, and he obtained the nickname of “the Ox” (Bue). But Annibale Caracci,
                    who observed his faculties with more attention, predicted, that the apparent
                    slowness of Domenichino’s genius would in time produce what would bo an honour
                    to the art of painting. When his early productions had brought him into notice,
                    he studied with extreme application, and made such advance as to raise his works
                    into a comparison with those of the most admired masters of the time. From his
                    acting as a continual censor of his own works, he became distinguished amongst
                    his fellow-pupils as an accurate and expressive designer; his colours were the
                    truest to nature; Mengs, indeed, found nothing to desire in his works, except a
                    somewhat larger proportion of elegance. That he might devote his whole powers to
                    the art, Domenichino shunned all society; or, if he occasionally sought it in
                    the public theatres and walks, it was in order better to observe the play of the
                    passions in the features of the people—those of joy, anger, grief, terror, and
                    every affection of the mind—and to commit them vividly to his tablets; thus,
                    says Bellori, it was that he succeeded in delineating the soul, in colouring
                    life, and calling forth heartfelt emotions, at which all his works aim. In
                    personal character he is credited with temperance and modesty; but, besides his
                    want of sociability, he became somewhat suspicious, and jealous of his
                    master.</p>
                <p>In Rome, Domenichino obtained employment from Cardinals Borghese, Farnese, and
                    Aldobrandi, for all of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0366-0349"/> whom he painted works in fresco. The
                    distinguished reputation which he had acquired excited the envy of some of his
                    contemporaries. Lanfranco in particular, one of his most inveterate enemies,
                    asserted that his celebrated Communion of St Jerome (painted for the church of
                    La Carità towards 1614, for a pittance of about ten guineas, now in the Vatican
                    Gallery, and ordinarily, but most irrationally, spoken of as the second or third
                    best oil picture in the world) was an imitation from Agostino Caracci; and he
                    procured an engraving of this master’s picture of the same subject (now in the
                    Gallery of Bologna), copies of which were circulated for the purpose of showing
                    up Domenichino as a plagiarist. There is in truth a very considerable
                    resemblance between the two compositions. The pictures which Zampieri painted
                    immediately afterwards, representing subjects from the life of St Cecilia, only
                    increased the alarm of his competitors, and redoubled their injustice and
                    malignity. Disgusted with these cabals, he left Rome for Bologna, where he
                    remained until he was recalled by Pope Gregory XV., who appointed him principal
                    painter and architect to the pontifical palace. In this architectural post he
                    seems to have done little or nothing, although he was not inexpert in the art.
                    He designed in great part the Villa di Belvedere at Frascati, and the whole of
                    the Villa Ludovisi, and some other edifices. From 1630 onwards Domenichino was
                    engaged in Naples, chiefly on a series of frescoes (never wholly completed) of
                    the life of St Januarius in the Cappella del Tesoro. He settled in that city
                    with his family, and opened a school. There the persecution against him became
                    far more shameful than in any previous instance. The notorious so-called “Cabal
                    of Naples ”— the painters Corenzio, Ribera, and Caracciolo,—leagued together as
                    they were to exclude all alien competition, plagued and decried the Bolognese
                    artist in all possible ways; <hi rend="italic">for</hi> instance, on returning
                    in the morning to his fresco-work, he would find not unfrequently that some one
                    had rubbed out the performance of the previous day. Perpetual worry is believed
                    to have brought the life of Domenichino to a close; contemporary suspicion did
                    not scruple to speak broadly of poison, but this has remained unconfirmed. He
                    died in Naples, after two days’ illness, on 15th April 1641.</p>
                <p>Domenichino, in correctness of design, expression of the passions, and simplicity
                    and variety in the airs of his heads, has been considered little inferior to
                    Raphael; but in fact there is the greatest gulf fixed between the two. Critics
                    of the last century adulated the Bolognese beyond all reason or toleration; he
                    is now regarded as commonplace in mind and invention, lacking any innate
                    ideality, though undoubtedly a forcible, resolute, and learned executant. “We
                    must,” says Lanzi, “despair to find paintings exhibiting richer or more varied
                    draperies, details of costume more beautifully adapted, or more majestic
                    mantles. The figures are finely disposed both in place and action, conducing to
                    the general effect; whilst a light pervades the whole which seems to rejoice the
                    spirit, growing brighter and brighter in the aspect of the best countenances,
                    whence they first attract the eye and heart of the beholder. The persons
                    delineated could not tell their tale to the ear more plainly than they speak it
                    to the eye. The Scourging of St Andrew, which he executed in competition with
                    Guido at Rome [a fresco in the church of San Gregorio], is a powerful
                    illustration of this truthful expression. Of the two works of these masters,
                    Annibale Caracci preferred that of Domenichino. It is said that in painting one
                    of the executioners the artist actually wrought himself into a passion, using
                    threatening words and actions, and that Annibale Caracci, surprising him at that
                    moment, embraced him, exclaiming with joy, ‘ To-day, my dear Domenichino, thou
                    art teaching me.’ So novel, and at the same time so natural, it appeared to him
                    that the artist, like the orator, should feel within himself all that he is
                    representing to others.” Domenichino is esteemed the most distinguished disciple
                    of the Caracci, or second only to Guido. Algarotti preferred him to the greatest
                    masters; and Nicolo Poussin considered the painter of the Communion of St Jerome
                    to be the first after Raphael. His pictures of Adam and Eve, and the Martyrdom
                    of St Agnes, in the Gallery of Bologna, are amongst his leading works. Others of
                    superior interest are his first known picture, a fresco of the Death of Adonis,
                    in the Loggia of the Giardino Farnese, Rome; the Martyrdom of St Sebastian, in
                    Santa Maria degli Angeli; the Four Evangelists, in Sant’ Andrea della Valle;
                    Diana and her Nymphs, in the Borghese Gallery; and the Assumption of the Virgin,
                    in Santa Maria di Trastevere. His portraits are also highly reputed. It is
                    admitted that in his compositions he often borrowed figures and arrangements
                    from previous painters. Domenichino was potent in fresco. He excelled also in
                    landscape painting. In that style (in which he was one of the earliest
                    practitioners) the natural elegance of his scenery, his trees, his well-broken
                    grounds, the character and expression of his figures, gained him as much public
                    admiration as any of his other performances. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.
