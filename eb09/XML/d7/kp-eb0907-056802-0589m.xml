                    the sea, in 60° 46' N. lat. and 46° 20' E. long. From its mouth, in the Gulf of
                    Archangel, the distance to the confluence of the co-tributary streams is about
                    400 miles, and to the source of the Sukhona 750 miles. The drainage area is
                    estimated at from 140,000 to 145,000 square miles. Except at the rapids the
                    current of the Dwina is comparatively slow, as the average fall per mile is only
                    9 inches. Till its union with the Viuchegda, a river which exceeds it in volume,
                    it flows for the most part in a single, well-defined, and permanent channel; but
                    below that point it often breaks up into several branches, and not unfrequently
                    alters its course. In the neighbourhood of Archangel it divides intc three
                    distinct arms, which form a regular delta; but of these that of Berezoff alone
                    is navigable for seafaring vessels, and even it is crossed by a bar at the mouth
                    with not more than 14∣ or 15∣ feet of water at full tide. Above the confluence
                    of the Viuchegda the breadth is about 1750 feet; below that point it widens out
                    to 3500; and near Archangel it attains more than three times that measure. The
                    river affords a valuable means of inland navigation. From Vologda to Archaugel
                    the ordinary passage requires from 10 to 12 days, and the return journey from 6
                    to 8 weeks. The channel is free from ice for about 174 days in the year.</p>

                    belongs to the Baltic basin, and takes its rise in a small lake about 800 feet
                    above the level of the sea, in the government of Tver, not far from the sources
                    of the Volga and the Dnieper. In its whole course of about 600 miles it waters
                    the seven governments of Tver, Pskoff, Vitebsk, Mogileff, Vilna, Curland, and
                    Livonia; and it is calculated that it drains an area of about 65,000 square
                    miles. From Dünaburg to Riga, a distance of 204 miles, there is altogether a
                    fall of 295 feet, of which 105 are in the 46∣ miles from Jakobstadt to
                    Friedrichstadt. In the lower part of its course the river attains an ordinary
                    depth of 30 feet, and an average breadth of 1400 feet; but during the spring
                    flood it sometimes rises 14 feet above its usual level, and extends its waters
                    for about a mile. The inundation lasts at Riga from two to ten days. Near the
                    mouth the river is usually free from ice 245 days in the year, and in the
                    government of Vitebsk for 229. It is navigable from the confluence of the Mezha
                    downwards, but the number of rapids and shallows greatly diminishes its value.
                    No fewer than 62 of the former are counted below Jakobstadt, and among these are
                    some of the most dangerous of all. The passage to Riga from Velish usually takes
                    thirteen days, from Disna seven, from Dünaburg four, from Friedrichstadt one.
                    Navigation can also be carried on by the following tributaries of the Dw’ina—the
                    Toropa, the Usviat, the Mezha and Obshei, the Kasplia, the Ulla, and the
                    Bolder-aa. By Ptolemy and Marcian of Heraclea the river is mentioned as the
                    Rhubon or Rhudon; at a later date it is called the Khezin or Turunt, and till
                    the present day has the name of Polot among the White Russians. The modern
                    designation is said to be due to the Schleswig and Bremen sailors, who were
                    struck by the sandstone hills at the mouth of the river.</p>
