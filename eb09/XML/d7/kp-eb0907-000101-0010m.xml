                    appointment of the seven Hellenic deacons (Acts vi.) we learn that their duty
                    under the apostles was simply to distribute alms from the public fund. In the
                    early church, however, they soon came to discharge higher functions. They
                    assisted the bishop and presbyter in the service of the sanctuary; in the
                    administration of the Eucharist they handed the elements to the people; they
                    instructed the catechumens, and in some cases baptized; and the archdeacons came
                    to exercise in the 6th century the judicial power of the bishop over the
                    inferior clergy.</p>
                <p>In the Church of England the form of ordaining deacons declares that it is their
                    office to assist the priest in the dis-tιibution of the holy communion; in
                    which, agreeably to the practice of the ancient church, they are confined to the
                    administering of the wine to the communicants. A deacon in England is not
                    capable of holding any benefice, yet he may officiate as a private chaplain, as
                    curate to a beneficed clergyman, or as lecturer in a parish church. He may be
                    ordained at twenty-three years of age, <hi rend="italic">anno</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">currente</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it is expressly provided
                    that the bishop shall not ordain the same person a priest and deacon on the same
                    day. In Presbyterian churches, as in apostolic times, the deacons have charge
                    only of the pecuniary affairs of the congregation. In the Roman Catholic Church
                    it is the deacon’s office to incense the officiating priest or prelate; to lay
                    the corporal on the altar; to receive the paten or cup from the subdeacon, and
                    present it to the person officiating; to incense the choir; to receive the pix
                    from the officiating prelate, and to carry it to the subdeacon; and at a
                    pontifical mass, when the archbishop gives the blessing, to put the mitre on his
                    head, and to take off the archiépiscopal pall and lay it on the altar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Deaconess.—</hi> This was the title of a ministry to which
                    women were appointed in the early church, whose duty it was to perform certain
                    functions towards female catechumens during the ceremony of baptism by
                    immersion, which could not so well be performed by the deacons. Their age was at
                    first fixed at sixty years, but it was afterwards reduced to forty years, and no
                    married woman was eligible to the office. Abuses gradually became prevalent
                    amongst the deaconesses, which led to the suppression of their ministry in the
                    Latin church in the 6th century. The office was abolished in the Greek church in
                    the 12th century.</p>
