                    southwestern coast. In British times, previous to the landing of Caesar, it was
                    inhabited by a tribe which Ptolemy calls the Durotriges, and which, upon no good
                    authority, but not without probability, has been identified with the Morini, the
                    occupants of a part of the opposite coast <hi rend="italic">(extremi hominum
                    Morini,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> viii. 727), the two appellations being
                    apparently of similar import, and referring to their location on the sea-shore.
                    Under the Romans this county constituted a portion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Prima;</hi> and the Saxons called it Dornsaeta,
                    or Dorsaeta (a word involving the same root, Dwr, water), and included it in the
                    kingdom of Wessex.</p>
                <p>On the north Dorsetshire is bounded by Somersetshire and Wiltshire, on the east
                    by Hampshire, on the west by Devonshire and a part of Somersetshire, whilst the
                    British Channel washes the whole of its southern coast. Its form is very
                    irregular; the northern boundary has a considerable angular projection in the
                    middle; its southern coast runs out into various points and headlands; and the
                    western inclines towards Devonshire with an uneven line. Its greatest breadth
                    from north to south is about 35 miles, and its length from east to west 55. Its
                    circumference, including 627,265 acres, is nearly 160 miles. In 1871 the
                    population was found to be 195,537,—having increased from 114,452 in 1801 and
                    175,054 in 1841. 111,731 acres were under corn-crops, and 60,633 under
                    green-crops. The males numbered 95,616, the females 99,921</p>
                <p>Dorset is divided into 35 hundreds, containing more than 300 parishes, 8
                    boroughs, 22 liberties, and 12 market towns, the principal of which are
                    Dorchester, Bridport, Sherborne, Lyme-Regis, Shaftesbury, Weymouth and
                    Melcombe-Regis, Poole, and Blandford. Only 10 members are returned to
                    parliament, instead of 20 as before the first Reform Act. The county itself
                    sends three; Dorchester, Bridport, Poole, Shaftesbury, and Wareham one each, and
                    Melcombe-Regis and Weymouth two between them. Dorsetshire forms a part of the
                    see of Salisbury. It originally fell under the wide jurisdiction of the ancient
                    sees of Dorchester in Oxfordshire and of Winchester, till the foundation of the
                    bishopric of Sherborne, 705 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and when that see
                    was transferred to Salisbury it still remained a part of it, till in 31st Henry
                    VIII. it was annexed to the newly-erected bishopric of Bristol, and so continued
                    till 1836, when its ancient connection with Salisbury was revived, and still
                    continues.</p>
                <p>Branches of the London and South-Western Railway, or in connection with it, enter
                    the county from Southampton, Salisbury, and Bath, meet near Wimborne, and
                    continue to Poole, Wareham, Dorchester, and Weymouth, which last two places are
                    also reached by a branch of the GreatWestern from Yeovil, with a drop-line to
                    Bridport at Maiden-Newton. The main line of the London and SouthWestern likewise
                    touches the north of the county near Shaftesbury, Gillingham, and Sherborne.</p>
                <p>The surface of Dorsetshire is hilly and uneven. Throwing out for the present the
                    consideration of the coast-line in Purbeck, Portland, and to the westward, and
                    proceeding in the direction of from S.E., to N.W., we find a descending series
                    of formations, commencing from the Tertiaries, which occupy an almost
                    equilateral triangle, and include the towns of Wareham, Poole, Wimborne, and
                    Cranborne; passing through a band of Chalk some ten or twelve miles in breadth,
                    in which the chief town Dorchester and Blandford are situated, and which is
                    fringed by a thin belt of Greensand; and thence to the Oolitic beds in the
                    north-east, and the Lias at Bridport and the south-west. The three systems thus
                    roughly indicated have been popularly divided into the Sands, the Chalks, and
                    the Clays. It is, of course, the last which has won for this county the somewhat
                    exaggerated, and not uncontested, designation of “the garden of England;” though
                    the rich wide vale of Blackmore, atd the luxuriant pastures and orchards of the
                    extreme wett may fairly support the claim. The Downs of the Chalk district,
                    formerly so celebrated as sheep-walks, have been rapidly disappearing of late
                    years under the influence of a more scientific system of agriculture, though
                    still the stock of sheep pastured in the county amounts to between 500,000 and
                    600,000. Even in the sandy region, cultivation is advancing, and detached
                    portions are improved, though there is still much waste land, dreary and barren,
                    hardly supporting, even in the summer months, a few sheep and cattle, and
                    supplying the scattered cottars with heath and turf for fuel.</p>
                <p>Dorsetshire is not generally speaking a well-wooded county, though much fine
                    timber may be seen, not only i∏ the richer and deeper soils, but likewise in the
                    sheltered valleys of the Chalk district, and more especially upon the Greensand.
                    The views from some of the higher hills, which constitute, as it were, the
                    back-bone of the county, are often vastly extensive, ranging on many points from
                    the Needles to the very utmost limit of the Mendip and Quantock Hills, where
                    they sink into the Bristol Channel.</p>
                <p>The Dorsetshire air is remarkably mild and salubrious, and in some sunnier spots
                    of the coast, such as Abbotsbury, even tropical plants are found to flourish.
                    Weymouth has long been celebrated as a watering-place, and owing to the general
                    calmness of the sea there, its pleasant situation, and commodiousness for
                    bathing, it still maintains considerable consequence. The sea-side villages of
                    Swanage, Lulworth, and Charmouth also, though more difficult of access, and
                    affording less accommodation for visitors, abound with many quiet and enjoyable
                    charms.</p>
                <p>The chief port of the county is Poole, situated on an estuary formed by the mouth
                    of the Frome. Its entrance is defended by Brownsea Castle,—not, however, a
                    military <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0390-0371"/> fortress, but simply a castellated mansion,—and
                    it is very secure in all winds. It was formerly the chief place for equipping
                    ships for the Newfoundland fishery; and a brisk trade was carried on from it
                    with Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean; but it is now chiefly occupied with
                    a coasting trade, and the export of potters’ clay. Swanage, Weymouth, Bridport,
                    and Lyme have harbours capable of admitting small vessels only. The magnificent
                    breakwater at Portland, of which the first stone was laid by Prince Albert in
                    1849, provides a harbour of refuge which is nearly land-locked, and a secure
                    anchorage of almost unlimited extent, and of easy access to the largest class of
                    vessels.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Dorsetshire are the Frome, the Stour, the Piddle, and the
                    Ivel. The Frome rises in the north-western part of the county, near Evershot,
                    and passing by Dorchester, reaches Poole, and falls into its bay. The Stour
                    enters this county from Wiltshire, near Gillingham, and, pursuing a southern and
                    south-eastern direction, enters Hampshire. The Piddle rises in the north, and,
                    flowing to the south-east, falls into Poole Bay. The Ivel, anciently the Yeo,
                    has its origin from several springs near Horethorn, in a hill north-east from
                    Sherborne, from which town it flows into Somersetshire, and falls into the
                    Parret, near Yeovil.</p>
                <p>Although neither coal nor any metallic ores have ever been found in Dorsetshire,
                    the stone quarries of Purbeck and Portland have long been celebrated. Purbeck,
                    though called an island, is more properly a peninsula, of an irregular oval
                    form, about twelve miles in length and seven in breadth. It consists, according
                    to Mantell, of Cretaceous, Wealden, and Oolitic strata in their regular order of
                    succession, and highly inclined in their section towards Swanage Bay, where they
                    are easily detected. At Handfast Point the chalk is discovered, its lower
                    division dipping at a considerable angle; then comes a layer of firestone, next
                    gault, and then greensand—all inclined; then, at Swanage Bay, a thick wealden
                    bed; to the south of which are the Purbeck Hills, with their peculiar strata,
                    and, a little further on, the Portland Oolite. The soil is altogether
                    calcareous, and for the most part a continuous mass of either white or a
                    brownish limestone, the latter having a mixture of seashells. The quarries on
                    the south side of the isle afford an inexhaustible fund of natural curiosities.
                    The best quarries are at Kingston, Worth, Langton, and Swanage. The Swanage
                    stone is white, full of shells, takes a polish, and looks like alabaster. All
                    over the heaths, both here and on the mainland, blocks of indurated Tertiary
                    grit, commonly called firestone, are found, and have been occasionally employed
                    in the building of some of the neighbouring churches; and at Downshay and Quar,
                    in the parish of Worth, and elsewhere, the beautiful Purbeck marble, so
                    conspicuous in the monuments and shafts of many of our cathedrals and finest
                    churches of the 13th century, and now often sought for their restoration, has
                    been extensively quarried. One of the most valuable products of Purbeck is a
                    white clay used for making pipes, and very largely applied to the manufacture of
                    china. Large quantities of it are dug, and many vessels loaded with it for
                    Staffordshire in the port of Poole.</p>
                <p>The Isle of Portland, as it is called, is also a peninsula, rising at its highest
                    point, the Verne, to nearly 500 feet above the sea-level, and sloping gradually
                    to near the water’s edge at its extreme southerly point, the Bill. Its famous
                    quarries, about 100 in number, are scattered in all directions under heaps of
                    rubble and unsaleable stone. They are Crown-property, and, except where the
                    stone is taken for Government purposes, are leased to various firms, who pay a
                    royalty of so much per ton. Some 50,000 tons are annually raised and exported.
                    The stratum of stone that is worked for sale lies nearly parallel with the upper
                    surface of the island, and without much earth or rubbish on it. The Portland
                    stone (or freestone as it is sometimes called) is well known for its almost
                    white colour, and as composing the materials of the most splendid, erections in
                    London, as well as in other parts of the British empire. The connection of
                    Portland with the mainland occurs at some 10 or 11 miles’ distance, at
                    Abbotsbury, where a most remarkable beach of raised shingle, called the Chesil
                    (Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Ceosol)</hi> or Pebble Beach, touches the shore,
                    being thus far separated from it by a narrow estuary, famous for its swannery,
                    called the Fleet.</p>
                <p>The entire length of the beach is from 16 to 18 miles, with an average height of
                    about 40 feet, and a breadth of some 180 or 190 yards, the pebbles constantly
                    decreasing in size from 1 to 3 inches in diameter at Portland, to the size of
                    peas at its termination.</p>
                <p>Agriculture throughout the county has made very important advances within the
                    last few years,—steamcultivation and improved implements having been largely
                    introduced, and the growth of root-crops abundantly stimulated by the use of
                    artificial manures. The precarious crops of flax and hemp for the supply of the
                    rope and twine works of Bridport are less cultivated than formerly. On the
                    larger farms in the Chalk district a peculiar custom prevails of under-letting
                    the dairies at so much per cow, the farmer finding the stock and the food, and
                    the dairyman disposing of the produce. The horned sheep of Dorsetshire, long
                    celebrated, have now become established as a useful and lucrative breed.
                    Professor Bell, in his <hi rend="italic">History of British Quadrupeds,</hi>
                    gives a figure of this, as the typical English sheep, of “a handsome, though
                    somewhat old-fashioned breed, principally esteemed for its producing lambs
                    earlier perhaps than any other in this country.” “To the eye of him who seeks
                    for beauty in harmony and propro-tion (he adds) this sheep is one of the
                    handsomest in any part of England. The strong well-formed body and limbs, the
                    clear white fleece, the finely-curved horns, and other points will to him
                    constitute a more pleasing combination of character than is to be found in those
                    breeds which have become more changed from the old stock by repeated
                    transmission of peculiarities, which, however advantageous to the breeder,
                    whether for the sake of the fleece or the flesh, cannot be considered as adding
                    to the abstract beauty of the animal.” There are still many fine flocks of this
                    characteristic breed existing in the county, though many farmers prefer the
                    Southdowns or Hampshires, as better adapted to their particular holdings. There
                    is a small breed in Portland, which fattens too highly upon richer pastures, but
                    the mutton of which is an especial dainty, weighing only about 8 δ&gt; a
                    quarter.</p>
                <p>The old hardy race of long-horned cattle, formerly common in the hilly districts,
                    are fast disappearing, and Devons, short-horns, and Herefords are almost
                    exclusively now bred. Great quantities of butter are sent to the London market.
                    The skimmed-milk cheese is often much esteemed, though little of it is exported
                    from the county.</p>
                <p>Vast numbers of mackerel are taken near Abbotsbury, and along the shore from
                    Portland to Bridport. The season for taking them is from the middle of March
                    till midsummer, in nets or seines.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Dorsetshire are not extensive. The principal are those of
                    flax and hemp in the neighbourhood of Bridport and Beaminster, and of pottery
                    and tiles in the district near Poole. Net-making, or braiding as it is called,
                    and also gloving, are carried on in some of the villages; but the manufactures
                    of lace, and of threadbuttons, formerly flourishing at Blandford and elsewhere,
                    may be said to be now entirely obsolete. At Sherborne these industries have been
                    succeeded by extensive silk-mills.</p>

                <p>Few, if any, parts of England possess a more abundant treasure of prehistoric
                    remains, than are to bθ found throughout this county, though the march of
                    agricultural progress inevitably tends to their obliteration. Vestiges of
                    peaceful British occupation may constantly be traced on those portions of the
                    Downs which are still uninclosed, whilst a series of magnificent hill-forts
                    crown all the most prominent heights, and probably served as camps of refuge for
                    the harassed tribes and their cattle in times of war and invasion. The grandest
                    of these, called Maidun Castle, is supposed to be the Dumum of Ptolemy, the
                    stronghold or Acropolis of the Durotriges, whose gigantic ramparts may be seen
                    outlined against the sky between the Weymouth and Bridport roads, about two
                    miles south from Dorchester. Its inner area covers about 44 acres, its outer
                    area about 116, the difference being absorbed in its stupendous double, and
                    sometimes triple, entrenchments, some 60 feet high, and extraordinarily steep.
                    Other grand examples of these hillfortresses may be seen at Eggardun and Pilsdun
                    to the westward, at Chalbury and Flowers-barrow to the eastward, and at
                    Rawlsbury, or Bulbarrow, Hod (inclosing an equilateral Roman camp), and
                    Hameldun, overlooking the valley of the Stour, and at Badbury, Woodbury,
                    &amp;c., in the more central parts of the county. It has been conjectured with
                    great probability that some of these last were among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >oppida</hi> subdued in the expedition of Vespasian; and it is not unlikely that
                    in that remarkable chain of <hi rend="italic">tumuli,</hi> or barrows, which are
                    visible along the crest of the Ridgeway, now tunnelled for the lines of railroad
                    which connect Weymouth and Dorchester, may have been deposited the ashes of
                    certain nameless heroes who fought the battles either of invasion or resistance.
                    Such barrows are widely distributed elsewhere through the county, and when
                    opened have usually been found to contain little more than burnt bones, corroded
                    metal, and rude cinerary αrns, with occasional marks of subsequent Roman
                    interments. A few monoliths, cromlechs, and stone circles have also been
                    recorded.</p>
                <p>Of the period of Roman occupation many relics exist. The <hi rend="italic">Via
                    Iceniana,</hi> or Icknield Street, with various vicinal off-shoots, passes
                    through the centre of the county, and connects its chief town Dorchester, or
                    Durnovaria, with Old Sarum and Exeter. An indisputable though scanty fragment of
                    the Roman wall of Dorchester still exists; and the avenues, called the walks,
                    which surround the town appear to follow its ancient course, the trees being
                    planted sometimes on the <hi rend="italic">agger</hi> and sometimes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">vallum.</hi> A tesselated pavement, some 20 feet square, w as
                    exhumed in 1858 in the grounds of the county prison, and is preserved in its
                    chapel; and various fragments of a similar character, as well as many coins of
                    the later emperors, and other metallic and fictile antiquities, have been and
                    still are not unfrequently brought to light, wherever the ground is disturbed.
                    Roman pavements have been found elsewhere,— one at Rampisham in 1799, one at
                    Frampton of unusual size and beauty in 1794, and others at Weymouth, Sherborne,
                    Dewlish, &amp;c. The amphitheatre, near the Dorchester railway station, has been
                    generally attributed to the time of Agricola, and constructed very probably for
                    the amusement of the Roman soldiers by the enforced labour of their captives. It
                    is more perfect than any other remaining in this country, and has been
                    calculated to suffice for nearly 13,000 spectators. The Roman stations in
                    Dorsetshire which antiquarians pretty nearly agree in identifying are <hi
                    rend="italic">Landinis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Londinis,</hi> Lyme Regis; <hi
                    rend="italic">Canca-Arixa,</hi> Charmouth; <hi rend="italic">Durnovaria,</hi>
                    Dorchester; <hi rend="italic">Clavinio,</hi> Weymouth, or a place in the
                    immediate neighbourhood; <hi rend="italic">Morinio,</hi> Wareham, or Hamworthy;
                    <hi rend="italic">Bolvelaunio,</hi> Poole; <hi rend="italic">Bindogladia,</hi>
                    Wimborne, or (Sir R. C. Hoare) Gussage Cowdown; <hi rend="italic">Ibernio,</hi>
                    Bere. Of mediaeval castles no considerable remains exist, except at Corfe and
                    Sherborne, both of them brought to ruin in the great Civil War, but both
                    retaining picturesque and highly interesting traces of their former
                    magnificence.</p>
                <p>The three principal churches of the county are the abbeychurch of Sherborne, a
                    rich specimenof Third Pointed architecture, restored in recent years at immense
                    cost, and with admirable taste; Wimborne Minster, with its two stately towers of
                    different periods and its massive Norman nave; and the noble but unfinished
                    abbey-church of Milton, now also carefully restored, and presenting some rich
                    examples of the Decorated period. Besides these, there are noticeable churches
                    at Bere-Regis, Dorchester (St Peter’s), and Fordington, Maiden-Newton,
                    Piddletrenthide, Cerne, Beaminster. Powerstock, &amp;c.; but, generally
                    speaking, the ecclesiastical buildings of the county, though not uninteresting,
                    cannot boast of special grandeur or beauty.</p>
                <p>At Milton abbey, originally founded by King Athelstan, and also at Forde-Abbey,
                    handsome portions of the monastic buildings are incorporated in the modern
                    mansions; and there are monastic remains of varying interest at Cerne,
                    Abbotsbury, Bindon, and elsewhere. At Sherborne some of the conventual buildings
                    are to be traced within the precincts of the flourishing grammar school.</p>
                <p>The dialect of the county, perfectly distinguishable from those of Wiltshire and
                    Somersetshire, yet bearing many common marks of its Saxon origin, has been
                    admirably illustrated, both philologically and poetically, by a living author,
                    the Rev. Wm. Barnes, whose poems in the vernacular have won the eulogium of
                    several eminent critics, whilst their Doric simplicity and tenderness and truth
                    is heartily appreciated by high and low in the county.</p>
                <p>This county has afforded titles to various noble families, besides the dukes and
                    earls of Dorset, duke of Portland to that of Bentinck, earl of Dorchester to
                    that of Darner, Shaftesbury to that of Ashley-Cooper, Viscount Bridport to that
                    of Hood, Baron Melcombe to Bubb-Dodington; whilst Blandford, Weymouth,
                    Woodsford, Encombe, &amp;c., are swallowed in the higher titles of their noble
                    possessors.</p>
                <p>Amongst its more eminent natives may be reckoned Cardinal Morton, Archbishops
                    Stafford and Wake, Bishops Sprat and Stillingfleet, Matthew Prior, Sir George
                    Summers, Sir James Thornhill, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The county rates have been recently assessed on an annual income of
                    £1,095,736.</p>
                <p>A curious ancient <hi rend="italic">Survey</hi> of the county was written by a
                    Rev. Mr Coker, about the middle of the 17th century, and published from his MS.
                    in 1732. In 1774 a very valuable <hi rend="italic">Coτιnty</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> appeared, by the Rev. John Hutchins, in 2 vols, folio; a second
                    edition in <hi rend="italic">4</hi> vols, folio, in 1803; and a third, greatly
                    improved, and brought down to the present date, also in 4 vols, folio, in 1874.
                    No other county in England, perhaps, possesses so full and accurate a
                    topographical and genealogical survey as this. The antiquities oí the county
                    have likewise been satisfactorily elucidated in various publications by Mr
                    Sydenham, Mr C. Warne, F.S.A., Dr Wake Smart, and others. (C. W. B.)</p>
