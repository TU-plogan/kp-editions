                    derivation of the word points to <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> influence
                    communicated through the soothsayer, much as the equivalent Greek term <hi
                    rend="italic">mantike</hi> refers to the utterances of the spiritually inspired
                    or possessed seer, <hi rend="italic">mantis.</hi> It is well seen from Cicero’s
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divinatione</hi> that in
                    classic times theology not only included in its system all revelation by
                    oracles, which clearly belongs to it, but also claimed possession of a variety
                    of diviner’s arts, such as augury and astrology, on the ground that their signs
                    were sent by the gods. On the side of the Stoics, it is there argued that if
                    divination is a real art, then there must be gods who gave it to mankind, which
                    proposition is met by the counter-suggestions that signs of future events may be
                    given by nature without any god, or that there may be gods and yet they not have
                    bestowed on man any such art as divination. The real point of the relation of
                    divination to religion is touched in the division of it into two kinds, <hi
                    rend="italic">—artificial divination,</hi> by haruspicatιon, prodigies,
                    lightning, augury, astrology, and lots, as contrasted with <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural divination,</hi> by dreams and prophetic oracles. On a general survey
                    of such arts among mankind, it appears that oracles, &amp;c., being taken as
                    revelations made directly by spiritual beings, fall to be considered under
                    headings treating of religion (see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Demonology);</hi> but divining by such signs as the flight of
                    birds or the falling of lots does not necessarily depend on the notion of
                    intervening demons or deities. One part of its position is well stated in the
                    argument by which Cicero makes his Stoic defend it :—If frogs by croaking, and
                    oxen by snuffing the air, can give us signs to foretell the weather, why should
                    there not be omens in the fibres of a victim’s entrails, or in thunderstorms 1
                    But the religious view which regards omens as divine signs seems to have been
                    from very early ages blended with the naturalistic view, so that in a great part
                    of the cases it is impossible to disentangle them, or even to say which is the
                    original one. This will appear in the following brief summary of the principal
                    methods of divination. Now that the diviner’s art has all but perished, we
                    moderns are able to look back upon its history, to see how its futile
                    proceedings were suggested by mistaken analogy, and how the experience of ages,
                    which ratifies true inferences and destroys false fancies, is now reducing them
                    to curious antiquarian relics.</p>
                <p>The various “artificial” modes of divination for the most part rest evidently on
                    the association of ideas in analogy and symbolism (see evidence in Tylor, <hi
                    rend="italic">Early Hist, of Mankind,</hi> p. 132; <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                    Culture,</hi> vol. i. p. 117, &amp;c., 78.) A tree planted at a child’s birth,
                    or any other plant mentally associated with a person, gives a sign by its
                    flourishing or withering as to that person’s health or death (Ploss, <hi
                    rend="italic">Das Kind,</hi> vol. i. p. 71.) So with the sticks set up by
                    Polynesians to see if the warriors they stand for will fall in battle, or with
                    the cocoa-nut that is spun like a teetotum to point out a thief (Polack, <hi
                    rend="italic">New Zealanders,</hi> vol. ι. p. 270; Mariner’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tonga Islands,</hi> ch. xx.) This kind of fanciful association appears in <hi
                    rend="italic">sortilege,</hi> or casting of lots, a proceeding remarkable not
                    only for its antiquity but for the frequency with which religions have adopted
                    it as a means of obtaining divine guidance, from the ages when classic poets
                    sang of Homeric heroes praying to the gods when they cast lots in Agamemnon’s
                    leather cap, or of Mopsus the soothsayer divining with sacred lots when the
                    Argonauts embarked on their voyage (Homer, <hi rend="italic">Il.,</hi> vii. 175;
                    Pindar, <hi rend="italic">Pyth.,</hi> iv. 338), and on until modern times, when
                    the Moravians still resorted to solemn religious lots to determine difficult
                    questions, such as the choice of wives. Dice or astragali (huckleb∩nes) have
                    been used for the pur poses of sortilege (see Suetonius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tiberius)</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">cartomancy,</hi> or fortune-telling by
                    means of playing-cards, is still common. In ancient times omens were drawn from
                    poets’ verses, fixed on by chance, a practice well known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sortes</hi><hi rend="italic">Virgïlianae,</hi> from Virgil being often so
                    consulted (see Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Die. Gr. and Rom.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiq.,</hi> art. “Sortes ”); and the Bible came ’ to be afterwards so used for
                    drawing texts, or “pricking for texts;” this practice is still very usual in
                    Germany (see Wuttke, <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Volksaberglaube,</hi> 2 ed., p. 227.) The <hi rend="italic">haruspication,</hi>
                    or examination of entrails, by which Roman statesmen were (or pretended to be)
                    guided in public affairs (see Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Div.,</hi> ii. 12;
                    Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> xi. 73); and <hi
                    rend="italic">scapulimancy,</hi> or the Tatar mode of divining by the cracks and
                    lines in a shoulder blade (Lubbock, <hi rend="italic">Origin of
                    Civilization,</hi> p. 230), formerly known in England as “reading the
                    speal-bone” (Brand, <hi rend="italic">Popular Antiquities,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    339), depended on imaginary symbolic associatiens, such as that cracks in
                    opposite directions meant good and ill fortune, that the course of particular
                    lines indicated the course of the consulter’s life, &amp;c. This sort of falsa
                    analogy may be well understood by any one who will have the similar art of <hi
                    rend="italic">palmistry,</hi> or divining by the lines of the hand, applied to
                    his own future by a fortune-teller at a fair. Omens obtained by <hi
                    rend="italic">augury,</hi> or divining by the sight and cries of animals,
                    especially birds (as the name indicates), are as familiar among uncivilized
                    races as they were in ancient Rome; their symbolism is apparent in such rules as
                    that a hawk means victory, an owl’s hoot is unlucky, and that a beast or bird on
                    the right hand portends good, but on the left hand evil (Tylor, <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">C.,</hi> vol. i. p. 119). Another class
                    of arts depend on the unconscious or halfconscious action of some person, often
                    the diviner himself. Among these is the use of the well-known diviningrod, which
                    when held in the hands, dips to indicate a hidden spring of water, a vein of
                    ore, or a buried treasure (Brand, vol. iii. p. 332; see Chevreul, <hi
                    rend="italic">De la Baguette</hi><hi rend="italic">Divinatoire,</hi> &amp;c.)
                    The use of this instrument remains in some districts of England; it is locally
                    known as “dowsing,” whence no doubt the name of Dousterswivel in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Antiquary.</hi> Similar in principle is the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">coscinomancy.</hi> or divining by a sieve held suspended, and
                    giving its indications by turning. In later times this gave place to the ordeal
                    by the Bible and key, where the book is suspended by a key tied in with its
                    wards between the leaves and the key supported on two persons’ forefingers, and
                    the whole turns round to prove guilty some servant maid accused of theft (Brand,
                    vol. iii. p. 351). In such cases, where the culprits’ fears are apt to betray
                    them, the process of divination really serves as a practical test. Dreams are
                    not only considered visits from ghosts, but often also as supernatural signs to
                    be interpreted symbolically, as when a Kamtschatkan dreaming of dogs or lice
                    would take it as foretelling a visit from Russians (Steller, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kamtschatka,</hi> p. 279). Of such interpretations the ancient art of <hi
                    rend="italic">oneiromancy</hi> consists, as may be seen in such rules as that if
                    a woman dreams of kindling a fire, she will bear a male child'; if one dreams of
                    white clouds it means joy, but if black clouds trouble (Brand, vol. iii. p. 132;
                    Tylor, Z.c.). It remains to mention in few words <hi rend="italic"
                    >astrology,</hi> the branch of divination whose importance <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n311/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0311-0294"/> in the world has exceeded that of all the rest
                    together. Researches into the ancient writings of Chaldaea have now shown how
                    fully historians were justified in treating that country as the principal among
                    the sources whence the stargazers received their precepts (see Sayce, “Astronomy
                    and Astrology of the Babylonians,” in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Soc. Bibl.
                    Arch.,</hi> vol. iii.; Maury, <hi rend="italic">La Magie et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Astrologie.)</hi> The rules in such
                    comparatively modern works as Sibly’s <hi rend="italic">Occult Sciences</hi> and
                    Lilly’s <hi rend="italic">Astrology</hi> fairly enough represent the ancient
                    traditions, and show their still intelligible symbolism,—how the stars rising at
                    a child’s birth are made in the horoscope to typify its destiny, and the planets
                    and signs of the zodiac exercise “influences” often plainly drawn from their
                    natures or names. Thus Mars has to do with soldiers, Venus with lovers, and
                    Mercury with prattlers; the solar man is grand and generous, the lunar man
                    unsteadfast and inclined to change his dwelling, the sign Leo presides over
                    places where wild beasts abound, but Aries over pastures. At the courts of
                    Asiatic rulers, the state astrologer still nominally holds a position like that
                    of his predecessor in the ancient empires of the world, but it is evident that
                    the last twenty years have shaken, even in the barbaric East, the power of the
                    occult sciences over the human mind. . <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. b. t.)</hi></p>
