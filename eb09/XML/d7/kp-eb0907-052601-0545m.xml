                <p><label type="entry">DUMFRIES</label>, one of the three Scottish border counties,
                    lies in an elliptical form on the north side of the Solway Firth, its other
                    boundaries being Lanark, Peebles, and Selkirk on the N., Roxburgh on the E., Ayr
                    and Kirkcudbright on the W., and Cumberland on the S. Its greatest length is
                    fully 50 miles, its breadth 32, its circumference 190, and the area is 1103
                    square miles or 702,953 acres. The coast-line on the Solway measures 21 miles.
                    Towards this arm of the sea the county slopes down from a high mountain range,
                    by which it is cinctured on the north, the intermediate pace being extremely
                    irregular, lofty hills alternating with wide stretches of table land or rich
                    fertile holms, and in other instances the surface looking like a vast undulating
                    mass that by some natural process had suddenly become fixed and rigid. Among the
                    leading features of the county are the three dales by which it is cleft from
                    north to south, and through which run the rivers that give name to them, the
                    Nith, Annan, and Esk. Overlooking these rise numerous elevations, the highest
                    being Whitecoomb in the east, 2695 feet; Hartfell in the north, 2651 feet;
                    Queensberry, also in the north, 2285 feet, which gives to the duke of Buccleuch
                    his secondary title, and the title of marquis to a branch of the house of
                    Douglas; and Ettrick Pen, 2269 feet, the latter standing sentinel over an
                    extensive district.</p>
                <p>The Nith is the chief river of the county Starting from its mountain cradle near
                    Dalmellington, in Ayrshire, it takes a south-westerly sweep, watering the old
                    burgh of Sanquhar, at the head of Nithsdale, and further down the modern village
                    of Thornhill, near which stands the ducal castle of Drumlanrig. As the river
                    proceeds it passes on the one hand Dalswinton, where Patrick Miller made his
                    first fruitful experiments in steam navigation, and on the other the acres of
                    Ellisland, which Robert Burns turned over with his plough. At Auldgirth Bridge,
                    near Blackwood, the dale narrows considerably; then it expands till around and
                    below the burgh of Dumfries it appears as a spacious plain, with gentle
                    acclivities or bolder elevations rising on every side. The Nith is swelled by
                    numerous streams at various stages, its latest and largest acquisition being the
                    Cluden, the confluence taking place about a mile above Dumfries, and the
                    absorbing river reaching the Solway about eight miles below that burgh, its
                    whole course measuring about 50 miles</p>
                <p>An upland spot, where the counties of Lanark, Peebles, and Dumfries converge,
                    gives birth to three streams, according to the popular saying,</p>
                <p>“Annan, Tweed, and Clyde All arise from one hillside.”</p>
                <p>The first-named river, after a rapid canter from its hign-land source, five miles
                    above Moffat, receives several tributaries a little south of that town, then
                    proceeds at a leisurely pace down the dale, which, narrowed at first by rocks or
                    ridges, expands into a fertile basin termed “the Howe of Annandale,” studded
                    with hamlets and spangled by the nine lochs of Lochmaben,—that venerable royal
                    burgh, which claims to have been the birth-place of King Robert Bruce, and the
                    prosperous town of Lockerbie occupying conspicuous places on the western and
                    eastern banks; other rivulets, including the Dryfe (flowing past the scene of a
                    fierce clan battle fought between the Maxwells and Johnstones in 1675), giving
                    increased volume to the stream below Bruce’s burgh, the valley narrowing again
                    as the water grows wider and deeper. When little more than a mile from the sea
                    it passes Annan, the second town in the county, its entire length being nearly
                    40 miles.</p>
                <p>During about a mile of its course the Esk divides Dumfriesshire from Cumberland;
                    starting from the Selkirk shire frontier it flows southward past the baronial
                    town of Langholm, and, after being a Scottish stream to the extent of 30 miles,
                    it enters English ground, waters Longtown, describes a westward curve, and then
                    falls like its two sister streams into the Solway, its entire course extending
                    to about 40 miles.</p>
                <p>Besides the lakes in Annandale already referred to, Loch Skene, lying under the
                    shadow of Whitecoomb hill, 1300 feet above sea-level, is the only one of
                    consequence; its water finds an outlet by leaping over a rocky height of 300
                    feet, forming a cascade termed the Gray Mare’s Tail. Another small but
                    exceedingly picturesque waterfall in Morton parish is called Crichope Linn.</p>
                <p>The chief mineral waters of the county are those of the well at Moffat, and
                    another about five miles distant, called Hartfell Spa, situated in a cleft of
                    the hill from which it takes its name. The former are reckoned beneficial for
                    chronic gout, rheumatism, and liver complaints; and the latter acts as a mild
                    astringent and powerful tonic. Owing to the great repute of these waters, and
                    the romantic scenery of the surrounding district, Moffat during summer and early
                    autumn becomes a favourite and fashionable place of resort. A small chalybeate
                    at Brow, on the Solway, possesses considerable virtue, and is rendered
                    interesting from the circumstance that it was partaken of by Burns during his
                    last illness, though without avail.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking the climate is mild and salubrious, with a mean temperature of
                    45° Fahr., the average rainfall supplying sometimes more than enough of
                    moisture. The soils are chiefly gravel or sandy loam and clay, except where
                    river and estuary have formed rich alluvial tracts. At no very distant date it
                    was roughly computed that there were 86 square miles of arable land lying along
                    the sea coast, 322 miles chiefly upland, and 598 miles mountainous yielding
                    nothing but heather and game; but by the application of bone manure, draining,
                    planting, and green crop husbandry, all this is changed, no fewer than 213,784
                    acres being under the plough—even the huge expanse of Lochar moss, lying in the
                    parishes of Tinwald, Dumfries, and Torthorwald, becoming by degrees less of a
                    reproach to the agricultural enterprise of its proprietors, though much of the
                    surface of the county still wears a pastoral aspect drawn from one of its chief
                    rural industries, sheep-breeding. In 1876 there were 49,975 acres under corn
                    crops, of which 48,292 were oats and 546 wheat; 25,669 were under green crops,
                    of which 20,747 were turnips; and 63,762 were in grass under rotation. These
                    figures differ little from those for 1873, except that 1231 acres were then in
                    wheat. With abundance of coal at the two extremities—Sanquhar and Canonbie; with
                    limestone at Kilhead, Closebum, and Barjarg; with lead mines at Wanlockhead, the
                    produce of which when undergoing refinement yields a large percentage of silver;
                    with gold dust and even nuggets of that metal in the same district, but now no
                    longer searched for systematically, as they were with considerable success in
                    the 16th and 17th centuries; with sandstone quarries in various quarters; with
                    woollen mills at Langholm; with numerous manufactures centring in the county
                    town; with some little sea-borne traffic; and with good salmon fisheries in the
                    Nith, along the Carlaverock shore, and at Annan Water-Foot on the Solway,—the
                    county itself is still essentially an agricultural one, and as such it takes
                    high rank.</p>
                <p>Early in the 18th century the district breeders of Galloway cattle began to send
                    stock to the south; and, before the current century was far advanced, some
                    15,000 head of heavy cattle were annually driven from Dumfriesshire and Galloway
                    to the English markets. Forty years ago the number had increased to 20,000,
                    their value on an average being at least £200,000. For some years past Ayrshire
                    dairy cattle and shorthorns have superseded the Galloways on most farms of the
                    county, and its trade in live stock generally has considerably decreased. Few
                    store cattle are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n546/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0546-0527"/> exported, they being mostly grazed a year or two
                    and fed off; and similar treatment is given to numerous short-horn yearlings and
                    two-year-olds that are imported from Ireland. In 1876 the entire cattle in the
                    county numbered 53,778 head, the sheep 493,020, the horses 7390, the pigs
                    14,413, —these returns varying little from those of 1873, except as regards
                    sheep, which amounted that year to 513,849. The sheep trade of Dumfriesshire,
                    which is of comparatively recent origin, is now of great extent. Cheviots
                    predominate, the frugal, black-faced breed still occupying the higher sheep
                    walks, while half-bred lambs, the produce of Cheviot ewes crossed by Leicester
                    or other long-wooled rams, are fattened on the richer pasture yielded by
                    low-lying farms, supplemented by turnips in winter, and are thus made ready for
                    the butcher when fifteen months old. For nearly <hi rend="italic">a</hi> hundred
                    years pigfeeding has occupied· a place in the rural economy of the county. A sum
                    of .£50,000 represented its annual trade in pork about sixty years ago.
                    Influenced by large imports of bacon from America, the curing of carcases has of
                    late decreased. In 1876 the number sold in the public markets of the county was
                    under 8000, the value of which, allowing for those disposed off privately, would
                    not exceed £45,000; a few years back the annual value ran from £70,000 to
                    £75,000. As regards quality and flavour, the Dumfriesshire hams still maintain
                    the high character they have long held in the English markets.</p>
                <p>Three leading highways, one in each valley, with numerous branch roads, intersect
                    the county. It possesses also ample railway communication,—the Glasgow and
                    SouthWestern line, completed in 1850, extending through Nithsdale and Lower
                    Annandale, and, soon after passing Gretna Green (famous in days of yore for its
                    matrimonial celebrations), crossing the little border river Sark; and the
                    Caledonian line, completed in 1849, traversing Moffatdale and Upper Annandale,
                    and also a portion of England as far as Carlisle.</p>
                <p>In a Parliamentary Blue Book (1874) the acreage of the county is given at
                    676,971, and its yearly value (1872) at £595,511, 17s., the owners numbering
                    4177, of whom 886 possessed more than one acre each, the value per acre being
                    17s. 7d. as compared with 2 0s. for all Scotland. From the valuation roll for
                    1876 we learn that the chief proprietor, the duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry,
                    owns 253,514 acres, yielding an annual revenue of £97,840. The names of other
                    leading proprietors, with their extent of land and incomes from it, are—Mr J. J.
                    Hope Johnstone of Annandale, 64,079 acres, with a rental of £28,684; earl of
                    Mansfield, 14,342 acres, £15,938; marquis of Queensberry, 13,243, £13,982; Mrs
                    Villiers and Viscountess Cole of Closeburn, 13,560, £11,658; Sir John Heron
                    Maxwell of Springkell, 13,391, £9023; Mr R. Jardine of Castlemilk, 17,064,
                    £9339; Sir F. J. W. Johnstone of Westerhall, 7714, £7932; and Lord Herries,
                    5814, £6537. Population of county in 1861, 75,878; in 1871, 74,784.</p>
                <p>Dumfriesshire during the Roman occupation formed part of the province of
                    Valentia, which lay between the walls of Hadrian and Antonine, the British
                    tribes occupying it being termed the Selgovae. In course of time they were
                    dispossessed by other Celts, the Scoto-Irish; but the aboriginal Britons shared
                    with the latter, and with the numerous Saxons and the few Normans of a later
                    day, in being the progenitors of the existing inhabitants; and or them lasting
                    memorials remain in the names of rivers, mountains, and headlands, most of which
                    are British, “the nomenclature of the earliest colonists of the county thus
                    remaining unchanged by the conflicts of race or the flight of ages." Down to the
                    death οΐ Dâvid I., Nithsdale and some other portions of the district were still
                    to a large extent Celtic in their people and institutions; after that king’s
                    reign we begin to read of its historical families, some of whom are still its
                    leading landowners—of its Maxwells, Douglases, Kirkpatricks, Johnstones, Bruces,
                    Baliols, Cornyns, Scotts, Carlyles, Jardines, Murrays, and Crichtons.</p>
                <p>Of all the primitive inhabitants numerous memorials still exist in the form of
                    druidical remains, British motes and camps, Roman roads and camps, Anglo-Saxon
                    relics, the chief of the latter being the Runic monument at Ruthwell, which
                    tells the story of the Cross in characters as old as the days of the Heptarchy.
                    As the county is also replete with “chiefless castles breathing stern
                    farewells,” and other time-worn tokens of bye-gone ages, it presents a rich
                    field for archaeological research.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dumfries,</hi> beautifully situated on the left bank of the
                    Nith, about eight miles from the Solway Firth, is the capital of the county just
                    described.</p>
                <p>The irregular yet decided progress of the town can be traced through the Middle
                    Ages, and more recently till our own day, when it wears an attractive and
                    flourishing aspect. A serious check was given to its prosperity by a visitation
                    of cholera, which cut off more than 500 of its inhabitants in 1832. Since a
                    copious supply of good water was obtained from a neighbouring loch, and other
                    sanitary improvements were introduced, the salubrity of the burgh has been
                    fairly established, and its size and trade—promoted also by its railway
                    intercourse and the establishment of the tweed manufacture—have greatly
                    increased. Few Scotch provincial towns have gone forward with such a gigantic
                    stride during the last thirty years, and its steps in advance have been
                    especially remarkable during the latter half of that period, as shown chiefly by
                    the bustle of its business streets, the formation of new thoroughfares, and the
                    numerous suburban villas which now environ the old burgh proper.</p>
                <p>From time immemorial the town has possessed a great weekly cattle market, which,
                    though reduced since 1848 by the establishment of competing markets, and the
                    substitution of sheep for cattle on many surrounding farms, is still second to
                    none on the north side of the border. The average number of cattle sold on the
                    Sands during five years ending 1872 was nearly 14,000 yearly; in 1876 the number
                    was 18,413, besides 6844 sold at the auction marts. Vast herds are also sent
                    direct south from the railway station. A still larger trade is now done in
                    sheep, the average number offered for sale during five years ending 1872 being
                    37,000, while 29,980 were sold at market in 1876, and 42,958 by auction. There
                    is also a weekly market for pork, beginning in November and ending about the end
                    of March.</p>
                <p>Among the special industries of Dumfries, clog-making and basket-making have long
                    occupied an important place; its traffic in timber has grown to be immense; a
                    hundred acres of nursery ground help to beautify the town, and supply material
                    for an extensive trade in seeds, flowers, and other plants; the conversion of
                    skins into hides and leather gives labour to about 150 hands; while nearly the
                    same number are engaged at iron works. More extensive than any of these is the
                    hosiery manufacture, which, dating a century back, now gives employment to about
                    480 hands (including warehousemen), the goods produced ranking as the best in
                    Scotland, and next to those of Hawick in extent. Prior to 1847, however, the
                    prosperity of Dumfries depended much on its position as the capital of a rich
                    rural district, which it still is; but soon after that date it began to bulk
                    largely as a manufacturing town in connection with the tweed trade; and to its
                    development the growth of the burgh in size and opulence is principally due. The
                    principal firm, that of Walter Scott and Sons, usually employs about 1400
                    workers, with 400 looms and 30,000 spindles. Nearly all the business traffic to
                    and from Dumfries is now carried on by rail, the vessels belonging to the port
                    numbering only two or three, and its revenue— burdened by heavy interest on a
                    sum borrowed to erect a large sea-dyke, which has been of little benefit—is
                    insufficient to cover the expenditure.</p>
                <p>The origin of two places of worship in connection with the Established Church (St
                    Mary’s and Greyfriars’) is noticed below; a third, St Michael’s, is a stately
                    fabric <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n547/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0547-0528"/> dating from 1746. Before the lower interior was
                    reseated in 1869, it contained a pew which Burns and his family occupied. The
                    poet’s remains rest under a magnificent mausoleum in the surrounding churchyard;
                    and besides this paramount distinction the cemetery is richer with monumental
                    erections than that of any other provincial town in the United Kingdom. Among
                    the other ecclesiastical buildings are three Free churches, three belonging to
                    the United Presbyterians, two to the Congregationalists, one each to the
                    Wesleyan, the Scottish Episcopal, the Catholic Apostolic, and the Roman
                    Catholic, while two other denominations—the Baptists and Evangelical Union— are
                    also represented, Dumfries has three newspapers, two of them published twice a
                    week and one weekly. It has long been able to boast of a well-equipped
                    grammarschool—the Academy. The town possesses its full share of benevolent
                    institutions. Its oldest one, Moorhead’s Hospital, erected in 1753, gives
                    accommodation to decayed householders. A hospital for the reception of persons
                    suffering from disease or accident has been inexistence since 1778, under the
                    name of the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Royal Infirmary, but the building now
                    used as such, an imposing edifice in the Northern Italian style, was only opened
                    a few years back; 398 patients were treated in 1876, at a total outlay of £2137.
                    Crowning an eminence situated a little southward of the town stands a noble
                    building resembling a Greek cross; this is the Crichton Royal Institution for
                    lunatics, due to the munificence of Dr James Crichton of Friars’ Carse, whose
                    bequest of £100,000 was applied in erecting and partly endowing the asylum.
                    Since it was opened, nearly forty years ago, it has been considerably enlarged,
                    and also supplemented (in 1848) by the Southern Counties’ Asylum for pauper
                    inmates chiefly; usually the patients number about 500, nearly a third, as
                    middle and upper class patients, being housed in the older portion of the
                    establishment. The old infirmary building is now used as a commercial academy
                    connected with the Marist Brotherhood, and . dedicated to St Joseph. In it about
                    70 youths receive education; belonging to the establishment there is a novitiate
                    adjoining the Roman Catholic chapel, where 14 members of the order are under
                    training for missionary service at home or abroad. Several of the banking
                    establishments possess a fine appearance, but the county buildings in Buccleuch
                    Street (Scotch baronial in design), Greyfriars’ Church fronting the head of High
                    Street (Pointed Gothic), and the new infirmary are the most imposing edifices
                    within the burgh. It has a theatre royal, opened in 1792, which was almost
                    entirely reconstructed at a cost of £3000 in 1876, and its interior is now, size
                    considered, as handsome as that of any similar place of entertainment throughout
                    the kingdom. There is no object in the town that can vie with Devorgilla’s
                    Bridge as regards archaeological interest. Built of stone about 1280, it had no
                    equal at that period in Scotland, though the popular story which assigns to it
                    thirteen arches is belied by indisputable documents which show that they never
                    numbered more than nine. A second stone bridge was built in 1793-5, at an
                    expense of about £5000; and a small iron foot bridge, which cost nearly £2000,
                    was opened on the closing day of 1875. The associations of Dumfries with Burns,
                    however, and the memorials it possesses of the national bard, draw to it more
                    travellers annually than all its other attractions—scenic, antiquarian, or
                    social.</p>
                <p>The town council consists of 25 members, including a provost, 3 bailies, a dean
                    of guild, and a treasurer. Four other royal burghs combine to form a
                    parliamentary constituency with Dumfries, namely, Annan, Kirkcudbright,
                    Sanquhar, and Lochmaben—these, “The Five Carlins” of Burns’s ballads, being
                    represented by one member. In 1861 the population within the royalty was 12,347;
                    in 1871 it had increased to 13,704. As a parliamentary burgh Dumfries includes
                    Maxwelltown on the opposito bank of the Nith, its population as such amounting
                    in 1871 to 18,826.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The precise circumstances of the origin of
                    Dumfries are but imperfectly known; but the prevailing opinion is that a fortlet
                    built by the Selgovae Britons formed the nucleus of the town, an hypothesis that
                    is supported by its name, which, according to Chalmers, is resolvable into two
                    Gaelic terms signifying a castle among the brushwoxl. The oldest existing
                    charter is one granted by Robert II., dated 1395. Made a royal burgh by William
                    the Lion, Dumfries thereby acquired important privileges; and another stimulus
                    to its prosperity was supplied when Devorgilla, daughter of Alan, lord of
                    Galloway, connected that province with the town by building a stone bridge over
                    the Nith. It was the son of that munificent lady, John Balio!, whom Edward I. of
                    England selected as heir to the Scottish throne from the numerous competitors
                    for it who placed their claims at his disposal. During the troubles that ensued,
                    Nithsdale and Galloway supported Baliol, and or. his withdrawal from public life
                    they for the most part favoured the pretensions of his nephew John, the Red
                    Comyιι, as opposed to those of Robert Brace, who drew considerable support from
                    his patrimonial estates of Annandale.</p>
                <p>Dumfries figured much in the wars of the period. Whilst the great border castle
                    of Carlaverock was being besieged by an army under the command of King Edward in
                    1300, the town was visited by him personally, and, as we learn from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wcmlrobe Accounts,</hi> he lodged with a body of Franciscan friars
                    in a house built for them by Dcvorgilla, and partly maintained by dues levied at
                    tho bridgo which owed its existence to her liberality. Six years afterwards,
                    when Edward had smitten down all opposition to his ambitious designs, the
                    monastery which he had visited became the scene of a deed which led to the
                    overthrow of them all. On the 10th of Febnιary 1306 Bruce and Comyn were brought
                    together in the streets of the ancient burgh. As they entered the monastery in
                    company, Brace charged his rival with treachery; the latter denied the
                    accusation, and the next moment was stabbed to the heart, Kirkpatrick rushing in
                    to “mak siccar” or complete the deed of slaughter which the lord of Annandale
                    had begun. The blow by which the Red Comyn perished in the house erected by his
                    pious grandmother broke all amicable intercourse between the homicidal baron and
                    the English king; and thenceforward Bruce became thoroughly committed to the
                    national cause, of which he had been previously but a questionable friend. A
                    modern ecclesiastical edifice, St Mary’s Church, occupies a site mournfully
                    associated with the war of independence,—Sir Christopher Seton, husband of
                    Brace’s sister Christiana, having been there executed by order of Edward I.
                    After peace was restored, the sorrowing widow built upon the spot a little
                    chapel, which her royal brother endowed with a hundred shillings sterling per
                    annum in order that masses for the soul of the deceased should be said in it
                    “for ever.” Another church, Greyfriars’, stands on the site of the old castle of
                    Dumfries, which exchanged owners half a dozen times at least during the same
                    troublous period,—its sufferings by siege or storm indicating but too truly the
                    sad experiences of the town itself; and for nearly 250 years afterwards, the
                    proximity of the burgh to the western border exposed it to wasting raids from
                    the English side, carried on sometimes by freebooting parties, and not seldom
                    also by more formidable hosts with higher objects in view than the burning of
                    the place or the plunder of its inhabitants,— these hostile visits, with their
                    retaliatory forays southward, terminating at last in 1551. The long close
                    connection of Dumfries with the heroic yet turbulent Douglases proved on the
                    whole more hurtful to it than advantageous. Bound up for several generations
                    quite as intimately with the Maxwells of Carlaverock and Tcr-regles, the town
                    experienced alternate “weal and woe” from the protracted feuds of that family
                    with the Annandale Johnstones.</p>
                <p>When the Union with England was under debate, the provost of Dumfries, as its
                    representative in the Scottish Parliament, voted against the measure; and the
                    Articles of Union were publicly bħrned (Nov. 20, 1706) by a party of Camcronians
                    at the market cross, with the enthusiastic approval of the populace. About nine
                    years afterwards the inhabitants were threatened with a hostile visit from
                    Viscount Kenmure, but they manifested such a bold front that the Jacobite chief
                    acted on Falsta(Γs maxim, “Discretion is the better part of valour.” Less
                    vigilant during the next rebellion, they allowed the town to be peacefully
                    occupied by the young Pretender, who, converting No. 6 of the tenement now used
                    as the Commercial Hotel into a little palace, held high state there for three
                    days towards the close of December 1745. In order at once to recruit his own
                    exchequer and punish the burgh for its loyalty to the house of Hanover, the
                    prince demanded a tribute of £2000 in money; also 1000 pairs of shoes for his
                    kilted followers, whose foot-gear had nearly vanished during their forlorn
                    journey from the south; and, as if he had been <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                    king, he levied the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n548/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0548-0529"/> excise and appropriated all the moneys possessed
                    by the local Government officials. Influenced by a false alarm, “Bonnie Charlie”
                    made a hurried departure, having first received £1100 of a levy, and carrying
                    with him hostages for the rest. Some years afterwards the burgh was reimbursed
                    by the state for the money contribution, the whole of which had been paid, and
                    for the shoes actually delivered, 225 pairs, the compensation amounting to
                    £2848.</p>
                <p>In 1264 Alexander III. planned an expedition to the Isle of Man at Dumfries. The
                    town was visited at subsequent periods by James IV., James V., by the beautiful
                    daughter of the latter monarch, Queen Mary, and by Mary’s son, the “British
                    Solomon.” On the arrival of James VI., 3d August 1617, he was sumptuously
                    entertained by the magistrates in a house that was known as “The Painted Hall;”
                    afterwards he presented the incorporated trades, seven in number, with a tiny
                    “war-engine,” the celebrated Silver Gun, the competition for which encouraged
                    the practice of musketry among the craftsmen, and constituted a great septennial
                    festival, the characteristics of which are finely mirrored in a well-known poem
                    by John Mayne, though the wapinschaw itself has not been held since 1831. (W. M
