                <p><label type="entry">DERBY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward-Geoffrey Smith Stanley,
                    fourteenth earl of</hi></label>, Baron Stanley of Bickerstaffe, and a baronet
                    (1799-1869), born at Knowsley in Lancashire, on the 29th March 1799, was the
                    eldest son of Lord Stanley, who afterwards (1834) became the thirteenth earl of
                    Derby. The title in the direct line of succession to which he was thus born
                    ranks second in precedency among the earldoms in the peerage of England. He was
                    educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he distinguished himself as
                    a classical scholar, though he took only an ordinary degree on quitting the
                    university. In 1819 he obtained the Chancellor’s prize for Latin verse, the
                    subject being “Syracuse.” He gave early promise of his future eminence as an
                    orator, and it is said that in his youth he used to practise elocution under the
                    instruction of Lady Derby, his grandfather’s second wife, who as Miss Eliza
                    Farren had been a celebrated actress. With such an inclination and aptitude for
                    public speaking, the heir to an ancient title was only fulfilling his natural
                    destiny in seeking a seat in the House of Commons, and of course he had no
                    difficulty in finding one. In 1820, soon after he had attained his majority, he
                    was returned for Stockbridge in Hampshire, one of the nomination boroughs whose
                    electoral rights were swept away by the Reform Bill of 1832, Stanley, like
                    several Others who entered parliament by means of them, being a warm advocate of
                    their destruction. It may appear somewhat strange that he should have remained
                    for four years, so far as is known, a silent member; but the representative of a
                    pocket borough had no constituency to consider, and there was not in those days
                    the incentive to frequent speaking that is now furnished by full daily reports
                    of the debates circulating through the entire country. His maiden speech was
                    delivered early in the session of 1824 in the debate on a private bill for
                    lighting Manchester with gas. Although the subject can scarcely have given scope
                    for any high flight of oratory, the speaker was warmly complimented by Sir James
                    Mackintosh, one of the first authorities in the House, who welcomed him as an
                    accession to the Liberal ranks, and Hansard reports the speech as characterized
                    by “much clearness and ability.” His second appearance was made in connection
                    with a subject—irrepressible as it proved, though he always did his utmost to
                    repress it—which was afterwards to determine more than one important turning
                    point in his political career, and to call forth his last utterance in
                    parliament. It is noteworthy also as an early exhibition of the Conservative
                    instinct whose growing strength led gradually to an entire change of his
                    political position. On the 6th May 1824, he delivered what seems to have been a
                    vehement and eloquent speech against Joseph Hume’s motion for a reduction of the
                    Irish Church establishment, maintaining in its most conservative form the
                    doctrine that church property is as sacred as private property. From this time
                    his appearances became frequent; and he soon asserted his place as one of the
                    most powerful <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0125-0110"/> speakers in the House. Specially noticeable
                    almost from the first was the skill he displayed in reply. Macaulay, in an essay
                    published in 1834, remarked that he seemed to possess intuitively the faculty
                    which in most men is developed only by long and laborious practice. “Indeed,
                    with the exception of Mr Stanley, whose knowledge of the science of
                    parliamentary defence resembles an instinct, it would be difficult to name any
                    eminent debater who has not made himself a master of his art at the expense of
                    his audience.”</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1824 Stanley went on an extended tour through Canada and the
                    United States in company with Mr Labouchere, afterwards Lord Taunton, and Mr
                    Evelyn Denison, afterwards Lord Ossington. In May of the following year he
                    married the second daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, created Baron
                    Skelmersdale in 1828, by whom he had a family of two sons and one daughter who
                    survived, besides three children who died in infancy.</p>
                <p>At the general election of 1826 Stanley renounced his connection with
                    Stockbridge, and became the representative of the borough of Preston, wſhere the
                    Derby influence has usually, though not invariably, been paramount. The change
                    of seats had this advantage, that it left him free to speak against the system
                    of rotten boroughs, which he did with great force during the Reform Bill
                    debates, without laying himself open to the charge of personal inconsistency as
                    the representative of a place where, according to Gay, cobblers used to “feast
                    three years upon one vote.” In 1827 he and several other distinguished Whigs
                    made a coalition with Canning on the defection of the more unyielding Tories,
                    and he commenced his official life as under-secretary for the colonies. Whether
                    the coalition arrangement would have proved stable had its distinguished leader
                    survived is more than questionable, but It was entirely broken up by his death
                    in August of the same year. Lord Goderich, who had been Stanley’s chief at the
                    Colonial Office, succeeded to the premiership, but he never was really in power,
                    and he resigned his place after the lapse of a few months without venturing to
                    meet parliament. During the succeeding administration of the duke of Wellington
                    (1828-30), Stanley and those with whom he acted were in opposition. His robust
                    and assertive Liberalism about this period sounds somewhat curiously to a
                    younger generation who knew him only as the very embodiment of Conservatism.
                    They can find little of the earl of Derby except his characteristic force of
                    expression in the conviction uttered by Stanley, “that the old and stubborn
                    spirit of Toryism is at last yielding to the liberality of the age—that the
                    Tories of the old βchool, the sticklers for inveterate abuses under the name of
                    the wisdom of our ancestors, the <hi rend="italic">laudatores temporis acti</hi>
                    are giving way on all sides.” Even the most retrograde political party, however,
                    makes distinct progress almost in spite of itself as the years pass on, and Lord
                    Derby might very well have maintained that the Toryism he represented in his
                    maturity was not the Toryism he had denounced in his youth.</p>
                <p>By the advent of Lord Grey to power in November 1830, Stanley obtained his first
                    opportunity of showing his capacity for a responsible office. He was appointed
                    to the chief secretaryship of Ireland, a position in which, as it turned out, he
                    found ample scope for both administrative and debating skill. On accepting
                    office he had, according to the usual practice, to vacate his seat for Preston
                    and seek re-election; and it must have been peculiarly mortifying to one of his
                    high spirit that, in spite of his family influence and growing reputation, he
                    alone of all the members of the new ministry in the Lower House failed to secure
                    his return. He was defeated, and the defeat was doubtless rendered more bitter
                    by the fact that his opponent was the Radical “orator” Hunt. The contest was a
                    peculiarly keen one, and turned upon the question of the ballot, which Stanley
                    refused to support. He re-entered the house as one of the members for Windsor,
                    Sir Hussey Vivian having resigned in his favour. In 1832 he again changed his
                    seat, being returned for North Lancashire, which he continued to represent until
                    his elevation to the House of Lords.</p>
                <p>Mr Stanley was one of the most ardent supporters of the great measure which has
                    made Lord Grey’s administration the most memorable of the present century. Of
                    this no other proof is needed than his frequent parliamentary utterances, which
                    were fully in sympathy with the popular cry “The bill, the whole bill, and
                    nothing but the bill.” Reference may be made especially to the speech he
                    delivered on the 4th March 1831 on the adjourned debate on the second reading of
                    the bill, which was marked by all the higher qualities of his oratory. More than
                    thirty years later, when he was premier, he was again called upon to deal with
                    the question, and he had statesmanship enough to settle it on a permanent basis;
                    but the incertitude with which he then took what he himself in a well remembered
                    phrase called “a leap in the dark” was in curious contrast to the clear
                    conviction with which he advocated the earlier measure.</p>
                <p>Apart from his connection with the general policy of the Government, Stanley had
                    more than enough to have employed all his energies in the management of his own
                    department. The secretary of Ireland has seldom an easy task; Stanley found it
                    one of peculiar difficulty. The country was in a very unsettled state. The just
                    concession that had been somewhat tardily yielded a short time before in
                    Catholic emancipation had excited the people to make all sorts of demands,
                    reasonable and unreasonable. As one result of that concession these demands were
                    now permitted to be urged on the floor of the House by the most eloquent and the
                    most widely popular representative Ireland has ever possessed,—one, too, whose
                    hatred of the “base, bloody, and brutal Whigs” seems to have totally unfitted
                    him for judging Whig measures fairly. Problems of great practical difficulty in
                    connection with the land and the church pressed for solution; and the alarming
                    increase of agrarian outrages demanded even more urgently the instant
                    application of vigorous measures of repression. Mr Stanley’s conduct in these
                    trying circumstances showed that he had the spirit that rises with difficulties.
                    Undaunted by the fierce denunciations of O’Connell, who styled him Scorpion
                    Stanley, he discharged with determination the ungrateful task of carrying a
                    Coercion Bill through the House. Parliar· ment has probably seldom witnessed
                    warmer or more personal encounters than those which took place about this time
                    between the Liberator and the Irish Secretary, and seldom has an official
                    position been more gallantly defended. It was generally felt that O’Connell,
                    powerful though he was, had fairly met his match in Stanley, who, with invective
                    scarcely inferior to his own, evaded no challenge, ignored no argument, and left
                    no taunt unanswered. The title “Rupert of Debate” is peculiarly applicable to
                    him in connection with the fearless if also often reckless method of attack he
                    showed in his parliamentary war with O’Connell. It was first applied to him,
                    however, thirteen years later by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton in the following
                    passage of <hi rend="italic">The New</hi><hi rend="italic">Timon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;—</hi></p>
                <p>“One after one the lords of time advance;</p>
                <p>Here Stanley meets—here Stanley scorns the glance! The brilliant chief,
                    irregularly great,</p>
                <p>Frank, haughty, rash,—the Rupert of debate.”</p>
                <p>The best answer, however, which he made to the attacks <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n126/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0126-0111"/> of the great agitator was not the retorts of
                    debate, effective though these were, but the beneficial legislation he was
                    instrumental in passing. Two of his measures deserve special mention. He
                    introduced and carried the first national education act for Ireland, one result
                    of which was the remarkable and to many almost incredible phenomenon of a board
                    composed of Catholics, Episcopalians, and Presbyterians, harmoniously
                    administering an efficient education scheme. He was also chiefly responsible for
                    the Irish Church Temporalities Act, though the bill was not introduced into
                    parliament until after he had quitted the Irish secretaryship for another
                    office. By this measure two archbishoprics and eight bishoprics were abolished,
                    and a remedy was provided for various abuses connected with the revenues of the
                    church. As originally introduced, the bill contained a clause authorizing the
                    appropriation of surplus revenues to non-ecclesiastical purposes. This had,
                    however, been strongly opposed from the first by Stanley, and several other
                    members of the cabinet, and it was withdrawn by the Government before the
                    measure reached the Lords. There was therefore no ground for the charge of
                    inconsistency brought against Stanley, when a year later he seceded from the
                    cabinet on the proposal being renewed.</p>
                <p>In 1833, just before the introduction of the Irish Church Temporalities Bill,
                    Stanley had been promoted to be secretary for the colonies with a seat in the
                    cabinet. In this position it fell to his lot to carry through parliament a
                    measure which is one of the abiding glories of English legislation. The
                    agitation for the emancipation of the slaves had been mainly the work of others
                    whose names have become historical in connection with it; but to Stanley
                    belonged the honour and privilege of bringing it to a successful practical issue
                    in the pages of the statute book. The speech which he delivered on introducing
                    the bill for the emancipation of the slaves in the West Indies, on the 14th May
                    1833, was one of the finest specimens of his eloquence. It showed a
                    philanthropic spirit and a love of freedom which proved him to be a not unworthy
                    associate of Clarkson, Wilberforce, and Buxton, and it was admirable for the
                    clear statement of the somewhat complicated arrangement by which the all but
                    unanimous wish of the nation was to be carried out. The latter quality was still
                    more conspicuous in committee, through which Stanley carried the measure with
                    the firmness and tact of true statesmanship.</p>
                <p>It has already been said that the Irish Church question determined more than one
                    turning-point in Mr Stanley’s political career. The most important occasion on
                    which it did so was in 1834, when the proposal of the Government to appropriate
                    the surplus revenues of the church to educational purposes led to his secession
                    from the cabinet, and, as it proved, his complete and final separation from the
                    Whig party. In the former of these steps he had as his companions Sir James
                    Graham, the earl of Ripon, and the duke of Richmond. Soon after it occurred,
                    O’Connell, amid the laughter of the House, described the secession in a couplet
                    from Canning’s <hi rend="italic">Loves of the Triangles :—</hi></p>
                <p>“Still down thy steep, romantic Ashbourne, glides The Derby dilly carrying six
                    insides.”</p>
                <p>Stanley was by no means content with marking his disapproval of the conduct of
                    the Government of which he had been a member by the simple act of withdrawing
                    from it. He spoke against the bill to which he objected with a vehemence that
                    showed the strength of his feeling in the matter, and against its authors with a
                    bitterness that he himself is understood to have afterwards admitted to have
                    been unseemly towards those who had so recently been his colleagues. The
                    language of one speech deserves to be quoted as a good specimen of what he could
                    do in the way of invective when he chose. “Plunder,” a term very familiar in
                    more recent debates on the same long-vexed question, was perhaps the mildest
                    word he used. The course followed by the Government was “marked with all that
                    timidity, that want of dexterity, which led to the failure of the unpractised
                    shoplifter.” His late colleagues were compared to “thimble-riggers at a country
                    fair,” and their plan was “petty larceny, for it had not the redeeming qualities
                    of bold and open robbery.”</p>
                <p>In the end of 1834, Lord Stanley, as he was now styled by courtesy, his father
                    having succeeded to the earldom in October, was invited by Sir Robert Peel to
                    join the short-lived Conservative ministry which he formed after the resignation
                    of Lord Melbourne. Though he declined the offer for reasons stated in a letter
                    published in the Peel memoirs, he acted from that date with the Conservative
                    party, and on its next accession to power, in 1841, he accepted the office of
                    colonial secretary, which he had held under Lord Grey. His position and his
                    temperament alike, however, made him a thoroughly independent supporter of any
                    party to which he attached himself. When, therefore, the injury to health
                    arising from the late hours in the Commons led him in 1844 to seek elevation to
                    the Upper House in the right of his father’s barony, Sir Robert Peel, in
                    acceding to his request, had the satisfaction of at once freeing himself from
                    the possible effects of his “candid friendship” in the House, and at the same
                    time greatly strengthening the debating power on the Conservative side in the
                    other. If the premier in taking this step had any presentiment of an approaching
                    difference on a vital question, it was not long in being realized. When Sir
                    Robert Peel accepted the policy of free trade in 1846, the breach between him
                    and Lord Stanley was, as might have been anticipated from the antecedents of the
                    latter, instant and irreparable. Lord Stanley at once asserted himself as the
                    uncompromising opponent of that policy, and he became, as his position
                    warranted, the recognized leader of the Protectionist party, having Lord George
                    Bentinck and Mr Disraeli for his lieutenants in the Commons. They did all that
                    could be done in a case in which the logic of events was against them, but their
                    watchword of Protection was never to become more than a watchword. It is one of
                    the peculiarities of English politics, however, that a party may come into power
                    because it is the only available one at the time, though it may have no chance
                    of carrying the very principle to which it owes its organized existence. Such
                    was the case when Lord Derby, who had succeeded to the earldom on the death of
                    his father in June 1851, was called upon to form his first administration in
                    February 1852. He was in a minority, but the circumstances were such that no
                    other than a minority Government was possible, and he resolved to take the only
                    available means of strengthening his position by dissolving parliament and
                    appealing to the country at the earliest opportunity. The appeal was made in
                    autumn, but its result did not materially alter the position of parties.
                    Parliament met in November, and by the middle of the following month, the
                    ministry had. resigned in consequence of their defeat on the clever but
                    financially unsound budget proposed by Mr Disraeli. For the six following years,
                    during Lord Aberdeen’s “ministry of all the talents” and Lord Palmerston’s
                    premiership, Lord Derby remained at the head of the opposition, whose policy
                    gradually became more generally Conservative and less distinctively
                    Protectionist as the hopelessness of reversing the measures adopted in 1846 made
                    itself apparent to all but the most reactionary. In 1855, he was asked to form
                    an administration after the resignation of Lord Aberdeen, but failing to obtain
                    sufficient support, he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0127-0112"/> declined the task. It was in somewhat more
                    hopeful circumstances that, after the defeat of Lord Palmerston on the
                    Conspiracy Bill in February 1858, he assumed for the second time the reins of
                    government. Though he still could not count upon a working majority, there was a
                    possibility of carrying on affairs without sustaining defeat, which was realized
                    for a full session, owing chiefly to the dexterous management of Mr Disraeli in
                    the Commons. The one rock ahead was the question of Reform, on which the wishes
                    of the country were being emphatically expressed, but it was not so pressing as
                    to require to be immediately dealt with. During the session of 1858 the
                    Government contrived to pass two measures of very considerable importance, one a
                    bill to remove Jewish disabilities, and the other a bill to transfer the
                    government of India from the East India Company to the Crown. Next year the
                    question of parliamentary reform had to be faced, and, recognizing the
                    necessity, the Government introduced a bill at the opening of the session,
                    which, in spite of, or rather in consequence of, its “fancy franchises,” was
                    rejected by the House, and, on a dissolution, rejected also by the country. A
                    vote of no confidence having been passed in the new parliament on the 10th June,
                    Lord Derby at once resigned.</p>
                <p>After resuming the leadership of the Opposition Lord Derby devoted much of the
                    leisure the position afforded him to the classical studies that had always been
                    congenial to him. It was his reputation for scholarship as well as his social
                    position that had led in 1852 to his appointment to the chancellorship of the
                    university of Oxford, in succession to the duke of Wellington; and perhaps a
                    desire to justify the possession of the honour on the former ground had
                    something to do with his essays in the field of authorship. These were made at
                    first with a diffidence that contrasted strongly with his boldness io politics.
                    His first venture was a poetical version of the 9th ode of the 3rd book of
                    Horace, which appeared in Lord Ravensworth’s collection of translations of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odes.</hi> In 1862 he printed and circulated in influential
                    quarters a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Translations of Poems Ancient and
                    Modern,</hi> with a very modest dedicatory letter to Lord Stanhope, and the
                    words “Not published” on the title-page. It contained, besides versions of
                    Latin, Italian, French, and German poems, a translation of the first book of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> The reception of this volume was such as to
                    encourage him to proceed with the task he had chosen as his <hi rend="italic"
                    >magnum opus,</hi> the translation of the whole of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> which accordingly appeared in 1864. The fact that it speedily
                    passed through six editions is, of course, not so unequivocal a proof of its
                    literary merit as would have been the case had the work proceeded from an author
                    of less social distinction, but it has considerable significance. Tried on its
                    merits, the most severe critic could not pronounce the work a failure. That it
                    was not a complete success was due principally to the facts that the author had
                    not caught the difficult secret of the management of the metre he chose—blank
                    verse,— and that he v as unable to divest himself of the diffuseness and of the
                    modern cast of thought and style of expression natural to the parliamentary
                    orator.</p>
                <p>During the seven years that elapsed between Lord Derby’s second and third
                    administrations an industrial crisis occurred in his native county, which
                    brought out very conspicuously his public spirit and his philanthropy. The
                    destitution in Lancashire, caused by the stoppage of the cotton-supply in
                    consequence of the American civil war, was so great as to threaten to overtax
                    the benevolence of the country. That it did not do so was probably due to Lord
                    Derby more than to any other single man. From the first he was the very life and
                    soul of the movement for relief. His personal subscription, munificent though it
                    was, represented the least part of his service. His noble speech at the meeting
                    in Manchester in December 1872, where the movement was initiated, and his advice
                    at the subsequent meetings of the committee, which he attended very regularly,
                    were of the very highest value in stimulating and directing public sympathy. His
                    relations with Lancashire had always been of the most cordial description,
                    notwithstanding his early rejection by Preston; but it is not surprising that
                    after the cotton famine period the cordiality passed into a warmer and deeper
                    feeling, and that the name of Lord Derby is still cherished in most grateful
                    remembrance by thousands of the factory operatives.</p>
                <p>On the rejection of Earl Russell’s Reform Bill in 1866, Lord Derby was for the
                    third time intrusted with the formation of a cabinet. Like those he had
                    previously formed it was destined to be short-lived, but it lived long enough to
                    settle on a permanent basis the question that had proved fatal to its
                    predecessor. The “education” of the party that had so long opposed all reform to
                    the point of granting household suffrage was the work of another; but it is
                    understood that Lord Derby fully concurred in, if he was not the first to
                    suggest, the statesmanlike policy by which the question was disposed of in such
                    away as to take it once for all out of the region of controversy and agitation.
                    The passing of the Reform Bill was the main business of the session 1867. The
                    chief debates were, of course, in the Commons, and Lord Derby’s failing powers
                    prevented him from taking any large share in those which took place in the
                    Lords. His description of the measure as a “leap in the dark,” was eagerly
                    caught up, because it exactly represented the common opinion at the time,—the
                    most experienced statesmen, while they admitted the granting of household
                    suffrage to be a political necessity, being utterly unable to foresee what its
                    effect might be on the constitution and government of the country.</p>
                <p>Finding himself unable, from declining health, to encounter the fatigues of
                    another session, Lord Derby resigned office early in 1868. The step he had taken
                    was announced in both houses on the evening of the 25th February, and warm
                    tributes of admiration and esteem were paid by the leaders of the two great
                    parties. He was succeeded by Mr Disraeli, to whom he yielded the entire
                    leadership of the party as well as the premiership. His subsequent appearances
                    in public were few and unimportant. It was noted as a consistent close to his
                    political life that his last speech in the House of Lords should have been a
                    denunciation of Mr Gladstone’s Irish Church Bill marked by much of his early
                    fire and vehemence. A few months later, on the 23rd October 1869, he died at
                    Knowsley.</p>
                <p>Lord Derby was one of the last and most brilliant representatives of a class
                    which seems to have become extinct, for the time at least, if the sharp
                    differentiation of human pursuits that has now established itself has not
                    rendered it impossible that it should ever again exist. Politics is now a
                    distinct and exclusive profession; the number of those to whom, like Lord Derby,
                    it is the main without being the all-absorbing interest of life seems to become
                    fewer year by year. There still remain one or two noted statesmen who are also
                    noted authors, but of the life of many interests embracing public affairs,
                    scholarship, literature, society, sportsmanship, and estate management, Lord
                    Derby was almost the last specimen. Of another class, which will have ceased to
                    exist when one or two more have passed away, he was also among the last and
                    best; he was a master of the all but lost art of parliamentary oratory. On this
                    point it is enough to quote the testimony of two most competent witnesses. Sir
                    Archibald Alison, writing of him when he was in the zenith of his powers, styles
                    him “by the admission of all parties the most per-íect<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0128-0113"/> orator of his day.” Even higher was the opinion
                    of Lord Aberdeen, who is reported by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to have
                    said that no one of the giants he had listened to in his youth, Pitt, Fox,
                    Burke, or Sheridan, “as a speaker, is to be compared with our own Lord Derby,
                    when Lord Derby is at his best.” (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">b. s.)</hi></p>
