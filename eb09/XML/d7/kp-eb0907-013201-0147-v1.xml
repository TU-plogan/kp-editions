                        Count</hi></label> (1764-1834), French general, was born at Thonon, in
                    Savoy, September 24, 1764. He studied medicine, took his degree of doctor at
                    Turin, and then went to Paris. When the Revolution broke out he served in the
                    National Guard. Sympathizing with the extreme party, he attempted in 1791 to
                    establish its principles in his native land; but, being prosecuted by order of
                    the king, he escaped to France. He had organized the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Legion of the</hi><hi rend="italic">Allobroges,</hi> and as its captain
                    took part in the great conflict of August 10,1792. In the following years he
                    served at the siege of Toulon, in the army of the eastern Pyrenees, and in the
                    army of Italy. He was captured at the battle of Rivoli, but was soon exchanged.
                    In the spring of 1798 Dessaix was elected member of the Council of Five Hundred.
                    In consequence of his opposition to the revolution of 18 Brumaire (9th November
                    1799), by which Napoleon became supreme, he was excluded from the council,
                    retaining, however, his military command. He was appointed successively
                    commander of Frankfort and of Breda, andin September 1803 was promoted general
                    of brigade, and soon after commander of the Legion of Honour. He distinguished
                    himself at the capture of Ulm, at the passage of the Tagliamento, and at the
                    battle of Wagram. His brilliant courage at this battle procured him from the
                    emperor the surname of “the Intrepid,” and the dignity of count of the empire.
                    He was also promoted general of division, and named grand officer of the Legion
                    of Honour. He took part in the expedition to Russia, and was twice wounded. For
                    several months he was commander of Berlin, and afterwards delivered the
                    department of Mont Blanc from the Austrians. His just conduct on this occasion
                    earned him the title of the Bayard of Savoy. After the first restoration,
                    Dessaix was created chevalier of St Louis. He nevertheless joined Napoleon in
