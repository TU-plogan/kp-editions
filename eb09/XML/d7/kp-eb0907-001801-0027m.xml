                    Geneva, February 4, 1778. He was descended from one of the most ancient families
                    of Provence, and his ancestors had been expatriated for their religion in the
                    middle of the 16th century. His father was a famous printer, and syndic of the
                    university and republic. Though a weakly boy he showed great aptitude for study,
                    and distinguished himself at school by his rapid attainments in classical and
                    general literature, and specially by a faculty for writing elegant verse, which
                    led Florian to anticipate that he might become famous as a poet. He showed
                    remarkable powers of memory, which proved of the greatest service to him in the
                    science to which he ultimately devoted himself. His interest in plants was first
                    roused while he was residing with his mother at a remote country village during
                    the siege of Geneva in 1792. He began his scientific studies at the college of
                    Geneva, by attending the courses of Saussure and Vaucher, the latter of whom
                    first inspired him with the determination to make botanical science the chief
                    pursuit of his life. In 1796 he removed to Paris, where he resided with
                    Dolomieu, attended various courses of lectures on natural science, and. gained
                    the friendship of Jussieu and Desfontaines. His first productions, <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Plantarum Succulentarum</hi> (4 vols., 1799) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Astragalogia</hi> (1802), introduced him to the notice of Cuvier
                    (whose chair in the College de France he supplied in 1802), Humboldt, Biot, and
                    Lamarck, who afterwards confided to him the publication of the third edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Flore</hi><hi rend="italic">Française</hi> (1803-15). The
                    introduction to this work contained the first exposition of his principle of
                    classification according to the natural as opposed to the Linnean or artificial
                    method. Having been elected (1804) doctor of medicine by the medical faculty of
                    Paris, he wrote, as an inaugural work, the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur les
                    propriétés médicinales des plantes comparées avec leurs formes extérieures et
                    leur classification naturelle,</hi> and soon after, in 1806, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Synopsis plantarum in flora</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallica
                    descriptarum.</hi> At the desire of the French Government he spent the summers
                    of the following six years in making a botanical and agricultural survey of the
                    whole kingdom, the results of which he published in 1813. In 1807 he was
                    appointed professor of botany in the medical faculty of the university of
                    Montpellier, and in 1810 he was transferred to the newly founded chair of botany
                    of the faculty of sciences in the same university. He was an admirable lecturer,
                    and the gardens under his charge were much improved during his occupancy of the
                    chair. From Montpellier he removed to Geneva in 1816, having been invited by the
                    now independent republic to fill the newly created chair of natural history. The
                    rest of his life was spent in an attempt to elaborate and complete his “natural”
                    system of botanical classification. The results of his labours in this
                    department are to be found in his <hi rend="italic">Regni vegetabilis systema
                    naturale,</hi> of which two volumes only were completed (1821) when he found
                    that it would be impossible for him to execute the whole work on so extensive a
                    scale. He accordingly commenced in 1824 a less extensive work in the same
                    direction—his <hi rend="italic">Prodromus systematis regni vegetabilis,—</hi>
                    but even of this he was able to finish only seven volumes, or two-thirds of the
                    whole. It was carried on after his death by his son Alphonse, who in 1834 had
                    succeeded him in his professorship. He had been for several years in delicate
                    health when he died on the 9th September 1841 at Turin, whither he had gone to
                    attend a scientific reunion. De Candolle received diplomas or the honour of
                    membership from most of the learned societies of Europe, and was a very frequent
                    contributor to their Transactions. Louis Philippe decorated him with the cross
                    of the Legion of Honour. He was highly esteemed in his native city, where he was
                    for a long period rector of the academy and a member of the legislature. For an
