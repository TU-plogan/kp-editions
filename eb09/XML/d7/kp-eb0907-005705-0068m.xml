                    twenty-two he was sent by his father against Ptolemy, who had invaded Syria; he
                    was totally defeated near Gaza, but soon repaired his loss by a victory which he
                    obtained over Cilles, in the neighbourhood of Myus. After conducting an
                    expedition against Babylon, and engaging in several campaigns against Ptolemy on
                    the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to
                    Athens, and restored the Athenians to liberty, by freeing them from the power of
                    Cassander and Ptolemy, and expelling the garrison which had been stationed there
                    under Demetrius Phalereus. After this successful expedition he besieged and took
                    Munychia, and defeated Cassander at Thermopylae. His reception at Athens, after
                    these victories, was attended with the greatest servility; and under the title
                    of “The Preserver” the Athenians worshipped him as a tutelary deity. In the next
                    campaign he defeated Menelaus by land, and completely destroyed the naval power
                    of Ptolemy. After an interval spent at Cyprus, he endeavoured to punish the
                    Rhodians for having deserted his cause; and his ingenuity in devising new
                    instruments of siege, in his unsuccessful attempt to reduce the capital, gained
                    him the appellation of Poliorcetes. He returned a second time to Greece as
                    liberator. But traces of Oriental despotism showed themselves, and the
                    licentiousness and extravagance of Demetrius made the Athenians regret the
                    government of Cassander. He soon, however, roused the jealousy of the successors
                    of Alexander; and Seleucus, Cassander, and Lysimachus united to destroy
                    Antigonus and his son. The hostile armies met at Ipsus, 301 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Antigonus was killed in the battle, and Demetrius, after sustaining a
                    severe loss, retired to Ephesus. This reverse of fortune raised him many
                    enemies; and the Athenians, who had lately adored him as a god, refused even to
                    admit him into their city. But he soon afterwards ravaged the territory of
                    Lysimachus, and effected a reconciliation with Seleucus, to whom he gave his
                    daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens was at this time oppressed by the
                    tyranny of Cassander; but Demetrius, after a protracted blockade, gained
                    possession of the city, and pardoned the inhabitants their former misconduct.
                    The loss of his possessions in Asia recalled him from Greece; and he established
                    himself on the throne of Macedonia by the murder of Alexander, the son of
                    Cassander, 294 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But here he was continually
                    threatened by Pyrrhus, who took advantage of his occasional absence to ravage
                    the defenceless part of his kingdom; and at length the combined forces of
                    Pyrrhus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus, assisted by the disaffected among his own
                    subjects, obliged him to leave Macedonia after he had sat on the throne for
                    seven years. He passed into Asia, and attacked some of the provinces of
                    Lysimachus with varying success; but famine and pestilence destroyed the greater
                    part of his army, and he retired to the court of Seleucus to seek support and
                    assistance. Here he met with a kind reception; but, nevertheless, hostilities
                    soon broke out; and after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law,
                    Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troops in the field of battle, and became
                    an easy prey to the enemy. His son Antigonus offered Seleucus all his
                    possessions, and even his person, in order to procure his father’s liberty; but
                    all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died in the fifty-fourth year of his age,
                    after a confinement of three years, 284 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His
                    remains were given to Antigonus, honoured with a splendid funeral at Corinth,
                    and thence conveyed to Demetrias. His posterity remained in possession of the
                    Macedonian throne till the time of Perseus, who was conquered by the Romans. See
