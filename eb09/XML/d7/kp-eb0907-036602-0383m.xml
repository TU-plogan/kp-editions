                    races of the Hellenic or Greek people was commonly known, the other being the
                    Ionic. These two races, if the term may here be rightly used, stand out in
                    marked contrast, as exhibiting different types oſ character, which have their
                    issue in different modes of thought and forms of government. But when from a
                    consideration of their political and intellectual development we endeavour to
                    work our way backward to the origin and early history of these races, we find
                    ourselves confronted by traditions which show little consistency, or which even
                    exclude each other. The writer who speaks with the greatest confidence on this
                    subject is the perfectly truthful man who well earned his title to be known as
                    the father of history; but Herodotus, although thoroughly to be trusted as to
                    all that he relates from his own experience, could not rise much above the
                    standard of his age in dealing with alleged matters of fact, nor could he see
                    that the eking out of theory by conjecture is an illegitimate process. Herodotus
                    then, in speaking of the Athenians and Spartans as standing at the head
                    severally of the Dorian and Ionian races, states positively that the Ionian was
                    a Pelasgic, the Dorian a Hellenic people; that the former had always been
                    stationary, while the latter had many times changed its abode. In the time of
                    Deucalion, he asserts, the Dorians, or rather the tribe or tribes which were
                    afterwards to be called Dorians, inhabited Phthiotis, by which he probably
                    understands the southern portion of the great Thessalian plain. Afterwards,
                    under their eponymus Dorus, they occupied Histiaeotis, which he describes as the
                    region under Ossa and Olympus. They had thus migrated from the most southerly to
                    the most northerly parts of the great plain which is drained by the Peneius. The
                    next migration was to the highlands of Pindus, the chain which runs down at
                    right angles from the Cambunian range, or the westward extension of Olympus.
                    Here, he says, they were known not as Dorians, but as Macedonians. A later
                    southward migration brought them into Dryopis, whence they made their way into
                    the Peloponnesus, and it would seem were then only first known as Dorians
                    (Herod, i. 56).</p>
                <p>If we examine the statement thus boldly advanced, we shall find at each step that
                    the ground becomes more uncertain. We may indeed, in order to explain it, assume
                    that the Pelasgic race was closely akin to the Greek, and that their language
                    stood midway between the Hellenic and the Latin; but if we do so we are
                    reasoning strictly from the point of view of modern philology, and really
                    abandoning that of Herodotus, who says that, if he may judge from the Pelasgian
                    populations which he found at Placia, Scylace, and Creston, the Pelasgians
                    generally must have spoken a barbarous dialect, i.e., a dialect unintelligible
                    to a Greek. He is thus driven to assume, first, that the Attic tribes had been
                    Pelasgic before they became Hellenic, and that the change was accompanied by a
                    change of language (Herod, i. 57). Elsewhere (ii. 51) he speaks of the Athenians
                    as being already Greek or Hellenic before <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0384-0367"/> the Pelasgians became their neighbours, and adds
                    that the latter came in time to be reckoned Hellenic also. We thus see, without
                    going further, how vague and misty were the notions of Herodotus; but we have to
                    note further that the account here given of the Dorians and Ionians is said to
                    apply to the time of Croesus, and thus, down to his age, the Ionians had been
                    stationary in their original abodes, these abodes in his day being assuredly not
                    in the Peloponnesus. Yet he can assert elsewhere that the Peloponnese had been
                    their original home, and that they had been expelled from it by the Achaians (i.
                    145). But, apart from the fact that the poets of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> know nothing of any expulsion
                    of Ionian s from Peloponnesus, the difficulties are increased if we betake
                    ourselves to the tribal genealogies which the Greeks regarded as undoubtedly
                    historical documents. We have then, on the one side, the assertion that the
                    Ionians were originally non-Hellenic and Pelasgian; on the other, the Iaρetid
                    genealogy speaks of Dorians, Achaians, Ionians, and Aeolians, as being all
                    sprung from Hellen,—Xouthus, the son of Hellen, being the father of Ion and
                    Achaiuε. If, therefore, we were to argue from these data, we should have to
                    conclude that, as the tribes just mentioned were all Hellenic, and as the
                    Ionians were Pelasgians, some Pelasgians at least were Hellenes. But the whole
                    process would be deceptive, for as Ion and Achaius are here the sons of Xouthus,
                    the Ionians would be expelled from the Peloponnesus by their nearest brethren.
                    It is, however, more important to note that the opinion of Herodotus respecting
                    the Pelasgi was distinctly contradicted by another, which had the countenance of
                    Strabo, Plutarch, and other writers. Strabo speaks of them as virtually nomadic
                    tribes; and the story even went that they'received their name, Pelasgi =
                    Pelargoi, or Storks, from their wandering habits. It is difficult to resist the
                    inference of Sir G. Cornewall Lewis that this radical inconsistency in the views
                    respecting the Pelasgians is a proof that they rest on no historical basis <hi
                    rend="italic">(Credibility of Early Roman History,</hi> i. 282). Further, there
                    is the extreme unlikelihood that the tribes afterwards known as Dorians should
                    for a certain period have been called Macedonians, or rather, as Herodotus
                    implies, that they should more than once change their name. The assertion that
                    they were called Macedonians involves a fresh contradiction, for elsewhere
                    Herodotus asserts that the Macedonians were not Hellenic at all, although they
                    were governed by chiefs of genuine Greek descent. Nor is our position improved
                    if we choose to prefer the statements of the genealogies in preference to those
                    of Herodotus or other historians, on the ground that the national tradition by
                    which these genealogies were handed down must be trustworthy, for the descent in
                    one genealogy is often directly contradicted by that of another, and not
                    unfrequently, and indeed even generally, the genealogy betrays the nature of the
                    materials from which it has been made up. Thus, for instance, Dorus, the
                    eponymus of the Dorians, has as his sister Protogeneia (the Early Dawn), who,
                    being wedded to Zeus, the god of the gleaming heaven, becomes the mother of
                    Aëthlius, the toiling sun, who is the father of Endymion, that is, of the
                    sun-god who sinks to sleep in Latmus, the land of forgetfulness. Finally, we
                    have to note the fact that, in the Hellenic world as elsewhere, tribes bearing
                    the same name were found separated by great distances; and in such cases
                    traditions always sprang up, not merely asserting their connection, but
                    accounting for it. Thus they found Achaians in Thessaly and Achaians in the
                    Peloponnese; and it was said, not merely that the former passed southwards
                    across the isthmus of Corinth, but that they were led by the barbarian Pelops
                    from Phrygia. The same process connected the Peloponnesian Dorians with the</p>
                <p>Dorian clans who dwelt between CEta and Parnassus, and spoke of the latter as the
                    stock from which the Spartans sprang, to the great benefit of the insignificant
                    clans, who thus acquired a foremost rank in the Hellenic world.</p>
                <p>All that we can do, then, is to bring together the genealogies which refer in any
                    way to Dorus and his supposed descendants the Dorians, and then gather from
                    historians and geographers the various regions in which Dorians were found
                    during ages which may reasonably be regarded as historical. The result of the
                    former process will scarcely appear satisfactory. We have noticed one genealogy
                    which represents Dorus as the son of Hellen; but in the Etolian genealogy he is
                    the son of Apollo and Phthia, and is slain by Aetolus in the land which from him
                    was called Etolia (Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gr.,</hi> i. 140). The great tradition which connects the Dorians of the
                    Peloponnesus with their more noteworthy namesakes is the legend which relates
                    the return of the Heraclids, or descendants of Hercules, who, after the death of
                    that hero, had been compelled to take refuge in Athens. Hyllus, in his exile, is
                    adopted by the Dorian king Aegimius, the father of Pamphylus and Dymas, who with
                    Hyllus become the eponymi or name-givers of the three tribes found in Dorian
                    communities generally, and known as Hylleans, Pamphylians, and Dymanes, Hyllus
                    being more particularly illustrious as the forefather of Eurysthenes and
                    Procles, the progenitors of the two houses from which the Spartan kings were
                    always elected. But this legend, like the rest, was variously related, and,
                    according to the version of Plato, the return of the Heraclids would be rather a
                    return of the Achaians to the Peloponnesus.</p>
                <p>We cannot, however, question the fact that the Dorian race was widely extended,
                    that it was found, like the Ionians, in various portions of the Hellenic world,
                    separated by considerable distances of land or sea, and that the people who bore
                    this name were singularly active in the work of colonization. They are found not
                    only in all parts of the Peloponnese but in the islands of the Aegean, and on
                    the coasts of Asia Minor; and from the foremost Dorian cities went forth, it is
                    said, the colonists who were to carry the Hellenic name and Hellenic culture far
                    to the east and the west. Thus Corinth became the mother city of Corcyra and
                    Syracuse, and from these sprang Epidamnus, Camarina, Ambracia, Potidaea. The
                    Dorians of Crete and Rhodes sent forth the settlers of the Sicilian Gela, and
                    Gela in turn became the parent of the mightier Acragas, or Agrigentum, while to
                    Megara is assigned the origin of Byzantium, the future home of Roman Caesars and
                    of Ottoman Sultans. These several communities exhibit a general likeness in
                    their dialect, their art, and their polity. Their civilization assumed a
                    magnificent phase in the splendour of Corinth and the great Dorian cities of
                    Italy and Sicily. Their powers of resistance were attested by the success with
                    which their colonies were planted in regions occupied by powerful and hostile
                    tribes, who failed to overthrow them simply because they lacked the Dorian power
                    of cohesion. Yet with the Dorians this power was subjected to strictly defined
                    bounds of action. All Dorian cities might feel a pride in belonging to the great
                    Dorian stock, and the parent city might claim certain prerogatives in its
                    colonies; but each city was for them nevertheless an absolute unit, with whose
                    independence no other city had any right to interfere, even though this
                    interference might have for its object the establishment of a pan-Hellenic
                    union. Any movements in this direction were sure to rouse the keenest and most
                    persistent opposition of the Dorian Greeks; and thus we can understand the
                    nature of the quarrel which was fought out between Sparta and Athens, and which
                    ended in the ruin of the great Ionian city, whose imperial rule must otherwise
                    have checked, and may perhaps have rooted out, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0385-0368"/> this fatal instinct of isolation. The Spartans,
                    who stood at the head of the Dorian portion of the Greek world, are regarded by
                    K. 0. Müller, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Dorians,</hi> as
                    exhibiting in their institutions and government the true type of the race. This
                    theory is strenuously combated by Grote, <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Greece,</hi> pt. ii. ch. 6; and at the least it must be said that if they
                    displayed the true Dorian type, that type must have been completely lost among
                    all the other Dorian tribes. The Spartans occupied Laconia strictly as an army
                    of occupation, and carrying out inflexibly their rigid system, they opposed an
                    uncompromising resistance, not only to luxury, but generally to art, refinement,
                    and speculation (Cox, <hi rend="italic">History of Greece,</hi> i. 72). No such
                    condition of things is found even in Crete, from which Sparta was supposed to
                    have derived her special institutions. Not only is their reputation as models of
                    Dorism altogether undeserved, but it probably would have been exceedingly
                    distasteful to the countrymen of Leonidas, Archidamus, and Agesilaus. <hi
