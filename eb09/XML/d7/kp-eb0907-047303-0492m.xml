                    appearances of asphyxia were awanting, and also the special signs of this form
                    of death. To this the name of syncopal asphyxia was given. Hence, in treating of
                    drowning, descriptions of these two forms were given, and in the case of bodies
                    recovered from the water death was said to have occurred either from asphyxia or
                    from syncope. Now, undoubtedly it often happens when persons fall or are thrown
                    into the water that, in consequence of fright or of the shock sustained by
                    violent contact with the surface of the water, no effort is made to save
                    themselves, and death rapidly ensues from syncope. In such cases none of the
                    characteristic signs of drowning are found, and, so far as the examination of
                    the body is concerned, it is impossible to decide upon the exact cause of death.
                    It is quite within the bounds of possibility that in such cases death may have
                    been effected by other means, and the body have been thrown into the water to
                    conceal the true cause of death.</p>
                <p>No such uncertainty, however, attends the investigation of a case of drowning by
                    true asphyxia, as it was called. The drowned individual struggles to reach the
                    surface of the water in his efforts to respire; as he does so he draws water
                    into his windpipe which provokes cough. This expels the air from his lungs, and
                    the water which threatened to suffocate him; and as he sinks, in his struggles
                    he endeavours again to respire, but now draws water into his mouth which chokes
                    him, and can only be got rid of by swallowing. Insensibility then comes on, and
                    death rapidly but placidly ensues from a true asphyxia.</p>
                <p>If the body be recovered—say within two hours—it is relaxed, and generally
                    presents a pallid appearance. The face is slightly congested, the features
                    placid and composed. The lips are livid, and the tongue is either protruded from
                    the mouth, firmly grasped by the teeth, or it is applied so closely to the
                    dental arch that the various teeth leave along its edge a distinct imprint. Here
                    and there on the surface of the trunk may be observed patches of lividity which
                    cannot be accounted for by the usual gravitation of blood <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0493-0474"/> which takes place more or less in all forms of
                    death. On the thighs the skin presents a roughened appearance, owing to the
                    unusual development of the papillae, and to this the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >cutis</hi><hi rend="italic">anserina,</hi> or goose-skin, has been applied.
                    Among the external signs which we are passing in review the state of the hands
                    and fingers merits special attention. In his dying agonies the drowned
                    individual spasmodically clutches for help in all directions; and, should it be
                    a pond or a canal with built retaining walls into which he has fallen, his nails
                    may be injured, sand or mud may be found beneath them, and, firmly grasped in
                    the hand, may be vegetable structures from the sides or the bottom of the pond
                    <hi rend="italic">; or,</hi> on the other hand, his fingers may present traces
                    of recent injury.</p>
                <p>Internally, the usual signs of asphyxia or apnoea are well marked. These are
                    :—(I) A distended condition of the right cavities of the heart with dark fluid
                    blood, while the left are well contracted, and are either empty or contain only
                    a small quantity of dark-coloured blood. (2) The lungs are developed, and highly
                    congested. On their tissue being incised, the cut surfaces on pressure give out
                    dark-coloured blood and frothy mucus in large quantity. (3) There is congestion
                    of the mucous lining of the air passages; and (4) dark colour and fluidity of
                    the blood through the body.</p>
                <p>Among the signs specially characteristic of this form of asphyxia we have:—(1) An
                    unusual quantity of water in the stomach (amounting to one or two pints), which
                    can only be accounted for by water having been swallowed during the last agonies
                    of death. In many cases this cannot be determined with any degree of certainty,
                    the fluid found in the stomach presenting no characters by which it can be
                    positively identified as having formed a portion of the water in which the
                    drowning occurred. In other cases, the fluid by certain characters, as its
                    taste, can be determined to be sea-water, or from its containing some foreign
                    substances, such as aquatic plants or insects, &lt;fcc., can be identified as
                    the water of the pond or river in which deceased was found. (2) Water in small
                    quantity has been detected in the airpassages. But this, as we shall show, is a
                    sign of little importance, and even in the most favourable circumstances one not
                    easily observed. (3) A peculiar foamy froth presents itself in the throat and
                    windpipe. The appearance of this froth is most striking. It is of a silvery
                    whiteness, and when closely examined is seen to be composed of an infinitude of
                    minute bullae of air. Its origin is easily explained. In the struggle for
                    breath, mucus is poured out along the air passages in greatly increased
                    quantity, and this, together with any water that may have entered, is churned up
                    along with the air which is pent up in the windpipe. Where death has been
                    attended with violent struggling this froth is poured out in great quantity, and
                    may occupy the mouth and nostrils. It is a sign of great importance, as showing
                    that the person was alive while in the water. It is, however, apt to be
                    confounded with a somewhat similar appearance in two other forms of death. When
                    acute bronchitis proves fatal, the air-passages are filled with frothy
                    mucus—which, however, differs in its external characters from the froth found in
                    the drowned. It is not foamy, and the bullae of air are much larger. In addition
                    the special signs of an acute disease of the bronchial tubes are present. In
                    death occurring during a fit of epilepsy, frothy mucus is also often found in
                    the windpipe, but in comparatively small quantity as compared with death by
                    drowning, and the bullae are of larger size.</p>
                <p>Of course when all the characteristic signs are present the evidence of drowning
                    is so much the stronger; but it is quite possible, from the presence of a
                    well-marked sign, to be certain as to the cause of death. A girl had fallen
                    asleep during the night close to a stove in the cabin of a coal barge. Her
                    clothes accidentally caught fire, and the pain of the burning quickly awoke her.
                    In her desperation she rushed up the cabin stairs and threw herself into the
                    water. In the morning her body was recovered considerably burned and covered
                    with the charred dress. The conduct of the parties in the barge at the time was
                    open to suspicion, and it was of importance to determine whether the body had
                    not been thrown into the water after death. All the signs of death by drowning
                    were well marked. The stomach contained water in considerable quantity, and
                    floating on the surface of this fluid were two charred fragments of the dress.
                    These must have been swallowed. The burnt dress was very friable, and portions
                    of it similar to those found floating in the stomach broke away on the slightest
                    touch. The surface of the canal in the immediate neighbourhood of deceased must,
                    during her dying agonies, have been covered with these fragments, and the water
                    which she swallowed happened to contain two of these fragments. Their presence
                    clearly indicated that deceased was alive after she had reached the water.
                    Again, cases have come under our notice, and many such are on record, where in
                    the hand of the deceased have been found firmly grasped a bunch of aquatic
                    vegetable structures which were known to grow only at the bottom of the pond in
                    which the body was found.</p>
                <p>Experiments on dogs show that complete immersion produces fatal asphyxia in four
                    minutes, and in man from one to two minutes suffices to cause death. On the
                    other hand, a certain amount of practice enables experienced swimmers to resist
                    asphyxia; and it is related that in 1872 the champion swimmer of England, of the
                    name of Johnson, remained under water for three minutes and ten seconds. It is
                    also known that recovery has followed after an immersion of twenty minutes. In
                    such cases it is to be presumed that the immersion was not complete. As to the
                    sensations of the drowned, after the first struggle for breath, the brain
                    becomes loaded with λ*enous blood, and unconsciousness to external objects
                    ensues. Captain Marryatt tells us that his sensations as he was drowning were
                    rather pleasant than otherwise: “The first struggle for life once over, the
                    water closing round me assumed the appearance of waving green fields It is not a
                    feeling of pain, but more like sink ing down, overpowered by sleep, in the long
                    soft grass of a cool meadow.” <hi rend="italic">{Life,</hi> vol. i. p. 74.)
                    Hence drowning is a favourite death with suicides, in whom—resolutely bent, as
                    they generally are, on self-destruction—the preliminary struggle is soon over.
                    The presence of marks of violence is our only indication of homicide, and when
                    these are absent the verdict of the medical jurist must be that the case is
                    either one of suicide or of simple accident.</p>
                <p>One circumstance, however, interferes with the recognition of the signs which we
                    have passed in review, and that is the presence of putrefaction or decay. In
                    consequence of death having occurred in such a medium as water, and as from the
                    sinking of the body it is not exposed to atmospheric air, putrefaction in the
                    colder months of the year proceeds slowly; but in summer, owing to the rapid
                    development of gas in all the soft structures of the body, but especially in the
                    intestines, the body quickly comes to the surface of the water, and
                    decomposition proceeds with great rapidity. All the canals of the body are
                    relaxed, and the pressure of gas is such as to force the froth from the air
                    passages, the water from the stomach, and the blood from the heart. “Almost
                    never,” says Devergie, the great authority on the effects of putrefaction in the
                    drowned, “can the signs of drowning during life be determined in summer, so
                    quick is the gaseous putrefaction.” Hence, too great caution cannot be exercised
                    by the medical jurist in giving a positive opinion in such cases.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that the progress of putrefaction in persons who have died by
                    drowning sh( uld differ widely <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n494/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0494-0475"/> from that of the same process in other forms of
                    death. In ordinary cases, the first signs of putrefaction manifest themselves in
                    the lower parts of the abdomen. The rest of the trunk is attacked, then the
                    extremities, and lastly the face. In drowning, on the contrary, the first part
                    of the body to show evidence of decay is the face; and in the course of a few
                    hours, so rapid is the advance of the putrefactive process, that it becomes
                    utterly impossible to recognize the features. Hence it is that it has been
                    chiefly in cases of drowning that difficulties have arisen as to identification,
                    in consequence of that part of the body by which persons are most readily
                    recognized undergoing alteration so rapidly. Devergie, who, from his official
                    connection with the Morgue at Paris, enjoyed unusual facilities for watching the
                    various stages of putrefaction in the drowned, has carefully described them, and
                    we now proceed to give a <hi rend="italic">resume</hi> of his observations. The
                    1st stage includes a green discoloration of the skin, first noticed on the face
                    and neck, which gradually extends over the body. The 2d is the evolution of gas,
                    distending the abdomen, and causing chose changes to which we have already
                    adverted. The 3d is that of brown putrefaction, which affects all the parts of
                    the body previously coloured green. The 4th is that of putrilage. The
                    discoloured parts soften, liquefy, and disappear. Under such circumstances the
                    body rapidly decays, and the bones fall asunder. On the other hand, in cool
                    weather the process of liquefaction is arrested, and the soft parts become
                    solidified, owing to their conversion into adipocire, a peculiar kind of animal
                    soap. To this stage— the 5th—Devergie gives the name of saponification. The 6th
                    stage is termed desiccation, or drying, from the continued removal of the fluids
                    from the body, which, thus hardened, is liable, from the action of the elements,
                    to undergo corrosion; and at the same time long immersion leads to the formation
                    of various incrustations. Devergie treats of these two conditions under the
                    heads of corrosion and incrustation. In the 9th and last stage we have the
                    destruction of the soft parts generally. In the liquid decomposition the part of
                    the body first attacked was the face, and the same order is observed in the
                    later stages— the soft parts of the face, now hardened by their transformation
                    into adipocire, fall off, and leave nothing but a grinning skeleton of a face
                    behind, the rest of the body being comparatively perfect. This peculiar progress
                    of the process of decomposition in the drowned explains the cases recorded of
                    apparently decapitated heads, and of bodies consisting of headless trunks,
                    having been found floating in the sea. These stages of the putrefactive process
                    Devergie states do not follow any definite order or period of sequence, and each
                    case demands careful investigation as to the condition of the body and the time
                    of the year when the drowning occurred, but as the result of his experience he
                    finds that the respective seasons of summer and winter make at least a month’s
                    difference in the period at which the earlier changes occur.</p>
                <p>As to the treatment of the drowned, a complete revolution has in recent times
                    taken place in its details. To induce a renewal of the respiration it was
                    formerly recommended that air should bo forcibly introduced into the lungs by
                    means of a pair of bellows, and, according to the older directions of the Humane
                    Society, the body was “to be well shaken every ten minutes in order to render
                    the process of animation more certain.” These expedients proved singularly
                    inefficacious except in cases where the other proposals of the society, such as
                    rubbing and the application of warmth, would of themselves have procured
                    recovery. In 1856 Dr Marshall Hall devised his ready method or postural
                    treatment of the asphyxiated, and by dissections, and by actual results in cases
                    of still birth and of drowning, proved that respiration could be imitated by
                    simply changing the position of the body. Since then Dr R. Silvester has
                    suggested a still more simple plan of postural treatment which, along with that
                    of Dr Marshall Hall, has been adopted by the Humane Society and also by the
                    National Life Boat Institution, from whose published directions we give the
                    modern treatment of the drowned by both methods, which is “in use in Her
                    Majesty’s Fleet, in the Coast-guard Service, and at all the stations of the
                    British Army at home and abroad.”</p>
                <p>Directions for Restoring the Apparently Drowned.</p>
                <p>I. Send immediately for medical assistance, blankets, and dry clothing, but
                    proceed to treat the patient <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> on the spot, in
                    the open air, with the face downward, whether on shore or.afloat; exposing the
                    face, neck, and chest to the wind, except in severe weather, and removing all
                    tight clothing from the neck and chest, especially the braces. The points to be
                    aimed at are—first and <hi rend="italic">immediately,</hi> the restoration of
                    breathing.; and secondly, after breathing is restored, the promotion of warmth
                    and circulation. The efforts to restore breathing must be commenced immediately
                    and energetically, and persevered in for one or two hours, or until a medical
                    man has pronounced that life is extinct. Efforts to promote warmth and
                    circulation, beyond removing the wet clothes and drying the skin, must not be
                    made until the first appearance of natural breathing; for if circulation of the
                    blood be induced before breathing has recommenced, the restoration to life will
                    be endangered.</p>
                <p>II. —To <hi rend="smallcaps">Restore Breathing.—</hi><hi rend="italic">To clear
                    the throat.—</hi> Place the patient on the floor or ground with the face
                    downwards, and one of the arms under the forehead, in which position all fluids
                    will more readily escape by the mouth, and the tongue itself will fall forward,
                    leaving the entrance into the windpipe free. Assist this operation by wiping and
                    cleansing the mouth. If satisfactory breathing commences, use the treatment
                    described below to promote warmth. If there be only slight breathing—or no
                    breathing— or if the breathing fail, then—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To excite breathing—</hi> Turn the patient well and instantly
                    on the side, supporting the head, and excite the nostrils with snuff, hartshorn,
                    and smelling salts, or tickle the throat with a feather, &amp;c. if they are at
                    hand. Rub the chest and face warm, and dash cold water, or cold and hot water
                    alternately, on them. If there be. no success, lose not a moment, but
                    instantly—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To imitate breathing—</hi> Replace the patient on the face,
                    raising and supporting the chest well on a folded coat or other article of
                    dress. Turn the body very gently on the side and a little beyond, and then
                    briskly on the face, back again, repeating these measures cautiously,
                    efficiently, and perseveringly, about fifteen times in the minute, or once every
                    four or five seconds, occasionally varying the side. (By placing the patient on
                    the chest, the weight of the body forces the air out; when turned on the side,
                    this pressure is removed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n495/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0495-0476"/>
                <p>and air enters the chest. ) On each occasion that the body is replaced on the
                    face, make uniform but efficient pressure with brisk movement on the back
                    between and below the shoulder-blades or bones on each side, removing the
                    pressure immediately before turning the body on the side. During the whole of
                    the operations let one person attend solely to the movements of the head and of
                    the arm placed under it. (The first measure increases the expiration—the second
                    commences inspiration. ) The result is respiration or natural breathing, and, if
                    not too late, life.</p>
                <p>Whilst the above operations are being proceeded with, dry the hands and feet, and
                    as soon as dry clothing or blankets can be procured, strip the body, and cover
                    or gradually reclothe it, but taking care not to interfere with the efforts to
                    restore breathing.</p>
                <p>III. Should these efforts not prove successful in the course of from two to five
                    minutes, proceed to imitate breathing by Dr Silvester’s method, as follows
                    :—Place the patient on the back on a flat surface, inclined a little upwards
                    from the feet; raise and support the head and shoulders on a small firm cushion
                    or folded article of dress placed under the shoulder-blades. Draw forward the
                    patient’s tongue, and keep it projecting beyond the lips; an elastic band over
                    the tongue and under the chin will answer this purpose, or a piece of string or
                    tape may be tied round them, or by raising the lower jaw, the teeth may be made
                    to retain the tongue in that position. Remove all tight clothing from about the
                    neck and chest, especially the braces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To imitate the movements of breathing—</hi> Standing at the
                    patient’s head, grasp the arms just above the elbows, and draw the arms gently
                    and steadily upwards above the head, and keep them stretched upwards for two
                    seconds. (By this means air is drawn into the lungs.) Then turn down the
                    patient’s arms, and press them gently and firmly for two seconds against the
                    sides of the chest. (By this means air is pressed out of the lungs.) Repeat
                    these measures alternately, deliberately, and perseveringly, about fifteen times
                    in a minute, until a spontaneous effort to respire is perceived, immediately
                    upon which cease to imitate the movements of breathing, and proceed to induce
                    circulation and warmth.</p>
                <p>IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Treatment after Natural Breathing has been
                    restored.</hi><hi rend="italic">To promote warmth and circulation—</hi> Commence
                    rubbing the limbs upwards, with firm grasping pressure and energy, using
                    handkerchiefs, flannels, &amp;c. (By this measure the blood is propelled along
                    the veins towards the heart. ) The friction must be continued under the blankets
                    or over the dry clothing. Promote the warmth of the body by the application of
                    hot flannels, bottles, or bladders of hot water, heated bricks, &amp;c., to the
                    pit of the stomach, the armpits, between the thighs, and to the soles of the
                    feet. If the patient has been carried to a house after respiration has been
                    restored, be careful to let the air play freely about the room.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of life, a teaspoonful of warm water should be given; and
                    then, if the power of swallowing have returned, small quantities of wine, warm
                    brandy-and-water, or coffee should be administered. The patient should be kept
                    in bed, and a disposition to sleep encouraged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Observations.</hi> —The above treatment should be
                    persevered in for some hours, as it is an erroneous opinion that persons are
                    irrecoverable because life does not soon make its appearance, persons having
                    been restored after persevering for many hours. The appearances which generally
                    accompany death are the following :—breathing and the heart’s action cease
                    entirely; the eyelids are generally half closed, the pupils dilated; the tongue
                    approaches to the under edges of the lips, and these, as well as the nostrils,
                    are covered with a frothy mucus; coldness and pallor of surface increase.</p>
                <p>The following cautions should be attended to:—Prevent unnecessary crowding of
                    persons round th body, especially if in an apartment. Avoid rough usage, and do
                    not allow rhé body to remain on the back unless the tongue is secured. Under no
                    circumstances hold the body up by the feet. On no account place the body in ⅛
                    warm bath unless under medical direction, and even then it should only be
                    employed as a momentary excitant.</p>
                <p>Dr Silvester’s method is more generally practised that that of Dr M. Hall,—its
                    special advantages being that it commences by imitating inspiration, and more
                    completely distends the chest. But we are of opinion that the combination of the
                    two methods as recommended above should undoubtedly be practised in every
                    case.</p>
                <p>It has frequently been pointed out that in fatal cases of drowning the right
                    auricle of the heart is very much distended; and it has been plausibly urged by
                    Professor Struthers of Aberdeen <hi rend="italic">{Edinburgh Medical
                    Journal,</hi> 1857, p. 418) that the movements of respiration may be
                    successfully imitated, and air may enter the lungs, and yet the patient may not
                    recover in consequence of the stoppage of the action of the heart. He recommends
                    that blood should be drawn from the external jugular vein, so as to relieve the
                    engorged auricle, which, from its distension, is paralyzed. The abstraction of a
                    small quantity of blood is all that is required to effect this—from half to one
                    or two table-spoonfuls. Finally, as a last resource, galvanism must be had
                    recourse to. Both this and the blood-letting must be practised by a qualified
                    medical man; but it is important to know that the methods of Dr Hall and Dr
                    Silvester can easily be learned by any one, and that, if early and perseveringly
                    applied, they are attended with a large measure of success. The treatment must
                    be continued for at least eight hours, should there be an absence of extreme
                    pallor, and while any heat of the body remains.</p>
                <p>The question of the treatment of the drowned cannot be regarded as definitely
                    settled, and the plans of Hall and Silvester have from time to time been
                    subjected to criticism. Among the latest suggestions is that of Dr B. Howard of
                    America, who, by means of what he terms his “direct” method, which mainly
                    consists in pressure of the chest from above (the patient being placed on his
                    back), claims that air is more easily introduced into the lungs, and that the
                    expansion and contraction of the chest are more perfectly attained (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancet,</hi> August 11, 1877). At the meeting of the British
                    Medical Association at Alan-ehester 1877, Dr Howard practically demonstrated his
                    plan on the living subject, and there can no doubt that involuntary respiration
                    was readily produced. Further evidence, however, is necessary from actual cases
                    of suspended animation.</p>
