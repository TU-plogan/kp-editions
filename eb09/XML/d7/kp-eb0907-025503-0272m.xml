                    :—wings two, mesothoracic, membranous, mostly horizontal and transparent, not
                    capable of being folded, with nervures generally few and longitudinally
                    disposed, and having a pair of alulets at the base; metathoracic wings replaced
                    by a pair of halteres or balancers; mouth antliate (whence the Fabrician name
                    <hi rend="italic">Antidata</hi> for the Order), with a proboscis formed of the
                    labium, inclosing modifications of other usual parts of the mouth, except of the
                    labial palpi, which are wanting; tarsi õ-jointed; prothorax reduced to a very
                    small collar. They are divided into two sections—the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Orthorhapha,</hi> in which the pupa is incomplete (the details of the future
                    perfect insect being visible), and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyclorhapha,</hi> in
                    which the pupa is coarctate (of a hard, uniform surface, cylindrical, rounded at
                    the extremities). The <hi rend="smallcaps">Orthorhapha</hi> are again divided
                    into two sub-sections—the <hi rend="italic">Nematocera</hi> (antennae composed
                    of more than 6 joints, palpi 4- or 5-jointed), and the <hi rend="italic"

                    three tribes, viz. :—1, the <hi rend="italic">Olìgoneura,</hi> in which the

                    proboscis is wanting, the body leathery, and the larvae have no oesophageal
                    frame. Of these, the <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi> comprise three tribes,
                    viz. :—1, the <hi rend="italic">Hypocera,</hi> in which the antennae are
                    inserted quite close to the mouth (fam. <hi rend="italic">Phoridae);</hi> 2, the

                    The <hi rend="italic">Eproboscidea</hi> comprise three families, all
                    parasitic,—the <hi rend="italic">Hippoboscidae, Nycteribiidae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Streblidae,</hi> the latter a very limited and aberrant group
                    stated to be oviparous, and having the wings distinct and well veined, unlike
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nycteribiidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The sub-order <hi rend="italic">Aphaniptera</hi> consists of two families only,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pulicidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Platypsyllidae</hi>
                    (the latter so peculiar in structure as to have been claimed for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera).</hi> Its members are parasitic, entirely coriaceous,
                    much compressed or flattened, and destitute of wings or balancers, these organs
                    being represented by more or less obsolete leathery plates; they have 3- or
                    4-jointed antennae, 4-jointed maxillary and 3-jointed labial palpi, and
                    5-jointed tarsi. The larvae of such of them as are known are vermiform, and the
                    pupae inactive, incomplete. If not considered as a sub-order, these two families
                    would apparently have to be placed at the head of the Eucephalous <hi
                    rend="italic">Nematocera,—</hi> in that case, of course, deranging the
                    characters given for that tribe.</p>
                <p>Other families of the <hi rend="italic">Diptεra</hi> have been proposed, but need
                    not be here noticed, being as yet scarcely established, or merely entitled to
                    the rank of sub-families (the <hi rend="italic">Muscidae</hi> especially
                    comprising many of the latter).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Diptera,</hi> in number of species and individuals (very
                    many having swarming propensities), have been considered to be the order of
                    animated beings most diffused over the globe; and the extremes of heat and cold
                    seem alike indifferent to them. They have long been known to abound in very high
                    latitudes; and, among the insects brought back by Captain Feilden, the
                    naturalist attached to Sir George Nares’s Arctic expedition, were Dipterous
                    species of apparently the most feeble organism. The Rev. A. E. Eaton, attached
                    as naturalist to the late “Transit of Venus” expedition, discovered also, on the
                    desolate shares of Kerguelen’s Island, <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> of a
                    degraded type suitable to the climatic peculiarities of the locality. Tropical
                    countries naturally furnish the most developed and in some cases extraordinary
                    forms,—the genera <hi rend="italic">Pangonia, Rhopalomera, A</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chias,</hi><hi rend="italic">Diopsis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elaphomyia,</hi> and various <hi rend="italic">Acroceridae</hi> (even in
                    temperate regions) abounding in instances of exaggerated and apparently
                    unnatural structure. To a geographical distribution of the widest extent, the
                    flies add a range of habits of the most diversified nature; they are both animal
                    and vegetable feeders, au enormous number of their species acting as scavengers
                    in consuming putrescent or decomposing matter of both kinds. The phytophagous
                    species are attached to various parts of the plant, dead or alive; and the
                    carnivorous in like manner feed on dead or living flesh, many being parasitic on
                    living animals of various classes (even <hi rend="italic">Reptilia,</hi> as a
                    fly is parasitic upon frogs in Australia), and more especially upon other
                    insects, including <hi rend="italic">llymenoptera,</hi> of which they frequently
                    simulate the external facies. No reasonable approximation can be made to the
                    number of existing species, as the <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> are not
                    collected or examined with the same assiduity as the more attractive orders.
                    Schiner. however, in 1868, stated the number then recorded to be no less than
                    20,800, to which a considerable annual increase is being made <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g.,</hi> 550 species in 1869, and 230 in 1875); and more than 4θT)O
                    different genera have been found necessary for their reception. These must be
                    nevertheless taken as vastly below the mark of existent species. No catalogue of
                    the British species has recently been made; Westwood, in 1840, enumerated about
                    2350.</p>
                <p>Considered in relation to man, there would seem to be sufficient reason for
                    placing this apparently feeble order at the head of our insect enemies. Allowing
                    for the good effected by the clearing away of animal and vegetable impurities by
                    many species, and for the indirect advantage caused by the known instances of a
                    few others assisting in the fecundation of plants, there remains a long list of
                    direct injuries effected by <hi rend="italic">Diptera.</hi> Without laying undue
                    stress upon the formation of galls and other vegetable deteriorations caused by
                    many species, there can be no doubt that the destruction of grass-lands by the
                    larva of the crane-fly, or “Daddy Long-Legs” <hi rend="italic">{Tipula</hi><hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Oscinis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chlorops,</hi> are of very
                    serious consequence. Our domestic animals, moreover, suffer from the bot-flies
                    <hi rend="italic">{(Estrus,</hi><hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">aster

                    “Tsetse,” <hi rend="italic">Glossina morsitans,</hi> which is of sufficient
                    power to close the exploration of a region in which it occurs. Nor is man
                    himself spared; the petty inconveniences of wasted food, broken rest, and slight
                    personal <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n274/mode/1up"

                    regions from fly-larvae, gnats, midges, &amp;c., and the parasitic species, are
                    aggravated in both warmer and more boreal countries to a dangerous extent, and
                    have even been found prejudicial to life. There are many recorded instances of
                    the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Diptera.</hi> feeding upon the human intestinal
                    canal, and of species (dubiously referred to <hi rend="italic">Oesirus)</hi>
                    attacking man; as also of loathsome cases of individuals being eaten alive by
                    the larvae of flies, developed in food secreted about the persons of beggars.
                    Various cases have, moreover, recently been noted of the diffusion of the germs
                    of disease by flies; and instances of death from transference of putrid animal
                    matter in New Caledonia have also been recorded. One of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscidae, Ludlia</hi><hi rend="italic">hominivoτax,</hi> is known to have
                    caused considerable destruction to human life among French convicts in Cayenne,
                    laying its eggs in the mouth or nostrils during sleep; and a very precise
                    account of much disease and death in man and domestic animals at Mohilew, by a
                    similar action of another of the same family, <hi rend="italic">Sarcophila
                    wofdfarti,</hi> has recently been given by Portchinsky, a Russian naturalist. It
                    is perhaps superfluous to speak of mosquitoes, too well known since the Biblical
                    “plague of flies;” but it may be observed that the corresponding plague of
                    sand-flies, <hi rend="italic">Simulium,</hi> so well known to affect the eyes of
                    sufferers from ophthalmia in Egypt, has made its appearance in the deserts of
                    West Australia, where the last exploring expedition of Mr Ernest Giles suffered
                    severely from it.</p>
                <p>The antiquity of the fly is scarcely more than historical. Very few fossil
                    species are known (5 only being recorded from the Solenhof en lithographic
                    Oolite); but the more recent “flies in amber” are so constantly found that the
                    expression has become a common proverb. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. c. r.)</hi></p>
