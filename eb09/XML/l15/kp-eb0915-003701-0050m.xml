                    Italy. It thus comprised the modern province of the Basilicata, together with
                    the greater part of the Principato Citeriore and a small portion of Calabria.
                    The precise limits were the river Silarus on the north-west, which separated it
                    from Campania, and the Bradanus, which flows into the Gulf of Tarentum, on the
                    north-east; while the two little rivers Lius and Crathis, flowing from the ridge
                    of the Apennines to the sea on the west and east, marked the limits of the
                    province on the side of Bruttium.</p>
                <p>Almost the whole of the province thus limited is occupied by the rugged masses of
                    the Apennines, which in this part of Italy can hardly be said to constitute a
                    range of mountains so much as a group of lofty masses, huddled together in a
                    very irregular manner. The main ridge, however (if it be taken as determined by
                    the watershed), approaches much more nearly to the western sea than to the Gulf
                    of Tarentum, and is continued from the lofty knot of mountains immediately on
                    the frontiers of Samnium, nearly due south, till it approaches within a few
                    miles of the Gulf of Policastro, and thenceforward is separated from the sea by
                    only a narrow interval till it enters the province of Bruttium. Just within the
                    frontier of Lucania rises the very lofty group of Monte Pυllino, the highest
                    summit of which attains to an elevation of above 7000 feet, the greatest that is
                    found in the southern Apennines. Towards the east the mountains descend by a
                    much more gradual slope to the Gulf of Tarentum, constituting long ridges of
                    hills which subside by degrees to the strip of plain that immediately adjoins
                    the shores of the gulf. This narrow strip is somewhat wider from the mouth of
                    the Bradanus to that of the Siris, and again expands to a considerable extent at
                    the mouth of the Crathis, but between the two a group of rugged hills descends
                    quite to the sea, and forms the headland of Roseto. The consequence of this
                    constitution is that while the rivers which flow to the Tyrrhenian Sea are of
                    comparatively little importance, those that descend towards the Gulf of Tarentum
                    have much longer courses, and attain to a considerable magnitude. Of these the
                    most important are—the Bradanus (still called Bradano), which rises near
                    Potentia, and enters the gulf just to the north of the ruins of Metapontum; the
                    Casuentus (Basiento), which has a course almost exactly parallel with the
                    preceding; the Aciris or Agri; and the Siris or Sinno. The Crathis, which forms
                    at its mouth the southern limit of the province, belongs almost wholly to
                    Bruttium, but it receives a tributary, the Sybaris (Coscile), which flows from
                    the mountains of Lucania. The only considerable stream on the western side of
                    Lucania is the Silarus or Sele, which constitutes its northern boundary, and has
                    two important tributaries in the Calor or Calore, and the Tanagrus, which joins
                    it from the south, after flowing through one of those trough-like upland valleys
                    so characteristic of the Apennines.</p>
                <p>The province of Lucania was so called from the people of that name, by whom it
                    was conquered about the middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Previous to that period it was included under the general name of Oenotria,
                    which was applied by the Greeks to the whole of the southernmost portion of
                    Italy. The mountainous regions of the interior were occupied by the tribes known
                    as G⅛otrians and Chones, while the coasts on both sides were occupied by Greek
                    colonies, which attained to great power and prosperity, and doubtless exercised
                    a kind of protectorate over the interior also. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Graecia</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Magna.)</hi> The Lucanians were a Sabellian
                    race, an offshoot of the Samnites of Central Italy, who pressed downwards
                    towards the south until they gradually conquered the whole country (with the
                    exception of the Greek towns on the coast) from the borders of Samnium and
                    Campania to the southern extremity of Italy. Subsequently, however, the
                    inhabitants of the peninsula which forms the extreme south (now known as
                    Calabria) broke out into insurrection, and under the name of Bruttians succeeded
                    in establishing their independence, after which the Lucanians became confined
                    within the limits already described. After this time we find them engaged in
                    hostilities with the Tarentines, and with Alexander, king of Epirus, who was
                    called in by that people to their assistance, 326 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    It was immediately after this that they first entered into relations with Rome,
                    with which they were sometimes in alliance, but more frequently engaged in
                    hostilities, during the long-continued wars of the Romans with the Samnites. On
                    the landing of Pyrrhus in Italy (281 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) they were
                    among the first to declare in his favour, and in consequence found themselves
                    exposed to the full brunt of the resentment of Rome when the departure of
                    Pyrrhus left his allies at the mercy of the victorious Romans. It was not,
                    however, till after several campaigns that they were reduced to complete
                    subjection (272 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). Notwithstanding this lesson,
                    the Lucanians again espoused the cause of Hannibal during the Second Punic War
                    (216 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and their territory became the theatre of
                    war during several successive campaigns, and was ravaged in turn by both
                    contending armies. It is clear that the country never recovered the effects of
                    these disasters, and under the Roman government Lucania fell into a state of
                    complete decay, to which the Social War (90-88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    appears to have given the finishing stroke. In the time of Strabo the Greek
                    cities on the coast, once so rich and flourishing, had fallen into utter
                    insignificance, and the few towns of the interior were poor places of no
                    importance. A large part of the province was given up to pasture, and the
                    mountains of the interior were covered with vast forests, which abounded in wild
                    boars, bears, and wolves.</p>
                <p>The towns on the east coast, adjoining the Gulf of Tarentum, were—Metapontum, a
                    few miles south of the Bradanus: Heraclea, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0051-0038"/> at the mouth of the Aciris; and Siris, on the
                    river of the same name. Close to its southern frontier stood Sybaris, which was
                    destroyed in 510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but subsequently replaced by
                    Thurii, founded within a few miles of the same site. On the west coast stood
                    Posidonia, known under the Roman government as Paestum, immediately south of the
                    Silaras; below that came Elea or Yelia, Pyxus, called by the Romans Buxentum,
                    and Laus, near the frontier of the province towards Bruttium. Of the towns of
                    the interior, none of which ever attained to any importance, the most
                    considerable was Potentia, still called Potenza, and now the capital of the
                    Basilicata. To the north, near the frontier of Apulia, were Acheruntia and
                    Bantia <hi rend="italic">y</hi> while due south from Potentia was Gruuιentum,
                    and still farther in that direction were Nerulum and Muranum. In the upland
                    valley of the Tanagrus were Atina, Forum Popilii, and Consilinum; Eburi (Eboli)
                    and Volceii (Buccino), though to the north of the Silarus, were also included in
                    Lucania.</p>
                <p>For administrative purposes under the Roman empire, Lucania was always united
                    with Brattium. The two together constituted the third region of Augustus. (E. H.
