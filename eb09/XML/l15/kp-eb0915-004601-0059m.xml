                    writer of the same name, at Samosata. His parents, who were Christians, died
                    when he was in his twelfth year. In his'youth he studied under Macarius of
                    Edessa, and after receiving baptism he adopted a strictly ascetic life, and
                    devoted himself with zeal to the continual study of Scripture. Settling at
                    Antioch, he became a presbyter, and, while supporting himself by his skill as a
                    swift writer, became celebrated as a teacher, pupils crowding to him from all
                    quarters, so that he is regarded as the founder of the famous theological school
                    of Antioch. He did not escape suspicion of heresy, and is represented as the
                    connecting link between Paul of Samosata and Arius. Indeed, on the deposition of
                    the former, he was excluded from ecclesiastical fellowship by three successive
                    bishops of Antioch, while the latter seems to have been among his pupils
                    (Theodoret, <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> i. 3, 4). He was, however, restored
                    before the outbreak of persecution, and the reputation won by his high character
                    and learning was confirmed by his courageous martyrdom. He was carried to
                    Nicomedia before the cruel Maximin, and persisting in his faith perished 312
                    A.D., under torture and hunger, which he refused to satisfy with food offered to
                    idols. His remains were conveyed to Drepanum in Bithynia, and under Constantine
                    the town was founded anew in his honour with the name of Helenopolis, and
                    exempted from taxes by the emperor (327 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> see <hi
                    rend="italic">Chron. Pasch.,</hi> Bonn ed., p. 527). Here, on the day after
                    Epiphany 387 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (the day on which his martyrdom was
                    commemorated), Chrysostom delivered the panegyrical homily from which, with
                    notices in Eusebius (ZZ. <hi rend="italic">E.,</hi> ix. G), Theodoret (Zoe.

                    Metaphrastes (cited at length in Bernhardy’s notes to Suidas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >s.v. ro0cυeι),</hi> the facts above given are derived. See also, for the
                    celebration of his day in the Syriac churches, Wright, <hi rend="italic">Cat. of

                <p>Jerome says, “Feruntur eius de Fide libelli et breves ad nonnullos epistolae but
                    only a short fragment of one epistle remains <hi rend="italic">(Chrom
                    Pasch.,</hi> p. 516). The authorship of a confession of faith ascribed to Lucian
                    and put forth at the semi-Arian synod of Antioch (341 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> is questioned. Lucian’s most important literary labour was his
                    edition of the Septuagint corrected by the Hebrew text, which, according to
                    Jerome <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Ruf.,</hi> ii. 77), was in current use from
                    Constantinople to Antioch. That the edition of Lucian is represented by the text
                    used by Chrysostom and Theodoret, as well as by certain extant MSS., such as the
                    Arundelian of the British Museum, was proved* by F. Field <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Prol. ad Origenis Ηexapla,</hi> cap. ix.), who points out that Lucian filled
                    up lacunae of the Septuagint text as compared with the Hebrew from the other
                    Greek translations, that his method was harmonistic, and that he sometimes
                    indulged in paraphrastic additions and other changes. Before the publication of
                    Field's <hi rend="italic">Hexapla,</hi> Lagarde had already directed his
                    attention to the Antiochian text (as that of Lucian may be called). See his <hi

                    promised, and the means for effecting it described. The accomplishment of this
                    task may be looked to as the first step in the process of tracing backwards the
                    history of the Septuagint.</p>
                <p>From a statement of Jerome in his preface to the gospels it seems probable that
                    Lucian had also a share in fixing the Syrian recension of the New Testament
                    text, but of this it is impossible to speak with certainty. Compare the
                    introductory volume of Westcott and Hort’s <hi rend="italic">New Testament,</hi>
                    p. 138.</p>
