                    given by foreigners to the Vierwaldstättersee, or lake of the four forest
                    cantons of Switzerland. Only a small portion of its shores lie within the canton
                    of Lucerne, but the name has been taken from the most considerable town which it
                    approaches. Lying on the north-west side of the Alps of central Switzerland,
                    this lake has extraordinary interest for the physical geographer, for the lover
                    of natural scenery, and for all who feel sympathy with the story of Swiss
                    independence. Like most of the other Alpine lakes, it lies altogether among the
                    <hi rend="italic">Voralpen,</hi> or outer ranges of the Alps, but is remarkable
                    for the extreme irregularity of its form, which suggests problems of much
                    difficulty to the orographer. The great majority of the Alpine lakes occupy
                    depressions or excavations in a single line of valley; and, so far as their form
                    is concerned, the facts appear to be equally reconcilable with the views of
                    those geologists who believe the lake basins to have been hollowed out by great
                    glaciers as with those which refer their origin to disturbances of relative
                    level, and restrict the action of the ancient glaciers to a secondary part in
                    the result. The Lake of Lucerne, however, appears to occupy portions of four
                    different valleys, orographically distinct, and connected only by narrow and
                    tortuous channels. Commencing at its eastern extremity, we have the portion
                    called the Bay of Uri, which at its southern end receives the considerable
                    stream of the Reuss, bearing down the drainage of the Alps adjoining the pass of
                    St Gotthard. This extends from south to north about 8 miles, with an average
                    breadth of less than 2 miles, enclosed between steep limestone mountains rising
                    from 4000 to 5000 feet above its surface. At the north end of the Bay of Uri a
                    low tract, only a few miles in width, divides the shore of the lake from the
                    little Lake of Lowerz, and another similar tract divides the latter from the
                    Lake of Zug, so that it seems natural to conclude that if the Bay of Uri had
                    been excavated by ice action it would have retained its original direction and
                    carried the waters of the Reuss to the Lake of Zug. In point of fact the channel
                    of the lake is bent abruptly westward round the promontory of Treib, and extends
                    in the same direction nearly 10 miles, with the local designation of
                    Buochsersee. But this channel is closed at its western end by a low neck of
                    land, and the passage for navigation is through a narrow strait, less than half
                    a mile wide, which connects the Buochsersee, lying south of the Bürgenstein and
                    the Vitznauerstock, with a third basin occupying the bottom of the valley which
                    lies north of those ridges. Proceeding westward along this latter portion of the
                    lake, we find two deep bays, several miles in length, opening on either hand,
                    while a third extends somewhat north of west to the town of Lucerne. The bay on
                    the left hand, opening towards the south west, is called the Alpnachersee, while
                    that on the opposite or north-east side is the Bay of Küssnacht. At the central
                    point where these meet it is seen that they lie in a continuous line of valley
                    extending from the Briinig Pass to the Lake of Zug, as the Bay of Küssnacht is
                    separated from the latter only by a low isthmus. Those who refuse to regard
                    glaciers as the chief agents in the excavation of lake basins ask how it can be
                    supposed that a glacier from the valley of the Reuss could have accomplished the
                    hollowing out of the middle portions of the lake, and further inquire whether
                    the glacier from the valley of Sarnen, which is supposed to have excavated the
                    bays of Alpnach and Küssnacht, should not have also cleared away the isthmus
                    between the latter and the Lake of Zug, leading the drainage of the lake in that
                    direction. The question as to the true origin of lake basins in the Alps cannot
                    be satisfactorily discussed until their forms have been determined by numerous
                    and accurate soundings, and this has as yet been done for the Lake of Como
                    alone. The greatest depth hitherto measured in the Lake of Lucerne is 1040 feet,
                    but no connected series of soundings appear to have as yet been macle. The mean
                    height of the surface above the sea-level is 1437 feet, or 68 feet higher than
                    the L ike of Zug.</p>
                <p>The irregularity of its form is the chief cause of the unequalled variety which
                    characterizes the scenery of the Lake of Lucerne, but the geological structure
                    of the mountains that enclose it much enhances the effect. Its eastern portion
                    lies amid the Secondary limestone rocks which are everywhere in the Alps marked
                    by sharp peaks and ridges and precipitous crags; the middle part is enclosed by
                    great masses of Tertiary conglomerate, called in Switzerland Nagelfluhe, which
                    constitutes such mountains as the Righi and the Bürgenstein, showing steep faces
                    with gently sloping summits; while the western extremity is surrounded by
                    swelling hills richly planted and dotted with bright looking hamlets or solitary
                    farm-houses. The forests which once covered the greater part of this region, and
                    give the local designation to the four original cantons of Switzerland, have
                    been extensively thinned, but enough yet remain to add another element to the
                    charms of the scenery. Vineyards with their formal rows of stakes are scarcely
                    seen on the shores of the lake, but orchards surround most of the houses, and
                    the walnut grows to great perfection. Lucerne is the only town on the lake.
                    Altdorf, the chief town of Uri, stands nearly 2 miles from the head of the Bay
                    of Uri, and Schwyz, capital of the canton of that name, is more than 3 miles
                    from the shore; but since the introduction of steam navigation several of the
                    villages on its coast have largely increased in population.</p>
                <p>Modern scepticism has thrown doubt upon many of the details in the popular
                    history of the origin of Swiss independence; but it is certain that the shores
                    of this lake nurtured the men who commenced the heroic efforts that secured
                    freedom for their country. Here, at the beginning of the 14th century, in an age
                    when nearly all Europe was in the hands of feudal oppressors, a handful o <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> mountaineers drove out the local tyrants and levelled
                    their strong holds, and a few years later, on the fields of Morgarten and
                    Sempach, confronted and put to flight the chivalry of Austria. The man who can
                    visit unmoved the Griitli, the spot, overlooking the Bay of Uri, consecrated by
                    popular tradition as the scene of the first meeting of the confederates on the
                    night of the 7th October 1307, must be devoid of all sense of the sublime in
                    natural scenery and of the heroic in human action. (J. B.)</p>
