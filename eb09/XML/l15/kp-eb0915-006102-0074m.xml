                    1465. He himself wrote his name as “Bernardin Lovino,” but the spelling “Luini”
                    is now very generally adopted. Few facts are known regarding the life of this
                    illustrious and delightful painter, and it is only since a comparatively recent
                    date that he has even been credited with the production of his own works, and
                    with the fame thereto appertaining, as many of them had, in the lapse of years
                    and laxity of attribution, got assigned to Leonardo. It appears that Luini
                    studied painting at Vercelli under Giovenone, or perhaps under Lo Scotto. He
                    reached Milan either after the departure of Da Vinci in 1500, or shortly before
                    that event; it is thus left uncertain whether or not the two artists had any
                    personal acquaintance, but Luini was at any rate in the painting-school
                    established in Milan by the great Florentine. In the latter works of Luini a
                    certain influence from the style of Raphael is superadded to that, far more
                    prominent and fundamental, from the style of Leonardo; but there is nothing to
                    show that he ever visited Rome. His two sons are the only pupils who have with
                    confidence been assigned to him; and even this can scarcely be true of the
                    younger, who was born in 1530, when Bernardino was well advanced in years, and
                    was not far from the close of his career. Gaudenzio Ferrari has also been termed
                    his disciple. One of the sons, Evangelista, has left little which can now be
                    identified; the other, Aurelio, was accomplished in perspective and landscape
                    work. There was likewise a brother of Bernardino, named Ambrogio, a competent
                    painter. Bernardino, who hardly ever left Lombardy, had some merit as a poet,
                    and is said to have composed a treatise on painting. The precise date of his
                    death is unknown; he may perhaps have survived till about 1540. A serene,
                    contented, and happy mind, naturally expressing itself in forms of grace and
                    beauty, seems stamped upon all the works of Luini. The same character is
                    traceable in his portrait, painted in an upper group in his fresco of Christ
                    Crowned with Thorns in the Ambrosian library in Milan,—a venerable bearded
                    personage. The only anecdote which has been preserved of him tells a similar
                    tale. It is said that for the single figures of saints in the church at Saronno
                    he received a sum of money equal to 22 francs per day, along with wine, bread,
                    and lodging; and he was so well satisfied with this remuneration that, in
                    completing the commission, he painted a Nativity for nothing.</p>
                <p>Along with this natural sweetness of character, a dignified suavity is the most
                    marked characteristic of Luini’s works. They are constantly beautiful, with a
                    beauty which depends at least as much upon the loving self-withdrawn expression
                    as upon the mere refinement and attractiveness of form. This quality of
                    expression appears in all Luini’s productions, whether secular or sacred, and
                    imbues the latter with a peculiarly religious grace—not ecclesiastical unction,
                    but the devoutness of the heart. His heads, while extremely like those painted
                    by Leonardo, have less subtlety and involution and less variety of expression,
                    but fully as much amenity. He began indeed with a somewhat dry style, as in the
                    Pietà in the church of the Passione; but this soon developed into the quality
                    which distinguishes all his most renowned works; although his execution,
                    especially as regards modelling, was never absolutely on a par with that of
                    Leonardo. Luini’s paintings do not exhibit an impetuous style of execution, and
                    certainly not a negligent one; yet it appears that he was in fact a very rapid
                    worker, as his picture of the Crowning with Thorns, painted for the College del
                    S. Sepolcro, and containing a large number of figures, is recorded to have
                    occupied him only thirty-eight days, to which an assistant added eleven. His
                    method was simple and expeditious, the shadows being painted with the pure
                    colour laid on thick, while the lights are of the same colour thinly used, and
                    mixed with a little white. The frescos <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n75/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0075-0062"/> exhibit more freedom of hand than the oil
                    pictures; and they are on the whole less like the work of Da Vinci, having at an
                    early date a certain resemblance to the style of Mantegna, as later on to that
                    of Raphael. Luini’s colouring is mostly rich, and his light and shade
                    forcible.</p>
                <p>Among his principal works the following are to he mentioned. At Saronno are
                    frescos painted towards 1525, representing the life of the Madonna—her Marriage,
                    the Presentation of the Infant Saviour in the Temple, the Adoration of the Magi,
                    and other incidents. His own portrait appears in the subject of the youthful
                    Jesus with the Doctors in the Temple. This series—in which some comparatively
                    archaic details occur, such as gilded nimbuses—was partly repeated from one
                    which Luini had executed towards 1520 in S. Croce. In the Brera Gallery, Milan,
                    are frescos from the suppressed church of La Pace and the Convent della
                    Felucca,—the former treating subjects from the life of the Virgin, the latter,
                    of a classic kind, more decorative in manner. The subject of girls playing at
                    the game of “hot-cockles,” and that of three angels depositing St Catherine in
                    her sepulchre, are particularly memorable, each of them a work of perfect charm
                    and grace in its way. In the Casa Silva, Milan, are frescos from Ovid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Metamorphoses.</hi> The Monastero Maggiore of Milan (or church of
                    S. Maurizio) is a noble treasure-house of Luini’s art,—including a large
                    Crucifixion, with about one hundred and forty figures; Christ Bound to the
                    Column, between figures of Saints Catherine and Stephen, and the founder of the
                    chapel kneeling before Catherine; the Martyrdom of this Saint; the Entombment of
                    Christ; and a large number of other subjects. In the Ambrosian library is the
                    fresco (already mentioned), covering one entire wall of the Sala della S.
                    Corona, of Christ Crowned with Thorns, with two executioners, and on each side
                    six members of a confraternity; in the same building the Infant Baptist Playing
                    with a Lamb; in the Brera, the Virgin Enthroned, with Saints, dated 1521; in the
                    Louvre, the Daughter of Herodias receiving the Head of the Baptist; in the
                    Esterhazy Gallery, Vienna, the Virgin between Saints Catherine and Barbara; in
                    the National Gallery, London, Christ Disputing with the Doctors. Many or most of
                    these gallery pictures used to pass for the handiwork of Da Vinci. The same is
                    the case with the highly celebrated Vanity and Modesty in the Sciarra Palace,
                    Rome, which also may nevertheless in all probability be assigned to Luini.
                    Another singularly beautiful picture by him, which seems to pass almost entirely
                    unobserved by tourists and by writers, is in the Royal Palace in Milan—a large
                    composition of Women Bathing. That Luini was also pre-eminent as a decorative
                    artist is shown by his works in the Certosa of Pavia.</p>
