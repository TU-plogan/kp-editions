                    capital of the province, is connected by a branch with the railway between
                    Kharkoff and Azoff, as well as with other towns and iron-works of the Donetz
                    coal-mines district. It stands on the small river Lugan, 10 miles from its
                    junction with the northern Donetz, in the Lugan mine district, of which it is
                    the chief town. This district, which comprises the important coal-mines of
                    Lisi-tchansk and the anthracite mines of Gorodische, occupies an area of about
                    110,000 acres on the banks of the Donetz river, and has a population of more
                    than 15,000. Although it is mentioned in Russian history as early as the 16th
                    century, and coal was discovered in it at the time of Peter I., it was not until
                    1795 that an Englishman, Gascoyne or Gaskoin, established its first iron-work
                    for supplying the Black Sea fleet and the southern fortresses with guns and
                    shot. This proved a failure, owing to the great distance from the sea, and the
                    manufacture of supplies for the navy was suspended; but during the Crimean war
                    the iron-works of Lugan again largely produced shot, shell, and gun-carriages.
                    Since 1864 agricultural implements, steam-engines, and the various machinery
                    required for beetroot sugar-works, distilleries, &lt;fcc., have been the chief
                    manufactures. The Lugan works, which employ about 1200 men, are the chief centre
                    for smelting the ores of the neighbouring iron-mines. The town is the seat of
                    the mining authorities for the district, and has a first-class meteorological
                    and magnetic observatory. The 11,000 inhabitants of Lugansk also carry on a very
                    active trade in cattle, tallow, wools, skins, linseed, wine, corn, and
                    manufactured wares. The weekly fairs are much frequented. There are also in the
                    town many tallowmelting works, and the smith trade is largely carried on.</p>
                <p>‘ LUGO, a maritime province of Spain, one of the four into which Galicia has
                    since 1833 been divided, is bounded on the E. by Oviedo and Leon, on the S. by
                    Orense, on the W. by Pontevedra and Coruna, and on the N. by the Atlantic. Its
                    extreme length from north to south is about 98 miles, its breadth 58, and the
                    area 3787 square miles. The coast, which extends for about 40 miles from the
                    estuary of Rivadeo to Cape Vares, is extremely rugged and inaccessible, and few
                    of the inlets that exist, except those of Rivadeo and Vivero, admit vessels of
                    any size. The province, especially in the north and east, is mountainous in its
                    character, being traversed by the great Cantabrian chain and its offshoots; the
                    sierra by which it is separated from Leon attains in some places a height of
                    6000 feet. A large part of the area is drained by the Mino, which rises on the
                    western slope of the Sierra de Meira, and follows a southerly direction until it
                    is joined by the Sil; the latt·er for a considerable distance forms the southern
                    boundary of the province. Of the rivers of the northern versant the most
                    important are the Navia (which has its lower course through Oviedo), the Eo (for
                    some distance the boundary between the two provinces), the Masma, the Oro, and
                    the Landrobe. The Eume, one of the rivers of Coruna, and the Ulla, which
                    separates that province from Pontevedra, both have their rise on the western
                    slopes of Lugo. Some of the northern valleys even, in their lower portions, are
                    fertile, and yield not only corn but fruit and wine, but the principal
                    agricultural wealth is on the Mino and Sil, where rye, maize, wheat, legumes of
                    various kinds, flax, hemp, and a little silk are produced. The hills are
                    comparatively well wooded. Iron is found at Cancel and Incio, antimony at
                    Castroverde and Cervantes, argentiferous lead at Riotorto; and there a:e
                    quarries of granite, marble, and various kinds of slate and building stone.
                    Linen and woollen cloths are manufactured, but to an insignificant extent, and
                    the trade of the province is unimportant. The internal communications are still
                    very imperfect. There is only one railway, that connecting Lugo with Coruna; but
                    connexions with Leon (Branuelas) <pb break="no"

                    population in 1877 was 410,387, being a decrease of 22,129 since 1860. There are
                    ten towns with a population over 10,000 —Chantada, Fonsagrada, Lugo, Mondonedo,
                    Monforte, Panton, Sarria, Savinao, Villalba, and Vivero.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lugo,</hi> the capital of the above province, stands on a
                    small hill near the northern bank of the river Mino, at a height of 1930 feet
                    above the level of the sea, 60 miles south-west from Coruna, and 353 north-west
                    from Madrid, on the highway between these two cities. With the former it is
                    continuously connected by rail. The form of the town, which is nearly
                    quadrangular, is defined by a massive Roman wall, from 30 to 40 feet in height
                    and 20 feet thick, with projecting semicircular towers which, prior to the civil
                    war in 1809, were eighty-five in number; it now serves as a promenade,
                    commanding an extensive and delightful prospect. The principal public places are
                    the Plaza de la Constitucion, a spacious arcaded square, the Plaza de San
                    Domingo, the Plaza del Hospital, and the busy Plaza del Campo, where fairs and
                    markets are held. The most important of the public buildings is the Gothic
                    cathedral on the south side of the town; it dates from the 12th century, but was
                    modernized in the 18th, and possesses no special architectural merit. Other
                    churches are those of the Capuchins and that of San Domingo; the only other
                    buildings of note are the episcopal palace, the secondary school, the hospital,
                    and the prison. The principal industries are tanning, and the manufacture of
                    linen cloth and of cream of tartar; there is some trade in silk wares. About a
                    mile to the south of the town, on the left bank of the Mino, are the famous hot
                    sulphur baths of Lugo; the bathing house dates from 1847. The population of the
                    ayuntamiento in 1877 was 18,909.</p>
                <p>Lugo <hi rend="italic">{Lucus</hi><hi rend="italic">Augusti)</hi> was made by
                    Augustus the seat of a <hi rend="italic">conventus juridicus.</hi> Its sulphur
                    baths were even then well known. It suffered greatly in the 5th century, during
                    the Moorish wars, and, more recently, during the war of independence. The
                    bishopric dates from a very early period, and it is said to have acquired
                    metropolitan rank in the middle of the 6th century; it is now suffragan to
                    Santiago.</p>
