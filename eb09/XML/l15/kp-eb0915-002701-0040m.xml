                    a famous Jacobite intriguer, executed for the part which he took in the
                    rebellion of 1745, was born about the year 1676, and was the second son of
                    Thomas, afterwards twelfth Lord Lovat. He was educated at King’s College,
                    Aberdeen, and there seems reason to believe that he was there no negligent
                    student, as his correspondence afterwards gives abundant proof, not only of a
                    thorough command of good English and idiomatic French, but of such an
                    acquaintance with the Latin classics as to leave him never at a loss for an apt
                    quotation from Virgil or Horace. Whether Lovat ever felt any real principle of
                    loyalty to the Stuarts or was actuated throughout merely by what he supposed to
                    be self-interest it is difficult to determine, but that he was a born traitor
                    and deceiver there can be no doubt. One of his first acts on leaving college was
                    to recruit three hundred men from his clan to form part of a regiment in the
                    service of William and Mary, in which he himself was to hold a command,— his
                    object being, as he unhesitatingly avows, to have a body of well-trained
                    soldiers under his influence, whom at a moment’s notice he might carry over to
                    the interest of King James. Among other wild outrages in which he was engaged
                    about this time was a rape and forced marriage committed on the widow of a
                    previous Lord Lovat with the view apparently of securing his own succession to
                    the estates; and it is a curious instance of his plausibility and power of
                    influencing others that, after being subjected by him to the most horrible
                    ill-usage, the woman is said to have ultimately become seriously attached to
                    him. A prosecution for his violence, however, having been instituted against him
                    by Lady Lovat’s family, Simon found it prudent to retire first to his native
                    strongholds in the Highlands, and afterwards to France, where he at length found
                    his way in July 1702 to the court of St Germains. One of his first steps towards
                    gaining influence there seems to have been to announce his conversion to the
                    Catholic faith. He then proceeded to put the great project of restoring the
                    exiled family into a practical shape. Hitherto nothing seems to have been known
                    among the Jacobite exiles of the efficiency of the Highlanders as a military
                    force. But Lovat, who was of course well acquainted with their capabilities, saw
                    that, as they were the only part of the British population accustomed to the
                    independent use of arms, they could be at once put in action against the
                    reigning power. His plan therefore was to land five thousand French troops at
                    Dundee, where they might reach the north-eastern passes of the Highlands in a
                    day’s march, and be in a position to divert the British troops till the
                    Highlands should have time to rise. Immediately afterwards five hundred men were
                    to land on the west coast, seize Fort Wilfiam or Inverlochy, and thus prevent
                    the access of any military force from the south to the central Highlands. The
                    whole scheme affords strong indication of Lovat’s sagacity as a military
                    strategist, and it is observable that his plan is that which was continuously
                    kept in view in all the future attempts of the Jacobites, and finally acted on
                    in the last outbreak of 1745. The advisers of the Pretender seem to have been
                    either slow to trust their astute coadjutor or slow to comprehend his project.
                    At last, however, he was despatched on a secret mission to the Highlands to
                    sound those of the chiefs who were likely to rise, and to ascertain what forces
                    they could bring into the field. He very soon found, however, that there was
                    little disposition to join the rebellion, and he then made up his mind to secure
                    his own safety by revealing all that he knew to the Government of Queen Anne.
                    Having by this means obtained a pardon for all his previous crimes, he was sent
                    back to France to act as a spy on the Jacobites. On returning to Paris
                    suspicions soon got afloat as to his proceedings, and in the end he was
                    committed close prisoner in the castle of Angoulême, where he remained for
                    nearly ten years, or till November 1714, when he made his escape to England. For
                    some twenty-five years after this he was chiefly occupied in lawsuits for the
                    recovery of his estates and the re-establishment of his fortune, in both of
                    which objects he was successful. The intervals of his leisure were filled up by
                    Jacobite and Anti-Jacobite intrigues, in which he seems to have alternately, as
                    suited his interests, acted the traitor to both parties. But he so far obtained
                    the confidence of the Government as to have secured the appointments of sheriff
                    of Inverness and of colonel of an independent company. His disloyal practices,
                    however, soon led to his being suspected; and he was deprived of both his
                    appointments. When the rebellion of 1745 broke out, Lovat acted with his
                    characteristic duplicity. He represented to the Jacobites—what was probably in
                    the main true—that though eager for their success his weak health and advanced
                    years prevented him from joining the standard of the prince in person, while to
                    the Lord President Forbes he professed his cordial attachment to the existing
                    state of things, but lamented that his headstrong son, in spite of all his
                    remonstrances, had insisted on joining the Pretender, and succeeded in taking
                    with him a strong force from the clan of the Frasers. The truth was that the
                    poor <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n41/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0041-0028"/> lad was most unwilling to go out, but was
                    compelled by his father to do so. Lovat’s false professions of fidelity did not
                    of course long deceive the Government, and after the battle of Culloden he was
                    obliged to retreat to some of the wildest recesses of the Highlands, after
                    seeing from a distant height his proud castle of Dounie delivered to the flames
                    by the royal army. Even then, however, broken down by disease and old age,
                    carried about on a litter and unable to move without assistance, his mental
                    resources did not fail him; and in a conference with several of the Jacobite
                    leaders he proposed that they should raise a body of three thousand men, which
                    would be enough to make their mountains impregnable, and at length force the
                    Government to give them advantageous terms. The project, though by no means a
                    chimerical one, was not carried out, and Lovat, after enduring incredible
                    hardships in his wanderings, was at last arrested on an island in Loch Morar
                    close upon the west coast. He was conveyed in a litter to London, and after a
                    trial of five days sentence of death in “the ordinary brutal form peculiar to
                    England” was pronounced upon him on the 19th of March 1747. His execution took
                    place on the 9th of April following. His conduct to the last was dignified and
                    even cheerful,—his humour, his power of s ιrcasm, and his calm defiance of fate
                    never deserting him. Just before submitting his head to the block he repeated
                    the line from Horace—</p>
                <p>“Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.”</p>
