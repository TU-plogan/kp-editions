                <p><label type="entry">LOUISA</label> (1776-1810), queen of Prussia, was born March
                    10, 1776, in Hanover, where her father, Duke Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
                    was commandant. After the death of her mother, who was by birth a princess of
                    Hesse-Darmstadt, she vyas entrusted to the care of a Fräulein von Wolzogen, and
                    afterwards to that of her grandmother, the landgravine of Hesse-Darmstadt.
                    During the period of the revolutionary wars, she lived for some time with her
                    sister Charlotte, the wife of Duke Frederick of Saxe-Hildburghausen. In 1793 she
                    met at Frankfort the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards King Frederick William
                    III., who was so fascinated by her beauty, and by the nobleness of her
                    character, that he asked her to become his wife. On April 24 of the same year
                    they were betrothed, and on the 24th of December they were married. As queen of
                    Prussia she commanded universal respect and affection, and nothing in Prussian
                    history is more pathetic than the patience and dignity with which she bore the
                    sufferings inflicted on her and her family during the war between Prussia and
                    France. After the battle of Jena she went with her husband to Königsberg, and
                    when the battles of Eylau and Friedland had placed Prussia absolutely at the
                    mercy of France, she made a personal appeal to Napoleon at his headquarters in
                    Tilsit, but without success. Early in 1808 she accompanied the king from Memel
                    to Königsberg, whence, towards the end of the year, she visited St Petersburg,
                    returning to Berlin on the 23d of December 1809. During the war Napoleon, with
                    incredible brutality, attempted to destroy the queen’s reputation, but the only
                    effect of his charges in Prussia was to make her more deeply beloved. On the
                    19th of July 1810 she died in her husband’s arms, while visiting her father in
                    Strelitz. No other queen in modern times has been more sincerely mourned. She
                    was buried in the garden of the palace at Charlottenburg, where a beautiful
                    mausoleum, containing a fine recumbent statue by Rauch, was built over her
                    grave. In 1840 her husband was buried by her side. The Louisa Foundation
                    (Luisenstift) for the education of girls was established in her honour, and in
                    1814 Frederick William III. instituted the Order of Louisa (Luisenorden). On the
                    10th of March 1876 the Prussian people celebrated the hundredth anniversary of
                    her birth, and it was then decided to.erect a statue of Queen Louisa in the
                    Thiergarten at Berlin.</p>
