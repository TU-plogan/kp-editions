                    rend="italic">Euphues,</hi> was born in Kent in 1553 or 1554. At the age of
                    sixteen, according to Wood, he became a student of Magdalen College, Oxford,
                    where in due time he proceeded to his bachelor’s and master’s degrees (1573 and
                    1575), and from whence we find him in 1574 applying to Lord Burghley “for the
                    queen’s letters to Magdalen College to admit him fellow.” The fellowship,
                    however, was not granted, and Lyly shortly after left the university. He
                    complains of what seems to have been a sentence of rustication passed upon him
                    at some period in his academical career, in his address to the gentlemen
                    scholars of Oxford affixed to the second edition of the first part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Euphues,</hi> but in the absence of any further evidence it is
                    impossible to fix either its date or its cause. If we are to believe Wood, he
                    never took kindly to the proper studies of the university. “For so it was that
                    his genius being naturally bent to the pleasant paths of poetry (as if Apollo
                    had given to him a wreath of his own bays without snatching or struggling) did
                    in a manner neglect academical studies, yet not so much but that he took the
                    degrees in arts, that of master being compleated 1575.” After he left Oxford,
                    where he had already the reputation of “a noted wit,” Lyly seems to have
                    attached himself to Lord Burghley. “This noble man,” he writes in the “Classe
                    for Europe,” in the second part of <hi rend="italic">Euphues</hi> (1580), “I
                    found so ready being but a straunger to do me good, that neyther I ought to
                    forget him, neyther cease to pray for him, that as he hath the wisdom of Nestor,
                    so he may have the age, that having the policies of Ulysses he may have his
                    honor, worthy to lyve long, by whom so many lyve in quiet, and not unworthy to
                    be advaunced by whose care so many have been preferred.” Two years later we
                    possess a letter of Lyly to the treasurer, dated July 1582, in which the writer
                    protests against some undefined accusation which had brought him into trouble
                    with his patron, and demands a personal interview for the purpose of clearing
                    his character. What the further relations between them were we have no means of
                    knowing, but it is clear that neither from Burghley nor from the queen did Lyly
                    ever receive any substantial patronage. In 1578 he began his literary career by
                    the composition of <hi rend="italic">Euphues, or the Anatomy of Wit,</hi> which
                    was licensed to Gabriel Cawood on December 2, 1578, and published in the spring
                    of 1579. In the same year the author was incorporated M.A. at Cambridge, and
                    possibly saw his hopes of court advancement dashed by the appointment in July of
                    Edmund Tylney to the office of master of the revels, a post at which, as he
                    reminds the queen some years later, he had all along been encouraged to “aim his
                    courses.” <hi rend="italic">Euphues and his England</hi> appeared in 1580, and,
                    like the first part of the book, won immediate popularity. For a time Lyly was
                    the most successful and fashionable of English writers. He was hailed as the
                    author of “a new English,” as a “raffineur de i’Anglois;” and, as Edmund Blount,
                    the editor of his plays, tells us in 1632, “that beautie in court which could
                    not parley Euphuism was as little regarded as she which nowe there speakes not
                    French.” After the publication of <hi rend="italic">Euphues,</hi> however, Lyly
                    seems to have entirely deserted the novel form himself, which passed into the
                    hands of his imitators, and to have thrown himself almost exclusively into
                    play-writing, probably with a view to the mastership of revels whenever a
                    vacancy should occur. Eight plays by him were probably acted before the queen by
                    the children of the Chapel Royal and the children of St Paul’s between the years
                    1584 and 1589, one or two of them being repeated before a popular audience at
                    the Blackfriars Theatre. Their brisk lively dialogue, classical colour, and
                    frequent allusions to persons and events of the day maintained that popularity
                    with the court which <hi rend="italic">Euphues</hi> had won. In 1589 Lyly
                    published a tract in the Martin Marprelate controversy, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pappe with an hatchet, alias a figge for my Godsonne; Or Crack me this</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mit</hi><hi rend="italic">; Or a Countme Cuffe, &lt;kc.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The evidence for his
                    authorship may be found in Gabriel Harvey’s <hi rend="italic">Pierces

                    allusions in Lyly’s own plays. See Fairholt’s <hi rend="italic">Dramatic Works
                    of John Lilly,</hi> vol. i. p. 20.</p></note> About the same time we may
                    probably date his first petition to Queen Elizabeth. The two petitions,
                    transcripts of which are extant among the Harleian MSS., are undated, but in the
                    first of them he speaks of having been ten years hanging about the court in hope
                    of preferment, and in the second he extends the period to thirteen years. It may
                    be conjectured with great probability that the ten years date from 1579, when
                    Edmund Tylney was appointed master of the revels with a tacit understanding that
                    Lyly was to have the next reversion of the post. “I was entertained your
                    Majestie’s servaunt by your own gratious favor,” he says, “strengthened with
                    condicions that I should ayme all my courses at the Revells (I dare not say with
                    a promise, but with a hopeful Item to the Revercion) for which these ten yeres I
                    have attended with an unwearyed patience.” But in 1589 or 1590 the mastership of
                    the revels was as far off as ever,—Tylney in fact held the post for thirty-one
                    years,—and that Lyly’s petition brought him no compensation in other directions
                    may be inferred from the second petition of 1593. “Thirteen yeres your highnes
                    servant but yet nothing. Twenty freinds that though they saye they will be sure,
                    I finde them sure to be slowe. A thousand hopes, but all nothing; a hundred
                    promises but yet nothing. Thus casting up the inventory of my friends, hopes,
                    promises, and tymes, the <hi rend="italic">summa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >totalis</hi> amounteth to just nothing.” What may have been Lyly’s subsequent
                    fortunes at court we do not know. Edmund Blount says vaguely that Elizabeth
                    “graced and rewarded” him, but of this there is no other evidence. After 1590
                    his works steadily declined in influence and reputation; other stars were in
                    possession of the horizon; and so far as we know he died poor and neglected in
                    the early part of James I.’s reign. He was buried in London at St Bartholomew
                    the Less on November 20, 1606. He was married, and we hear of two sons and a
                    daughter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Comedies.—</hi> In 1632 Edmund Blount published “Six Court
                    Comedies,” including <hi rend="italic">Endymion, Sappho and Ρhao, Alexander and
                    Campaspe, Midas, Mother Bombie,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gallathea.</hi> To
                    these should be added the <hi rend="italic">Woman in the Moone</hi> (Lyly’s
                    earliest play, to judge from a passage in the prologue and therefore earlier
                    than 1584, the date of <hi rend="italic">Alexander and Campaspe),</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Love's Metamorphosis,</hi> first printed in 1601. Of these, all
                    but the last are in prose. <hi rend="italic">A Warning for</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Faire</hi><hi rend="italic">Women</hi> (1599) and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Maidi</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis</hi> (1600)
                    have been attributed to Lyly, but on altogether insufficient grounds. The first
                    editions of all these plays were issued between 1584 and 1601, and the majority
                    of them between 1584 and 1592, in what were Lyly’s most successful and popular
                    years. His importance as a dramatist has been very differently estimated. Prof.
                    Minto denies him any appreciable influence upon our literature, while Professor
                    A. Ward, on the other hand, rightly believes his work to have had a great effect
                    upon the development of dramatic dialogue, and the prose drama in general.
                    Lyly’s dialogue is still a long way removed from the dialogue of Shakespeare.
                    But at the same time it is a great advance in rapidity and resource upon
                    anything which had gone before it; it represents an important step in English
                    dramatic art. His nimbleness, and the wit which struggles with his pedantry,
                    found their full development in the dialogue of <hi rend="italic">Twelfth
                    Night</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Much Ado about Nothing,</hi> just as “Marlowe’s
                    mighty line” led up to and was eclipsed by the majesty and music of
                    Shakespearian passion. One or two of the songs introduced into his plays are
                    justly famous, and show a real lyrical gift. Nor in estimating his dramatic
                    position and his effect upon his time must it be forgotten that his classical
                    and mythological plots, flavourless <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n119/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0119-0104"/> and dull as they would be to a modern audience,
                    were charged with interest to those courtly hearers who saw in Midas Philip II.,
                    Elizabeth in Cynthia, and perhaps Leicester’s unwelcome marriage with Lady
                    Sheffield in the love affair between Endymion and Tellus which brings the former
                    under Cynthia’s displeasure. As a matter of fact his reputation and popularity
                    as a play-writer were considerable. Gabriel Harvey dreaded lest Lyly should make
                    a play upon their quarrel; Meres, as is well known, placeshim among “the best
                    for comedy;” and Ben Jonson names him among those foremost rivals who were
                    “outshone” and outsung by Shakespeare.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Euphues.—</hi> It was not, however, as a dramatist, but as the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Euρhues,</hi> that Lyly made most mark upon the
                    Elizabethan world. His plays amused the court circle, but the “new English” of
                    his novel threatened to permanently change the course of English style. The plot
                    of <hi rend="italic">Euphues</hi> is extremely simple. The hero, whose name may
                    very possibly have been suggested by a passage in Ascham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schoolmaster,</hi> is introduced to us as still in bondage to the follies of
                    youth, “preferring fancy before friends, and this present humour before honour
                    to come.” His travels bring him to Naples, where he falls in love with Lucilla,
                    the governor’s light-minded daughter. Lucilla is already pledged to Euphues’s
                    friend Philautus, but Euphues’s passion betrays his friendship, and the old
                    lover finds himself thrown over· by both friend and mistress. Euphues himself,
                    however, is very soon forsaken for a more attractive suitor. He and Philautus
                    make up their quarrel, and Euphues writes his friend “a cooling card,” to be
                    “applied to all lovers,” which is so severe upon the fair sex that Lyly feels it
                    necessary to balance it by a sort of apology addressed “to the grave matrons and
                    honest maidens of Italy.” Euphues then leaves Naples for his native Athens,
                    where he gives himself up to study, of which the first fruits are two long
                    treatises— the first, “Euphues and his Ephoebus,” a disquisition on the art of
                    education addressed to parents, and the second, “Euphues and Atheos,” a
                    discussion of the first principles of religion. The remainder of the book is
                    filled up with correspondence between Euphues and his friends. We have letters
                    from Euphues to Philautus on the death of Lucilla, to another friend on the
                    death of his daughter, to one Botonio ‘ ‘ to take his exile patiently,” and to
                    the youth Alcius, remonstrating with him on his bad behaviour at the university.
                    Finally a pair of letters, the first from Livia “at the emperour’s court to
                    Euphues at Athens," answered by “Euphues to Livia,” wind up the first part, and
                    announce to us Euphues’s intention of visiting England. An address from Lyly to
                    Lord Delawarr is affixed, to which was added in the second edition “An Address
                    to the Gentlemen Scholars of England.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Euphues and his England</hi> is rather longer than the first
                    part. Euphues and Philautus travel from Naples to England. They arrive at Dover,
                    halt for the night at Fidus’s house at Canterbury, and then proceed to London,
                    where they make acquaintance with Surius, a young English gentleman of great
                    birth and noble blood; Psellus, an Italian nobleman reputed “great in magick”;
                    Martius, an elderly Englishman; Camilla, a beautiful English girl of
                    insignificant family; Lady Flavia and her niece Fraunces. After endless
                    correspondence and conversation on all kinds of topics, Euphues is recalled to
                    Athens, and from there corresponds with his friends. “Euphues’ Glasse for
                    Europe” is a flattering description of England sent to Livia at Naples. It is
                    the most interesting portion of the book, and throws light upon one or two
                    points of Lyly’s own biography. The author naturally seized the opportunity for
                    paying his inevitable tribute to the queen, and pays it in his most exalted
                    style. “0 fortunate England that hath such a queene, ungratefull if thou praye
                    not for hir, wicked if thou do not love hir, miserable if thou lose hir! ”—and
                    so on. The book ends with Philautus’s announcement of his marriage to Fraunces,
                    upon which Euphues sends characteristic congratulations and retires, “tormented
                    in body and grieved in mind,” to the Mount of Silexedra, “where I leave him to
                    his musing or Muses.”</p>
                <p>Such is a brief outline of the book which for a time set the fashion for English
                    prose. Two editions of each part appeared within the first year after
                    publication, and thirteen editions of both are enumerated by Mr Arber up to
                    1636, after which, with the exception of a modernized version in 1718, <hi
                    rend="italic">Euphues</hi> was never reprinted until 1868, when Mr Arber took it
                    in hand. The reasons for its popularity are not far to seek. As far as matter
                    was concerned it fell in with all the prevailing literary fashions. Its long
                    disquisitions on love, religion, exile, women, or education, on court life and
                    country pleasures, handled all the most favourite topics in the secularized
                    speculation of the time; its foreign background and travel talk pleased a
                    society of which Lyly himself said “trafic and travel hath woven the nature of
                    all nations into ours and made this land like arras full of device which was
                    broadcloth full of workmanship;” and, although Lyly steered clear in it of the
                    worst classical pedantries of the day, the book was more than sufficiently
                    steeped in classical learning, and based upon classical material, to attract a
                    literary circle which was nothing if not humanist. A large proportion of its
                    matter indeed was drawn from classical sources. The general tone of sententious
                    moralizing may be traced to Plutarch, from whom the treatise on education,
                    “Euphues and his Ephoebus,” and that on exile, “Letter to Botonio to take his
                    exile patiently,” are literally translated, as well as a number of other shorter
                    passages either taken direct from the Latin versions or from some of the
                    numerous English translations of Plutarch then current. The innumerable
                    illustrations based upon a kind of pseudo natural history are largely taken from
                    Pliny, while the mythology is that of Virgil and Ovid.</p>
                <p>It was not the matter of <hi rend="italic">Euphues,</hi> however, so much as the
                    style which made it famous. The sources of Lyly’s peculiar style have only
                    recently been satisfactorily traced by a German scholar, Dr Landmann, whose
                    interesting and well arranged pamphlet we need do little more than summarize
                    (Landmann, <hi rend="italic">Der Euphuismus,</hi><hi rend="italic">sein

                    Giessen, 1881). What, asks Dr Landmann, is Euphuism, properly so called? The
                    term till now has been generally used as if it included all the affected modes
                    of speaking and writing in vogue in England during the 16th century. It has even
                    been made to cover all the corruption of English taste from Surrey to Dryden;
                    and the common mode of explaining it has been to say that it was a mere
                    “exaggeration of the Italianating taste which had begun with the revival of our
                    poetical literature” under Henry VIII. In reality, however, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euphues</hi> has very little to do with the other affectations of the time. Its
                    chief characteristics, to quote Dr Landmann, are “a peculiar combination of
                    antithesis with alliteration, assonance, rhyme, and play upon words, a love for
                    the conformity and correspondence of parallel sentences, and a tendency to
                    accumulate rhetorical figures, such as climax, the rhetorical question,
                    objections and refutations, the repetition of the same thought in other forms,
                    &amp;c.” To this may be added constant references to antiquity and a great
                    fondness for comparisons drawn from a sort of fabulous natural history. On the
                    other hand the style is free from what Puttenham calls “mingle mangle,” that is
                    to say, from the pedantic and indiscriminate use of foreign or Latinized words,
                    and also from the hyperbolical extravagances of the Petrarchians. Lyly’s
                    peculiarities are those of syntax and construction rather than of phraseology.
                    Compared to that of the Surrey school, his diction is simple and direct, and he
                    himself declares that he does not pretend to please those “Englishmen who desire
                    to heare finer speech than the language will allowe,” that is to say, the lovers
                    of the Italianate circumlocutions which ruled English poetry from Surrey to
                    Spenser. His work then is not simply to be regarded as the outcome of the
                    classical and Italian influence at work in England since the beginning of the
                    century. It has individual features which have to be accounted for, and which
                    have now been traced with certainty by Dr Landmann to the influence of one
                    foreign author—Don Antonio de <hi rend="smallcaps">Guevara</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{g.υ. ).</hi> Guevara’s chief work was <hi rend="italic">El Libro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aureo de Marco Aurelio</hi> (1529),—a sort of historical romance
                    based upon Plutarch and upon Marcus Aurelius’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditations,</hi> the object of which was to produce a “mirror for princes,” of
                    the kind so popular throughout the Renaissance. Within the year of its
                    publication Guevara issued an enlarged edition of his book, calling it <hi
                    rend="italic">Libro</hi><hi rend="italic">del Empcrador Marco Aurelio con
                    relox</hi><hi rend="italic">de Principes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a
                    number of fresh editions and of translations into almost every European language
                    followed. The book became almost immediately popular in England. The first
                    edition, or rather a French version of it, was translated into English by Lord
                    Berners in 1531, and published in 1534. Before 1560 twelve editions of Lord
                    Berners’s translation had been printed, and before 1578 six different
                    translators of this and later works of Guevara had appeared. The translation,
                    however, which had most influence upon English literature was that by North, the
                    well-known translator of Plutarch, in 1568, called <hi rend="italic">The Dial
                    for Princes, Compiled by the Reverend Father in God Don Antony of Guevara,
                    Byshop of Guadix, &lt;kc., Englished out of the Frcnche by Th. North.</hi> It
                    was from this book, and from certain other translations from Guevara, of which a
                    full account will be found in Dr Landmann’s pamphlet, that Lyly borrowed his
                    peculiar style, and even a certain small proportion of his material. The
                    sententious and antithetical style of the <hi rend="italic">Dial for
                    Princes</hi> is substantially that of <hi rend="italic">Euphues,</hi> though
                    Guevara on the whole handles it better than his imitator, and has many passages
                    of real force and dignity. The general plan of the two books is also much the
                    same. In both the biography is merely a peg on which to hang moral disquisitions
                    and treatises. The use made of letters is the same in both. Even the names of
                    some of the characters are Similar. Thus Guevara’s Lucilla is the flighty
                    daughter of Marcus Aurelius. Lyly’s Lucilla is the flighty daughter of Ferardo,
                    governor of Naples; Guevara’s Livia is a lady at the court of Marcus Aurelius,
                    Lyly’s Livia is a lady at the court “of the emperor,” of whom no further
                    description is given. The 9th, 10th, llth, and 12th chapters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dial for Princes</hi> suggested the discussion between Euphues and
                    Atheos. The letter from Euphues to Alcius is substantially the same in subject
                    and treatment as that from Marcus Aurelius to his nephew Epesipo. Both Guevara
                    and Lyly translated Plutarch’s work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Educatione Liberorum,</hi> Lyly, however, keeping closer than the Spanish
                    author to the original. The use made by Lyly of the university of Athens was an
                    anachronism in a novel intended to describe his own time. He borrowed it,
                    however, from Guevara, in whose book a university <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n120/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0120-0105"/> of Athens was of course entirely in place. The
                    “cooling card for all fond lovers” and the address to the ladies and gentlemen
                    of Italy have their counterparts among the miscellaneous letters by Guevara
                    affixed by North to the <hi rend="italic">Bial for Princes;</hi> and other
                    instances of Lyly’s use of these letters, and of two other treatises by Guevara
                    on court and country life, could be pointed out.</p>
                <p>Lyly was not the first to appropriate and develop the Guevaristic style. The
                    earliest book in which it was fully adopted was <hi rend="italic">A petite Pall
                    ace of Pettie his Pleasure,</hi> by George Pettie, which appeared in 1576, a
                    production so closely akin to <hi rend="italic">Euphucs</hi> in tone and style
                    that it is difficult to believe it was not by Lyly. Lyly, however, carried the
                    style to its highest point, and made it the dominant literary fashion. His
                    principal followers in it were Greene, Lodge, and Nash, his principal opponent
                    Sir Philip Sidney; the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> in fact supplanted <hi
                    rend="italic">Euphucs,</hi> and the Euphuistic taste proper may be said to have
                    died out about 1590 after a reign of some twelve years. According to Drayton it
                    was Sidney’s chief merit that—</p>
                <p>“He did first reduce Our tongue from Lillie's writing then in use, Talking of
                    Stones, Stars, Plants, of Fishes, Flyes, Playing with words and idle similies,
                    As th’ English Apes and very Zanies be Of everything that they doe heare and
                    see, .So imitating his rediculons tricks They spake and writ all like meere
                    lunatiques."</p>
                <p>Shakespeare, Dr Landmann maintains, cannot strictly speaking be said to have
                    ridiculed Euphuism. <hi rend="italic">Love’s Labour Lost</hi> is a caricature of
                    the Italianate and pedantic fashions of the day, not of the peculiar style of
                    <hi rend="italic">Euphucs.</hi> The only certain allusion in Shakespeare to the
                    characteristics of Lyly’s famous book is to be found in <hi rend="italic">Henry
                    IV.,</hi> where Falstaff, playing the part of the king, says to Prince Hal,
                    “Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art
                    accompanied; for, though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it
                    grows, yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears.” Here the pompous
                    antithesis is evidently meant to caricature the peculiar Euphuistic sentence of
                    court parlance. That Shakespeare indeed was well acquainted with what was the
                    court manual of his youth, and at times reproduces both ideas and phrases from
                    it, has been amply proved by Mr Rushton, the German critic Hense, and others,
                    but there is no evidence of antagonism between the two writers. It might have
                    been otherwise had Lyly’s Euphuism affected his plays. But these show little or
                    no trace of Guevara’s influence; their faults are the common faults of
                    Elizabethan writing, from many of which Shakespeare himself was not free.</p>
