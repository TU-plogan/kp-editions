                    belonging to the great central plateau, is composed of almost the whole of
                    Gévaudan and of some parishes of the old dioceses of Alais and Uzès, districts
                    all formerly included in the province of Languedoc. It lies between 44° 6' and
                    44° 58' N. lat., and between 2° 58' and 4° E. long., and is bounded on the N.W.
                    by Cantal, on the N.E. by Haute-Loire, on the E. by Ardèche, on the S.E. by
                    Gard, and on the S.W. by Aveyron, having an extreme length of 65 miles, an
                    extreme breadth of 50, and an area of 1996 square miles. Lozère is mountainous
                    throughout, and its average elevation makes it the highest of all the French
                    departments. It has three distinct regions—the Cevennes to the south-east, the
                    “causses” to the southwest, and the mountain tracts which occupy the rest. The
                    Cevennes, forming the watershed between the Garonne and Loire basins to the west
                    and that of the Rhone to the east, begin (within Lozère) with Mount Aigoual,
                    which rises to a height of more than 5100 feet; parallel to this are the
                    mountains of Bougés, a range between the rivers Tarn and Tarnon, bold and bare
                    on its southern face, but falling gently away with wooded slopes toward the
                    north. To the north of the Tarn is the range of Lozère, including the peak of
                    Finiels, the highest point of the department (5584 feet). Further on occurs the
                    broad marshy plateau of Montbel, from which the water drains southward to the
                    Lot, northwards to the Allier, eastward by the Chassezac to the Ardèche. From
                    this plateau extend the mountains of La Margeride, a long series of undulating
                    granitic tablelands partly clothed with woods of oak, beech, and fir, and partly
                    covered with pastures, to which the flocks are brought up from lower Languedoc
                    in summer. The highest point (Mount de Randon) is 5098 feet. Adjoining the
                    Margeride hills on the west is the volcanic range of Aubrac, an extensive
                    pastoral district where horned cattle take the place of sheep; the highest point
                    is 4826 feet. The “causses” of Lozère, having an area of about 483 square miles,
                    consist of extensive calcareous tracts, fissured and arid, but separated from
                    each other by deep and well-watered gorges, whose freshness and beauty are in
                    pleasant contrast with the desolate aspect of the plateaus. The “causse” of
                    Sauveterre, between the Lot and the Tarn, ranges from 3000 to 3300 feet in
                    height; that of Méjean has nearly the same average altitude, but has peaks some
                    1000 feet higher. Between these two “causses” the Tarn flows through a series of
                    landscapes which are among the most picturesque and grand in France. The Lot and
                    the Tarn, the two most important tributaries of the Garonne, both have their
                    sources in this department, as also have the Allier, the two Gardons, which
                    unite to form the Gard, the Cèze, and the Chassezac with its affluent the
                    Altier. The climate of Lozère varies greatly with the locality. The mean
                    temperature of Mende, the capital, is below that of Paris; that of the mountains
                    is always low, but in the “causses” the summer is scorching and the winter
                    severe; in the Cevennes the climate becomes mild enough at their base (656 feet)
                    to permit the growth of the olive. Rain falls in violent storms, causing
                    disastrous floods. On the Mediterranean versant there are 78 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 7 inches, in the Garonne basin 45 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5, and in that of the Loire only 27 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 95. The general character of the department is
                    pastoral; only onefourth of the area is occupied by arable land; 91,500 acres
                    are meadow, 155,700 wood, and 90,000 chestnut plantation. The number of sheep
                    (which is doubled in summer) is 300,000; there are 50,000 head of cattle; and
                    pigs, goats, horses, asses, and mules are also reared. Bees are also kept, and,
                    among the Cevennes, silkworms. The export of chestnuts from the Cevennes is
                    considerable. Rye is the chief cereal; but oats, wheat, meslin, barley, and many
                    potatoes are also grown. Great care is bestowed on cultivation in the valleys
                    adjoining the Ardèche; fruit trees and leguminous plants are irrigated by small
                    canals (“béais ”) on terraces which have been made or are maintained with much
                    labour. The department yields argentiferous lead (Villefort), slates, and
                    mineral waters, among which those of Bagnols are most frequented. The
                    exportation of its antimony, manganese, marble, and lithographic stones is
                    undeveloped as yet. The tufa of Mende is well adapted for building purposes. The
                    manufactures are unimportant. The population in 1876 was 138,319, having
                    decreased by 5000 since 1801, and by a still greater number since the end of the
                    17th century. There are about 20,000 Protestants. The arrondissements are three
                    (Mende, Florae, and Marvejols), the cantons twenty-four, and the communes one
                    hundred and ninety-six. .. *</p>
