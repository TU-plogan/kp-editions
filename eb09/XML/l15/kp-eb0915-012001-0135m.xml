                <p><label type="entry">LYSIPPUS</label>, a Greek sculptor whose professional
                    activity falls between the years 372 and 316 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In
                    addition to the sketch with accompanying illustrations of his style given under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Archaeology</hi> (vol. ii. p. 361, figs. 9 and 11), it may
                    here be stated that the head of Alexander the Great (fig. 11 just referred to)
                    is now admitted tobe the best existing representation of the style of Lysippus
                    in portrait sculpture. When we read of successful portraits by him of Socrates
                    and Aesop, as well as of Alexander, we are driven to believe that one of the
                    forces of which he was conscious within himself was that of seizing the
                    spiritual expression and making it illumine faces and forms which under other
                    conditions would be more or less repulsive. This in fact is confirmed by the
                    head of Alexander in the British Museum (fig. 11 <hi rend="italic">supra).</hi>
                    But with the possession of this force it is difficult to reconcile the tradition
                    of his having taken as his model the Doryphorus of Polycletus, the style of
                    which may be seen in the bronze statuette fig. 6 in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Archaeology,</hi> and, to a less extent, in fig. 7 of the same
                    article. There everything turns on the refinements of physical form. It is
                    admitted that Lysippus introduced great changes in the accepted rules for the
                    proportions of the human figure, and from a number of sculptures traceable to
                    his time, or shortly after his time, it is not only obvious but strikingly in
                    contrast with earlier works that the legs are made long and massive while the
                    body is proportionately shortened, though still retaining a very powerful
                    rendering of the forms. Among the best examples of this are two bronze
                    statuettes of Neptune and Jupiter in the British Museum found at Paramythia in
                    Epirus, or, less satisfactory, the larger bronze of Hercules from Byblus, also
                    in the British Museum. In these cases the limbs and various parts of the figure
                    are studied with extreme skill worthy of the best time. Yet the combined effect
                    is such as to do away with the impassive beauty which is ascribed to Polycletus,
                    and to replace it with a beauty of expression so far as was consistent with
                    powerful physical form. One of his works famed in antiquity was a bronze
                    statuette of Hercules, called Epitrapezius, because, as the story goes,
                    Alexander the Great carried it with him to be placed always on his table. A copy
                    of this, in stone, enlarged somewhat from the original, was obtained by the
                    British Museum from Babylonia in 1881. It is signed with the name of an artist,
                    Diogenes, apparently otherwise unknown, and it bears clearly the evidence of
                    having been copied from a work in bronze. But except in the face, which is
                    carefully executed (“argutiae operum custoditae in minimis quoque rebus” is said
                    of Lysippus by Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Hat. Hist.,</hi> xxxiv. 65), the
                    sculpture is poor and could not be quoted as illustrating any particular style
                    of art, though not inconsistent with the characteristics of Lysippus. With
                    reference to the marble statue of Alexander the Great in Munich, standing with
                    one foot raised on a helmet, it is clear that this affected attitude, which
                    occurs in several other existing statues, such as the so-called Jason in
                    Lansdowne House, cannot fairly be traced to the invention of Lysippus, since it
                    is to be found twice on the frieze of the Parthenon. At the same time the merit
                    may belong to him, as has recently been claimed, of having first applied this
                    attitude in producing a new type of the god Neptune for his temple on the
                    isthmus of Corinth. It was a bolder step to apply this attitude to a draped
                    female figure as in the existing statues of the Muse Melpomene standing with one
                    foot raised on a rock, and if this was really introduced into art by Lysippus it
                    would confirm to some extent his reputation for novelties of representation. But
                    at present we cannot do more than say that he is known to have made a group of
                    the Muses for the town of Megara, and that several statues still exist
                    representing a Muse in an attitude corresponding with that of the Alexander in
                    Munich, which is reasonably inferred to be a copy from a work of Lysippus. If it
                    could be proved that in these cases Lysippus had worked upon Athenian types, we
                    should then understand how it happens that in some respects he was in ancient
                    times classed with the Athenian Praxiteles (Quintilian, xii. 10, 9, “ad
                    veritatem Lysippum ac Praxitelem accessisse optime affirmant ”), and is still
                    compared with him so far as the remaining works of both, or copies therefrom,
                    enable a comparison to be made.</p>
