                    special constitution by the king of the Netherlands, is bounded on the N. and E.
                    by Rhenish Prussia, S. by Lorraine and the French department Meurthe-et-Moselle,
                    and W. by Belgian Luxemburg. It measures 32 miles from Hartelingen to Rosport,
                    both on the Sure, and 50 miles from Rumelange in the south to Weiler in the
                    north. The surface contains 639,000 acres (998 square miles), of which 293,554
                    acres are arable, 61,033 meadowland, 143,812 woodland, 54,135 coppice, and 540
                    vineyards. The hills in the south of the duchy are a continuation of the
                    Lorraine plateau; and the northern districts are crossed in all directions by
                    outrunners from the Ardennes. With the exception of the Chiers, which flows into
                    the Meuse near Sedan after a course of 50 miles, the streams all drain into the
                    Moselle, which forms the boundary between Luxemburg and the Rhine province for
                    about 20 miles. The Sure or Sauer, the most important stream in the duchy, rises
                    at Vaux-les-Rosières in Belgian Luxemburg, crosses the duchy, and forms the
                    eastern boundary from the confluence of the Our till it joins the Moselle after
                    a course of 50 miles, during which it receives the Wiltz, the Woltz, the Alzet,
                    &amp;c. At Mondorf there are mineral wells and a bathing establishment. The soil
                    of Luxemburg is generally good; the southern districts are on the whole the most
                    fertile as well as the most populous. Building materials of all sorts are
                    obtained throughout the duchy, and in the south there is iron-ore of fair
                    quality— the mining area at present occupying from 8000 to 10,000 acres. Galena
                    is worked on the frontier between Ober-wampach and Longville, and antimony at
                    Gösdorf near Wiltz. Since 1842 Luxemburg has been included in the Zollverein,
                    and its principal dealings are, consequently, with Germany. Besides the iron
                    furnaces,—situated all of them in the south near the Lorraine plateau,—the
                    industrial establishments of the country comprise a large number of tanneries, a
                    dozen weaving factories, an important glove-making factory, a pottery,
                    paper-mills for all sorts of paper, breweries and distilleries, and two sugar
                    refineries. A German patois mixed with French words is spoken throughout the
                    country; ’but French, which is universally employed by the commercial community,
                    is also the common speech of all classes on the French and Belgian frontiers.
                    Though perfect liberty of worship prevails, Roman Catholicism is almost the sole
                    form of religion in the duchy, the only dissenters worthy of note being the
                    Protestant Prussian employés and about three hundred Jewish families. The
                    government is in the hands of the grand-duke, who sanctions and promulgates the
                    laws. Between 1850 and 1879 the king of the Netherlands was represented in his
                    grand-ducal functions by his brother Prince Henry; but since the prince’s death
                    he has resumed the personal direction of affairs. The grand-duchy is a neutral
                    and independent state, and its crown hereditary in the Nassau family (Treaty of
                    London, March 11, 1867). A house of representatives and a council of state,
                    named by the grand-duke, compose the administrative body. The representatives,
                    to the number of forty-four, are chosen by the people in the proportion of one
                    for from 4000 to 5500 inhabitants. No law can be passed without the consent of
                    the house of representatives. Bills are introduced by the grand-duke, but the
                    house has also the right of initiative. A single battalion (150) of Luxemburg
                    chasseurs composes the grand-ducal army,—all voluntary recruits. The gendarmerie
                    also consists of about 150 men. There are two courts of first instance in the
                    duchy,—one at Luxemburg, the other at Diekirch,—and a high court and a court of
                    appeal, both at Luxemburg. Criminals appear before the court of assize at
                    Luxemburg. By grand-ducal decree the order of the Crown of Oak was instituted
                    for the duchy, December 29, 1841, and that of the Golden Lion, February 5, 1858.
                    The communal councils are under the supervision of the district commissioners,
                    who are subject in turn to the minister of the interior. The administration of
                    the town of Luxemburg depends immediately on the Government. Education is in a
                    flourishing state: there are 642 primary schools attended by 31,000 pupils;
                    Luxemburg has a normal school and an athenaeum; Diekirch and Echternach have
                    each a gymnasium. The bishopric of Luxemburg, containing 13 diaconates,
                    subdivided into 253 parishes, holds its authority directly from the Holy See.
                    From 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 francs is the annual amount of the state budget, and
                    the public debt was 12,000,000 francs in 1863. Since 1854 there has been a
                    grand-ducal bronze coinage.</p>

                <p>The Luxemburg territory as well as the country of Ardenne was included in Belgica
                    Prima at the first division of Gaul by Angustus in 27 B.c.; during the Frankish
                    period it formed part first of Austrasia, then of Lorraine, and then of Lower
                    Lorraine. On the dismemberment of ancient Austrasia the countship of Ardenne
                    fell to Ricuin; and, when after Ricuin’s death his children divided his
                    possessions, Ardenne .proper was obtained by Count Sigfried (Sigefroi). The
                    county of Luxemburg, as Ardenne came to be called after the chief town, was
                    raised to be a duchy in 1354, and existed as an independent state till 1451,
                    when it was seized by Philip, duke of Burgundy. The dynasty which he displaced
                    had been ambitious and active, and had, in the person of Henry VII., attained
                    the imperial dignity, and in that of John ascended the •throne of Bohemia. As a

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0101-0088"/> came to the house of Austria, and, after forming
                    part of the archduchy governed by Albert and Isabella, 1598-1632, followed the
                    fate of the Spanish Netherlands till it was ceded by the treaty of Utrecht to
                    the house of Hapsburg, It was deprived of Thionville, Moutmedy, Damvilliers, I
                    voix, and Marville by the treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) in favour of France; and
                    Louis XIV. occupied the town and great part of the province from 1684 till the
                    treaty of Ryswick (1697). Seized by the French in 1793, it went in the main to
                    form the department of Forêts. On the 16th March 1815 William I. declared
                    himself king of the Netherlands and duke of Luxemburg, and his claims were
                    sanctioned by the treaty of Vienna,—Luxemburg being considered compensation for
                    the loss of the small principalities of Hadamar, Siegen, Dietz, and
                    Nassau-Dillemburg, the surrender of which to Prussia had deprived William of his
                    place in the Germanic confederation. The fortress was assigned, to the
                    confederation itself, and was garrisoned by six' thousand men, of whom
                    one-fourth belonged to the grand-duke and three-fourths to the confederation.
                    From the recognition of Belgian independence in 1830 to the treaty of London in
                    1839, matters were still more complicated; there were two governments in
                    Luxemburg—one at Luxemburg, acting for the grand-duke, and the other at Arion,
                    acting for Belgium. By the treaty of London about 1218 square miles of the duchy
                    with 149,571 inhabitants were transferred to Belgium, the German confederation
                    and King William being compensated with parts of Limburg. On the dissolution of
                    the confederation the duchy became free from its connexion with Germany, but the
                    fortress remained in the hands of Prussia. A diplomatic contest for possession
                    of the duchy took place between France and Prussia; and the matter became the
                    object of a special conference of the plenipotentiaries of the great powers,
                    Holland, Belgium, and Italy, in 1867. The result was that the neutrality of
                    Luxemburg was guaranteed and the military importance of the town destroyed. The
                    actual demolition of the fortifications evacuated by the Prussians in September
                    1867 did not take place till 1872.</p>

                    miles north of Metz and 25 south-west of Treves, in a position as remarkable for
                    natural beauty as fot military strength. The main part of the town is built on a
                    rocky table-land terminating precipitously towards the north-east and south; the
                    modern portions, known as Pfaffenthal, Clausen, and Grund, lie 200 feet below,
                    in the valley of the Alzetle. Till their demolition in terms of the treaty of
                    1867 the fortifications, on which the engineers of three centuries had expended
                    their skill, were the great feature of the place; in point of strength they
                    ranked, according to Carnot, second only to those of Gibraltar, and like them
                    they were to a great extent hewn out of the solid rock. The site is now occupied
                    partly by a fine public park, partly by new districts of handsome houses, which
                    give the city more of the outward appearance of a capitaL Among the buildings of
                    historical interest are the cathedral of Notre Dame, erected by the Jesuits in
                    1613;' the church of St Michel, dating from 1320; the Government-house, built in
                    1443, and still regularly occupied by the legislative assemblies; the
                    town-house, built in 1830; the law courts, dating from 1565, but serving till
                    1795 as the residence of the governor of Luxemburg; and the athenaeum, built in
                    1594, and now (1882) attended by 500 to 600 pupils. The population of the city
                    and suburbs, which was 15,930 in 1875, is now estimated at 19,000.</p>

                    up in the course of the 10th century, and soon began to surround itself with
                    walls; but it was not till 1503 that a regular system of fortifications was
                    commenced, and the principal features· of the modem fortress were due to Vauban,
                    who accompanied Créqui in his capture of the place in 1664. Extensive additions
                    were made to the works in 1728-34.</p>
