                    of Paris, but had attached himself to the parlement of Paris, and married the
                    niece of the chancellor Aligre. He won the favour of De Bullion, the
                    superintendent of finances, and through him obtained the intendancy of Piedmont,
                    where he made the acquaintance of Mazarin. He was Mazarin’s right hand through
                    the troublous times of the Fronde, and was the medium of communication between
                    him and the queen, when the cardinal was in nominal disgrace at Brühl. He had
                    been made secretary of state in 1643, andon the death of Mazarin was continued
                    in his office. Like Colbert and unlike Fouquet he recognized the fact that Louis
                    intended to govern, and by humouring his master’s passion for knowing every
                    detail of personnel and administration he gained great favour with him. He
                    married his son to a rich heiress, the Marquise de Courtenvaux, and soon began
                    to instruct him in the management of state business. The young man speedily won
                    the king’s confidence, and in 1666 was made secretary of state for war in his
                    father’s room. His talents were perceived by the great Turenne in the short war
                    of the Devolution (1667-68), who gave him instruction not so much in the art of
                    war as in the art of providing armies. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle signed,
                    Louvois devoted himself to the great work of organizing the French army. The
                    years between 1668 and 1672, says Camille Rousset, “were years of preparation,
                    when Lionne was labouring with all his might to find allies, Colbert to find
                    money, and Louvois soldiers for Louis.” Louvois’s work was not the least
                    important of the three. Till then armies were either bodies of free lances
                    collected round a particular general and looking to him for pay, or a sort of
                    armed militia, who looked on soldiering as an interlude, not a profession.
                    Louvois understood the new condition of things, and organized a national
                    standing army. In his organization, which lasted almost without a change till
                    the period of the French Revolution, the leading points must be noted. First
                    among them was the almost forcible enrolment of the nobility and gentry of
                    France, which St Simon so bitterly complains of, and in which Louvois carried
                    out part of Louis’s measures for curbing the spirit of independence by service
                    in the army or at court. Then must be mentioned his elaborate hierarchy of
                    officers, the grades of which with their respective duties he established for
                    the first time, and his new system of drill, perfected by Martinet. Besides the
                    army itself, he organized for its support a system of payment and commissariat,
                    and a hospital system, which made it more like a machine, less dependent on the
                    weather, and far superior to the old German system. Further, with the help of
                    Vauban he formed a corps of engineers, and lastly, to provide the deserving with
                    suitable reward, and encourage the daring, he reorganized the military orders of
                    merit, and founded the Hôtel des Invalides at Paris. The success of his measures
                    is to be seen in the victories of the great war of 1672- 1678, in which his old
                    instructor Turenne was killed. After the peace of Nimeguen in 1678, Louvois was
                    high <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0040-0027"/> in favour, his father Michel le Tellier had been
                    made chancellor, and his only opponent Colbert was in growing disfavour. The ten
                    years of peace between 1G78 and 1688 were distinguished in French history by the
                    rise of Madame de Maintenon, the capture of Strasburg, and the revocation of the
                    edict of Nantes, in all of which Louvois bore a prominent part. The surprise of
                    Strasburg in 1681 in time of peace, in pursuance of an order of the chamber of
                    reunion, was not only planned but executed by Louvois and Monclar, and after the
                    revocation of the Edict of Nantes he claims the credit of inventing the
                    dragonnades. Colbert died in 1683, and had been replaced by Le Pelletier, an
                    adherent of Louvois, in the controller-generalship of finances, and by Louvois
                    himself in his ministry for public buildings, which he took that he might be the
                    minister able to gratify the king’s two favourite pastimes, war and buildings.
                    Louvois was able to superintend the successes of the first years of the war of
                    1688, but died suddenly of apoplexy after leaving the king’s cabinet on July 16,
                    1691. His sudden death caused a suspicion of poison, and struck everybody with
                    surprise. “He is dead,” writes Madame de Sevigné, “that great minister, that
                    important man, who held so grand a position, and whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moi</hi> spread so far, who was the centre of so much.” “Tell the king of
                    England,” said Louis the next day, “that I have lost a good minister, but that
                    his affairs and mine will go none the worse for that.” He was very wrong; with
                    Louvois the organizer of victory was gone. Great war ministers are far rarer
                    than great generals. French history can only point to Carnot as his equal,
                    English history only to the elder Pitt. The comparison with Carnot is an
                    instructive one: both had to organize armies out of old material on a new
                    system, both had to reform the principle of appointing officers, both •were
                    admirable contrivers of campaigns, and both devoted themselves to the material
                    well-being of the soldiers. But in private life the comparison will not hold;
                    Carnot was a good husband, an upright man, and a broad minded thinker and
                    politician, while Louvois married for money and lived openly with various
                    mistresses, most notoriously with the beautiful Madame de Courcelles, used all
                    means to overthrow his rivals, and boasted of having revived persecution in his
                    horrible system of the dragonnades.</p>
