                    Kotla states, and. on the W. by Firozpur district. The surface of Ludhiâna
                    consists for the most part of a broad plain, without hills or rivers, and
                    stretching northward from the native borders to the ancient bed of the Sutlej.
                    The soil is composed of a rich clay, broken by large patches of shifting sand.
                    On the eastern edge, towards Umballa, the soil improves greatly, the clay being
                    here surmounted by a bed of rich mould, suitable for the cultivation of cotton
                    and sugar-cane. Towards the west the sand occurs in union with the superficial
                    clay, and forms a light friable soil, on which cereals form the most profitable
                    crop. Even here, however, the earth is so retentive of moisture that good
                    harvests are reaped from fields which appear to the eye mere stretches of dry
                    and sιndy waste, but are covered, after the autumn rains, by waving sheets of
                    wheat and millet. These southern uplands descend to the valley of the Sutlej by
                    an abrupt terrace, which marks the former bed of the river. The principal stream
                    has now shifted to the opposite side of the valley, leaving a broad alluvial
                    strip, 10 miles in width, between its ancient and its modern bed. The Sutlej
                    itself is here only navigable for boats of small burden. A branch of the Sirhind
                    Canal, now in course of construction, will irrigate a large part of the western
                    <hi rend="italic">pargands.</hi> At present irrigation is almost entirely
                    confined to wells. The district is singularly bare of trees.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 returned a total population of 583,245 persons (319,342 males
                    and 263,903 females), spread over an area of 1359 square miles, inhabiting 879
                    villages and towns, and 151,934 houses. Hindus numbered 219,371; Mohammedans,
                    206,603; Sikhs, 95,463; and “others,” 61,858. In ethnical classification the
                    Jats rank first, both in number (205,304) and in agricultural importance; they
                    form one-third of the total population, and nearly two-thirds of the cultivating
                    class. The Gùjars come next with 30,009 persons. Rajputs number 23,961, and
                    cluster thickly in the fertile strip along the bank of the Sutlej. Though they
                    hold the richest portion <hi rend="italic">)l</hi> the district, they are but
                    careless and improvident cultivators. Brahmans number 21,165, but their social
                    importance is small, and they own but a single village. The mercantile classes
                    are represented by 15,251 Kshattriyas and 8174 Banias. There are also 5549
                    Kashmiris, employed in weaving shawls and woollen goods. Four towns were
                    returned in 1868 as containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, viz., Ludhiana,
                    39,983; Raikot, 9165; Jagraon, 7096; and Machiwara, 6062. Ludhiana is a
                    flourishing agricultural district in spite of the general unpromising appearance
                    of its soil, a result mainly attributable to the untiring diligence of its Jat
                    cultivators. Almost all the available land has been brought under the plough,
                    and in many villages no waste land is left for pasturage, the cattle being fed
                    from cultivated produce. Under <hi rend="italic">rabi</hi> or spring crops there
                    were in 1872-73 198,279 acres of wheat, 30,620 of barley, 162,649 of gram, and
                    576 of poppy. The <hi rend="italic">kharif</hi> or rain crops comprised 129,589
                    acres of <hi rend="italic">jodr,</hi> 49,047 of Indian corn, 55,293 of <hi
                    rend="italic">moth,</hi> and 15,894 of cotton. In spite of their industrious
                    habits, many of the peasantry are deeply in debt, and ∙the rate of interest is
                    high. Most of the land is held by tenants-at-will. Agricultural labourers are
                    paid in grain; in the towns, unskilled labour is paid at the rate of from 3d. to
                    4⅜d. per diem. Ludhiana is comparatively free from danger of actual famine,
                    though it suffers much from drought. The exports, of which the annual value is
                    estimated at £377,120, are chiefly confined to grain, cotton, wool, saltpetre,
                    and indigo; the principal imports (£365,552) are English goods, spices, and red
                    madder dye. Manufactures include shawls, <hi rend="italic">pashmina</hi> cloth,
                    stockings, gloves, cotton goods, furniture, carriages, and firearms. Eight large
                    silk factories and upwards of four hundred private silk-looms give employment to
                    over three thousand persons. Communication is afforded by the Sind, Punjab, and
                    Delhi Railway, which runs through the centre of the district, and by several
                    lines of good metalled roads.</p>
                <p>The administrative staff of the district comprises a deputy commissioner, with an
                    assistant and two extra assistants, a small-cause court judge, and three <hi
                    rend="italic">tahsilddrs,</hi> besides the usual medical and constabulary
                    officers. The total revenue in 1872-73 was £103,795, of which £85,215 was
                    contributed by the land tax. Education in 1873 was afforded by 184 schools, of
                    which 68 were in receipt of Government grants in aid; the total number of
                    enrolled pupils was 6733. In the upland portion of the district the atmosphere
                    is dry and healthy; in the Sutlej valley, however, the air is extremely noxious
                    after the rainy season floods, and fever prevails often in an epidemic form;
                    ophthalmia is also common. The mean temperature in 1872 was 87 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0-</hi> 59 Fahr, in May, 85° '67 in July, and 54 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 85 in December, the maximum being 117°, and the
                    minimum 31°. The average annual rainfall is 28 inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Though the present town of Ludhiana dates no
                    farther back than the 15th century, other cities in the district can claim a
                    much greater antiquity. At Sunet, close to the modern station, are ruins of an
                    extensive brick-built town, whose greatness had already passed away before the
                    period of Mohammedan invasion; and the old Hindu city of Machiwara is of still
                    earner date, being mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Mahdbhdrata.</hi> During
                    the Mussulman epoch, the history of the district is bound up with that of the
                    Rais of Raikot, a family of converted Rajputs, who received the country as a
                    fief under the Sayyid dynasty, about the year 1445. The town of Ludhiana was
                    founded in 1480 by two of the Lodi race (then ruling at Delhi), from whom it
                    derives its name, and was built in great part from the prehistoric bricks of
                    Sunet. The Lodis continued in possession until 1620, when it again fell into the
                    hands of the Rais of Raikot. Throughout the palmy days of the Mughal empire the
                    Ràikot family held sway, but the Sikhs took advantage of the troubled period
                    which accompanied the Mughal decadence to establish their supremacy south of the
                    Sutlej. Several of their chieftains made encroachments on the domains of the
                    Rais, who were only able to hold their own by the aid of George Thomas, the
                    famous adventurer of Hariâna. In 1806 Ranjit Sinh crossed the Sutlej and reduced
                    the obstinate Mohammedan family, and distributed their territory amongst his own
                    co-rcligionists. Since the British occupation of the Punjab Ludhiana has grown
                    in wealth and population, but its history has been uneventful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ludhiana,</hi> the chief town and headquarters station of
                    Ludhiàna district, is situated on the south bank of the old bed of the Sutlej, 8
                    miles from the present bed of the river, in 30° 55' 25" N. lat. and 75° 53' 30"
                    E. long. The population in 1868 was 39,983, viz., Mohammedans, 27,860; Hindus,
                    10,208; Sikhs, 45; Christians, 79; “others,” 1791. The Kashmiris retain their
                    hereditary skill as weavers of shawls and <hi rend="italic">pashmina</hi> cloth,
                    the value of the quantity exported-in 1871-72 being returned at «£13,350. Shawls
                    of the soft Râmpur wool, cotton cloths, scarfs, turbans, furniture, and
                    carriages also form large items in the thriving trade of the town. Since the
                    opening of the railway Ludhiâna has become a great central grain mart, having
                    extensive export transactions both with the north and south. The American
                    Presbyterian Mission has a church and school, with a small colony of native
                    Christians. The town bears a bad reputation for unhealthiness.</p>
