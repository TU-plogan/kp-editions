                    emperor Lothair I., and inherited by his second son, King Lothair II., 855-869,
                    from whose days the name <hi rend="italic">Pegnum Lolharii</hi> first arose.
                    This border-land between the realms of the Eastern and Western Franks in its
                    original extent took in most of the Frisian lowlands between the mouths of the
                    Rhine and the Ems, and a strip of the right shore of the Rhine to within a few
                    miles of Bonn. In the neighbourhood of Bingen it receded from the left shore of
                    the river so as to exclude the dioceses of Worms and Spires, but to admit a
                    certain connexion with Alsace. Towards the west it included nearly the whole
                    territory which is watered by the rivers Moselle and Meuse, and spread over the
                    dioceses of Cologne, Treves, Metz, Toul, Verdun, Liège, and Cambrai. Hence this
                    artificial realm embraced, broadly speaking, almost all modern Holland and
                    Belgium (with the exception of Flanders), part of the Prussian Rhine provinces,
                    and what is still called Lorraine, partly French and partly German, divided,
                    however, from Alsace and the Palatinate by the natural frontier line of the
                    Vosges and the Haardt mountains. Its inhabitants were soon called <hi

                    Louis the German and Charles the Bald divided the realm of Lothair II. more
                    ethnographically by the treaty of Meersen, August 8, 870. After the deposition
                    in 887 of the emperor Charles HL, who for a short time appeared at the head of
                    the three reunited realms, the country still remained distinct, though the
                    invasions of the Northmen and feudal disintegration creeping in from the west
                    vied to tear it to pieces. Yet the emperor Arnulf, after his success against the
                    Scandinavians, restored some order, and made his son Zwentebulch king over that
                    part of the empire in 894. But he never overcame the difficulties inherent in a
                    country peopled by Franks, Burgundians, Almains, Frisians, and Scandinavians,
                    speaking various Romance and Teutonic dialects, the western group being
                    evidently attracted by the growth of a French, the eastern by that of a German
                    nationality. King Zwentebulch quarrelled with certain powerful lords, offended
                    mortally the bishops, especially that of Treves, and finally lost his life in
                    battle on the 13th August 900. In the days of Louis the Child, the last of the
                    eastern Carolings, there rose to ducal dignity Reginar Long-neck, count of
                    Haspengau, Hennegau, or Hainault, who owned a number of fiefs and monasteries in
                    the diocese of Liege. He found it profitable to adhere to Charles, king of the
                    Western Franks, especially after Louis’s death in 911. His son Gisilbert from
                    915 began to rule the Lotharingians likewise in opposition to Conrad I. and
                    Henry I., who were the successors of Louis the Child, with the exception,
                    however, of Alsace and the Frisian districts, which now separated, definitively
                    to remain with the German kingdom. By the treaty of Bonn (921) the Lotharingian
                    duchy was ceded formally to France, until Henry I., profiting by the disunion
                    between Charles the Simple and his rivals, subdued Gisilbert and his dominion
                    (925), and about 928 returned it to him with the hand of his daughter as a
                    member of the German kingdom, though rather more independent than other duchies.
                    Its western frontier now appears to have extended up to the Dutch Zealands.</p>
                <p>Henry’s son, the great Otto L, when his brother rebelled in conjunction with
                    Eberhard and Gisilbert, the dukes of Franconia and Lotharingia, beat and
                    annihilated these two vassals (939), and secured the latter country by a treaty
                    with the French king Louis IV., who married Gisilbert’s widow, entrusting it
                    consecutively to his brother Henry, to a Duke Otto, and from 944 to Conrad the
                    Red, his son-in-law. Chiefly with the help of the Lotharingians he invaded
                    France in order to reinstate the king, who had been dethroned by his proud
                    vassals. But a few years later, when Liudulf, the son of King Otto and the
                    English Edith, and Duke Conrad, discontented with certain measures, rose against
                    their father and lord, the everrestless spirit of the Lotharingians broke out
                    into new commotions. The stern king, however, suppressed them, removed both his
                    son and his son-in-law from their offices, and appointed his youngest brother,
                    the learned and statesmanlike Brun, archbishop of Cologne and chancellor of the
                    realm, to be also duke or, as he is called, archduke of Lotharingia. Brun
                    snatched what was still left of demesne lands and some wealthy abbeys like St
                    Maximine near Treves from the rapacious nobles, who had entirely converted the
                    offices of counts and other functionaries into hereditary property. He presided
                    over their diets, enforced the public peace, and defended with their assistance
                    the frontier lands of Germany against the pernicious influence of the death
                    struggle fought between the last Carolings of Laon and the dukes of Paris.
                    Quelling the insurrections of a younger Reginar in the lower or ripuarian
                    regions, he admitted a faithful Count Frederick, who possessed much land in the
                    Ardennes, at Verdun, and at Bar, to ducal dignity. Although the emperor, after
                    Brun’s early death, October 10, 965, took the border-land into his own hands, he
                    connived, as it appears, at the beginning of a final division between an upper
                    and a lower duchy,—leaving the first to Frederick and his descendants, while the
                    other, administered by a Duke Gottfrid, was again disturbed by a third Reginar
                    and his brother Lambert of Louvain. When Otto II. actually restored their fiefs
                    to them in 976, he nevertheless granted the lower duchy to Charles, a son of the
                    Caroling Louis IV., aud his own aunt Gerberga. Henceforth there are two duchies
                    of Lorraine, the official name applying originally only to the first, but the
                    two dignitaries being distinguished as <hi rend="italic">Dτιx Mosellanorum</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Dux Ripuariorum,</hi> or later on <hi rend="italic">Dux
                    Metensis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Barrensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dux
                    Lovaniensis, de Brabantia, Bullionis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de Limburg.</hi>
                    Both territories now swarmed with ecclesiastical and temporal lords, who
                    struggled to be independent, and, though nominally the subjects of the German
                    kings and emperors, frequently held fiefs from the kings and the grand seigneurs
                    of France.</p>
                <p>Between powerful vassals and encroaching neighbours the imperial delegate in the
                    lower duchy could only be a still more powerful seigneur. But Duke Charles
                    became -the captive of the bishop of Laon, and died in 994. His son, Duke Otto,
                    dying chddless (1004), left two sisters married to the counts of Louvajn and
                    Namur. Between 1012 and 1023 appears Duke Gottfrid I., son of a count of Verdun,
                    and supporter of the emperor Henry II., who, fighting his way against the counts
                    of Louvain, Namur, Luxemburg, and Holland, is succeeded by his brother Gozelo
                    I., hitherto margrave of Antwerp, who since 1033, with the emperor’s permission,
                    ruled also Upper Lorraine, and defended the frontier bravely againstthe
                    incursions of Count Odo of Blois, the adversary of Conrad II. At his death
                    (1046) the upper duchy went to his second son Gottfrid, while the eldest, Gozelo
                    II., succeeded in the lower, until he died childless (1046). But Gottfrid II.
                    (the Bearded), an energetic but untrustworthy vassal, rebelled twice in alliance
                    with King Henry I. of France and Count Baldwin V. of Flanders against the
                    emperor Henry V., who opposed a union of the duchies in such hands. Lower
                    Lorraine therefore was given (1046) to Count Frederick of Luxemburg, after whose
                    death (1065) it was nevertheless held by Gottfrid, who in the mean time, being
                    banished the country, had married Beatrice, the widow of Boniface of Tuscany,
                    and acted a prominent part in the affairs of Italy. As duke of Spoleto and
                    champion of the Holy See he rose to great importance during the turbulent
                    minority of Henry IV. When he died December 21, 1069, his son Gottfrid III., the
                    Hunchbacked, succeeded in the lower duchy, who for a short time was the husband
                    to Matilda of Canossa, the daughter of Boniface and Beatrice. Soon, however, he
                    turned his back on Italy and the pope, joined Henry IV., fought with the Saxon
                    rebels and Robert of Flanders, and in the end was miserably murdered by an
                    emissary of the count of Holland, February 26, 1076. Conrad, the emperor’s young
                    son, now held the duchy nominally till it was granted 1088 to Gottfrid IV.,
                    count of Bouillon, and son of Ida, a sister of Gottfrid III., and Count Eustace
                    of Boulogne, the hero of the first crusade, who died king of Jerusalem in 1100.
                    After him Henry, count of Limburg, obtained the country; but, adhering to the
                    old emperor in his last struggles, he was removed by the son in May 1106 to make
                    room for Gottfrid V., the great-grandson to Lambert I., count of Lorraine, a
                    descendant of the first ducal house, which had been expelled by Otto the Great.
                    Nevertheless he joined his predecessor in rebellion against the emperor (1114),
                    but returned to his side in the war about the see of Liége. Later on he opposed
                    King Lothair III., who in turn supported Walram, son of Henry of Limburg, but
                    died in peace with Conrad <pb break="no"

                    the last duke of Lower Lorraine, and second duke of Brabant. Henceforth the
                    duchy split definitely into that of Limburg, the inheritance of the counts of
                    Verdun, and that of Louvain or Brabant, the dominion of the ancient line of the
                    counts of Haspengau. Various fragments remained in the hands of the counts of
                    Luxemburg, Namur, Flanders, Holland, Juliers, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Upper Lorraine, a hilly table-land, is bordered on the east by the ridge of the
                    Vosges, on the north by the Ardennes, and on the south by the table-land of
                    Langres. Towards the west the open country stretches on into Champagne. The
                    Meuse and the Moselle, the latter with its tributaries Meurthe and Saar, run
                    through it from S.E. to N.W. in a direction parallel to the ridge of the
                    Argonnes. In this country Duke Frederick was succeeded by his son and grandson
                    till 1033. Afterwards Gozelo I. and Gottfrid the Bearded, Count Albert of Alsace
                    and his brother or nephew Gerard, held the duchy successively under very
                    insecure circumstances. The ducal territories were even then on all sides
                    surrounded and broken in upon, not only by those of the three bishops, but also
                    by the powerful counts of Bar. Moreover, when in 1070 a new dynasty was
                    established in Theodoric, son of Count Gerard of Alsace, his brother Gerard of
                    Vaudemont became the founder of a separate line. The former political and feudal
                    ties still connected the duchy with the empire. The bishops were the suffragans
                    of the archbishop of Treves, who rose to be one of the prince-electors. The
                    dukes, however, descending from Theodoric in the male line, though much weakened
                    by the incessant dilapidation of their property, for two centuries adhered
                    generally to the emperor. Duke Simon I. was step-brother of the emperor Lothair
                    III.; his son Matthew I. intermarried with the Hohenstaufen family. His son and
                    grandsons appear traditionally on the side of Henry VI., Philip, Frederick II.,
                    and but rarely prefer the Welfish, opponent. Later on Theobald II. and Frederick
                    IV. supported Albert and Frederick of Austria against Louis the Bavarian. Yet
                    during the same age French feudalism and chivalry, French custom and language,
                    advanced steadily to the disadvantage of German policy and German idioms amongst
                    knights and citizens. King Philip Augustus already promoted Frenchmen to the
                    sees of Cambrai, Verdun, and Toul. Though remaining a fief of the empire, the
                    duchy of Lorraine itself, a loose accumulation of centrifugal elements, was
                    irresistibly attracted by its western neighbour, although the progress of French
                    monarchy for a time was violently checked by the English invasion. Duke Rudolf,
                    a great grandson of Rudolf of Hapsburg, died at Crécy among the French chivalry,
                    like his brother-in-law the count of Bar. To his son John, who was poisoned at
                    Paris (1391), Charles, called the Bold, succeeded, while his brother Frederick,
                    who was slain at Agincourt, had annexed the county of Vaudemont by right of his
                    wife. Charles, who died in 1431 without male issue, had bestowed his daughter
                    Isabella in marriage on René, count of Anjou, and titular king of Naples,
                    Sicily, and Jerusalem, and also a French vassal for fragments of the duchy of
                    Bar, and the fiefs of Pont à Mousson and Guise. However, when he obtained by
                    right of his wife the duchy of Lorraine, he was defeated by Anthony, the son of
                    Frederick of Vaudemont. But by his daughter Iolanthe marrying Frederick II.,
                    Count Anthony’s son and heir, the duchies of Lorraine and Bar were in the end
                    united by René II. with the county of Vaudemont and its dependencies Aumale,
                    Mayenne, and Elboeuf. In the meantime all these prospects were nearly
                    annihilated by the conquests of Charles of Burgundy, who evidently had chosen
                    Lorraine to be the keystone of a vast realm stretching from the North Sea to the
                    Mediterranean. This new border empire, separating Germany from France, fell
                    almost instantly to pieces, however, when the bold. Burgundian lost his
                    conquests and his life in the battle of Nancy, January 4, 1477. After this the
                    duchy tottered on, merging ever more into the stream of French history, though
                    its bishops were princes of the empire and resided in imperial cities. At the
                    death of René II. (1508), his eldest son Anthony, who had been educated in the
                    court of France, inherited Lorraine with its dependencies. The second, Claude,
                    was first duke of Guise, and the third, John, alternately or conjointly with his
                    nephew Nicolaus, bishop of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, better known as the cardinal
                    of Lorraine. Still the old connexion reappeared occasionally during the French
                    wars of the emperor Charles V. In 1525 the country was invaded by German
                    insurgents, and Lutheranism began to spread in the towns. When Maurice, elector
                    of Saxony, and the German princes rose against the emperor (1552), they sold the
                    three bishoprics and the cities of Toul, Metz, and Verdun, as well as Cambrai,
                    to King Henry II., and hailed him as imperial vicar and <hi rend="italic">vindex
                    libertatis</hi><hi rend="italic">Germanise.</hi> In vain did Charles V. lay
                    siege to Metz for nearly three months; the town, already entirely French, was
                    successfully defended by the duke of Guise. German heresy also lost its hold in
                    these territories owing to the Catholic influence of the house of Guise, which
                    ruled the court of France during an eventful period. Charles II., the grandson
                    of Duke Anthony, who as a descendant of Charles the Caroling even ventured to
                    claim the French crown against the house of Bourbon, had by his wife, a daughter
                    of King Henry II., two sons. But Henry, the eldest, brother-in-law to Henry of
                    Navarre, leaving no sons, the duchy at his death, July 31, 1624, reverted to his
                    brother Francis, who, on November 26, 1625, resigned it in favour of his son
                    Charles III., the husband of Duke Henry’s eldest daughter. Siding against
                    Richelieu with the house of Austria and Duke Gaston of Orleans, Charles, after
                    being driven out by the French and the Swedes, resigned the duchy, January 19,
                    1634; and like the three bishoprics it was actually allotted to France by the
                    peace of Westphalia. The duke, however, after fighting with the Fronde, and with
                    Condé and Spain against Turenne and Mazarin, and quarrelling in turn with Spain,
                    was nevertheless reinstated by the treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) under hard
                    conditions. He had to cede the duchy of Bar, to raze the fortifications of
                    Nancy, and to yield the French free passage to the bishoprics and Alsace. But,
                    restless as ever, after trying to be raised among the princes of the blood royal
                    in return for a promise to cede the duchy, he broke again with Louis XIV., and
                    was expelled once more together with his nephew and heir Charles IV. Leopold.
                    Both fought in the Dutch war on the German side in the vain hope of reconquering
                    their country. When Charles IV. after his uncle’s death refused to yield the
                    towns of Longwy and Nancy according to the peace of Nimeguen, Louis XIV.
                    retained the duchy, while its proprietor acted as governor of Tyrol, and fought
                    the Turks for the emperor Leopold I., whose sister he had married. In the next
                    French war he commanded the imperial troops. Hence his son Leopold Joseph, at
                    the cost of Saarlouis, regained the duchy once more by the treaty of Ryswick
                    (1697). This prince carefully held the balance between the contending parties,
                    when Europe struggled for and against the Bourbon succession in Spain, so that
                    his court became a sanctuary for pretenders and ^persecuted partisans. His
                    second son Francis Stephen, by a daughter of Duke Philip of Orleans, and his
                    heir since 1729, surrendered the duchy ultimately, owing to the defeat of
                    Austria in the war for the Polish crown (1735). This being lost by Stanislaus
                    Leszczynski, the father-in-law of Louis XV., the usufruct of Lorraine and a
                    comfortable residence at Nancy were granted to the <pb break="no"

                    more than a century all Lorraine and Alsace up to the Rhine were French.
                    Meanwhile Francis Stephen, since 1736 the husband of Archduchess Maria Theresa,
                    had obtained in compensation the grand-duchy of Tuscany, where the last of the
                    Medici died in 1737. He became his wife’s coregent in the Austrian provinces
                    (1740), and was elected king of the Romans and crowned emperor 1745, the
                    ancestor of the present rulers of Austria. When in the recent Franco-German war
                    both Strasburg and Metz were taken by the German troops after a gallant defence,
                    the French had to submit in the peace of Frankfort, May 10, 1871, to the
                    political and strategical decisions of the conquerors. Old German territory, all
                    Alsace, and a portion of Lorraine, the upper valley of the Saar, the strong
                    fortresses of Diedenhofen (Thionville) and Metz on the Moselle, with the
                    surrounding districts, viz., the greater part of the Moselle and the Meurthe
                    departments, where here and there German is still the language of the
                    inhabitants, were the spoils of victory. They are now united and administered in
                    all civil and military matters as an imperial province of the new German
                    empire.</p>
