                    of the most eminent philosophers of our age, was born May 21, 1817, in Bautzen,
                    in the kingdom of Saxony, and died at Berlin 1st July 1881. The incidents of the
                    life of a philosopher, especially if his career has been exclusively an academic
                    one, are usually passed over as unimportant. In external events no life could be
                    less striking than that of Lotze, who, moreover, was of a retiring disposition,
                    and was forced through delicate health to seclude himself from even such
                    external excitement and dissipation as the quiet university town of Göttingen,
                    where he passed nearly forty years of his life, might afford. His interests on
                    the contrary, as exhibited in his various writings, are most universal; and in a
                    surprising degree he possessed the power of appreciating the wants of practical
                    life, and the demands of a civilization so complicated as that of our age, so
                    full of elements which have not yet yielded to scientific treatment. But,
                    although in his teachings he rose more than most thinkers beyond the temporary
                    and casual influences which surrounded him, it was significant for the
                    development of his ideas that the same country produced him which gave to
                    Germany Lessing and Fichte, that he received his education in the gymnasium of
                    Zittau under the guidance of eminent and energetic teachers, who nursed in him a
                    love and tasteful appreciation of the classical authors, of which in much later
                    years he gave a unique example in his masterly translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antigone</hi> of Sophocles into Latin, and that, himself the son
                    of a physician, he went to the university of Leipsic as a student of philosophy
                    and natural sciences, but enlisted officially as a student of medicine. He was
                    then only seventeen. It appears that thus early Lotze’s studies were governed by
                    two distinct interests and emanated from two centres. The first was his
                    scientific interest and culture, based upon mathematical and physical studies,
                    under the guidance of such eminent representatives of modern exact research as
                    E. H. Weber, W. Volckmann, and G. T. Fechner. The others were his aesthetical
                    and artistic predilections, which were developed under the care of C. H.
                    Weisse.. To the former he owes his appreciation of exact investigation and a
                    complete knowledge of the aims of science, to the latter an equal admiration for
                    the great circle of ideas which had been cultivated and diffused through the
                    teachings of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. But each of these aspects, which
                    early in life must have been familiar to him, exerted on the other a tempering
                    and modifying influence. The true method of science which he possessed forced
                    him to condemn as useless the entire form which Schelling’s and Hegel’s
                    expositions had adopted, especially the dialectic method of the latter, whilst
                    his love of art and beauty, and his appreciation of moral purposes, revealed to
                    him the existence beyond the phenomenal world of a world of values or worths
                    into which no exact science could penetrate. It is evident how this initial
                    position at once defined to him a variety of tasks which philosophy had to
                    perform. First there were the natural sciences themselves only just emerging
                    from an unclear conception of their true method,— especially those which studied
                    the borderland of physical and mental phenomena, the medical sciences,
                    pre-eminently that science which has since become so popular, the science of
                    biology. Lotze’s first essay was his dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">futurae biologiae</hi><hi rend="italic">principibus
                    philosophicis,</hi> with which he gained (1838) the degree of doctor of
                    medicine, after having only four months previously got the degree of doctor of
                    philosophy. Then, secondly, there arose the question whether the methods of
                    exact science sufficed to explain the connexion of phenomena, or whether for the
                    explanation of this the thinking mind was forced to resort to some hypothesis
                    not immediately verifiable by observation, but dictated by our higher
                    aspirations and interests. And, if to satisfy these we were forced to maintain
                    the existence of a world of moral standards, it was, thirdly, necessary to form
                    some opinion as to the relation of these moral standards of value to the forms
                    and facts of phenomenal existence. These different tasks, which philosophy had
                    to fulfil, mark pretty accurately the aims of Lotze’s writings, and the order in
                    which they were published. But, though he laid the foundation of his
                    philosophical system very early, in his <hi rend="italic">Metaphysik</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1841) and his <hi rend="italic">Logik</hi> (1843), and commenced
                    lecturing when only twenty-two years old on philosophical subjects, in Leipsic,
                    though he accepted in 1844 a call to Göttingen to fill the chair of philosophy
                    which had become vacant through the death of Herbart, he did not proceed to an
                    exhaustive development of his peculiar views till very much later, and only
                    during the last decade of his life, after having matured them in his eminently
                    popular lectures, did he with much hesitation venture to present his ideas in
                    something like a systematic form. The two small publications just referred to
                    remained unnoticed by the reading public, and Lotze became first known to a
                    larger circle through a series of works which had the object of establishing in
                    the study of the physical and mental phenomena of the human organism in its
                    normal and diseased states the same general principles which had been adopted in
                    the investigation of inorganic phenomena. These works were his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allgemeine Pathologie und Therapie als mechanische Naturivissenschaften</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1842, 2d ed. 1848), the articles “Lebenskraft” (1843) and “Seele und
                    Seelenleben” (1846) in Rud. Wagner’s <hi rend="italic">Handwörterbuch der
                    Physiologie,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Physiologie des Körperlichen
                    Lebens</hi> (Leipsic, 1851), and his <hi rend="italic">Medizinische Psychologie
                    oder Physiologie der Seele</hi> (Leipsic, 1852). When Lotze came out with these
                    works, medical science was still much under the influence of Schelling’s
                    philosophy of nature. The mechanical laws, to which external things were
                    subject, were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world; in the
                    organic and mental worlds these mechanical laws were conceived as being
                    disturbed or overridden by other powers, such as the influence of final causes,
                    the existence of types, the work of vital and mental forces. This confusion
                    Lotze, who had been trained in the school of mathematical reasoning, tried to
                    dispel. The laws which govern particles of matter in the inorganic world govern
                    them likewise if they are joined into an organism. A phenomenon <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> if followed by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in the one case,
                    is followed by the same <hi rend="italic">b</hi> also in the other case. Final
                    causes, vital and mental forces, the soul itself can, if they act at all, only
                    act through the inexorable mechanism of natural laws. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is to be followed by <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and not by <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> this can only be effected by the additional existence of a
                    third something <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which again by purely mechanical laws
                    would change <hi rend="italic">b</hi> into <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> As we
                    therefore have only to do with the study of existing complexes of material and
                    spiritual phenomena, the changes in these must be explained in science by the
                    rule of mechanical laws, such as obtain everywhere in the world, and only by
                    such. One of the results of these <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n24/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0024-0013"/> investigations was to extend the meaning of the
                    word mechanism, and comprise under it all laws which obtain in the phenomenal
                    world, not excepting the phenomena of life and mind. Mechanism was the
                    unalterable connexion of every phenomenon <hi rend="italic">a</hi> with other
                    phenomena 5, <hi rend="italic">c, d,</hi> either as following or preceding it;
                    mechanism was the inexorable form into which the events of this world are cast,
                    and by which they are connected. The object of those writings was to establish
                    the all-pervading rule of mechanism. But the mechanical view of nature is not
                    identical with the materialistic. In the last of the above-mentioned works the
                    question is discussed at great length how we have to consider mind, and the
                    relation between mind and body; the answer is—we have to consider mind as an
                    immaterial principle, its action, however, on the body and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vice versa</hi> as purely mechanical, indicated by the fixed laws of a
                    psycho-physical mechanism. These doctrines of Lotze— though pronounced with the
                    distinct and reiterated reserve that they did not contain a solution of the
                    philosophical question regarding the nature, origin, or deeper meaning of this
                    all-pervading mechanism, neither an explanation how the action of external
                    things on each other takes place nor yet of the relation of mind and body, that
                    they were merely a preliminary formula of practical scientific value, itself
                    requiring a deeper interpretation—these doctrines were nevertheless by many
                    considered to be the last word of the philosopher who, denouncing the reveries
                    of Schelling or the idealistic theories of Hegel, established the science of
                    life and mind on the same basis as that of material things. Published as they
                    were during the years when the modern school of German materialism was at its
                    height,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Vogt, <hi

                    literature which destroyed the phantom of Hegelian wisdom and vindicated the
                    independent and self-sufficing position of empirical philosophy. Even
                    philosophers of the eminence of J. H. Fichte (the younger) did not escape this
                    misinterpretation of Lotze’s true meaning, though they had his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysik</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Logik</hi> to refer to, though he
                    promised in his <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Physiologie</hi> (1851) to enter in
                    a subsequent work upon the “bounding province between aesthetics and
                    physiology,” and though in his <hi rend="italic">Mediciηische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Psychologie</hi> he had distinctly stated that his position was
                    neither the idealism of Hegel nor the realism of Herbart, nor materialism, but
                    that it was the conviction that the essence of everything is the part it plays
                    in the realization of some idea which is in itself valuable, that the sense of
                    an all-pervading mechanism is to be sought in this that it denotes the ways and
                    means by which the highest idea, which we may call the idea of the good, has
                    voluntarily chosen to realize itself.</p>
                <p>The misinterpretations which he had suffered induced Lotze to publish a small
                    pamphlet of a polemical character <hi rend="italic">(Streitschriften,</hi>
                    Leipsic, 1857), in which he corrected two mistakes. The opposition which he had
                    made to Hegel’s formalism had induced some to associate him with the
                    materialistic school, others to count him among the followers of Herbart, the
                    principal philosopher of eminence who had maintained a lifelong protest against
                    the development which Kant’s doctrines had met with at the hands of Fichte,
                    Schelling, and Hegel. Lotze publicly and formally denied that he belonged to the
                    school of Herbart, though he admitted that historically the same doctrine which
                    might be considered the forerunner of Herbart’s teachings might lead to his own
                    views, viz., the monadology of Leibnitz.</p>
                <p>When Lotze wrote these explanations, he had already given to the world the first
                    volume of his great work, <hi rend="italic">Mikrokosmus</hi> (vol. i. 1856, vol.
                    ii. 1858, vol. iii. 1864; 3d ed., 1876-1880). In many passages of his works on
                    pathology, physiology, and psychology Lotze had distinctly stated that the
                    method of research which he advocated there did not give an explanation of the
                    phenomena of life and mind, but only the means of observing and connecting them
                    together; that the meaning of all phenomena, and the reason of their peculiar
                    connexions, was a philosophical problem which required to be attacked from a
                    different point of view; and that the significance especially which lay in the
                    phenomena of life and mind would only unfold itself if by an exhaustive survey
                    of the entire life of man, individually, socially, and historically, we gain the
                    necessary data for deciding what meaning attaches to the existence of this
                    microcosm, or small world of human life, in the macrocosm of the universe. This
                    review, which extends, in three volumes, over the wide field of anthropology,
                    beginning with the human frame, the soul, and their union in life, advancing to
                    man, his mind, and the course of the world, and concluding* with history,
                    progress, and the connexion of things, ends with the same idea which was
                    expressed in Lotze’s earliest work,— <hi rend="italic">Metaphysik.</hi> The view
                    peculiar to him is reached in the end as the crowning conception towards which
                    all separate channels of thought have tended, and in the light of which the life
                    of man in nature and mind, in the individual and in society, had been surveyed.
                    This view can be briefly stated as follows. Everywhere in the wide realm of
                    observation we find three distinct regions,—the region of facts, the region of
                    laws, and the region of standards of value and worth. These three regions are
                    separate only in our thoughts, not in reality. To comprehend the real position
                    we are forced to the conviction that the world of facts is the field in which,
                    and that laws are the means by which, those higher standards of moral and
                    aesthetical value are being realized; and such a union can again only become
                    intelligible through the idea of a personal Deity, who in the creation and
                    preservation of a world has voluntarily chosen certain forms and laws, through
                    the natural operation of which the ends of His work are gained.</p>
                <p>Whilst Lotze had thus in his published works closed the circle of his thought,
                    beginning with a conception metaphysically gained, proceeding to an exhaustive
                    contemplation of things in the light it afforded, and ending with the stronger
                    conviction of its truth which observation, experience, and life could afford, he
                    had all the time been lecturing on the various branches of philosophy according
                    to the scheme of academical lectures transmitted from his predecessors. Nor can
                    it be considered anything but a gain that he was thus induced to expound his
                    views with regard to those topics, and in connexion with those problems, which
                    were the traditional forms of philosophical utterance. His lectures ranged over
                    a wide field: he delivered annually lectures on psychology and on logic (the
                    latter including a survey of the entirety of philosophical research under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Encyclopädie der Philosophie),</hi> then at longer
                    intervals lectures on metaphysics, philosophy of nature, philosophy of art,
                    philosophy of religion, rarely on history of philosophy and ethics. In these
                    lectures he expounded his peculiar views in a stricter form, and during the last
                    decade of his life he embodied the substance of those courses in his <hi
                    rend="italic">System der Philosophie,</hi> of which only two volumes have
                    appeared (vol. i. <hi rend="italic">Logik,</hi> 1st ed., Leipsic, 1874, 2d ed.,
                    1880; vol. ii. <hi rend="italic">Metaphysik,</hi> 1879). The third and
                    concluding volume, which was to treat in a more condensed form the principal
                    problems of practical philosophy, of philosophy of art and religion, did not
                    appear. A small pamphlet on psychology, containing the last form in which he had
                    begun to treat the subject in his lectures (abruptly terminated through his
                    death) during the summer<pb break="no"

                    Appended to this volume is a complete list of Lotze’s writings, compiled by
                    Professor Rehnisch of Göttingen.</p>
                <p>To understand this series of Lotze’s writings, it is necessary to start with his
                    definition of philosophy. This is given after his exposition of logic has
                    established two points, viz., the existence in our mind of certain laws and
                    forms according to which we connect the material supplied to us by our senses,
                    and, secondly, the fact that logical thought cannot be usefully employed without
                    the assumption of a further set of connexions, not logically necessary, but
                    assumed to exist between the data of experience and observation. These
                    connexions of a real not formal character are handed to us by the separate
                    sciences and by the usage and culture of everyday life. Language has
                    crystallized them into certain definite notions and expressions, without which
                    we cannot proceed a single step, but which we have accepted without knowing
                    their exact meaning, much less their origin. In consequence the special sciences
                    and the wisdom of common life entangle themselves easily and frequently in
                    contradictions. A problem of a purely formal character thus presents itself,
                    viz'., this—to try to bring unity and harmony into the scattered thoughts of our
                    general culture, to trace them to their primary assumptions and follow them into
                    their ultimate consequences, to connect them all together, to remodel, curtail,
                    or amplify them, so as to remove their apparent contradictions, and to combine
                    them in the unity of an harmonious view of things, and especially to make those
                    conceptions from which the single sciences start as assumptions the object of
                    research, and fix the limits of their applicability. This is the formal
                    definition of philosophy. Whether an harmonious conception thus gained will
                    represent more than an agreement among our thoughts, whether it will represent
                    the real connexion of things, and thus possess objective not merely subjective
                    value, cannot be decided at the outset. It is also unwarranted to start with the
                    expectation that everything in the world should be explained by one principle,
                    and it is a needless restriction of our means to expect unity of method. Nor are
                    we able to start our philosophical investigations by an inquiry into the nature
                    of human thought and its capacity to attain an objective knowledge, as in this
                    case we would be actually using that instrument the usefulness of which we were
                    trying to determine. The main proof of the objective value of the view we may
                    gain will rather lie in the degree in which it succeeds in assigning to every
                    element of culture its due position, or in which it is able to appreciate and
                    combine different and apparently opposite tendencies and interests, in the sort
                    of justice with which it weighs our manifold desires and aspirations, balancing
                    them in due proportions, nor sacrificing to a one-sided principle any truth or
                    conviction which experience has proven to be useful and necessary. The
                    investigations will then naturally divide themselves into three parts, the first
                    of which deals with those to our mind inevitable forms in which we are obliged
                    to think about things, if we think at all (metaphysics), the second being
                    devoted to the great region of facts, trying to apply the results of metaphysics
                    to these, specially the two great regions of external and mental phenomena
                    (cosmology and psychology), the third dealing with those standards of value from
                    which we pronounce our aesthetical or ethical approval or disapproval. In each
                    department we shall have to aim first of all at views clear and consistent
                    within themselves, but, secondly, we shall in the end wish to form some general
                    idea or to risk an opinion how laws, facts, and standards of value may be
                    combined in one comprehensive view. Considerations of this kind will naturally
                    turn up in the two great departments of cosmology and psychology, or they may be
                    delegated to an independent research under the name of religious philosophy. We
                    have already mentioned the final conception in which Lotze’s speculation
                    culminates, that of a personal Deity, Himself the essence of all that merits
                    existence for its own sake, who in the creation and government of a world has
                    voluntarily chosen certain laws and forms through which His ends are to be
                    realized. We may add that according to this view nothing is real but the living
                    spirit of God and the world of living spirits which He has created; the things
                    of this world have only reality in so far as they are the appearance of
                    spiritual substance, which underlies everything. It is natural that Lotze,
                    having this great and final conception always before him, works under its
                    influence from the very beginning of his speculations, permitting us—as we
                    progress—to gain every now and then a glimpse of that interpretation of things
                    which to him contains the solution of our difficulties.</p>
                <p>The key to Lotze’s theoretical philosophy lies in his metaphysics, to the
                    exposition of which important subject the first and last of his larger
                    publications have been devoted. To understand Lotze’s philosophy, a careful and
                    repeated perusal of these works is absolutely necessary. The object of his
                    metaphysics is so to remodel the current notions regarding the existence of
                    things and their connexions with which the usage of language supplies us as to
                    make them consistent and thinkable. The further assumption, that the modified
                    notions thus gained have an objective meaning, and that they somehow correspond
                    to the real order of the existing world which of course they <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> can never actually describe, depends upon a general
                    confidence which we must have in our reasoning powers, and in the significance
                    of a world in which we ourselves with all the necessary courses of our thoughts
                    have a place assigned to them in harmony with the whole. The object therefore of
                    these investigations is opposed to two attempts frequently repeated in the
                    history of philosophy, viz. :—(1) the attempt to establish general laws or
                    forms, which the development of things must have obeyed, or which a Creator must
                    have followed in the creation of a world (Hegel); and (2) the attempt to trace
                    the genesis of our notions, and decide as to their meaning and value (modern
                    theories of knowledge). Neither of these attempts is practicable. The world of
                    many things surrounds us; our notions, by which we manage correctly or
                    incorrectly to describe it, are also ready made. What remains to be done is, not
                    to explain how such a world manages to be what it is, nor how we came to form
                    these notions, but merely this—to expel from the circle and totality of our
                    conceptions those abstract notions which are inconsistent and jarring, or to
                    remodel ι nd define them so that they may constitute a consistent and harmonious
                    view. In this endeavour Lotze discards as useless and untenable many favourite
                    conceptions of the school, many crude notions of everyday life. The course of
                    things and their connexion is only thinkable by the assumption of many things
                    the reality of which (as distinguished from their existence in our thoughts) can
                    be conceived only as a multitude of relations. This, standing in relation to
                    other things, gives to a thing its reality. And. the nature of this reality
                    again can neither be consistently represented as a fixed and hard substance nor
                    as an unalterable something, but only <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> as a fixed
                    order of recurrence of continually changing events or impressions. But, further,
                    every attempt to think clearly what those relations are, what we really mean, if
                    we talk of a fixed order of events, forces upon us the necessity of thinking
                    also that the different things which stand in relations or the different phases
                    which follow each other cannot be merely externally strung together or moved
                    about by some indefinable external power, in the form of some predestination or
                    inexorable fate. The things themselves which exist and their changing phases
                    must stand in some internal connexion; they themselves must be active or
                    passive, capable of doing or suffering. This would lead to the view of Leibnitz,
                    that the world consists of monads, self-sufficient beings, leading an inner
                    life. But this idea involves the further conception of Leibnitz, that of a
                    pre-established harmony, by which the Creator has cared to arrange the life of
                    each monad, so that it agrees with that of all others. This conception,
                    according to Lotze, is neither necessary nor thoroughly intelligible. Why not
                    interpret at once and render intelligible the conception of everyday life
                    originating in natural science, viz., that of a system of laws which governs the
                    many things? But, in attempting to make this conception quite cleai’ and
                    thinkable, we are forced to represent the connexion of things as a universal
                    substance, the essence of which we conceive as a system of laws which underlies
                    everything and in its own self connects everything, but imperceptible, and known
                    to us merely through the impressions it produces on us, which we call things. A
                    final reflexion then teaches us that the nature of this universal and
                    all-pervading substance can only be imagined by us as something analogous to our
                    own mental life, where alone we experience the unity of a substance (which we
                    call self) preserved in the multitude of its (mental) states. It also becomes
                    clear that only where such mental life really appears need we assign an
                    independent existence, but that the purposes of everyday life as well as those
                    of science are equally served if we deprive the material things outside of us of
                    an independence, and assign to them merely a connected existence through the
                    universal substance by the action of which alone they can appear to us.</p>
                <p>The universal substance, which we may call the absolute, is at this stage of our
                    investigations not endowed with the attributes of a personal Deity, and. it will
                    remain to be seen by further analysis in how far we are able—without
                    contradiction—to identify it with the object of religious veneration, in how far
                    that which to metaphysics is merely a postulate can be gradually brought nearer
                    to us and become a living power. Much in this direction is said by Lotze in
                    various passages of his writings; anything complete, however, on the subject is
                    wanting. Nor would it seem as if it could be the intention of the author to do
                    much more than point out the lines on which the further treatment of the subject
                    should advance. The actual result of his personal inquiries, the great idea
                    which lies at the foundation of his philosophy, we know. It may be safely stated
                    that Lotze would allow much latitude to individual convictions, as indeed it is
                    evident that the empty notion of an absolute can only become living and
                    significant to us in the same degree as experience and t hought have taught us
                    to realize the seriousness of life, the significance of creation, the value of
                    the beautiful and the good, and the supreme worth of personal holiness. To endow
                    the universal substance with moral attributes, to maintain that it is more than
                    the metaphysical ground of everything, to say it is the perfect realization of
                    the holy, the beautiful, and the good, <pb break="no"

                    himself what real not imaginary values are clothed in those expressions.</p>
                <p>We have still to mention that aesthetics formed a principal and favourite study
                    of Lotze’s, and that he has treated this subject also in the light of the
                    leading ideas of his philosophy. See his essays <hi rend="italic">Uebcr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">den Begriff der Schönheit,</hi> Gottingen, 1845, and <hi
                    rend="italic">üeber Bedingungen der Kunstschönheit,</hi> ibid., 1847; and
                    especially his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aesthetik</hi><hi rend="italic">in Deutschland,</hi> Munich, 1868.</p>
                <p>Lotze’s historical position is of much interest. Though ho disclaims being a
                    follower of Herbart, his formal definition of philosophy and his conception of
                    the object of metaphysics are similar to those of Herbart, who defines
                    philosophy as an attempt to remodel the notions given by experience. In this
                    endeavour he forms with Herbart an opposition to the philosophies of Fichte,
                    Schelling, and Hegel, which aimed at objective and absolute knowledge, and also
                    to the criticism of Kant, which aimed at determining the validity of all human
                    knowledge. But this formal agreement involves material differences, and the
                    spirit which breathes in Lotze’s writings is more akin to the objects and
                    aspirations of the idealistic school than to the cold formalism of Herbart.
                    What, however, with the idealists was an object of thought alone, the absolute,
                    is to Lotze only inadequately definable in rigorous philosophical language; the
                    aspirations of the human heart, the contents of our feelings and desires, the
                    aims of art, and the tenets of religious faith must be grasped in order to fill
                    the empty idea of the absolute with meaning. These manifestations of the divine
                    spirit again cannot be traced and understood by reducing (as Hegel did) the
                    growth of the human mind in the individual, in society, and in history to the
                    monotonous rhythm of a speculative schematism; the essence and worth which is in
                    them reveals itself only to the student of detail, for reality is larger and
                    wider than philosophy; the problem, “how the one can be many,” is only solved
                    for us in the numberless examples in life and experience which surround us, for
                    which we must retain a lifelong interest, and which constitute the true field of
                    all useful human work. This conviction of the emptiness of terms and abstract
                    notions, and of the fulness of individual life, has enabled Lotze to combine in
                    his writings the two courses into which German philosophical thought had been
                    moving since the death of its great founder, Leibnitz. We may define these
                    courses by the terms esoteric and exoteric,—the former the philosophy of the
                    school, cultivated principally at the universities, trying to systematize
                    everything and reduce all our knowledge to an intelligible principle, losing in
                    this attempt the deeper meaning of Leibnitz’s philosophy; the latter the
                    philosophy of general culture, contained in the literature of the classical
                    period, in the unsystematic writings of Lessing, Winkelmann, Goethe, Schiller,
                    and Herder, who more or less expressed their indebtedness to Leibnitz. Lotze can
                    be said to have brought philosophy out of the schoolroom into the market of
                    life. By understanding and combining what was great and valuable in those
                    divided and scattered endeavours, he has become the true successor of Leibnitz,
                    and his philosophy will no doubt attain that universal celebrity which was
                    attained by the monadology and the system of pre-established harmony.</p>
                <p>The age in which Lotze lived and wrote in Germany was not one peculiarly fitted
                    to appreciate the position he took up. Frequently misunderstood, yet rarely
                    criticized, he was nevertheless greatly admired, listened to by devoted hearers,
                    and read by an increasing circle. But no watchword of easy currency, no ready
                    Shibboleth, attracts or helps to combine this increasing circle to the unity of
                    a philosophical school. The real meaning of Lotze’s teaching is reached only by
                    patient study, and those who in a larger or narrower sense call themselves his
                    followers will probably feel themselves indebted to him more for the general
                    direction he has given to their thoughts, for the tone he has imparted to their
                    inner life, for the seriousness with which he has taught them to consider even
                    small affairs and practical duties, and for the indestructible confidence with
                    which his philosophy permits them to disregard the materialism of science, the
                    scepticism of shallow culture, the disquieting results of philosophical and
                    historical criticism. It is not unlikely that the present phase of English
                    thought will more easily assimilate the valuable elements of Lotze’s philosophy,
                    as indeed fragments and beginnings of a similar view exist already in English
                    literature. Wherever his writings are widely read and appreciated, it will be on
                    account of the great moral influence which his philosophy exerts in common with
                    some systems of the past, but almost alone among the systems of the day. (j∕T.
