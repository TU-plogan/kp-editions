                    very exactly, partly because they varied at different times, partly because we
                    are still but imperfectly acquainted with the geography of western Asia Minor.
                    The name is first found, under the form of Luddi, in the inscriptions of the
                    Assyrian king Assur-bani-pal, who received tribute from Gyges about 660 <hi

                    v. 43, x. 431), and the place of the Lydian capital Sardes is taken by Hyde (ZZ,
                    xx. 385), unless this was the name of the district in which Sardes stood (see
                    Strabo, xiii. p. 626).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Greek writer who mentions the name is Mimnermus of Colophon, in the 37th
                    Olympiad. According to Herodotus (i. 7), the Meiones (called Maeones by other
                    writers) were named Lydians after Lydus, the son of Attys, in the mythical epoch
                    which preceded the rise of the Heraclid dynasty. In historical times, however,
                    the Maeones were a tribe inhabiting the district of the Upper Hermus, where a
                    town called Maeonia (now <hi rend="italic">Menηeη)</hi> existed (Pliny, <hi
                        rend="italic">N. H.,</hi> v. 30; Hierocles, p. 670). The Lydians must
                    originally have been an allied tribe which bordered upon them to the north-west,
                    and occupied the plain of Sardes or Magnesia at the foot of Tmolus and Sipylus.
                    They were cut off from the sea by the Greeks, who were in possession, not only
                    of the Bay of Smyrna, but also of the country north of Sipylus as far as Temnus,
                    in the Boghaz, or pass, through which the Hermus forces its way from the plain
                    of Magnesia into its lower valley.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    ridge north of the Hermus, on which the ruins of Temnus lie, is called Sardene.
                    Northward the Lydians extended at least as far as the Gygaean Lake (Lake Coloe,
                    now <hi rend="italic">Mermereh),</hi> and the Sardene range (now <hi
                        rend="italic">Dumaηly DagK).</hi> The plateau of the Bin Bir Tepé, on the
                    southern shore of the Gygaean Lake, was the chief burialplace of the inhabitants
                    of Sardes, and is still thickly studded with tumuli, among which the “tomb of
                    Alyattes” towers to a height of 260 feet. Next to Sardes, Magnesia ad Sipylum
                    was the chief city of the country, having taken the place of the ancient
                    Sipylus, now probably represented by an almost inaccessible acropolis discovered
                    by Mr Humann not far from Magnesia on the northern cliff of Mount Sipylus. In
                    its neighbourhood is the famous seated figure of “Niobe” (Z∕., xxiv. 614-17),
                    cut out of the rock, and probably intended to represent the goddess Cybele, to
                    which the Greeks attached their legend of Niobe. According to Pliny (v. 31),
                    Tantalis, afterwards swallowed up by earthquake in the pool Sale or Saloe, was
                    the ancient name of Sipylus and “the capital of Maeonia” (Paus., vii. 24;
                    Strabo, xii. p. 579).</p>

                <p>Under the Heraclid dynasty the limits of Lydia must have been already extended,
                    since according to Strabo (xiii. p. 590), the authority of Gyges reached as far
                    as the Troad, and we learn from the Assyrian inscriptions that the same king
                    sent tribute to Assur-bani-pal, whose dominions were bounded on the west by the
                    Halys. But under the Mermnads Lydia became a maritime as well as an inland
                    power. The Greek cities were conquered, and the coast of Ionia included within
                    the Lydian kingdom. The successes of Croesus finally changed the Lydian kingdom
                    into a Lydian empire, and all Asia Minor westward of the Halys, with the
                    exception of Lycia, owned the supremacy of Sardes. Lydia never again shrank back
                    into its original dimensions. After the Persian conquest the Maeander was
                    regarded as its southern boundary, and in the Roman period it comprised the
                    country between Mysia and Caria on the one side and Phrygia and the Aegean on
                    the other.</p>
                <p>Lydia proper was exceedingly fertile. The hill-sides were clothed with vine and
                    fir, and the rich broad plain of Hermus produced large quantities of corn and
                    saffron. The climate of the plain was soft but healthy, though the country was
                    subject to frequent earthquakes. The Pactolus, which flowed from the fountain of
                    Tarne in the Tmolus mountains, through the centre of Sardes, into the Hermus,
                    was believed to be full of golden sand; and gold mines were worked in Tmolus
                    itself, though by the time of Strabo the proceeds had become so small as hardly
                    to pay for the expense of working them (Strabo, xiii. 591). Maeonia on the east
                    contained the curious barren plateau known to the Greeks as the Catacecaumene or
                    Burnt country, once a centre of volcanic disturbance. The Gygaean lake (where
                    remains of pile dwellings have been found) still abounds with carp, which
                    frequently grow to a very large size.</p>
                <p>Herodotus (i. 171) tells us that Lydus was a brother of Mysus and Car. The
                    statement is on the whole borne out by the few Lydian, Mysian, and Carian words
                    that have been preserved, as well as by the general character of the
                    civilization prevailing among the three nations. The language, so far as can be
                    judged from its scanty remains, was Indo-European, and more closely related to
                    the western than to the eastern branch of the family. The race was probably a
                    mixed one, consisting of aborigines and Aryan immigrants. It was characterized
                    by industry and a commercial spirit, and, before the Persian conquest, by
                    bravery as well.</p>
                <p>The religion of the Lydians resembled that of the other civiΓized nations of Asia
                    Minor. It was a nature-worship, which at times became wild and sensuous. By the
                    side of the supreme god Medeus stood the sun-god Attys, as in Phrygia the chief
                    object of the popular cult. He was at once the son and bridegroom of Cybele or
                    Cybebe, the mother of the gods, whose image carved by Broteas, son of Tantalus,
                    was adored on the cliffs of Sipylus (Paus., iii. 22). Like the Semitic Tammuz or
                    Adonis, he was the beautiful youth who had mutilated himself in a moment of
                    frenzy or despair, and whose temples were served by eunuch priests. Or again he
                    was the dying sun-god, slain by the winter, and mourned by Cybele, as Adonis was
                    by Aphrodite in the old myth which the Greeks had borrowed from Phoenicia. This
                    worship of Attys was in great measure due to foreign influence. Doubtless there
                    had been an ancient native god of the name, but the associated myths and rites
                    came almost wholly from abroad. The Hittites in their stronghold of Carchemish
                    on the Euphrates had adopted the Babylonian cult of Istar (Ashtoreth) and
                    Tammuz-Adonis, and had handed it on to the tribes of Asia Minor. The close
                    resemblance between the story of Attys and that of Adonis was the result of a
                    common origin. The old legends of the Semitic East had come to the West through
                    two channels. The Phoenicians brought them by sea and the Hittites by land. But
                    though the worship of Makar or Melkarth on Lesbos (ZZ., xxiv. 544) shows that
                    the Phoenician faith had found a home on this part of the coast of Asia Minor,
                    it could have had no influence upon Lydia, which, as we have seen, was cut off
                    from the sea before the rise of the Mermnads. It was rather to the Hittites that
                    Lydia, like Phrygia and Cappadocia, owed its faith in Attys and Cybele. The
                    latter became “the mother of Asia,” and at Ephesus, where she was adored under
                    the form of a meteoric stone, was identified with the Greek Artemis. Her mural
                    crown is first seen in the Hittite sculptures of Boghaz Keui on the Halys, and
                    the bee was sacred to her. A gem found near Aleppo represents her Hittite
                    counterpart standing on this insect. The priestesses by whom she was served are
                    depicted in early art as armed with the double-headed axe, and the dances they
                    performed in her honour with shield and bow gave rise to the myths which saw in
                    them the Amazons, a nation of woman-warriors. The prae-Hellenic cities of the
                    coast—Smyrna, Samorna (Ephesus), Myrina, Cyme, Priene, and Pitane—were all of
                    Amazonian origin, and the first three of them have the same name as thé Amazon
                    Myrina, whose tomb was pointed out in the Troad. The prostitution whereby the
                    Lydian girls gained their dowries (Herod., i. 93) was a religious exercise, as
                    among the Semites, which marked their devotion to the goddess Cybele. In the
                    legend of Hercules, Omphale takes the place of Cybele, and was perhaps her
                    Lydian title. Hercules is here the sun-god Attys in a new form; his Lydian name
                    is unknown, since E. Meyer has shown <hi rend="italic">(Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> xxxi.
                    4) that Sandon belongs not to Lydia but to Cilicia. By the side of Attys stood
                    the moon-god Manes or Men.</p>
                <p>According to the native historian Xanthus (460 B.c.) three dynasties ruled in
                    succession over Lydia. The first, that of the Attyads, is wholly mythical. It
                    was headed by a god, and included geographical personages like Lydus, Asies, and
                    Meles, or such heroes of folk-lore as Cambletes, who devoured his wife. To this
                    mythical age belongs the colony which, according to Herodotus (i. 94), Tyrsenus,
                    the son of Attys, led to Etruria. Xanthus, however, puts Torrhebus in the place
                    of Tyrsenus, and makes him the eponym of a district in Lydia. There was no
                    connexion between the Etrurians and Lydians in either language or race, and the
                    story in Herodotus rests solely on the supposed resemblance of Tyrrhenus and
                    Torrhebus. It is doubtful whether Xanthus recognized the Greek legends which
                    brought Pelops from Lydia, or rather Maeonia, and made him the son of Tantalus.
                    The legends must have grown up after the Greek colonization of Aeolis and Ionia,
                    though Dr Schliemann’s discoveries at Mycenae have shown a certain likeness
                    between the art of early Greece and that of Asia Minor, while the gold found
                    there in such abundance may have been derived from the mines of Tmolus. The
                    second dynasty was also of divine origin, but the names which head it prove its
                    connexion with the distant East. Its founder, a descendant of Hercules and
                    Omphale, was, Herodotus tells us (i. 7), a son of Ninus and grandson of Belus.
                    The Assyrian inscriptions have shown that the Assyrians had never crossed the
                    Halys, much less known the name of Lydia, before the age of Assur-bani-pal, and
                    consequently the old theory which brought the Heraclids from Nineveh must be
                    given up. But we now know that the case was otherwise with another Oriental
                    people, which was deeply imbued with the elements of Babylonian culture. The
                    Hittites had overrun Asia Minor and established themselves on the shores of the
                    Aegean before the reign of the Egyptian king Ramses II.</p>

                <p>The subject allies who then fight under their banners include the Masu or Mysians
                    and the Dardani of the Troad from Iluna or Ilion and Pidasa (Pedasus); and, if
                    we follow Brugsch, Iluna should be read Mauna and identified with Maeonia. At
                    the same time the Hittites left memorials of themselves in Lydia. Mr G. Dennis
                    has discovered an inscription in Hittite hieroglyphics attached to the figure of
                    “Niobe” on Sipylus, and a similar inscription accompanies the figure (in which
                    Herodotus [ii. 106] wished to see Sesostris or Ramses II.) carved on the cliff
                    of Kârabel, the pass which leads from the plain of Sardes to that of Ephesus. We
                    learn from Eusebius that Sardes was first captured by the Cimmerians 1078 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and, since it was four centuries later before
                    the real Cimmerians appeared on the horizon of history, we may perhaps find in
                    the statement a tradition of the Hittite conquest. Possibly the Ninus of
                    Herodotus points to the fact that Carchemish was called “the old Ninus” (Amm.
                    Marc,,xiv. 8), while the mention of Belus may indicate that Hittite civilization
                    came from the land of Bel (see Sayce, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Soc. Biblical
                        Arch.,</hi> vii. 2). At all events it was when the authority of the Hittite
                    satraps at Sardes began to decay that the Heraclid dynasty arose. According to
                    Xanthus, Sadyattes and Lixus were the successors of Tylon the son of Omphale.
                    After lasting five hundred and five years, the dynasty came to an end in the
                    person of Sadyattes, as he is called by Nicolas of Damascus, whose account is
                    doubtless derived from Xanthus. The name Candaules given him by Herodotus meant
                    “dog-strangler,” and was a title of the Lydian Hermes. Gyges, termed Gugu in the
                    Assyrian inscriptions, Gog in the Old Testament, put him to death and
                    established the dynasty of the Mermnads 690 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    (Euseb., 698 B.C.). Gyges initiated a new policy, that of making Lydia a
                    maritime power; but his attempt to capture Old Smyrna was unsuccessful. Towards
                    the middle of his reign the kingdom was overrun by the Cimmerians, called
                    Gimirrae in the Assyrian texts, Gomer in the Old Testament, who had been driven
                    from their old seats on the Sea of Azoff by an invasion of Scythians, and thrown
                    upon Asia Minor by the defeat they had suffered at the hands of Esar-haddon. The
                    lower town of Sardes was taken by them, and Gyges turned to Assyria for aid,
                    consenting to become the tributary of Assur-bani-pal or Sardanapalus, and
                    sending him among other presents two Cimmerian chieftains he had himself
                    captured in battle (about 660 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> At first no one
                    could be found in Nineveh who understood the language of the ambassadors. A few
                    years later, Gyges joined in the revolt against Assyria, which was headed by the
                    viceroy of Babylonia, Assur-bani-paΓs own brother. The Ionic and Carian
                    mercenaries he despatched to Egypt enabled Psammetichus to make himself
                    independent. Assyria, however, was soon avenged. The Cimmerian hordes returned,
                    Gyges was slain in battle after a reign of thirtyeight years, and Ardys his son
                    and successor returned to his allegiance to Nineveh. The second capture of
                    Sardes on this occasion was alluded to by Callisthenes (Strabo, xiii. p. 627).
                    Alyattes the grandson of Ardys finally succeeded in extirpating the Cimmerians,
                    as well as in taking Smyrna, and thus providing his kingdom with a port. The
                    trade and wealth of Lydia rapidly increased, and the Greek towns fell one after
                    the other before the attacks of the Lydian kings. Alyattes’s long reign of
                    fifty-seven years saw the foundation of the Lydian empire. All Asia Minor west
                    of the Halys owned his sway, and the six years’ contest he carried on with the
                    Medes was closed by the marriage of his daughter Aryenis to Astyages, and an
                    intimate alliance between the two empires. The Greek cities were allowed to
                    retain their own institutions and government on condition of paying taxes and
                    dues to the Lydian monarch, and the proceeds of their commerce thus flowed into
                    the imperial exchequer. The result was that the king of Lydia became the richest
                    prince of his age. Alyattes was succeeded by Croesus, who had probably already
                    for some years shared the royal power with his father, or perhaps grandfather,
                    as Floigl thinks <hi rend="italic">{Geschichte des semitischen</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Alterthums</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> p. 20). He
                    reigned alone only fifteen years, Cyrus the Persian, after an indecisive battle
                    on the banks of the Halys, marching upon Sardes, and capturing both acropolis
                    and monarch before his allies could come to his help (Euseb., 546 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The place where the acropolis was entered was
                    believed to have been overlooked by the mythical Meles when he carried the lion
                    round his fortress which made it invulnerable; it was really a path opened by
                    one of the landslips which have reduced the sandstone cliff of the Acropolis to
                    a mere shell, and threaten in a few years to carry it altogether into the plain
                    below. The overthrow of Croesus gave rise to many legends among both Lydians and
                    Greeks, and he was held to have escaped death at the conqueror’s hands through
                    the intervention of the gods. The revolt of the Lydians under Pactyas, whom
                    Cyrus had appointed to collect the taxes, caused the Persian king to disarm
                    them, though we can hardly credit the statement that by this measure their
                    former warlike spirit was crushed. Sardes now became the western capital of the
                    Persian empire, and its burning by the Athenians was the indirect cause of the
                    Persian War. After Alexander’s death, Lydia passed to Antigonus; then Achaeus
                    made himself king at Sardes, but was defeated and put to death by Antiochus. The
                    country was presented by the Romans to Eumenes, and subsequently formed part of
                    the proconsular province of Asia. By the time of Strabo (xiii. p. 631) its old
                    language was entirely supplanted by Greek.</p>
                <p>The Lydian empire may be described as the industrial power of the ancient world.
                    The Lydians were credited with being the inventors, not only of games such as
                    dice, huckle-bones, and ball (Herod., i. 94), but also of coined money. The
                    oldest known coins are the electrum coins of the earlier Mermnads (Madden, <hi
                        rend="italic">Coins of the Jews,</hi> pp. 19-21), stamped on one side with a
                    lion’s head or the figure of a king with bow and quiver; these were replaced by
                    Croesus with a coinage of pure gold and silver. To the latter monarch λvere
                    probably due the earliest gold coins of Ephesus (Head, <hi rend="italic">Coinage
                        of Ephesus,</hi> p. 16). Mr Head has shown that the electrum coins of Lydia
                    were of two kinds, one weighing 168’4 grains for the inland trade, and another
                    of 224 grains for the trade with Ionia. The standard was the silver “mina of
                    Carchemish,” as the Assyrians called it, which contained 8656 grains. Originally
                    derived by the Hittites from Babylonia, but modified by themselves, this
                    standard was passed on to the nations of Asia Minor during the period of Hittite
                    conquest, but was eventually superseded by the Phoenician mina of 11,225 grains,
                    and continued to survive only in Cyprus and Cilicia. The inns, which the Lydians
                    were said to have been the first to establish (Herod., i. 94), were connected
                    with their attention to commercial pursuits. Their literature has wholly
                    perished, and the only specimen of their writing we possess is on a marble base
                    found by Mr Wood at Ephesus (Schliemann, <hi rend="italic">Ilios,</hi> p. 698).
                    They were celebrated for their music and gymnastic exercises, and their art
                    formed a link between that of Asia Minor and that of Greece. A marble lion at
                    Achmetly represents in a modified form the Assyrian type, and the engraved gems
                    found in the neighbourhood of Sardes and Old Smyrna resemble the rιιde
                    imitations of Assyrian workmanship met with in Cyprus and on the coasts of Asia
                    Minor. For a description of a pectoral of white gold, ornamented with the heads
                    of animals, human faces, and the figure of a goddess, discovered in a tomb on
                    Tmolus, see <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> January 15, 1881, p. 45. Lydian
                    sculpture was probably similar to that of the Phrygians as displayed at
                    Doghanly, Kumbet, and Ayazin, a necropolis lately discovered by Mr Ramsay.
                    Phallic emblems, for averting evil, were plentiful; even the summit of the tomb
                    of Alyattes is crowned with an enormous one of stone, about 9 feet in diameter.
                    The tumulus itself is 281 yards in diameter and about half a mile in
                    circumference. It has been partially excavated by Spiegelthal and Dennis, and a
                    sepulchral chamber discovered in the middle, composed of large well-cut and
                    highly polished blocks of marble, the chamber being 11 feet long, nearly 8 feet
                    broad, and 7 feet high. Nothing was found in it except a few ashes and a broken
                    vase of Egyptian alabaster. The stone basement which, according to Herodotus,
                    formerly surrounded the mound has now disappeared. (A. H. S. ) <pb break="no"
