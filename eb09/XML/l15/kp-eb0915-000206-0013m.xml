                    (1826-1870), eldest son of Carlos Antonio Lopez above noticed, was born near
                    Asuncion, Paraguay, July 24, 1826. During his boyhood his father was in hiding,
                    and in consequence his education was wholly neglected. Soon after his father’s
                    accession to the presidency, Francisco, then in his nineteenth year, was made
                    commander-in-chief of the Paraguayan army, during the spasmodic hostilities then
                    prevailing with the Argentine Republic. After receiving successively the highest
                    offices of the state, he was sent in 1853 as minister to England, France, and
                    Italy, to ratify formally treaties made with these powers the previous year. He
                    spent a year and a half in Europe, and succeeded in purchasing large quantities
                    of arms and military supplies, together with several steamers, and organized a
                    project for building a railroad and establishing a French colony in Paraguay. He
                    also formed the acquaintance of Madame Lynch, an Irish adventuress of many
                    talents and popular qualities, who became his mistress, and strongly influenced
                    his later ambitious schemes. Returning to Paraguay, he became in 1855 minister
                    of war, and on his father’s death in 1862 at once assumed the reins of
                    government as vice-president, in accordance with a provision of his father’s
                    will, and called a congress by which he was chosen president for ten years. He
                    had long cherished ambitious designs, and now set himself to enlarge the army,
                    and purchase in Europe large quantities of military stores. In 1864 he began
                    open aggression on Brazil by demanding, in his self-styled capacity of
                    “protector of the equilibrium of the La Plata,” that Brazil should abandon her
                    armed interference in a <pb break="no"

                    Uruguay. No attention being paid to his demand, he treacherously seized a
                    Brazilian merchant steamer in the harbour of Asuncion, and threw into prison the
                    Brazilian governor of the province of Matto Grosso who was on board. In the
                    following month (December 1864) he despatched a force to invade Matto Grosso,
                    which seized and sacked its capital Cuyabâ, and took possession of the province
                    and its diamond mines. Lopez next sought to send an army to the relief of the
                    Uruguayan president Aguirro against the revolutionary aspirant Flores, who was
                    supported by Brazilian troops. The refusal of the Argentine president, Mitre, to
                    allow this force to cross the intervening province of Corrientes, was seized
                    upon by Lopez as an occasion for war with the Argentine Republic.</p>
                <p>A congress, hastily summoned and composed of his own nominees, bestowed upon
                    Lopez the title of marshal, with extraordinary war powers, and on April 13,
                    1865, he declared war, at the same time seizing two Argentine warvessels in the
                    bay of Corrientes, and on the next day occupied the town of Corrientes,
                    instituted a provisional government of his Argentine partisans, and summarily
                    announced the annexation to Paraguay of the provinces of Corrientes and Entre
                    Rios. Meantime the party of Flores had been successful in Uruguay, and that
                    state on April 18 united with the Argentine Republic in a declaration of war on
                    Paraguay, the news of the treacherous proceedings of Lopez having then but just
                    reached Buenos Ayres. On May 1st Brazil joined these two states in a secret
                    alliance, which stipulated that they should unitedly prosecute the ⅜war “until
                    the existing government of Paraguay should be overthrown,” and “until no arms or
                    elements of war should be left to it.” This agreement was literally carried
                    out.</p>
                <p>The war which ensued, lasting until April 1, 1870, was on the largest scale of
                    any that South America had experienced, and was carried on with great
                    stubbornness and with alternating fortunes, though with a steadily increasing
                    tide of disasters to Lopez (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Paraguay).</hi> In 1868,
                    when the allies were pressing him hard before the various strongholds still
                    remaining to him in Paraguay, his mind, naturally suspicious and revengeful, led
                    him to conceive that a conspiracy had been formed against his life in his own
                    capital and by his chief adherents. His bloodthirsty rage knew no bounds. In a
                    short time several hundred of the chief Paraguayan citizens were seized and
                    executed by his order, including his brothers and brothers-in-law, cabinet
                    ministers, judges, prefects, military officers of the highest grade, the bishops
                    and priests, and nine-tenths of the civil officers, together with more than two
                    hundred foreigners, among them several members of the different diplomatic
                    legations.</p>
                <p>Lopez was at last driven with a mere handful of troops to the northern frontier
                    of Paraguay, where on April 1, 1870, he was surprised by a Brazilian force and
                    killed as he was endeavouring to escape by swimming the river Aquidaban. His
                    ill-starred ambition had in a few years reduced Paraguay from the prosperity
                    which it had enjoyed under his father to a condition of hopeless weakness, and
                    it has since remained a virtual dependency of Brazil.</p>
