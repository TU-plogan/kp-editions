                    been executed six months before his birth for killing the Marquis de Beuvron in
                    a duel, but his aunt, the Princesse de Condé, recognizing in him the last male
                    heir of her great family De Montmorency, took charge of him, and educated him
                    with her son, the Due d’Enghien. The young Montmorency attached himself
                    enthusiastically to his cousin, and shared his successes and reverses throughout
                    the troubles of the Fronde. He returned to France in 1659 and was pardoned, and
                    Condé, who was then much attached to the Duchesse de Châtillon, Montmorency’s
                    sister, contrived the marriage of his adherent and cousin to the greatest
                    heiress in France, the Princesse de Tingry, after which he was created Due de
                    Luxembourg and peer of France. At the opening· of the war of the devolution,
                    1667-68, Condé, and consequently Luxembourg, had no command, but in the second
                    campaign he served as one of Condé’s lieutenants in the conquest of Franche
                    Comté. During the four years of peace which followed the peace of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, Luxembourg diligently cultivated the favour of Louvois, and in
                    1672 received orders to commence hostilities with the Dutch. He defeated the
                    prince of Orange, whom he was to beat again and again, at Woerden, and ravaged
                    Holland, and in 1673 made his famous retreat from Utrecht with only 20,000 men
                    in face of 70,000, an exploit which placed him in the first rank of generals. In
                    1674 he was made captain of the gardes du corps, and in 1675 was made marshal of
                    France. In 1676 he was placed at the head of the army of the Rhine, but failed
                    to keep the duke of Lorraine out of Philipsburg; in 1677 he stormed
                    Valenciennes; and in 1678 he defeated the prince of Orange, who attacked him at
                    St Denis after the signature of the peace of Nimeguen. His reputation was now at
                    a great height, and it is commonly reputed that he quarrelled with Louvois, who
                    managed to mix him up in the confessions of the poisoners, and get him sent to
                    the Bastille. Rousset in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Louvois</hi> has, however, shown that this quarrel is probably apocryphal. There
                    is no doubt that Luxembourg spent some months of 1680 in the Bastille, but on
                    his release took up his post at court as <hi rend="italic">capitaine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des gardes,</hi> and was in no way disgraced. When the war of 1690
                    broke out, the king and Louvois also recognized that Luxembourg was the only
                    general they had fit to cope with the prince of Orange, and accordingly he was
                    put in command of the army of Flanders. On July 1, 1690, he defeated the prince
                    of Waldeck at Fleurus with the loss of 14,000 men and 49 pieces of cannon. In
                    the following year he commanded the army which covered the king, who was
                    besieging Mons, and defeated William III. of England at Leuze on September 18,
                    1691. Again in the next campaign he covered the king’s siege of Namur, and
                    utterly defeated William at Steenkerk on June 5, 1692; and on July 29, 1693, he
                    won his greatest victory over his old adversary at Neerwinden, in which he took
                    76 pieces of cannon and 80 flags. No wonder he was received with enthusiasm at
                    Paris by all but the king, who looked coldly on a relative and adherent of the
                    Condés. He conceived himself strong enough to undertake an enterprise which St
                    Simon describes at length in the first , volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi>: instead of ranking as eighteenth peer of France according to his
                    patent of 1661, he claimed through his wife to be Due de Piney of an old
                    creation of 1571, which would place him second on the roll. The whole affair is
                    described with St Simon’s usual keen interest in all that concerned the peerage,
                    and was chiefly checked through his assiduity. In the campaign of 1694, possibly
                    owing to this check, Luxembourg did but little in Flanders, except his
                    well-known march from Vignamont to Tournay in face of the enemy. On his return
                    to Versailles for the winter he fell ill, and died on January 4, 1695. In his
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n100/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0100-0087"/> last moments he was attended by the famous Jesuit
                    priest Bourdaloue, who said on his death, “I have not lived his life, but I
                    would wish to die his death.” The holy father certainly had not lived like
                    Luxembourg, whose morals were conspicuously bad even in those times, and whose
                    life had shown very slight signs of religious conviction. But as a general he
                    was Condé’s grandest pupil. Utterly slothful, like Condé, in the management of a
                    campaign, and therein differing from Turenne, at the moment of battle he seemed
                    seized with happy inspirations, against which no ardour of William’s and no
                    steadiness of Dutch or English soldiers could stand. His death and Catinat’s
                    disgrace close the second period of the military history of the reign of Louis
                    XIV., and Catinat and Luxembourg, though inferior to Condé and Turenne, were
                    very far superior to Tailard and Villeroi. He was distinguished for a pungent
                    wit. One of his best retorts referred to his deformity. “I never can beat
                    that'cursed humpback,” William· was reputed to have said of him. “How does he
                    know I have a hump 1” retorted Luxembourg, “he has never seen my back.” He left
                    four sons, the youngest of whom was a marshal of France as Maréchal de
                    Montmorency.</p>
