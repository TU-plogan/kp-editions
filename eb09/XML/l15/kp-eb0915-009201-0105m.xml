                    Pausanias (viii. 2) says that Lycaon sacrificed a child to Zeus, and was during
                    the sacrifice turned into a wolf. Henceforth the story ran—a man was turned into
                    a wolf at each annual sacrifice to Zeus Lycaeus, recovering his human form after
                    ten years if he had not during that time eaten human flesh. Lycaon is evidently
                    the Lycaean form of a very common conception, viz., the divine first man, whose
                    life is the heavenly fire, who conies to earth and returns to heaven as the
                    lightning. The oldest city, the oldest cultus, and the first civilization of
                    Arcadia are attributed to him. The mysterious cultus and the human sacrifices,
                    which continued apparently through the historical period (Paus., viii. 38), of
                    Zeus Lycaeus have moulded the legends of the Lycaean first man and first king.
                    Moreover his name, which is connected with that of the mountain, suggested a
                    derivation from <hi rend="italic">λvκoς,</hi> wolf; and legends analogous to
                    those of the Teutonic were-wolf (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lycanthropy)</hi>
                    naturally grew round him.</p>
                <p>. LYCAONIA, in ancient geography, was the name given to a province in the
                    interior of Asia Minor, north of Mount Taurus. It was bounded on the E. by
                    Cappadocia, on the N. by Galatia, on the W. by Phrygia and Pisidia, while to the
                    S. it extended to the chain of Mount Taurus, from which it was, however, in part
                    separated by Isauria, though some writers included that district in Lycaonia.
                    Its boundaries appear indeed to have varied at different times, as was the case
                    with all the nations of Asia Minor. The name is not found in Herodotus, but
                    Lycaonia is mentioned by Xenophon as traversed by Cyrus the younger on his march
                    through Asia. That author, however, describes Iconium, one of the principal
                    cities of Lycaonia, as included in Phrygia. But in Strabo’s time the limits of
                    the province were more clearly recognized, though Isauria was by some authors
                    considered as a part of Lycaonia, by others as a distinct province. Ptolemy, on
                    the other hand, includes Lycaonia as a part of Cappadocia, with which it may
                    have been associated by the Romans for administrative purposes; but the two
                    countries are clearly distinguished both by Strabo and Xenophon.</p>
                <p>*Lycaonia is well described by Strabo as a cold region of elevated plains,
                    affording pasture to wild asses and to sheep. It in fact forms a part of the
                    great table-land which constitutes the whole interior of Asia Minor, and has
                    throughout its whole extent an elevation of more than 3000 feet above the sea.
                    It suffers, moreover, severely from the want of water, aggravated by the
                    abundance of salt in the soil, so that the whole northern portion of the
                    province, extending from near Iconium to the salt lake of Tatta, and the
                    frontiers of Galatia, was almost wholly barren. Other portions of the country,
                    however, notwithstanding the deficiency of water, were well adapted for feeding
                    sheep, so that Amyntas, king of Galatia, to whom the district was for a time
                    subject, maintained there not less than three hundred flocks, which brought him
                    in a large revenue.</p>
                <p>Though the greater part of Lycaonia is a broad open plain, extending as far as
                    the underfalls of the Taurus, its monotonous character is interrupted by some
                    minor ranges, or rather groups of mountains, of volcanic character, of which the
                    Kara Dagh in the southern portion of the district, a few miles north of Karaman,
                    rises to a height of above 8000 feet, while the Karadja Dagh, to the north-east
                    of the preceding, though of very inferior elevation, presents a striking range
                    of volcanic cones. The mountains in the north-west of the province, near Iconium
                    and Laodicea, on the other hand, are the termination of the great range of the
                    Sultan Dagh, which traverses a large part of Phrygia.</p>
                <p>The Lycaonians appear to have been in early times to a great extent independent
                    of the Persian empire, and were like their neighbours the Isaurians a wild and
                    lawless race of freebooters; but their country was traversed by one of the great
                    natural lines of high road through Asia Minor, from Sardis and Ephesus to the
                    Cilician gates, and a few considerable towns would naturally grow up along this
                    line of route. The most important of these was Iconium, in the most fertile spot
                    in the province, of which it has always continued to be the capital. It is still
                    called Konieh. A little farther north, immediately on the frontier of Phrygia,
                    stood Laodicea (Ladik), called Combusta, to distinguish it from the Phrygian
                    city of that name; and in the south, near the foot of Mount Taurus, was Laranda,
                    now called Karaman, which has given name to the province of Karamania. Derbe and
                    Lystra, which appear from the Acts of the Apostles to have been considerable
                    towns, were apparently situated in the same part of the district, but their
                    sites have not been identified. The other towns mentioned by ancient writers
                    were insignificant places.</p>
                <p>The Lycaonians appear to have still retained a distinct nationality in the time
                    of Strabo, but we are wholly in the dark as to their ethnical affinities, or
                    relations to the tribes by which they were surrounded. The mention of the
                    Lycaonian language in the Acts of the Apostles (xiv. 11) is evidently only
                    intended to designate the vernacular tongue, as opposed to Greek, and cannot be
                    regarded as any proof that they spoke a different language from their neighbours
                    the Phrygians or Cappadocians.</p>
