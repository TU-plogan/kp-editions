                <p><label type="entry">LOTTERIES</label>. The word lottery has no very definite
                    signification. It may be applied to any process of determining prizes by lot,
                    whether the object be amusement, or gambling, or public profit. In the Roman
                    Saturnalia and in the banquets of aristocratic Romans the object was amusement;
                    the guests received <hi rend="italic">apophoreta.</hi> The same plan was
                    followed on a magnificent scale by some of the emperors. Nero excited the people
                    by giving such prizes as a house or a slave. Heliogabalus introduced an element
                    of absurdity,—one ticket for a golden vase, another for six flies. This amusing
                    custom descended to the festivals given by the feudal and merchant princes of
                    Europe, especially of Italy; and it afterwards formed a prominent feature of the
                    splendid court hospitality of Louis XIV. In the Italian republics of the 16th
                    century the lottery principle was applied to encourage the sale of merchandise.
                    The lotto of Florence and the seminario of Genoa are well known, and Venice
                    established a monopoly and drew a considerable revenue for the state. The first
                    letters patent for a lottery in France were granted by Francis I., and in 1656
                    the Italian Tonti (the originator of “Tontines ’’) opened another for the
                    building of a stone bridge between the Louvre and the Faubourg St Germain. The
                    institution became very popular in France, and gradually assumed an important
                    place in the Government finance. The parliaments frequently protested against
                    it, but it had the support of Mazarin, and Pontchartrain by this means raised
                    the expenses of the Spanish Succession War. Necker, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Administration des Finances,</hi> estimates the public charge for lotteries at
                    4,000,000 livres per annum. There were also lotteries for the benefit of
                    religious communities and charitable purposes. Two of the largest were the <hi
                    rend="italic">Loteries de Piété</hi> and <hi rend="italic">des Eηfans</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Trouvés.</hi> These and also the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loterie</hi><hi rend="italic">de l'</hi><hi rend="italic">École militaire</hi>
                    were practically merged in the <hi rend="italic">Loterie Royale</hi> by the
                    famous decree of 1776, suppressing all private lotteries in France. The
                    financial basis of these larger lotteries was to take ∙∕ <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ths for expenses and benefit, and return ⅛∣ths to the public who
                    subscribed. The calculation of chances had become a familiar science. It is
                    explained in detail by M. Caminade de Castres in <hi rend="italic">Enc.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Méth.</hi><hi rend="italic">Finances,</hi> ii., <hi rend="italic"
                    >s. ν.</hi> “Loterie.” The names of the winning numbers in the first drawing
                    were (1) <hi rend="italic">extrait,</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic">ambe,</hi> (3)
                    <hi rend="italic">terne,</hi> (4) <hi rend="italic">quaterne,</hi> (5) <hi
                    rend="italic">quine.</hi> After this there were four drawings called <hi
                    rend="italic">primes</hi><hi rend="italic">gratuites.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >extrait</hi> gave fifteen times the price of the ticket; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quine</hi> gave one million times the price. These are said to be much more
                    favourable terms than were given in Vienna, Frankfort, and other leading
                    European cities at the end of the 18th century. There is no doubt that lotteries
                    had a demoralizing effect on French society. They were denounced by the eloquent
                    bishop of Autun as no better than the popular games of <hi rend="italic"
                    >belle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">biribi ·</hi> they were condemned on financial
                    grounds, by Turgot; and Condillac compared them to the debasement of money which
                    was at one time practised by the kings of France. The <hi rend="italic">Loterie
                    Royale,</hi> was ultimately suppressed in 1836. Under the law of 29th May 1844
                    lotteries may be held for the assistance of charity and the fine arts. The
                    Société du Credit Foncier, and many of the large towns, are permitted to
                    contract loans, the periodical repayments of which are determined by lot. This
                    practice, which is prohibited in Germany and England, resembles the older system
                    of giving higher and lower rates of interest for money according to lot.
                    Lotteries were suppressed in Belgium in 1830, but they still figure largely in
                    the State budgets of Germany, Holland, Spain, and Italy.</p>
                <p>In England the earliest lotteries sanctioned by Government were for such purposes
                    as the repair of harbours in 1569, and the Virginia Company in 1612. In 1696 by
                    the Act 10 &amp; 11 Will. III. c. 17 lotteries, with the exception of the Royal
                    Oak lottery, were prohibited as common nuisances, by which children, servants,
                    and other unwary persons had been ruined. This prohibition was in the 18th
                    century gradually extended to illegal insurances on marriages and other events,
                    and to a great many games with dice, such as faro, basset, hazard, except
                    backgammon and games played in the royal palace. In spite of these prohibitions,
                    the Government from 1709 down to 1824 showed a bad example to the nation by
                    annually raising considerable sums in lotteries authorized by Act of Parliament.
                    The prizes were in the form of terminable or perpetual annuities. The £10
                    tickets were sold at a premium of say 40 per cent, to contractors who resold
                    them in retail (sometimes in one-sixteenth parts) by “morocco men,” or men with
                    red leather books who travelled through the' country. As the drawing extended
                    over forty days, a very pernicious system arose of insuring the fate of tickets
                    during the drawing for a small premium of 4d. or 6d. This was partly cured by
                    the Little Go Act of 1802, 42 Geo. III. c. 119, directed against the itinerant
                    wheels which plied between the state lotteries, and partly by Perceval’s Act in
                    1806, which confined the drawing of each lottery to one day. From 1793 to 1824
                    the Government made an average yearly profit of £346,765. Cope, one of the
                    largest contractors, is said to have spent £36,000 in advertisements in a single
                    year. The English lotteries were used to raise loans for general purposes, but
                    latterly they were confined to particular objects, such as the improvement of
                    London, the disposal of Cox’s museum, the purchase of Tomkin’s picture gallery,
                    &lt;fcc. Through the efforts of Lyttleton and others a strong public opinion was
                    formed against them, and in 1826 they were finally prohibited. An energetic
                    proposal to revive the system was made before the select committee on
                    metropolitan improvements in 1830, but it was not listened to. By a unique
                    blunder in legislation, authority was given to hold a lottery under the Act 1
                    &amp; 2 Will. IV. c. 8, which provides a scheme for the improvement of the city
                    of Glasgow. These “Glasgow lotteries” were suppressed by 4 &lt;fc 5 Will. IV. c.
                    37. The statute law in Scotland is the same as in England. At common law in
                    Scotland it is probable that all lotteries and raffles, for whatever purpose
                    held, may be indicted as nuisances. The art unions are supposed to be protected
                    by a special statute.</p>
                <p>The American Congress of 1776 instituted a national lottery. The scheme was
                    warmly advocated by Jefferson and other statesmen, and before 1820 at least
                    seventy Acts were passed by Congress authorizing lotteries for various public
                    purposes, such as schools, roads, &amp;c.,—about 85 per cent, of the
                    subscriptions being returned in prizes. A sounder opinion now prevails on this
                    subject in America.</p>
                <p>The only systematic work on this subject is the <hi rend="italic">Critique hist,
