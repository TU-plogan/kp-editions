                        rend="smallcaps">Lanterloo),</hi> a round game of cards. Loo may be played
                    by any number of persons; from five to seven makes the best game. “Three-card
                    loo” is the game usually played. A pack of fifty-two cards is required. The
                    players being seated, the pack is shuffled and a card dealt face upwards to
                    each. The player to whom a knave falls has the first deal, the player to his
                    left deals next, and so on in rotation. Each player is entitled to a deal, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the game should not be abandoned till it returns to
                    the original dealer; but, if there is a loo in the last deal of a round, the
                    game continues till there is a hand without a loo. The pack is cut to the
                    dealer, who deals three cards to each player and an extra hand called <hi
                        rend="italic">miss.</hi> The dealer turns up the top of the undealt cards
                    for trumps. The dealer is sometimes permitted to deal the cards in any order he
                    pleases; but the best rule is to require that the cards be dealt one at a time
                    in rotation, as at whist. During the deal each player contributes to the <hi
                        rend="italic">pool</hi> a sum previously agreed upon, the dealer
                    contributing double. The unit for a single stake should be divisible by three
                    without a remainder, <hi rend="italic">e,g.,</hi> three counters or three pence.
                    The players are bound to put in the stake before the deal is completed;
                    sometimes a penalty is enforced for neglect. The deal being completed and the
                    pool formed, each player in rotation, beginning from the dealer’s left, looks at
                    his cards, and declares whether he will play, resign, or take miss. If the
                    former, he says “I play.” If he takes miss he places his cards face downwards in
                    the middle of the table, and takes up the extra hand. If he resigns, he
                    similarly places his cards face downwards in the middle of the table. If miss is
                    taken, the subsequent players only have the option of playing or resigning. A
                    player who takes miss must play. Those who have declared to play, and the one—if
                    there is one—who has taken miss, then play one card each in rotation, beginning
                    from the dealer’s left, the cards thus played constituting a <hi rend="italic"
                        >trick.</hi> The trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, or, if
                    trumped, by the highest trump, the cards ranking as at whist. The winner of the
                    trick leads to the next, and so on, until the hand is played out. The cards
                    remain face upwards in front of the persons playing them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rules of Play.—</hi> If the leader holds ace of trumps he must
                    lead it (or king, if ace is turned up). If the leader has two trumps he must
                    lead one of them, and if one is ace (or king, ace being turned up) he must lead
                    it. With this exception the leader is not bound to lead his highest trump if
                    more than two declare to play; <hi rend="italic">but if there are only two
                        declared players</hi> the leader with more than one trump must lead the
                    highest. Except with trumps as above stated he may lead any card he chooses. The
                    subsequent players must head the trick if able, and must follow suit if able.
                    Holding none of the suit led, they must head tlιe trick with a trump, if able.
                    Otherwise they may play any card they please. The winner of the first trick is
                    subject to the rules already stated respecting the lead, and in addition he must
                    lead a trump if able (called <hi rend="italic">trump after trick).</hi></p>
                <p>When the hand has been played out, the winners of the tricks divide the pool,
                    each receiving one-third of the amount for each trick. If only one declared to
                    play, the dealer plays miss either for himself or for the pool. If he plays for
                    the pool he must declare before seeing miss that he does not play for himself.
                    Any tricks he may win, when playing for the pool, remain there as an addition to
                    the next pool.</p>
                <p>If each declared player wins at least one trick it is a <hi rend="italic">single,
                        i.e.,</hi> a fresh pool is made as already described; but if one of the
                    declared players fails to make a trick he is <hi rend="italic">looed.</hi> Then,
                    only the player who is looed contributes to the next pool, together with the
                    dealer, who puts in a single stake. If more than one player is looed, each has
                    to contribute. At <hi rend="italic">unlimited loo</hi> each player looed has to
                    put in the amount there was in the pool. But it is generally agreed to <hi
                        rend="italic">limit</hi> the loo, so that it shall not exceed a certain
                    fixed sum. Thus, at eighteen-penny loo, the loo is generally limited to half a
                    guinea. If there is less than the limit in the pool the payment is regulated as
                    before; but if there is more than the limit, the loo is the fixed sum agreed
                    on.</p>
                <p>The game is sometimes varied by <hi rend="italic">forces, i.e.,</hi> by
                    compelling every one to play, either whenever there is no loo the previous deal
                    (α <hi rend="italic">single),</hi> or whenever clubs are trumps <hi
                        rend="italic">{club law).</hi> When there is a force no miss is dealt. <hi
                        rend="italic">Irish loo</hi> is played by allowing declared players to
                    exchange some or all of their cards for cards dealt from the top of the pack.
                    There is no miss, and it is not compulsory to lead a trump with two trumps,
                    unless there are only two declared players. At <hi rend="italic">five-card
                        loo</hi> each player has five cards instead of three, and a single stake
                    should be divisible by five. <hi rend="italic">Pam</hi> (knave of clubs) ranks
                    as the highest trump, whatever suit is turned up. There is no miss, and cards
                    may be exchanged as at Irish loo. If ace of trumps is led, the leader says “Pam
                    be civil,” when the holder of that card must pass the trick if he can do so
                    without revoking. A flush (five cards of the same suit, or four with Pam) <hi
                        rend="italic">loos the board, i.c.,</hi> the holder receives the amount of a
                    loo from every one, and the hand is not played. A tramp flush takes precedence
                    of flushes in other suits. If more than one flush is held, or if Pam is held,
                    the holder is exempted from payment. As between two flushes which do not take
                    precedence, the elder hand wins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Declaring to Play, and Playing</hi> (three-card loo).—Play on
                    two tramps. The first to declare should play on an honour in tramps <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n13/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0013-0002"/> and an ace in plain suits. Play also on king
                    of trumps; but some players throw up king of trumps single unless with it
                    another king or a guarded queen is held. Also play on one tramp with two other
                    cards as high as queens; some players throw up this hand. Holding a trump and
                    two aces, lead the trump if three others declare to play; but otherwise lead an
                    ace. Do not play on a hand without a trump; except, play on any cards that give
                    a reasonable chance of a trick, or take miss, if the amount in the pool is
                    considerable, and the loo is limited. If the number of players is less than
                    five, or if several throw up, weaker hands may be played; on the other side, if
                    several have declared to play, only a very strong hand should be risked. If
                    there are only three left in, all others having thrown up, miss should be taken,
                    but not when there are more than two to follow the player whose turn it is to
                    declare.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laws of Loo.—</hi> These vary greatly, and should be agreed on
                    before commencing to play. The ordinary rules, which loo the player for nearly
                    every error, are very bad. The following are based on the laws of the late
                    Blenheim Club. 1. First knave deals. 2. Each player has a right to shuffle. 3.
                    The player to the dealer’s right cuts the pack. 4. The dealer must deliver the
                    cards, one by one, in rotation, as at whist, and must deal one card for miss at
                    the end of each round; he must turn up the top card of the undealt cards for
                    trumps. 5. If the dealer deals without having the pack cut, or shuffles after it
                    is cut, or deals except as provided in law 4, or deals two cards together and
                    then deals a third without rectifying the error, or exposes a card, or deals too
                    many cards, he forfeits a single to the pool, and deals again.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The law which loos a
                            player· for misdealing is atrocious, and should always be
                        opposed.</p></note> 6. The player to the left of the dealer deals next. If a
                    player deals out of turn, he may be stopped before the tramp card is turned,
                    otherwise the deal stands good, and the player to his left deals next. 7.
                    Players must declare to play in rotation, beginning to the dealer’s left. A
                    player looking at his cards before his turn forfeits a single to the pool. 8. A
                    player who declares before his turn, or who exposes a card, forfeits a single to
                    the pool, and must throw up his hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Forfeits of a single go to increase the pool already
                            formed, and see note to law 5.</p></note> 9. If a declared player
                    exposes a card before his turn to play, or plays out of turn, or before all have
                    declared, or detaches a card so that it can be named by any other declared
                    player, or revokes, he must leave in the pool any tricks he may make, and
                    forfeit four times the amount of a single. If he makes no trick he is looed, and
                    there is no further penalty. 10. If the leader holds ace of trumps and does not
                    lead it (or king, ace being turned up), or if he holds two tramps and does not
                    lead one, or the highest of two or more trumps when there are only two declared
                    players (unless his cards are sequence cards or cards of equal value), or if a
                    player does not head the trick when able, or if he does not lead trump after
                    trick (if he holds a trump), he is liable to the same penalty as in law 9.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tricks left in the pool
                            and fines under laws 9 and 10 go to the next pool and not to the pool
                            already formed. Many players inflict the penalty of a loo for the
                            offences named in laws 9 and 10; but the rule above, as played at the
                            Blenheim, is the best.</p></note> 11. In case of revokes or errors in
                    play the hand must be replayed if so desired by any one except the offender. 12.
                    The place of an aftercomer is decided by dealing a card between every two of the
                    players. The aftercomer sits where the first knave falls. (H. J. )</p>
