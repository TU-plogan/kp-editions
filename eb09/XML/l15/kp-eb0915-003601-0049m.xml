                    procurator for the province. In a memoir by an anonymous grammarian, who may
                    have abridged Suetonius, Lucan is said to have been taken to Rome at the age of
                    eight months, to have displayed remarkable precocity, and to have incurred the
                    displeasure of Nero by overcoming him in a poetical contest. The latter
                    statement seems to be founded upon a misapprehension of a passage in Statius’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Genethliacon Lucani</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it is
                    certain that Nero, whether from j ealousy, as Tacitus affirms, or on account of
                    the republican spirit of Lucan’s poetry, forbade him to recite in public, and
                    that his indignation made him an accomplice in the conspiracy of Piso, 65 A.D.
                    Upon the discovery of the plot he is alleged to have endeavoured to purchase
                    safety by impeaching his own mother (“hoping,” says his translator Gorges
                    quaintly, “that this impiety might be a means to procure pardon at the hands of
                    an impious prince”). The statement, however, of Tacitus, that letters were
                    forged in his name to implicate his father, warrants the suspicion that the
                    evidence against his mother may also have been fabricated. Failing to obtain a
                    reprieve, he caused his veins to be opened, and expired with great courage,
                    repeating a passage from his <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> descriptive of the
                    death of a wounded soldier (“Lucan by his death approved,” Shelley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Adonaif).</hi> His father was involved in the proscription, his
                    mother escaped, and his widow Polla Argentaria survived to receive the homage of
                    Statius under Domitian.</p>
                <p>Besides his principal performance, Lucan’s works included juvenile poems on the
                    descent of Orpheus and the ransom of Hector, an unfinished tragedy on the
                    subject of Medea, and numerous miscellaneous pieces. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carmen ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Pisonem</hi> sometimes attributed to him is now
                    more commonly ascribed to Saleius Bassus. His minor works have perished, but all
                    that the author wrote of the <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> has come down to
                    us. It would probably have concluded with the battle of Philippi, but breaks off
                    abruptly as Caesar, beset by foes, is about to plunge into the harbour of
                    Alexandria. This incompleteness should not be left out of account in the
                    estimate of its merits, for, with two capital exceptions, the faults of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> are such as revision might have mitigated or
                    removed. No such pains, certainly, could have amended the deficiency of unity of
                    action, or supplied the want of a legitimate protagonist. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pharsalia</hi> follows history with inevitable servility, and is rather a
                    metrical chronicle than a true epic. If it had been completed according to the
                    author’s design, Pompey, Cato, and Brutus must have successively enacted the
                    part of nominal hero, while the real hero is the arch enemy of liberty and
                    Lucan, Caesar. Yet these defects, though glaring, are not fatal or peculiar to
                    Lucan. Thereat hero of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> it has been
                    repeatedly observed, is no other than Satan; and Shakespeare himself succeeded
                    no better than Lucan in preserving unity of action when he wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Julius</hi><hi rend="italic">Caesar.</hi> The false taste, the
                    strained rhetoric, the ostentatious erudition, the tedious harangues and
                    far-fetched or commonplace reflexions so-frequent in this singularly unequal
                    poem, are faults much-more irritating, but they are also faults capable of
                    amendment, and which the writer might not improbably have removed. As pointed
                    out by Dean Merivale, the bombastic style of composition which prevailed under
                    Nero yielded to a more sober taste under the Flavian dynasty; and the lapse of
                    time would have contributed to mellow the poet’s immaturity and chasten the
                    ardour of temperament which made him essay great themes “ante annos Culicis
                    Maroniani.” Great allowance should also be made for the difficulties the highest
                    genius must encounter when emulating predecessors who have already carried art
                    to its-last perfection, and thus necessitated to choose between mere imitation
                    and a conscious effort after originality. Lucan’s temper could never have
                    brooked the former course; his versification, no less than his subject, is
                    entirely his own; he avoids all resemblance to his great predecessor with a
                    persistency which can only have resulted from deliberate purpose, while largely
                    influenced by the declamatory school of his grandfather and uncle. Hence his
                    partiality for finished antithesis, contrasting strongly with his generally
                    breathless style and turbid diction. Quintilian sums up both aspects of his
                    genius with pregnant brevity, “Ardens et concitatus et sententiis clarissimus,”
                    adding with equal justice, “Magis oratoribus quam poetis annumerandus.” Lucan’s
                    oratory, however, frequently rises into the region of poetry, especially where
                    it sets forth ideas essentially sublime, and impressive in the mere statement.
                    Such are the apotheosis of Pompey at the beginning of the ninth book, and the
                    passage in the same book where Cato, in the truest spirit of the Stoic
                    philosophy, refuses to consult the oracle of Jupiter Ammon. The exordium of the
                    poem, and the portraits of Caesar and Pompey, are examples of oratory blazing up
                    into poetry, as a wheel takes fire by friction. In some cases Lucan’s rhetoric
                    is frigid, hyperbolical, and out of keeping with the character of the speaker,
                    as in Caesar’s address to his legions before Pharsalia; in general, however, it
                    may be said that the more he is of an orator or a moralist the more he is of a
                    poet. If this denotes that his genius was not essentially and in the truest
                    sense poetical, the same may be said of Dryden and Pope; and it at least proves
                    him to have been in harmony with the living forces of his age, in which rhetoric
                    was a note of culture and philosophical humanitarianism a growing idea, while
                    poetry, though widely cultivated, was becoming more and. more a mere ornamental
                    accomplishment. This is not the case with Lucan; his theme has a genuine hold
                    upon him; in the age of Nero he celebrates the republic as a poet with the same
                    energy with which in the age of Cicero he might have defended it as an orator.
                    But for him it might almost have been said that the Roman republic never
                    inspired a Roman poet.</p>
                <p>Lucan never speaks of himself, but his epic speaks for him. The author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> must have been endowed with no common ambition,
                    industry, and self-reliance, an enthusiastic though narrow and aristocratic
                    patriotism, and a faculty for appreciating magnanimity in others which is at
                    least some presumption that he possessed it himself. He probably bore a strong
                    family resemblance to his uncle Seneca; but the only personal trait positively
                    known to us is his conjugal affection, a characteristic of Seneca also.</p>

                <p>Lucan, together with Statius, was preferred even to Virgil in the Middle Ages. So
                    late as 1493 his commentator Sulpitius writes :—“Magnus profecto est Maro,
                    magnus Lucanus; adeoque prope par, ut quis sit major possis ambigere.” Shelley
                    and Southey, in the first transport of admiration, thought Lucan superior to
                    Virgil; Pope, with more judgment, says that the fire which burns in Virgil with
                    an equable glow breaks forth in Lucan with sudden, brief, and interrupted
                    flashes. In general, notwithstanding the enthusiasm of isolated admirers, Lucan
                    has been unduly neglected, but he has exercised an important influence upon one
                    great department of modern literature by his effect upon Corneille, and through
                    him upon the classical French drama.</p>
                <p>The most celebrated editions of Lucan are those by Oudendorp (1728), Burmann
                    (1740), and Weber (1829). Bentley’s emendations are brilliant, but unsafe. The
                    most elaborate criticism is that in Nisard’s <hi rend="italic">Études sur les
                    Poêles Latins de la Décadence,</hi> stern to the poet’s defects and unkind to
                    his deserts. Dean Merivale has some •excellent observations in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Imperial Rome,</hi> chaps, liv. and lxiv. Brebeuf’s
                    French version is celebrated. Christopher Marlowe, a kindred spirit, translated
                    the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> into English, and there
                    are other old versions by Sir Ferdinand Gorges and Thomas May. The latter’s
                    supplement is one of the best examples of modern Latin versification. Gorges’s
                    translation is in octosyllabic verse, and very curious. The standard English
                    version, by Rowe, is one of the most successful translations in our language. It
                    is somewhat too diffuse, butas a whole reproduces the vehemence and animation of
                    the original with a spirit that leaves little to be desired. (R. G. )</p>
