                    Lucknow city, turns to the east and enters Bâra Bânki. The Sâi forms the
                    south-west boundary of the district, running almost parallel with the Gumti.</p>
                <p>The census of 1869 returned the population of the district at 970,625. Recent
                    changes and transfers to and from other districts have, however, taken place.
                    Allowing for these, Lucknow contains (according to the census of 1869) a
                    population of 789,465 persons (416,960 males and 372,505 females), spread over
                    an area of 965 square miles. Hindus number 614,276; Mohammedans, 167,184;
                    Christians, 4982; the remainder being made up of unclassified prisoners and jail
                    officials. Four towns contain a population exceeding 5000 inhabitants, viz.,
                    Lucknow city, Amethi (7182), Kakori (8220), Malihâbâd (8026). The estimated area
                    under cultivation is returned at 547 square miles. Three harvests are reaped in
                    the year, viz., the <hi rend="italic">rabi</hi> in spring, comprising wheat,
                    barley, gram, peas, <hi rend="italic">gujai</hi> (a mixture of wheat and
                    barley), and <hi rend="italic">birra</hi> (a mixture of barley and gram); the
                        <hi rend="italic">kharif</hi> in the rainy season, comprising rice, millets,
                        <hi rend="italic">sànwàn,</hi><hi rend="italic">mandιvd, kdkun,</hi> and
                    Indian corn; and the <hi rend="italic">hcnwat</hi> in the autumn, consisting of

                    addition, there are valuable crops of tobacco, opium, cotton, spices, and
                    vegetables. Irrigation is carried on by means of rivers, tanks, and wells. The
                    cultivators are almost all deeply in debt, and under advances of seed grain from
                    their landlords. Wageshave remained stationary in the country, but have
                    decreased in the city owing to its diminished wealth and population since the
                    departure of the Oudh court. The price of food, on the other hand, has
                    materially risen of late years. When not paid in grain, an ordinary agricultural
                    labourer receives about l⅛d. a day. Artisans, such as smiths and carpenters,
                    receive 4⅛d. a day for work in their own villages, or 6d. a day if called away
                    from their homes. Famineshave occurred in Lucknow in 1769, 1784-86, and 1837,
                    and severe scarcities in 1861, 1865-66, 1869, and 1873—all caused by drought.
                    The district is well provided with communications by road, river, and railway.
                    Three imperial lines of road branch out south, east, and north to Cawnpur,
                    Faizabad, and Sitapur, metalled and bridged throughout, and comprising,
                    exclusive of the roads in Lucknow city and cantonments, a length of about 500
                    miles. There are also seven principal local lines of road. River communication
                    is not much used. The line of railway is comprised in the Oudh and Rohilkhand
                    railway system. The entire length of railway communication is 52 miles.
                    Manufactures are mainly confined to Lucknow city. In the country towns are a few
                    weavers, dyers, bangle-makers, brass-workers, and potters. Cotton weaving has
                    greatly declined since the introduction of European piece-goods. The principal
                    imports are food-stuffs, piece-goods, arms, hardware, glass, crockery, and salt;
                    while muslins, emljroidery, cotton prints, brass vessels, lace, tobacco,
                    &amp;c., are exported. The district is administered by a deputy commissioner,
                    aided by a magistrate in charge of the city, and a second in the cantonments,
                    one or two assistant commissioners, three extra-assistant commissioners, three
                        <hi rend="italic">tnhsilddrs,</hi> and four honorary magistrates. Besides,
                    there are a civil judge and a small-cause court judge, who have no criminal or
                    revenue powers. The total imperial and local revenue of Lucknow district in
                    1871-72 amounted to £162,926, and the expenditure to £70,534; the Government
                    land revenue was £70,580. Excluding Lucknow city, the schools consist of one
                    Anglo-vernacular middle class, five vernacular middle class, and seventy-one
                    primary schools. The prevailing endemic diseases are fevers, skin diseases, and
                    bowel complaints. Choleraisseldomabsent. Small-pox is also an annual visitant.
                    The average annual rainfall is 37’6 inches, and the mean annual temperature 78

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lucknow,</hi> capital of the above district, and of the
                    province of Oudh, in 26° 52' N. lat., 80° 58' E. long., is distant from Cawnpur
                    42 miles, from Benares 199 miles, and from Calcutta 610 miles, and has an area
                    of 13 square miles. It ranks fourth in size among Indian cities, being only
                    surpassed by the presidency capitals of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. It stands
                    on both banks of the Gumti, mostly on the western side, the river being spanned
                    by four bridges, two of them built by native rulers and two since the British
                    annexation in 1856. Viewed from a distance, the city presents a picture of
                    unusual magnificence and architectural splendour, which fades on nearer view
                    into something more like the ordinary aspect of a crowded Oriental town. From
                    the new bridge across the Gumti, the city seems to be embedded in trees. High up
                    the river the ancient stone bridge of Asaf-ud-dauU crosses the stream. To its
                    left rise the walls of the Machi Bhâwan fort, enclosing the Lachman <hi
                        rend="italic">tila</hi> (Lachman’s hill), the earliest inhabited spot in the
                    city, from which it derives its modern name. Close by, the immense Imâmbâra, or
                    mausoleum of Asaf ud-daulâ, towers above the surrounding buildings. Farther in
                    the distance, the lofty minarets of the Jamâ Masjid or “cathedral mosque”
                    overlook the city; while nearer again, on the same side of the river, the ruined
                    walls of the residency, with its memorial cross, recall the heroic defence made
                    by the British garrison in 1857. In front, close to the water’s edge, the
                    Chattar Manzil palace, a huge and irregular pile of buildings, crowned by gilt
                    umbrellas, glitters gaudily in the sunlight; while to the left, at some little
                    distance, two mausoleums flank the entrance to the Kaisar Bâgh, the last of the
                    overgrown palaces built by the exiled dynasty of Oudh. Still more picturesque
                    panoramas may be obtained from any of the numerous towers and cupolas which
                    abound in every quarter. But a nearer examination shows that Lucknow does not
                    correspond in its interior arrangements to its brilliant appearance from a
                    little distance. Nevertheless, many of its streets are broader and finer than
                    those of most Indian towns; and the clearance effected for military purposes
                    after the mutiny has been instrumental in greatly improving both the aspect and
                    the sanitary condition of the city. A glacis half a mile broad surrounds the
                    fort; and three military roads, radiating from this point as a centre, cut right
                    through the heart of the native quarter, often at an elevation of some 30 feet
                    above the neighbouring streets. Three other main roads also branch out from the
                    same point, one leading across the bridge, and the others along the banks of the
                    Gumti. The residency crowns a picturesque eminence, the chief ornament of the
                    city, containing, besides many ruined walls, an old mosque and a magnificent
                    banyan tree. An artificial mound rises near at hand, its sides gay with
                    parterres of flowers, while in the rear, half hidden by the feathery foliage of
                    gigantic bamboos, the graveyard covers the remains of some 2000 Europeans, who
                    perished in 1857. The cantonments lie 3 miles to the south-east of the city.</p>
                <p>The population of Lucknow, including the cantonments, was returned by the census
                    of 1869 at 284,779. The native civil population consisted of 273,126, viz.,
                    161,739 Hindus and 111,387 Mohammedans. There were also 3648 native soldiers,
                    4222 Europeans, 760 Eurasians, and 3023 prisoners and jail officials. The
                    traffic of Oudh flows southwards through Lucknow to Cawnpur. Large quantities of
                    grain and timber come in from the trans-Gogra districts to the north, while raw
                    cotton, iron, and imported goods from the south and east are sent in exchange.
                    In 1869-70 goods to the value of nearly three quarters of a million sterling
                    paid taxes at the octroi office. The chief municipal taxable articles are food
                    stuffs, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi><hi rend="italic">gùr</hi> or molasses,
                    sugar, spices, oilseeds, and tobacco; besides a large quantity of European
                    manufactured articles brought into the town. Of the total municipal revenue in
                    1870-71 (£20,018), £16,230 was derived from octroi. Lucknow muslins and other
                    textile fabrics have a high reputation. Gold and silver brocade, however, forms
                    the leading manufacture. It is used for the numerous purposes of Indian pomp,
                    and has a considerable market even in Europe. The gorgeous needlework embroidery
                    upon velvet and cotton, with gold thread, thread and coloured silks, furnishes
                    employment to many hands. Lucknow jewellery, once very famous, has declined
                    since the departure of the native court. Glass work and moulding in clay still
                    maintain their original excellence. A Kashmiri colony has introduced a small
                    manufacture of shawls. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, with its branches, has a
                    central station in Lucknow, and gives direct communication with Benares,
                    Bareilly, and Cawnpur, as well as connecting with the great trunk lines to
                    Calcutta, Bombay, and the Punjab. Before the amalgamation of Oudh with the
                    North-Western Provinces in 1877, Lucknow formed the residence of the chief
                    commissioner and his staff, and it still ranks as the headquarters of officials
                    whose authority extends over the whole province. The principal medical
                    institutions are the King’s hospital, Balrampur hospital, Government dispensary
                    and lunatic asylum. The leading educational establishments are the Canning
                    college, Martinière college, Ward’s institution, Loretto convent, and a number
                    of schools under the charge of the Church of England and American missions.</p>

                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0063-0050"/> of disaffection occurred as early as April
                    1857, and Sir Henry Lawrence immediately took steps to meet the danger by
                    fortifying the residency and accumulating stores. On the night of the 30th May
                    the expected insurrection broke out; the men of the 71st regiment of native
                    infantry, with a few from the other regiments, began to burn the bungalows of
                    their officers, and to murder the inmates, but were dispersed by the European
                    force and fled towards Sitapur. Though the city thus remained in the hands of
                    the British, the symptoms of disaffection amongst the remaining native troops
                    were unmistakable, and on June 11 the military police and native cavalry broke
                    into open revolt, followed on the succeeding morning by the native infantry. On
                    the 20th news of the fall of Cawnpur arrived; and on the 29th occurred the
                    failure of Lawrence’s attack upon the advancing enemy, in consequence of which
                    the British troops fell back on Lucknow, abandoned the Machi Bhawan, and
                    concentrated all their strength upon the residency. The siege of the enclosure
                    began upon July 1. Three unsuccessful assaults were made by the mutineers on
                    July 20, August 10, and August 18; but meanwhile the British within were
                    dwindling away. On September 5 news of the relieving force under 0utram and
                    Havelock reached the garrison, and on the 22d the relief arrived at the
                    Alambagh, a walled garden on the Cawnpur road held by the enemy in force.
                    Havelock stormed the Alambagh, and on the 25th fought his way with continuous
                    opposition through the narrow lanes of the city. On the 26th he arrived at the
                    gate of the residency enclosure, and was welcomed by the gallant defenders
                    within. The sufferings of the besieged had been very great; but even after the
                    first relief it became clear that Lucknow could only be temporarily defended
                    till the arrival of further reinforcements should allow the garrison to cut its
                    way out. Night and day the enemy kept up a continual firing against the British
                    position, while 0utram, who had reassumed the command which he yielded to
                    Havelock during the relief, retaliated by frequent sorties. Throughout October
                    the garrison continued its gallant defence, and a small party, shut up in the
                    Alambagh, and cut off unexpectedly from the main body, also contrived to hold
                    good its dangerous post. Meanwhile Sir Colin Campbell's force had advanced from
                    Cawnpur, and arrived at the Alambagh on the 10th of November. The Alambagh, the
                    Dilkusha palace, south-east of the town, the Martinière, and the Sikandra Bagh,
                    the chief rebel stronghold, were successively carried in the course of the six
                    following days, and the second relief was successfully accomplished. Even now,
                    however, it remained impossible to hold Lucknow, and Sir Colin Campbell
                    determined, before undertaking any further offensive operations, to return to
                    Cawnpur with his army, escorting the civilians, ladies, and children rescued
                    from their long imprisonment in the residency, with the view of forwarding them
                    to Calcutta. On the morning of the 20th November the troops received orders to
                    march for the Alambagh; and the residency, the scene of so long and stirring a
                    defence, was abandoned for a while to the rebel army. Outram with 3500 men held
                    the Alambaghuntil the commander-in-chief could return to recapture the capital.
                    The rebels in great strength again surrounded the greater part of the city, for
                    a circuit of 20 miles, with an external line of defence. On the 2d of March 1858
                    Sir Colin Campbell found himself free enough in the rear to march once more upon
                    Lucknow. He first occupied the Dilkusha, and posted guns to command the
                    Martinière. On the 5th Brigadier Franks arrived with 6000 men; Outram’s force
                    then crossed the Gumti, and advanced from the direction of Faizâbâd, while the
                    main body attacked from the southeast. After a week’s hard fighting, March 9-15,
                    the rebels were completely defeated, and their posts captured one by one.</p>
