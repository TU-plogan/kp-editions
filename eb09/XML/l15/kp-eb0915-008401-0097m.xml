                    their charge. Luther himself, was much more fitted to be a reformer and preacher
                    than an exponent of a scheme of theology or th'fe organizer of an ecclesiastical
                    system. His wonderfully sympathetic nature was easily moved, and his own liking
                    and disliking ruled him too strongly to make him able to expound in calm fashion
                    the whole round of theology, giving to each doctrine its proper place in the
                    system. His nominalist training, his quietism got from the mystics of the 14th
                    and 15th centuries, his occasional fits of morbid melancholy, all kept him from
                    looking at the whole system of Christian doctrine, and made him intensify the
                    value and importance of special aspects of truth. Thé early Lutheran theology
                    reflected the character of its founder. It lacked systematic completeness, more
                    especially in its failure to construct a comprehensive doctrine of the work of
                    the Holy Spirit, and it swayed from side to side in violent controversies, until
                    at length out of the conflicts emerged the Form of Concord, which, it was hoped,
                    would succeed in pacifying the church. The dogmatic symbols of the Lutheran
                    Church are usually said to include nine separate creeds, three of which are
                    taken from the early Christian Church while six are the production of the 16th
                    century. They are the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicaeo Constantinopolitan Creed in
                    its Western form <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >filioque),</hi> the so-called Athanasian Creed, the Augsburg Confession or
                    Confessio Augustana, the Apology for the Augsburg Confession, the Smalkald
                    Articles, Luther’s two Catechisms, and the Form of Concord. These nine
                    confessions together make up the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Concordiae</hi> of the Lutheran Church; but only the three pre-Reformation
                    creeds and the Augsburg confession are recognized by all Lutherans. Luther’s
                    catechisms, especially the shorter of the two, have been almost universally
                    accepted, but the Form of Concord was expressly rejected by many Lutheran
                    churches. The Augsburg Confession and Luther’s Shorter Catechism may be said to
                    contain the distinctive principles of Lutheranism which all Lutherans unite to
                    maintain, but, as the principal controversies of the Lutheran Church all arose
                    after the publication of the Augsburg Confession, and were fought out between
                    men who united in accepting that symbol, it does not contain <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0098-0085"/> all that is distinctively Lutheran. The Augsburg
                    Confession itself perhaps owed its universal recognition to the fact that it
                    existed in two forms which vary slightly in the way in which they state the
                    doctrine of the sacrament of the supper, the <hi rend="italic">variata</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">inνariata</hi>; and this also bears witness to the lack of
                    dogmatic coherence which is a characteristic of Lutheranism. Melanchthon’s <hi

                    Commonplaces</hi> (first published in 1521) may also rank along with these
                    creeds as an authoritative exposition of Lutheran theology; and the changes it
                    underwent in its successive editions show the incompleteness of the system.</p>
                <p>The earliest controversy which divided the Lutheran Church arose in Luther’s
                    lifetime and lasted till 1560 (1537-60). It sprang out of differences of opinion
                    about the precise meaning to be attached to the term law in Luther’s famous
                    distinction between law and gospel. According to Luther, and the distinction
                    runs through all Lutheranism, law and gospel are the two factors which bring
                    home to the individual experience the knowledge of salvation. Law is the rule of
                    life given by God and accompanied by threatening and promise, which counts on
                    fulfilment from selfish motives, threatens, terrifies, and so produces
                    contrition; while the gospel, which is the message of salvation, comes after the
                    law has done its work, and soothes. In this description the term law has a
                    distinct and definite meaning; it signifies legal injunction or command; and
                    Luther and his followers were accustomed to say, using law in this definite way,
                    that Christ was not under the dominion of the law, and that Christ’s people are
                    also free from its restraints. They said that believers ascend to the Christian
                    life only when they have transcended a rule of life which counts on selfish
                    motives for obedience. The word law manifestly means more than Luther put into
                    this definition, and certain Lutherans who accepted Luther’s distinction between
                    law and gospel did not understand his limitation of the term law, and taught
                    that believers were not bound by the moral law. These antinomians, of whom
                    Agricola was chief, took Luther’s statements about law in the sense of legal
                    injunction, and applied them to law in the sense of ethical rule. The confusion
                    perplexed the Lutheran Church for more than twenty years.</p>
                <p>The debates which harassed the Reformed Church in the Arminian controversy, and
                    the Roman Catholic Church in the Jansenist controversy, appeared in the Lutheran
                    Church in three separate disputes lasting from about 1550 to 1580. In these
                    discussions the stricter Lutherans were on the one side and Melanchthon with his
                    followers on the other. The first dispute was about the relation of good works
                    to conversion. George Major, founding on an expression in Melanchthon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Commonplaces</hi> (ed. 1543), said that good works were both
                    necessary and useful to holiness. He was attacked by Mat. Flacius and Nie.
                    Amsdorf, and after a long and tedious discussion, in the course of which it was
                    made plain that both sides were sadly in want of general principles to guide
                    them, and that important words were used ambiguously, George Major’s proposition
                    was condemned because it savoured of Pelagianism. The problem took a new form in
                    the Synergist controversy, which discussed the nature of the first impulse in
                    conversion, and in the controversy about original sin which followed. Pfeffiuger
                    taught that the first impulse in conversion came from grace and was due to the
                    Holy Spirit, but he said that this impulse and its effect might be compared with
                    the reviving of a man apparently dead. According to the strict Lutherans the
                    sinner was not apparently but actually dead, and grace was not merely the
                    occasion, it was also the actual cause, of the new life. Flacius, who had made
                    this last assertion, which seemed to be generally approved of, started a fresh
                    controversy by his assertion that sin was part of the substance of man in his
                    present natural condition, and that man was no more able to cooperate with grace
                    in conversion than was a stick or a stone. This was contradicted by Striegel, a
                    follower of Melanchthon, who asserted that sin had not totally destroyed man’s
                    ethical nature, but that grace by its action changed what was morally insensible
                    into what was morally living and sensible, so that there could be an actual
                    synergy or co-operation between God’s grace and man’s will.</p>
                <p>The controversy raised by Andrew Osiander was much more important, and revealed
                    the lack in Lutheranism of a systematic doctrine of the work of the Holy Spirit.
                    Osiander^felt that Lutheran dogmatic had omitted to make adequate answer to a
                    most important practical question in theology, how Christ’s death on the cross
                    could be so brought into connexion with each individual believer as to be the
                    ground of his actual justification. The mediaeval church had spanned the
                    centuries by their doctrine of the prolongation of Christ’s death throughout
                    time in the sacrifice of the mass, but he could not see any such real connexion
                    of time in Luther’s theology. He proposed to get rid of the difficulty by saying
                    that justification is a real work in the believer done by that same Christ who
                    had died so many centuries before. He distinguished between redemption, which he
                    said was the result of the historical work of Christ upon the cross, and
                    justification, which was another work of the same Redeemer within the
                    individual, and was the influence renewed daily of the Saviour upon each
                    believer. The controversy which followed was full of ambiguities and
                    misunderstandings, but out of it rose two distinct theories, one of which was
                    generally adopted by the Lutherans, while the other has become a characteristic
                    of Reformed or Calvinist theology. Striegel declared that the principal effect
                    of the work of Christ upon the cross was to change the attitude of God towards
                    the whole human race, and that in consequence whenever men come into being and
                    have faith they can take advantage of that change of attitude, the ground of
                    their assurance being that because of what Christ did God regards all men
                    benevolently. Calvinist divines, on the other hand, found in Osiander’s
                    criticism the starting point of that close connexion between Christ’s work and
                    His redeemed which is expressed in the doctrine of the limited reference in the
                    atonement.</p>
                <p>These controversies all implied more or less vagueness in the earlier dogmatic
                    teaching of Luther. Others, however, arose from what may be called the
                    distinctive teaching of Luther upon the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper and what
                    was implied therein. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Luther</hi> it is
                    stated that Luther, at least after the peasants’ war, held strongly a theory of
                    the connexion between the elements (the bread and wine) and the body and blood
                    of Christ in the sacrament of the supper which has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >consubstantiation,</hi> and that this theory depended not merely on certain
                    scholastic definitions of bodily presence but also on the supposition that the
                    attribute of ubiquity belonged to the glorified body of Christ. A large number
                    of Lutherans, followers of Melanchthon, were inclined to depart from these views
                    and approach the more reasonable opinions of Calvin, and this occasioned
                    controversies about Crypto-Calvinism and about Christology. J <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> he university of Jena was the theological
                    headquarters of the stricter Lutherans, while Wittenberg was the centre of the
                    Philippists or Crypto-Calvinists, as the followers of Melanchthon were called.
                    At first the controversy mainly gathered round the questions of the corporeal
                    presence, the oral manducation, and the literal eating of Christ’s body by
                    unbelievers as well as by the truly faithful, but it soon included discussions
                    on the person of Christ, and into these discussions Reformed theologians were
                    brought. The result was various conferences at Maulbronn (1564), which only
                    confirmed both parties in their peculiar opinions; at Dresden (1571), where the
                    Lutheran theologians of Wittenberg and Leipsic renounced the doctrine of the
                    ubiquity of Christ’s body and agreed with the Calvinists; and elsewhere. It
                    seemed as if the Lutheran Church was about to fall in pieces.</p>
                <p>Out of these disputes came the Form of Concord, due principally to Jacob Andreae
                    of Tübingen, to Martin Chemnitz of Brunswick, and to Nicolas Selnecker of
                    Leipsic. Various theological conferences were held, and various articles of
                    agreement more or less successful were framed, of which the most notable was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Torgau Book</hi> of 1576; and at last in 1577 the Form of
                    Concord was published, and after much discussion and negotiation was adopted by
                    most of the Lutherans in Germany. Its recognition was mainly due to the
                    exertions of Augustus, elector of Saxony It was also adopted by the Lutheran
                    churches of Sweden in 1593, and of Hungary in 1597. It was rejected by the
                    Lutheran Church of Denmark and by the churches of Hesse, of Anhalt, of
                    Pomerania, and of several imperial cities. It was at first adopted and
                    afterwards rejected by Brunswick, by the Palatinate, and by Brandenburg. The
                    German churches which refused to adopt it became for the most part Reformed or
                    Calvinist; and the Form of Concord, which ended the more violent theological
                    controversies among the Lutherans, greatly decreased their numbers and
                    territorial extent.</p>
                <p>The divided state of Germany in the 16th century, aided by the. maxim of the
                    peace of Augsburg which gave Protestantism a legal standing, and by the
                    consistorial system of ecclesiastical rule which followed in consequence,
                    divided the Lutherans in Germany into a number of separate churches as numerous
                    as the principalities. At the peace of Augsburg the adherents to the Augsburg
                    Confession were recognized legally as having a right to exist within the German
                    empire, and the power of determining whether the Roman Catholic or Lutheran
                    confessions should be the recognized creed of the state was left, with some
                    reservation, in the hands of thς supreme civil authority in each separate
                    principality <hi rend="italic">{cujus regio</hi><hi rend="italic">ejus
                    religio).</hi> This virtually gave the direction of the church of each German
                    state into the hands of the supreme civil power therein; it belonged to the
                    princes in the various principalities and to the municipal councils in the fιee
                    imperial cities. This legal recognition of the supreme authority of the civil
                    power in ecclesiastical affairs was intensified by the adoption in the Lutheran
                    Church of the consistorial system of church government, which was the
                    distinctive mark of the Lutheran as opposed to the Reformed Church. The
                    consistorial system took a great variety of forms, but it had one common
                    characteristic: it simply transferred the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">episcopale</hi> from the bishops to the civil authorities, and, as
                    the bishops ruled their dioceses in ecclesiastical and-other matters by means of
                    councils or consistories appointed by themselves, so in the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0099-0086"/> Lutheran Church these old episcopal consistories
                    were transformed into councils whose members were appointed by the civil rulers.
                    Thus each petty German state had its own church with its special organization
                    and peculiar regulations. Richter in his <hi rend="italic">Evangelische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kirchenordnungendeslβten</hi><hi rend="italic">Jahrhunderts</hi>
                    (2 vols., 1846) has collected more than one hundred and eighty separate
                    constitutions of churches adhering to the Augsburg Confession. This minute
                    subdivision makes it almost impossible to recognize any unity in the Lutheran
                    Church save what comes from the profession of a common creed.</p>
                <p>The publication of the Form of Concord drew the strict Lutherans more together,
                    and set over against them in Germany a Calvinist Church, and the divided state
                    of Protestantism greatly weakened its strength in the religious wars of the 17th
                    century. As the smaller German states came together in larger principalities the
                    awkwardness of the separate Protestant churches was more keenly felt. Many
                    attempts were made by conferences, as at Leipsic (1631), Thorn (1645), Cassel
                    (1661), to unite Lutherans and Reformed, though without success. At length the
                    union of the two churches was effected mainly by the force of the civil
                    authority in Nassau (1817), in Prussia (1817), in Hesse (1823), in Anhalt Dessau
                    (1827). These unions for the most part aimed, not at incorporating the two
                    churches in doctrine and worship, but at bringing under one government the two
                    confessions, and permitting every congregation to use at pleasure either the
                    Lutheran or the Heidelberg Catechism. They were sometimes accompanied, as in
                    Prussia, by a separation of the stricter Lutherans, who formed themselves into
                    dissenting churches. The separation in Prussia was caused mainly by a new
                    liturgy which Frederick William III. forced on the church, and which the
                    dissenters or Old Lutherans refused to use. The divisions caused in this way
                    were at first repressed but were afterwards tolerated, and have reproduced
                    themselves in the flourishing Lutheran Church of the United States.</p>
