                    carpentry. The rope-work forms a parallelogram more than 1000 feet in length by
                    100 broad. The foundries, fitting shops, and smiths’ shops are on an equally
                    extensive scale, the forges numbering eighty-four. Of the graving docks the
                    largest is 509 feet in length, about 98 in breadth, and more than 26 feet in
                    depth below low-water mark. The Prée, an area of 40 acres reclaimed from the
                    sea, contains boatbuilding yards, steam saw-mills, and wood stores; a floating
                    bridge 900 feet long connects it with the shipbuilding establishments of Caudan,
                    which occupy the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Scorff and the
                    Blavet. Apart from its naval constructions, in which Lorient holds the first
                    rank in France, it has an important place in the manufacture of marine
                    artillery. Private industry is also engaged in engine making. The trade in fresh
                    fish and sardines within the arrondissement reaches an annual value of 35
                    millions of francs. South from the town, also on the Scorff, is the harbour,
                    which comprises a dry dock and a wet dock, measuring about 1650 feet by 200. The
                    roadstead, formed by the estuary of the Blavet, is accessible to vessels of the
                    largest size; the entrance, 3 or 4 miles south from Lorient, which is defended
                    by numerous forts, is marked on the east by the peninsula of Gâvre (an artillery
                    practising ground) and the fortified town of Port Louis; on the west are the
                    fort of Loqueltas, and, higher up, the battery of Kernevel. In the middle of the
                    channel is the granite rock of St Michel, occupied by a powder magazine.
                    Opposite it, on the right bank of the Blavet, is the mouth of the river Ter,
                    with fish and oyster breeding establishments, from which 10 millions of oysters
                    are annually obtained. Above Lorient on the Scorff, here spanned by a suspension
                    bridge, is Kerantrech, a pretty village surrounded by numerous country houses.
                    The population of Lorient in 1876 was 35,165, including C360 of the military and
                    official class.</p>
                <p>Lorient has taken the place of Bort Louis as the port of the Blavet. The latter
                    stands on the site of an ancient hamlet which was fortified during the wars of
                    the League and handed over by Mcrcceur to the Spaniards. After the treaty of
                    Vervins it was restored to France, and it received its name of Port Louis under
                    Richelieu. Some Breton merchants trading with the Indies had established
                    themselves first at Port Louis, but in 1628 they built their warehouses on the
                    other bank. The Compagnie des Indes, created in 1664, took possession of these,
                    giving them the name of Lorient. In 1745 the company, then at the acme of its
                    prosperity, owned thirty-five ships of the largest class and many others of
                    considerable size. The failure of the attempt of the English under Lestock
                    against Lorient is still commemorated by the inhabitants by an annual procession
                    on the first Sunday of October. The decadence of the company dates from 1753. In
                    1782 the town was acquired by purchase by Louis XVI., on the bankruptcy of its
                    former owners, the Rohan-Guéméné family.</p>
