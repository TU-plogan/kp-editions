                <p><label type="entry">LOT</label>, a south-westerly department of central France,
                    corresponding to what was formerly known as Quercy (the country of the Cadurci),
                    a district of the old province of Guyenne, is situated between 44° 12' and 45°
                    5' N. lat., and between 1° and *2° 12' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by
                    Corrèze, on the W. by Dordogne and Lot-et-Garonne, on the S. by Tarn-et-Garonne,
                    and on the E. by Aveyron and Cantal. Its extreme length, from north-east to
                    south-west, is about 52 miles, and its breadth from north-west to south-east 31
                    miles, with an area of 2013 square miles. It slopes towards the south-west, from
                    a maximum altitude of 2560 feet on the borders of Cantal to a minimum of 213
                    feet at the point where the river Lot quits the department, through a wide
                    geological range beginning with primary rocks (granite, gneiss, mica-schists),
                    which are succeeded by lias, oolitic limestone (occupying the greater portion of
                    the area), chalks, .and finally by Tertiary formations. The Lot, which traverses
                    it from east to west, is navigable for the whole distance (78 miles) with the
                    help of locks; its principal tributary within the department is the Célé (on the
                    right). In the north of the department the Dordogne has a course of 37 miles;
                    among its tributaries are the Cère, which has its rise in Cantal,, and the
                    Ouysse, a river of no great length, but remarkable for the abundance of its
                    waters. The streams in the south of Lot all flow into the Tarn. By the Dordogne
                    and Lot the surface is divided into a number of limestone plateaus known by the
                    name of “causses”; that to the north of the Dordogne is called the Causse de
                    Martel; between the Dordogne and the Lot is the Causse de Gramat or de
                    Rocamadour; south of the Lot is the Causse de Cahors. These “causses,” owing to
                    the rapid disappearance of the rain through the faults in the limestone, have
                    for the most part an arid appearance, and their rivulets are generally mere dry
                    beds; but their altitude (from 700 to 1300 feet, much lower therefore than that
                    of the similar plateaus in Lozère, Hérault, and Aveyron) admits of the
                    cultivation of the vine; they also yield a small quantity of maize, wheat, oats,
                    rye, and potatoes, and some wood. The deep intervening valleys are full of
                    verdure, being well watered by abundant springs supplied by drainage from the
                    plateaux above. The climate is on the whole that of the Girondine region; the
                    valleys are warm, and the rainfall is somewhat above the average for France. The
                    difference of temperature between the higher parts of the department belonging
                    to the central plateau and the sheltered valleys of the south-west is
                    considerable. Of the entire area of the department 691,920 acres are arable,
                    222,402 are forest land, 168,038 are occupied by vineyards, 64,250 are heath,
                    and 61,778 are meadow. Sheep are the most abundant kind of live stock; but pigs,
                    horned cattle, horses, asses, and mules, and goats are also reared, as well as
                    poultry in large quantities, and bees. Wine is the principal product of the
                    department, the most valued being that of Cahors or Côte du Lot. It is used
                    partly for blending with other wines and partly for local consumption. The
                    north-east cantons supply large quantities of chestnuts; apples, cherries, and
                    peaches are common, and the department also grows tobacco and supplies truffles.
                    The iron, lead, and zinc deposits are unimportant. Marble, millstones,
                    limestone, and clay are obtained to some extent, but phosphate of lime is the
                    most valuable mineral product of Lot. The manufactures are inconsiderable; but
                    there are numerous mills, and wool spinning and carding as well as cloth making,
                    tanning, currying, brewing, and agricultural implement making are carried on to
                    some extent. The exports consist of grain, flour, wine, brandy, live stock,
                    nuts, truffles, prunes, tobacco, wood, phosphate of lime, leather, and wool. The
                    population in 1876 was 276,512. The three arrondissements are Cahors, Figeac,
                    and Gourdon; there are twenty-nine cantons and three hundred and twenty-three
                    communes.</p>
