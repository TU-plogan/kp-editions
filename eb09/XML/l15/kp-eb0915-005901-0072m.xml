                    the life guard of Lord Essex, consisting of one hundred gentlemen. His first
                    essay in arms was at Worcester, his next at Edgehill. He was made governor of
                    Wardour Castle in 1643, which place he surrendered on honourable terms after ten
                    months’ siege. On being exchanged soon afterwards, he engaged as major of Sir A.
                    Haslerig’s regiment of horse,· in which capacity he did good service in the
                    western counties. He was present at the second battle of Newbury, October 1644.
                    In 1645 he was elected M.P. for Wilts in the room of his father Sir Henry
                    Ludlow, and attached himself inflexibly to the republican party. In 1648 he was
                    one of a committee of six who arranged the violent action known as Pride’s
                    Purge. He was one of the king's judges, and put his hand to the warrant for his
                    execution. In January 1651 Ludlow was sent into Ireland as lieutenant-general of
                    horse, holding also a civil commission. Here he spared neither health nor money
                    in the public service. Ireton, the deputy of Ireland, died 27th November 1651,
                    and for six months Ludlow held the chief place, which he then resigned to
                    Fleetwood. Though disapproving of Cromwell’s action in dissolving the Long
                    Parliament, he maintained his employment, but when Cromwell was declared
                    Protector he declined to acknowledge his authority, and was soon after recalled
                    to England. He refused the Protector face to face when ordered to submit to his
                    government, and in December 1655 retired to his own house in Essex. After Oliver
                    Cromwell’s death Ludlow was returned for the borough of Hindon, and took his
                    seat in Richard’s parliament in 1659. He sat also in the restored Rump, and was
                    a member of its councilof state andof the committee of safety after its second
                    expulsion. He also held office for a short time in Ireland. After the
                    Restoration, finding that his life was in danger, he left England, in September
                    1660, and travelled through France and Geneva, and thence to Vevey, then under
                    the protection of the canton of Bern. There he spent the rest of his long life
                    unmolested, to the great credit of the Government of that canton, which had also
                    extended its protection to other regicides. He was, however, in constant danger
                    from Cavalier assassins. He steadily refused during thirty years of exile to
                    have anything to do with the desperate enterprises of republican plotters. But
                    in 1689 he returned to England, hoping to be employed in Irish affairs. He was,
                    however, known only as a regicide; and an address from the House of Commons was
                    presented to William III. by Sir Edward Seymour, requesting the king to issue a
                    proclamation for his arrest. Ludlow escaped again, and returned to Vevey, where
                    he died in 1693, aged seventy-three, and where a monument raised to his memory
                    by his widow is still to be seen in the church of St Martin. Over the door of
                    the house in which he lived was placed the inscription “Omne solum forti patria,
                    quia Patris.” His memoirs, extending to the year 1688, were published in 1698-99
                    at Vevey.</p>
