                        rend="italic">Period</hi> (1483-1517). —Martin Luther (Lyder, Lüder,
                    Ludher—from Lothar, some say) was born at*Eisleben in the county of Mansfeld, in
                    Thuringia, on the 10th of November 1483. His father Hans Luther, a slate-cutter
                    by trade, belonged to a family of free peasants. His mother was Margaret
                    Lindeburn. Hans Luther had left Möhra, his native village, and had come to
                    Eisleben to work as a miner. When Martin was six months old he went to Mansfeld
                    and set up a forge, the small profits of which enabled him to send his son to
                    the Latin school of the place. There the boy so distinguished himself that his
                    father determined to make him a lawyer, and sent him for a year to a Franciscan
                    school at Magdeburg, and then to Eisenach near Möhra. There Luther, with other
                    poor scholars, sang for alms in the streets, and his fine tenor voice and gentle
                    manners attracted the attention and gained for him the motherly care of Ursula
                    Cotta, the wife of the burgomaster of Eisenach. From Eisenach he went in his
                    eighteenth year to the high school of Erfurt, where his favourite master was the
                    humanist Trutwetter, who taught him classics and philosophy. He took his
                    bachelor’s degree in 1502, and his master’s in 1505. At Erfurt the preaching of
                    the town’s pastor Weisemann made a deep impression on his mind, as did the
                    preacher’s frequent exhortations to study the Scripture. Luther tells us that he
                    sought in vain for a whole Bible, and that he could only get portions to read. A
                    dangerous illness, the death of a near friend, together with other
                    circumstances, so Wrought on his pious, sensitive nature that in spite of father
                    and family he resolved to give up all his prospects and become a monk. He
                    entered the Augustinian convent at Erfurt in June 1505, taking with him Plautus
                    and Virgil, the solitary mementos of the life he had abandoned. His first years
                    of monastic life were spent in fierce mental struggle. He had found a whole
                    Bible and read it diligently, but it did not bring him peace. The feeling of
                    universal human sinfulness, and of his own, was burnt into him both by his
                    dogmatic studies and by his reading of the Scripture. He lived a life of the
                    severest mortification, and invented continually new forms of penance, and all
                    the while heart and head alike told him that outward acts could never banish
                    sin. “I tormented myself to death,” he said, “to make my peace with God, but I
                    was in darkness and found it not.” The vicargeneral of his order, Staupitz, who
                    had passed through somewhat similar experiences, helped him greatly. “There <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0085-0072"/> is no true repentance,” he said, “but that
                    which begins with the love of righteousness and of God. Love Him then who has
                    first loved thee.” Staupitz had been taught heart religion by the mystics, and
                    he sent Luther to the sermons of Tauler and to the <hi rend="italic">Theologia
                        Germanica.</hi></p>
                <p>When Luther regained his mental health, he took courage to be ordained priest in
                    May 1507, and next year, on the recommendation of Staupitz, the elector of
                    Saxony appointed him professor in the university of Wittenberg, which had been
                    founded in 1502. While in the monastery Luther had assiduously pursued his
                    studies, and his severe mortifications and penances had never interrupted his
                    theological work. He read all the great scholastic theologians, but Augustine
                    was his master in theology, while Erfurt studies under Trutwetter doubtless made
                    him pore over Occam (“mein lieber Meister,” as he afterwards fondly called him)
                    till he got his bulky folios by heart. He began by lecturing on Aristotle; and
                    in 1509 he gave Biblical lectures, which from the very first were a power in the
                    university. His class-room was thronged; his fellow-professors were students.
                    Staupitz forced him also to preach; and his marvellous eloquence, felt to be
                    from the heart, attracted great crowds of hearers. The year 1511 brought an
                    apparent interruption, but in fact only a new development, of Luther’s character
                    and knowledge of the world. He went to Rome, probably in fulfilment of an old
                    vow, and the journey was a marked event in his life. He went up in true pilgrim
                    spirit, a mediaeval Christian, and he came back a Protestant. The pious German
                    was horrified with what he saw in Rome, and he afterwards made telling use of
                    what he had seen in various tracts, and notably in his address to the German
                    nobles. He tells us that at Wittenberg he had pondered over the text, “The just
                    shall live by faith,” that while in Rome the words came back to him, and that on
                    his return journey to Germany the evangelical meaning of the phrase rushed into
                    his mind. On his return to the university he was promoted to the degree of
                    doctor of divinity, in October 1512. The oath he had to take on the occasion “to
                    devote his whole life to study, and faithfully to expound and defend the holy
                    Scripture,” was to him the seal of his mission. He began his work with lectures
                    on the Psalms, and then proceeded to comment on the epistles of Paul to the
                    Romans and Galatians, enforcing especially his peculiar views of the relations
                    between law and gospel. His lectures and his sermons were attended by great
                    audiences, and disciples gathered round him. As early as 1516 his special
                    principles were publicly defended at academical disputations. Staupitz made him
                    district-vicar of his order for Meissen and Thuringia. He made short preaching
                    tours, and his influence was felt far beyond Wittenberg. When the plague came to
                    that university town he remained at his post when others fled. Then came 1517,
                    the year of the Reformation. The new pope, Leo X., had sent agents through
                    Germany to sell indulgences, and had chosen John Tetzel, a Dominican monk, for
                    Saxony. Luther, who had passed through deep soul-struggles ere he won pardon,
                    knew that God’s forgiveness could not bo purchased for money, and thundered
                    against Tetzel and his indulgences from Wittenberg pulpit. He wrote anxiously to
                    the princes and bishops to refuse the pardon-seller a passage through their
                    lands. When Tetzel got to Jiiterbogk near Wittenberg, Luther could stand it no
                    longer. He wrote out ninety-five propositions or theses denouncing indulgences,
                    and on the eve <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> of All Saints, October 31, nailed
                    the paper to the door of the Castle church. In a short time all Germany was
                    ablaze.</p>
                <p>These ninety-five theses are one continuous harangue against the doctrine and
                    practice of pardon-selling, but they do not openly denounce indulgence in every
                    form. They make plain these three things:—(1) there maybe some good in
                    indulgence if it be reckoned, one of the many ways in which God’s forgiveness of
                    sin can be proclaimed; (2) the external signs of sorrow are not the real inward
                    repentance, nor are they as important as that is, and no permission to neglect
                    the outward expression can permit the neglect of true repentance; (3) every
                    Christian who feels true sorrow for sin is there and then pardoned by God for
                    Christ’s sake without any indulgence ticket or other human contrivance. And in
                    his sermons on indulgence Luther declared that repentance consisted in
                    contrition, confession, and absolution, and that contrition was the most
                    important, and in fact the occasion of the other two. If the sorrow be true and
                    heartfelt, confession and pardon will follow. The inward and spiritual fact of
                    sorrow for sin, he thought, was the great matter; the outward signs of sorrow
                    were good also, but God, who alone can pardon, looks to the inward state. These
                    theses, with the sermons explaining them, brought Germany face to face with the
                    reality of blasphemy in the indulgences. Luther’s public life had opened; the
                    Reformation had begun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Period</hi> (1517-1524).—Pilgrims who had come to
                    Wittenberg to buy indulgences returned with the theses of Luther in their hands,
                    and with the impression of his powerful evangelical teaching in their hearts.
                    The national mind of Germany took up the matter with a moral earnestness which
                    made an impression, not only upon the princes, but even upon bishops and monks.
                    At first it seemed as if all Germany was going to support Luther. The traffic in
                    indulgences had been so shameless that all good people and all patriotic Germans
                    had been scandalized. But Luther had struck a blow at more than indulgences,
                    although he scarcely knew it at the time. In his theses and explanatory sermons
                    he had declared that the inward spiritual facts of man’s religious experience
                    were of infinitely more value than their expression in stereotyped forms
                    recognized by the church, and he had made it plain too that in such a solemn
                    thing as forgiveness of sin man could go to God directly without human
                    mediation. Pious Christians since the day of Pentecost had thought and felt the
                    same, and all through the Middle Ages men and women had humbly gone to God for
                    pardon trusting in Christ. They had found the pardon they sought, and their
                    simple Christian experience had been sung in the hymns of the mediaeval church,
                    had found expression in its prayers, had formed the heart of the evangelical
                    preaching of the church, and had stirred the masses of people in the many
                    revivals of the Middle Ages. But those pious people, hymn-writers, and preachers
                    had not seen that this inward experience of theirs was really opposed to a great
                    part of the ecclesiastical system of their day. The church had set such small
                    store by that inward religious experience that the common speech of the times
                    had changed the plain meanings of the words “spiritual,” “sacred,” “holy.” A man
                    was “spiritual” if he had been ordained to office in the church; money was
                    “spiritual” if it had been given to the church; an estate, with its roads,
                    woodlands, fields, was “spiritual” or “holy” if it belonged to a bishopric or
                    abbey. And the church that had so degraded the meaning of “spiritual” had thrust
                    itself and its external machinery in between God and the worshipper, and had
                    proclaimed that no man could draw near to God save through its appointed ways of
                    approach. Confession was to be made to God through the priest; God spoke pardon
                    only in the priest’s absolution. When Luther attacked indulgences in the way he
                    did he struck at this whole system.</p>
                <p>Compelled to examine the ancient history of the church, he soon discovered the
                    whole tissue of fraud and imposture by which the canon law had from the 9th
                    century downwards<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0086-0073"/> been foisted upon the Christian world. There
                    is scarcely any essential point in ancient ecclesiastical history bearing upon
                    the question of the invocation of saints, of clerical priesthood, of episcopal
                    and metropolitan pretensions, which his genius did not discern in its true
                    light. Whatever Luther denounced as fraud or abuse, from its contradiction to
                    spiritual worship, may be said to have been openly or tacitly admitted to be
                    such. But what produced the greatest effect at the time were his short popular
                    treatises, exegetical and practical—his <hi rend="italic">Interpretation</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">of the Magnificat or the Canticle of the Virgin Mary,</hi> his
                        <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Ten Commandments, and of the Lords
                        Prayer.</hi> The latter soon found its way into Italy, although without
                    Luther’s name, and has never been surpassed either in genuine Christian thought
                    or in style. He resolved also to preach throughout Germany, and in 1518 appeared
                    at a general meeting of his order at Heidelberg. There he held a public
                    disputation on certain theses called by him paradoxes, in which he strove to
                    make apparent the contrast between the external view of religion taught by the
                    schoolmen and the spiritual view of gospel truth based upon justifying faith. He
                    made many disciples on this occasion, of whom perhaps the most notable was
                    Martin Bucer. On his return to Wittenberg in May 1518, Luther wrote and
                    published an able and moderate exposition of the theses, and sent it to some of
                    the German bishops. He proclaimed the need for a thorough reformation of the
                    church, which he thought could only be effected, with the aid of God, by an
                    earnest co-operation of the whole of Christendom. This energy awakened
                    opponents. Conrad Wimpina at Frankfort, Hoogstraten at Cologne, Sylvester
                    Trierias at Rome, and above all John Eck, an old fellow student, at Ingolstadt,
                    attacked his theses, and discovered heresy in them. The result was that Luther
                    was summoned to appear before the pope at Rome, but the elector of Saxony
                    intervened, and got the matter so arranged that Luther was cited to appear
                    beforo the pope’s legate at Augsburg.</p>
                <p>The pope was unwilling to quarrel with Germany, where the whole people seemed to
                    be supporting Luther, and the cardinal legate James de Vio of Gaeta, commonly
                    called Cajetan, was told to be conciliatory. Luther went to Augsburg on foot,
                    and presented himself before the legate, but the interview was not a successful
                    one. The cardinal began by brow-beating the monk, and ended by being somewhat
                    afraid of him. “I can dispute no longer with this beast,” he said; “it has two
                    wicked eyes and marvellous thoughts in its head.” Luther could not respect
                    either the learning or the judgment of Cajetan. He left Augsburg by stealth,
                    afraid of capture, condemned, but appealing “from the pope ill-informed to the
                    pope to-be-better-informed.” On his return to Wittenberg he found the elector in
                    great anxiety of mind, in consequence of an imperious letter from the cardinal,
                    and offered to leave Saxony for France. The elector, however, allowed him to
                    remain, and the pope sent another legate to settle the affairs of Germany. This
                    was Carl von Miltitz, a native of Saxony, a man of the world, and no great
                    theologian. He resolved to meet Luther privately, and did so in the house of
                    Spalatin, court preacher to the elector of Saxony. In his interview with Cajetan
                    Luther had refused to retract two propositions—that the treasury of indulgences
                    is not filled with the merits of Christ, and that he who receives the sacrament
                    must have faith in the grace offered to him. Miltitz made no such demands. He
                    apparently gave up Tetzel and the indulgences, agreed with much of Luther’s
                    theology, but insisted that he had not been respectful to the pope, and that
                    such conduct weakened the authority which rightly belonged to the church. He
                    wished Luther to write to the pope and apologize. Luther consented. It was
                    further arranged that both parties were to cease from writing or preaching on
                    the controverted matters, and that the pope was to commission a body of learned
                    theologians to investigate. Luther accordingly wrote to the pope, telling him
                    that he “freely confessed that the authority of the church was superior to
                    everything, and that nothing in heaven or on earth can be preferred before it
                    save only Jesus Christ, who is Lord over all.” This was in March 1519. Meanwhile
                    Luther had appealed from the pope to a general council to be held in Germany. In
                    the end of 1518 a papal bull concerning indulgences had appeared, confirming the
                    old doctrine, without any reference to the late dispute.</p>
                <p>The years 1519, 1520, 1521 were a time of fierce but triumphant struggle with the
                    hitherto irresistible Church of Rome, soon openly supported by the empire. The
                    first of these years passed in public conferences and disputations. Luther had
                    promised Miltitz to refrain from controversy, on the understanding that his
                    adversaries did not attack him, and he kept his word. But his old antagonist
                    John Eck published thirteen theses attacking Luther, and challenged Andrew
                    Bodenstein of Carlstadt, a friend and colleague of Luther, to a public
                    disputation. Luther instantly replied to Eek’s theses, and the disputation
                    between Carlstadt and Eck was immediately followed by one between Eck and
                    Luther. In this famous Leipsic disputation the controversy took a new shape. It
                    was no longer a theological dispute; it became a conflict between two opposing
                    sets of principles affecting the whole round of church life. Luther and Eck
                    began about indulgences and penance, but the debate soon turned on the authority
                    of the Roman Church and of the pope. Eck maintained the superiority of the Roman
                    Church and of the pope as successor of St Peter and vicar-general of Christ. His
                    argument was “no pope no church.” Luther denied the superiority of the Roman
                    Church, and supported his denial by the testimony of eleven centuries, by the
                    decrees of Nicaea, by the Holy Scriptures. He maintained that the Greek Church
                    was part of the church of Christ, else Athanasius, Basil, and the Gregories were
                    outside Christianity. The pope has more need of the church, he said, than the
                    church has of the pope. Eck retorted that these had been the arguments of
                    Wickliffe and of Huss, and that they had been condemned at the council of
                    Constance. Luther refused to admit that the condemnation was right; Eck refused
                    to debate with an opponent who would not abide by the decision of oecumenical
                    councils; and so the disputation ended. But Luther immediately afterwards
                    completed his argument and published it. He asserted that he did not mean to
                    deny the bishop of Rome’s primacy, provided the pope kept his own place as
                    servant of the church, but that he did mean to deny that there could be no
                    church apart from the pope. The church, he said, is the communion of the
                    faithful, and consists of the elect, and so never can lack the presence of the
                    Holy Spirit, who is not always with popes and councils. This church, he
                    declared, is invisible, but real, and every layman who is in it and has Holy
                    Scripture and holds by it is more to be believed than popes or councils, who do
                    not. This Leipsic disputation had very important consequences. On the one hand,
                    Eck and his associates felt that Luther must now be put down by force, and
                    pressed for a papal bull to condemn him; and Luther himself, on the other hand,
                    felt for the first time what great consequences lay in his opposition to the
                    indulgences. He saw that his Augustinian theology, with its recognition of the
                    heinousness of sin, and of the need of the sovereign grace of God, was
                    incompatible with the whole round of mediaeval ceremonial life, proved it to be
                    impossible for men to live perfectly holy lives, and so made saints and saint
                    worship and relics and pilgrimages <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0087-0074"/> impossible things. He saw the uselessness of
                    the monastic life, with its vigils and fasts and scourgings. These things were
                    not helps, he saw, but hindrances to the true religious life. The Leipsic
                    disputation made Luther feel that he had finally broken with Rome, and it made
                    all Germany see it too, and raised the popular enthusiasm to a white heat. The
                    people of the towns declared their sympathy with the bold monk. Ulrich von
                    Hutten and the German humanists saw that this was more than a monkish quarrel,
                    and recognized Luther as their leader. Franz von Sickingen and the free knights
                    hailed him as a useful ally. Even the poor down-trodden peasants hoped that he
                    might be a luckier leader than Joss Fritz, and that he might help them to free
                    themselves from the unbearable miseries of their lot. Luther became the leader
                    of the German nation after the Leipsic disputation.</p>
                <p>During 1520 the first great political crisis occurred, on the occasion of the
                    death of Maximilian, and ended fatally, in consequence of the want of patriotic
                    and political wisdom among the German princes. Ranke has pointed out the
                    political elements which then existed for creating a Germany as free and
                    independent as France or England; and Justus Möser of Osnabruck had long before
                    truly declared, “If the emperor at that time had destroyed the feudal system,
                    the deed would have been, according to the spirit in which it was done, the
                    grandest or the blackest in the history of the world.” Möser means that if the
                    emperor had embraced the Reformed faith, and placed himself at the head of the
                    lower nobility and cities, united in one body as the lower house of a German
                    parliament, this act would have saved Germany. Probably some such idea was in
                    the mind of the archbishop of Treves when he proposed that Frederick, the
                    elector of Saxony, should be chosen emperor. Frederick might have carried out
                    this policy, just because, if elected, he had nothing to rely upon except the
                    German nation, then more numerous and powerful than it has been since; but he
                    had not the courage to accept a dignity which he supposed to require for its
                    support a more powerful house than his own. Charles, the son of Maximilian, was
                    elected emperor, and that election meant the continuation of a mediaeval policy
                    in Germany.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Luther was at Wittenberg continuing his course of preaching, lecturing,
                    and writing. The number of matriculated students had increased from 232 in 1517
                    to 458 in 1519, and to 579 in 1520; but large numbers besides these came to hear
                    Luther. The study of Greek and Hebrew was diligently carried on, and the
                    university was in a most flourishing state. Some of the finest productions of
                    Luther’s pen belong to this period,—his <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> on the
                    sacraments, on excommunication, on the priesthood, on good works, his <hi
                        rend="italic">Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation on the
                        Reformation of Christendom,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Babylonian
                        Captivity of the Church;</hi> The address to the German nobles, published on
                    June 26, 1520, created a great deal of excitement not only in Germany but beyond
                    it. It was this appeal which first made Zwingli feel in sympathy with Luther,
                    who showed in this little book that the Romish doctrine of two estates, one
                    secular and the other spiritual, was simply a wall raised round the church to
                    prevent reform. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> Christians are spiritual, he said,
                    and there is no difference among them. The secular power is of God as well as
                    the spiritual, and has rule over all Christians without exception,—pope,
                    bishops, monks, and nuns. He also appealed to the people to prevent so much
                    money going out of the kingdom to Italy. “Why,” he said, “should 300,000 florins
                    be sent every year from Germany to Rome ?” His address raised the cry of Germany
                    for the Germans, civil government uncontrolled by ecclesiastics, a married
                    clergy, while he called for a national system of education as the foundation of
                    a better order of things. The most important work of the time, however, was the
                        <hi rend="italic">Babylonian Captivity of the Church of God</hi> (October
                    1520), in which he boldy attacked the papacy in its principles. The main thought
                    in the book is expressed in the title. The catholic church had been taken into
                    bondage by the papacy, as the Jewish people were taken to Babylon, and ought to
                    be brought back into freedom. Luther described the sacraments, real and
                    pretended, and showed how each had been carried into captivity and ought to be
                    delivered. He concluded in a very characteristic fashion. “I hear that bulls and
                    other papistical things have been prepared, in which I am urged to recant or be
                    proclaimed a heretic. If that be true, I wish this little book to be part of my
                    future recantation.” The printing press sent thousands of these books through
                    Germany, and the people awaited the bull, armed beforehand against its
                    arguments. The bull was published at Rome on July 15, 1520. It accused Luther of
                    holding the opinions of Huss, and condemned him. Eck brought it to Leipsic, and
                    published it there in October. It was posted up in various German towns, and
                    usually the citizens and the students tore it down. At last it reached Luther.
                    He answered it in a pamphlet, in which he called it the execrable bull of
                    Antichrist, and at last he proclaimed at Wittenberg that he would publicly burn
                    it. On December 10, 1520, at the head of a procession of professors and
                    students, Luther passed out of the university gates to the market-place, where a
                    bonfire had been laid. One of the professors lighted the fuel, and Luther threw
                    the bull on the flames; a companion flung after it a copy of the canon law.
                    Germany was henceforth to be ruled by the law of the land, and not by the law of
                    Rome. The news flashed over all Germany, kindling stern joy. Rome had shot its
                    last bolt; if Luther was to be crushed, only the emperor could do it. On
                    December 17th Luther drew up before a notary and five witnesses a solemn
                    protest, in which he appealed from the pope to a general council. This protest,
                    especially when we take it along with other future acts of Luther, meant a great
                    deal more than many historians have discerned. It was the declaration that the
                    Christian community is wider than the Roman Church, and was an appeal from later
                    mediaeval to earlier mediaeval ideas of catholicity. In the times immediately
                    preceding the Reformation, the common description of Christian society was
                    social life in communion with the bishop of Rome, but in the earlier Middle Ages
                    Christian society had also been defined to be social life within the holy Roman
                    empire. For the Roman empire had imposed on all its subjects a creed, and to
                    that extent had made itself a Christian community. The oecumenical council was
                    the ecclesiastical assembly and final court of appeal for this society, whose
                    limits were determined by the boundaries of the mediaeval empire, and Luther by
                    this appeal not only declared that he could be a catholic Christian without
                    being in communion with Rome, but secured an ecclesiastical standing ground for
                    himself and his followers which the law could not help recognizing. It was an
                    appeal from the catholic church defined ecclesiastically to the catholic church
                    defined politically, and foreshadowed the future political relations of the
                    Lutheran Church.</p>
                <p>The pope had appealed to the emperor to crush heresy in Germany, and Charles V,,
                    with his Spanish training and his dreams of a restored mediaeval empire, where
                    he might reign as vicar of God <hi rend="italic">circa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >civilia,</hi> had promised his aid. He had declared, however, that he must
                    pay some regard to the views of Frederick of Saxony, from whom he had received
                    the imperial crown, and had in the end resolved to summon Luther before the diet
                    to be held at Worms. The diet was opened by Charles in January 1521, and the <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0088-0075"/> papal nuncio Hieronymus Alexander (afterwards
                    archbishop of Brindisi and cardinal) urged first privately and then publicly in
                    the diet that Luther should be condemned unheard, as one already tried and
                    convicted by the papal bull. He threatened the Germans with extermination, it is
                    said, in case of their refusal to accede to his requests,— “We shall excite the
                    one to fight against the other, that all may perish in their own blood,”—a
                    threat to which the whole subsequent history of Germany offers the commentary.
                    But the princes had their own quarrel with Rome, and urged besides that it would
                    be unfair to condemn a man unheard and untried. A committee appointed by the
                    diet presented a list of one hundred grievances of the German nation against
                    Rome. This startled the emperor, who, instead of ordering Luther’s books to be
                    burned, issued only a provisional order that they should be delivered to the
                    magistrate. He then sent to summon Luther before him, and granted him a safe
                    conduct to and from the diet. In April Luther set out for Worms. Before leaving
                    Wittenberg he had devised with his friend Lucas Cranach the artist what he
                    called “a good book for the laity,” a series of woodcuts depicting contrasts
                    between Christ and the pope, with explanations in pithy German:— Christ washing
                    the disciples’ feet on one page, the pope holding out his toe to be kissed, on
                    the other; Christ bearing his cross, the pope carried in state through Rome on
                    men’s shoulders; Christ driving money-changers out of the temple, the pope
                    selling indulgences, with piles of money before him; and so on. Luther went to
                    Worms, believing that he was going to his death. Everywhere on the road he saw
                    the imperial edict against his books posted up, yet his journey was in some sort
                    a triumphal progress; the people came out in crowds to meet him, and at Erfurt
                    the herald gave way to the universal request, and, against his instructions,
                    permitted Luther to preach. On the 16th Luther entered the imperial city amidst
                    an immense concourse of people. Next day he was brought before the diet. When
                    the hour approached he fell on his knees, and uttered in great agony a prayer
                    such as can only be pronounced by a man filled with the spirit of Him who prayed
                    in Gethsemane. When he appeared before the diet he was asked by John Eck, an
                    official of the archbishop of Treves (to be distinguished from Eck the
                    theologian), whether the books piled on a table were his, and whether he would
                    retract what was written in them. Luther acknowledged his writings, and
                    requested that as the matter written concerned the highest of all subjects, the
                    word of God and the welfare of souls, he might have time for consideration
                    before he answered the second question. His request was granted, and he retired.
                    Luther’s resolution had been taken before he appeared at the diet; he only
                    desired to convince friends as well as foes that he did not act with
                    precipitation at so decisive a moment. The next day he employed in prayer and
                    meditation, making a solemn vow upon a volume of Scripture to remain faithful to
                    the gospel, should he have to seal his confession with his blood. When he was
                    again brought before the diet, he answered at great length, dividing his
                    writings into three kinds :— (1) those in which he had written about faith and
                    morals in such fashion that even his opponents admitted that what he had said
                    was worth reading: he could not retract these; (2) those in which he had
                    condemned the papacy and popish doings, which had ruined Christendom body and
                    soul: to retract these would be mean and wicked, and he would not; (3) those in
                    which he had attacked private persons with perhaps more vehemence than was
                    right: he would not retract, but would readily listen to any one who pointed out
                    errors. He spoke in German with earnestness and force, but the emperor and his
                    followers scarcely understood him, and he was asked to repeat his answer in
                    Latin. He did so, and the papal party were irritated; the official declared that
                    they were not there to make distinctions or to discuss things which had been
                    long ago settled by councils; let the accused say whether he recanted or not.
                    Luther answered, “Well then, if your imperial majesty and your graces require a
                    plain answer, I will give you one of that kind without horns and teeth. It is
                    this. I must be convinced either by the witness of Scripture or by clear
                    arguments, for I do not trust either pope or councils by themselves, since it is
                    manifest that they have often erred and contradicted themselves—for I am bound
                    by the Holy Scriptures which I have quoted, and my conscience is held by the
                    word of God. I cannot and will not retract anything, for to act against
                    conscience is unsafe and unholy. So help me God. Amen.” Eck asked him whether he
                    actually meant to say that general councils had erred. He answered that he
                    declared, and that openly, that councils had erred several times, that the
                    council of Constance had erred. Eck replied that he surely did not mean to say
                    that general councils had erred. Luther persisted that he could prove that they
                    had erred in many places. The emperor made a sign to end the matter, and Luther
                    said, “I can do nought else. Here stand I. God help me. Amen.” He went back to
                    his lodgings in deep depression of spirit, but was comforted on learning that
                    the elector had told Spalatin, “Doctor Martin has spoken well in Latin and in
                    German before the emperor and all the princes and estates of the empire; only he
                    is too keen for me.” Luther’s answer created very various feelings among those
                    who heard him. The Italians and Spaniards wished the safe conduct revoked, and
                    Luther burnt at once. Most of the Germans resolved to protect him at all
                    hazards. The emperor deliberated for a day, and then declared that he meant to
                    permit Luther to return safely from the council, but that his opinions were to
                    be condemned, and all who clung to them punished for the future. But the
                    proposal to cancel the safe conduct had roused the people. There were
                    threatenings of insurrections of the peasants, and of Sickingen and the knights;
                    and the emperor, to allay the feeling, resolved that three days should be given
                    to Luther to reconsider what he had said. Theologians came to argue with him,
                    and to induce him to make some recantation, but in vain. At last the edict of
                    the diet was pronounced, in which Luther was condemned in the severest terms,
                    and placed under the ban of the empire. This meant that when his safe conduct
                    expired he was an outlaw, and that all people were forbidden to give him food or
                    fire or shelter. His books were to be burnt, his goods confiscated, and his
                    adherents punished. Whoever disobeyed the edict incurred the ban of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>I'rederick the elector of Saxony thought that Luther’s life was no longer safe,
                    as in twenty-one days his safe conduct would expire. Luther was hurried away
                    from Worms, and as he travelled back to Wittenberg he was stopped near Eisenach
                    by a band of armed knights, and carried to the fortified castle of the Wartburg
                    above Eisenach by Frederick’s orders. The elector’s fears, as matters turned
                    out, were exaggerated. Germany was in no mood to give Luther up, and there were
                    threatenings of risings when he disappeared, only appeased when it was whispered
                    about that he was in friendly keeping. Luther remained at the Wartburg, dressed
                    as a knight, ordered to let his beard grow, and bearing the name Junker George,
                    for ten months, and made use of his enforced leisure to begin what was perhaps
                    his greatest literary work, his translation of the Scriptures from the original
                    texts. The New Testament was almost entirely his own work. He used for the text
                    Erasmus’s fourth edition, and took incredible pains with his work. Some of his
                    MS. still <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n89/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0089-0076"/> survives, and shows that he corrected and
                    recorrected with great pains. Some passages were altered at least fifteen times.
                    He often felt at a loss for want of technical knowledge, and kid all his friends
                    under contribution. Thus, when in difficulty about the translation of Rev. xxi.
                    he wrote to Spalatin to ask for names and descriptions of all the precious
                    stones mentioned. When engaged in the translation of the descriptions of the
                    slaughter of beasts for sacrifice, he got a butcher to kill some sheep for him,
                    that he might learn what every part of a sheep was called. His aim was to
                    reproduce the tone and spirit of the original as far as he possibly could. No
                    fine courtly words, he said to Spalatin; this book can only be explained in a
                    simple popular style. It must be understood by the mother in the house, by the
                    children in the streets, and by the <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> common man in
                    the market.” The translation of the New Testament was first published on
                    September 21, 1522, and a second edition appeared in October. By choosing the
                    Franconian dialect in use in the imperial chancery, Luther made himself
                    intelligible to those whose vernacular dialect was High German or Low German,
                    and his Bible is still the standard of the German tongue, and has preserved
                    unity of language, literature, and thought to the German nation during its
                    political disintegration. The translation of the Old Testament, begun in the
                    same year, was a much more tedious task, and Luther was assisted in it by what
                    Matthesius calls a private Sanhedrim. The friends met once a week, several hours
                    before supper, in the old Augustinian monastery at Wittenberg, which had become
                    Luther’s house. Bugeuhagen, Justus Jonas, Melanchthon, Aurogallus, Roser, and
                    several Jewish rabbis made the “Sanhedrim.” Luther thus describes the work: “We
                    are labouring hard to bring out the prophets in the mothertongue. Ach Gott! what
                    a great and difficult work it is to make the Hebrew writers speak German! They
                    resist it so, and are unwilling to give up their Hebrew existence and become
                    like Germans.” At the Wartburg Luther was ill in health and somewhat troubled in
                    mind. He had been ill before he was summoned to Worms, and his long journey in
                    the waggon with its cloth tent, the excitement at Worms, and the solitude at the
                    Wartburg had enfeebled him; but his literary activity was untiring. He wrote
                    short commentaries on the G8th Psalm and on other portions of Scripture, and a
                    set of homilies intended to guide evangelical preachers, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kirchen-postille.</hi> He also wrote one or two short treatises on worship,
                    on the mass, on confession, and on monkish vows, intended to guide the reformed
                    churches in the rejection of superstitious usages. Up to this time there had
                    been no change in the church services. The true doctrine of the gospel had been
                    preached in Germany, and Romish rites and ceremonies had been exhibited as
                    abuses, but not ∙a single word or portion of these ceremonies had been changed,
                    and Luther felt that the time had come to bring the preaching and the usages
                    into harmony with each other. In the midst of these labours news came to him
                    that Germany was threatened with a new sale of indulgences. The cardinal
                    archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, unable to pay the 26,000 ducats due
                    to Rome for his pallium, had resolved to raise the money by indulgences. Luther
                    wrote a fierce tractate <hi rend="italic">Against the New Idol at Halle.</hi>
                    The archbishop getting word of this, sent to Frederick asking him to restrain
                    Luther from attacking a brother-elector, and Frederick wished Luther to desist.
                    He was indignant, but at the request of Melanchthon he agreed to lay the
                    treatise aside until he had written to the archbishop. “Put down the idol within
                    a fortnight, or I shall attack you publicly,” he wrote; and the archbishop in
                    reply thanked Luther for his Christian brotherly reproof, and promised, “with
                    the help of God, to live henceforth as a pious bishop and Christian prince.”</p>
                <p>Luther’s absence from his congregation, his students, and his friends and books
                    at Wittenberg weighed heavily upon him, and he began to hear disquieting
                    rumours. Carlstadt and other friends at Wittenberg were urging on the
                    Reformation at too rapid a rate. Their idea was that everything in worship not
                    expressly enjoined in the Bible should at once be abolished. The churches were
                    to be stripped of crucifixes, images of saints, and the ritual of the mass; the
                    festivals of the Christian year were to be neglected, the monastic life put down
                    by force; and some even wished it ordained that all clergymen should be married.
                    To Luther all this seemed dangerous, and sure to provoke a reaction; the changes
                    insisted upon were to him matters of indifference, which might be left to the
                    individual to do or leave undone as he pleased. Auricular confession, the
                    reception of the Lord’s Supper under both forms, pictures in churches, the
                    observance of festivals and fasts, and the monastic life were <hi rend="italic"
                        >adiaphora.</hi> He wrote earnestly warning his friends against rashness and
                    violence, and he was anxious and distressed. Still he held out patiently till
                    events occurred which called for his presence. Certain men claiming to be
                    prophets, Nicolaus Storch, a weaver, and his disciple Thomas Münzer, belonging
                    to the village of Zwickau, near the Erzgebirge on the borders of Bohemia,
                    preached wildly a thoroughgoing reformation in the church and the banishment of
                    priests and Bibles. All believers were priests, they said, and all the faithful
                    had the Holy Spirit within them, and did not need any such external rule as Holy
                    Scripture. They were banished from Zwickau, and came to Wittenberg, where
                    Carlstadt joined them. Fired by their preaching, the people tore down the images
                    in the churches and indulged in various kinds of rioting. Luther felt he could
                    remain no longer in hiding. He wrote to the elector telling him that he must
                    quit the Wartburg, and at the same time declaring that he left at his own peril.
                    “You wish to know what to do in the present troublesome circumstances,” he said.
                    “Do nothing. As for myself, let the command of the emperor be executed in town
                    or country. Do not resist if they come to seize and kill me; only let the doors
                    remain open for the preaching of the word of God.” He was warned that Duke
                    George of Saxony, a violent enemy of the Reformation, was waiting to execute the
                    sentence of the ban. “If things were at Leipsic as they are at Wittenberg,” he
                    said, “I would go there, if it rained Duke Georges for nine days running, and
                    every one of them nine times as fierce as he.” He left the Wartburg, suddenly
                    appearing in Wittenberg on March 3, 1522, and plunged at once into the midst of
                    struggles very different from those which he had hitherto so victoriously
                    overcome. Hé found things in a worse state than he had feared; even Melanchthon
                    had been carried away. Luther preached almost daily for eight consecutive days
                    against Carlstadt and the fanatics from Zwickau, and in the end he prevailed and
                    the danger was averted. His theme was that violence does no good to God’s word;
                    there are in religion matters of indifference. “The Word created heaven and
                    earth and all things; the same Word must also now create, and not we poor
                    sinners. <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">summarum,</hi> I will
                    preach it, I will talk of it, I will write about it, but I will not use force or
                    compulsion with any one.” “In this life every one must not do what he has a
                    right to do, but must forego his rights, and consider what is useful to his
                    brother. Do not make a ‘must be’ out of a <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> may
                    be,’ as you have now been doing, that you may not have to answer for those whom
                    you have misled by your uncharitable liberty.” Storch and Münzer, sincere though
                    misguided men, sought an interview with him. They laid <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n90/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0090-0077"/> their claims for support before him; they
                    said that they were inspired and could prove it, for they would tell him what
                    then passed through his mind. Luther challenged them to the proof. “You think in
                    your own heart that my doctrine is true,” said one of them impressively. “Get
                    thee behind me, Satan,” exclaimed Luther, and dismissed them. “They were quite
                    right,” he said to his friends afterwards; “that thought crossed my mind about
                    some of their assertions. A spirit evidently was in them; but what could it be
                    but the evil one ?”</p>
                <p>When Charles V. had laid Luther under the ban of the empire, he had undoubtedly
                    been greatly influenced by political considerations. Francis 1. of France and
                    Charles of Spain were rivals, and the whole of the European policy of the time
                    turns on this rivalry. The opponents schemed to attract to themselves and to
                    divert from their neighbour the two outside powers of England and the papacy,
                    and in</p>
                <p>1521 it was the policy of Charles to win alliance with the pope. The Germans saw
                    that they were being sacrificed in this game of statecraft, and there was no
                    great willingness even among Roman Catholics to put the edict of Worms in force.
                    Luther at the Wartburg and at Wittenberg was protected by the national feeling
                    of Germany from attack. The diet of the empire met in</p>
                <p>1522 at Nuremberg, and the new imperial council, which ruled in the emperor’s
                    absence, and very fairly represented the popular feeling in Germany, was in no
                    mood to yield to the papacy. Leo X. had died, and his successor Adrian VI., an
                    orthodox Dominican and an advocate for reformation in the cloisters and in the
                    lives of the clergy, proposed to begin reformation by crushing the German
                    heresy. He instructed his nuncio to the diet to demand the execution of the
                    edict of Worms. The imperial council refused until the grievances of Germany
                    were heard and redressed. They spoke of concordats broken and papal pledges
                    unfulfilled, and finally they demanded a free oecumenical council to be held in
                    Germany within a year, which should settle abuses, and until it met they wished
                    the creed to be an open question. The nuncio found that the pulpits of the free
                    imperial city were filled with preachers, mostly monks, who were making the city
                    resound with gospel preaching. He asked the diet at least to arrest the
                    preachers; the diet pleaded incompetence. He proposed to seize them himself in
                    the pope’s name; the magistrates threatened to release them by force, and the
                    nuncio had to desist. The diet then presented a hundred gravamina or subjects of
                    complaint which the German nation had against the papacy, including in the list
                    indulgences, dispensations bought for money, absentee bishops and other
                    ecclesiastics, the use of bans and interdicts, pilgrimages, excessive demands
                    for money, and the decisions of matrimonial cases in ecclesiastical courts. The
                    complaint was an expansion of Luther’s address to the German nobles. The nuncio
                    could do nothing, and was forced to accept by way of compromise a decision from
                    the diet that only the <hi rend="italic">verum, purum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >sincerum, et sanctum</hi><hi rend="italic">evangelism</hi> was to be
                    preached in Germany. Nuremberg reversed the edict of Worms. Next year the diet
                    met again at Nuremberg, and the new pope, Clement VIE., sent the celebrated
                    cardinal-legate Lorenzo Campeggio to demand the execution of the edict of Worms.
                    The diet asked in return what had become of the hundred grievances of the German
                    nation, to which Rome had never deigned to return an answer. Campeggio declared
                    that at Rome the document had been considered merely as a private pamphlet; on
                    which the diet, in great indignation, insisted on the necessity of an
                    oecumenical council, and proceeded to annul the edict of Worms,— declaring,
                    however, in their communication to the pope, that it should be conformed to as
                    much as possible, which with respect to many cities and princes meant not at
                    all. Finally it was resolved that a diet to be held at Spires was to decide upon
                    the religious differences. But between Nuremberg and Spires an event occurred,
                    the revolt of Sickingen and the knights, which was destined to work harm to the
                    Reformation. The diet of Spires met, and, many of the members being inclined to
                    connect Sickingen and Luther, there was a strong feeling against the
                    Reformation, but the feeling was not strong enough to induce the diet to comply
                    with the demands of the legate Campeggio and revoke the decisions of Nuremberg,
                    and it refused to execute the edict of Worms. Campeggio, however, was able to
                    separate Germany into two parties, and this separation became apparent at the
                    convention of Ratisbon, where Bavaria, Austria, and other South-German states
                    resolved to come to separate terms with the papacy. The curia promised to stop a
                    number of ecclesiastical extortions and indulgences, to make better appointments
                    to benefices, and to hand over some of the ecclesiastical estates to the
                    Austrian and Bavarian princes; while the states promised to set aside the
                    gravamina, and to permit no toleration of the new doctrines. On the other hand,
                    many states which had kept aloof from the Reformation now joined it, and
                    declared against the seven sacraments, the abuses of the mass, the worship of
                    saints, and the supremacy of the pope. The emperor’s brother and successor
                    Ferdinand was a bitter foe to the Reformation, and urged persecution. Four
                    Augustinian monks at Antwerp were the first martyrs; they were burnt on 1st July
                    1523. Ferdinand began the bloody work of persecution in the hereditary states of
                    Austria immediately after the convention of Ratisbon. At Passau in Bavaria, and
                    at Buda in Hungary, the faggots were lighted. The dukes of Bavaria followed the
                    same impulse.</p>
                <p>Luther’s literary activity during these years was unparalleled. In 1522 he
                    published, it is said, one hundred and thirty treatises, and eighty-three in the
                    following year, among them the famous <hi rend="italic">Contra Henricum
                        regem</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliae,</hi> in which, after having dealt
                    mercilessly with the royal controversialist, he exclaims, “I cry ‘ Gospel!
                    Gospel! Christ! Christ! ’ and they ceasenot to answer ‘Usages! Usages!
                    Ordinances! Ordinances! Fathers! Fathers !’ The apostle St Paul annihilates with
                    a thunderstorm from heaven all these fooleries of Henry.” His principal work,
                    however, during these years was the publication of certain short tracts upon
                    worship and its reform, followed by various directories for public worship,
                    which afterwards served as a model for the numerous Lutheran Church ordinances.
                    In 1522, while Luther was still in the Wartburg, Carlstadt had published for the
                    church at Wittenberg an ordinance for directing the government and worship of
                    the church. It was very brief, but very revolutionary <hi rend="italic">(cf</hi>
                    Richter’s <hi rend="italic">Evangel,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Kirchenordnungen,</hi> vol. ii. p. 484). This was withdrawn after Luther’s
                    return; but the Reformer felt that the time had come for a definite reform of
                    public worship and for publishing his views upon the subject. Accordingly, after
                    a series of tracts in 1522 upon religious and monastic vows, the abolition of
                    private masses, the Lord’s Supper under both forms, saint worship, the so-called
                    spiritual estate, and the married life, he published in 1523 <hi rend="italic"

                    made as few changes as possible in the form of service, caring only to give full
                    place to prayer and the reading and preaching of the word. The order of worship
                    was followed by the <hi rend="italic">Formula</hi><hi rend="italic">Hissae,</hi>
                    published in Latin, but at once translated into German by Paul Speratus, in
                    which the ancient form was as much preserved as is consistent with evangelical
                    doctrine. Luther was of opinion that the more difficult introits should be
                    removed from the order of the Eucharist, and simpler hymns put in their place,
                    and he also was strongly in favour of the singing of hymns in the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0091-0078"/> common worship. This led to the publication
                    in 1524 of a small collection of church hymns, which was Luther’s first <hi
                        rend="italic">German Church Hymn-book,</hi> and which was the beginning of
                    the wonderfully rich German Protestant hymnology. In the same year Luther
                    translated the order of baptism, and published it under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">Das Tauf-</hi><hi rend="italic">Büchlein.</hi> He also drew up
                    a directory for public worship for Leisnig <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Richter,
                        <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> vol. i.). The hymn-book was followed by a
                    prayer-book, and by the publication of a short summary of the heads of Christian
                    truth fitted for the instruction of the “rude common man.” Luther’s catechism
                    for children completed this series of works, intended to aid worship, public and
                    private. Notwithstanding this immense amount of literary work, Luther found time
                    to make preaching tours, and visited in this way Altenburg, Zwickau, Eilenburg,
                    Erfurt, Weimar, and many other places, and was cheered by the progress of the
                    Reformation throughout North Germany. About this time also he sent a powerful
                    address to the municipal councils of the German towns, exhorting them to
                    establish everywhere Christian schools, both elementary and secondary. “Oh my
                    dear Germans,” he exclaimed, “the divine word is now in abundance offered to
                    you. God knocks at your door; open it to Him! Forget not the poor youth. . . .
                    The strength of a town does not consist in its towers and buildings, but in
                    counting a great number of learned, serious, honest, and well-educated
                    citizens.” He tried to impress upon them the necessity for the highest
                    education, the knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, by showing how serviceable such
                    learning had been to him in his attack upon the abuses of Rome. He also appealed
                    to the princes and cities to help the gospel and the Reformed churches; but
                    church rule and church maintenance could not be fixed on a legal basis until
                    much later.</p>
                <p>Here we conclude this first glorious period of Luther’s life. The problem to be
                    solved was not to be solved by Luther and by Germany; the progressive vital
                    element of reformation passed from Germany to Switzerland, and through
                    Switzerland to France, Holland, England, and Scotland. Before he descended into
                    the grave, and Germany into thraldom, Luther saved, as much as was in him, his
                    country and the world, by maintaining the fundamental principles of the
                    Reformation against Melanchthon’s pusillanimity; but three Protestant princes
                    and the free cities were the leaders. The confession was the work of
                    Melanchthon; but the deed was done by the laity of the nation. The German
                    Reformation was made by a scholastically trained monk, seconded by professors;
                    the Swiss Reformation was the work of a free citizen, an honest Christian,
                    trained by the classics of antiquity, and nursed in true hard-won civil liberty.
                    Luther’s work was continued, preserved, and advanced by the work of the Swiss
                    and French Reformers. The monk began; ∙the citizen finished. If the one
                    destroyed Judaism, the other converted paganism, then most powerful, both as
                    idolatry and as irreligious learning. But as long as Luther lived he did not
                    lose his supremacy, and he deserved to keep it. His mind was universal, and
                    therefore catholic in the proper sense of the word.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Third Period</hi> (1525-1546). In this third period the epic of
                    Luther’s life was changed into tragedy; the revolt of the knights under
                    Sickingen, the Anabaptist tumults, and the peasants’ war in the Black Forest
                    alienated the sympathies of many from the Reformation, and resulted in a divided
                    Germany (see vol. x. p. 498, vol. i. p. 786). From Sickingen’s rising Luther
                    sedulously kept himself aloof, but the insurgent had more than once proclaimed
                    himself on Luther’s side, and that was enough to make many of the princes
                    resolve to have nothing to do with reform. The convention of Ratisbon was the
                    result of Sickingen’s abortive revolt. The Anabaptists have to do with Luther’s
                    history mainly in so far as his contact with them modified and gave final shape
                    to his doctrine of baptism. In his tract on the <hi rend="italic">Sacrament of
                        Baptism,</hi> 1519, Luther distinguishes carefully between the sign-and the
                    thing signified. The ordinance is just the sign, the thing signified is the
                    death to sin, the new birth, and a new life in Christ. This new life goes on
                    here on earth, so does the death to sin. Believers die daily to sin, not once
                    for all in baptism, and their life in Christ is not a full life whilst earth’s
                    life lasts; and so baptism is merely a sign of what is never really accomplished
                    till after death. In the <hi rend="italic">Babylonian Captivity of the Church of
                        God,</hi> 1520, Luther adopted a view not unlike Calvin’s. He said that
                    God’s word was always more than a statement, it was also a promise. Baptism was
                    therefore a seal or pledge, a promise that what was signified by the ordinance
                    would be bestowed. Only unbelief can rob the baptized of the benefits of their
                    baptism and make the ordinance of none effect. But after Luther came in contact
                    with the Anabaptists he departed from this simple theory, for he thought that he
                    could not justify infant baptism upon it, and so in his <hi rend="italic">Sermon
                        on Baptism,</hi> 1535, he introduced a third theory, which approached much
                    nearer to mediaeval views. He explained that in the ordinance of baptism God
                    through His word so works on the water in the sacrament that it is no longer
                    mere water, but has the power of the blood of Christ in some mysterious fashion.
                    Luther then asked if faith was required for the worthy partaking of the
                    sacrament, and he felt obliged to confess that the faith of the recipient was
                    not needed. This sermon marks Luther’s reaction towards ideas he had abandoned
                    in 1519-20.</p>
                <p>More important was the connexion between the Lutheran movement and the peasant
                    revolt. The first coalitions of the peasants against the intolerable rapacity
                    and cruelty of the feudal aristocracy had begun before the close of the 15th
                    century. But all the oppressed inclined towards Luther, and the oppressors, most
                    of whom were sovereigns, bishops, and abbots, towards the pope. The struggle in
                    the peasants’warwas really between the reforming and the papist party, and it
                    could easily be foreseen that Luther would be dragged into it. As early as
                    January 1525 the revolutionary movement had extended from the Black Forest into
                    Thuringia and Saxony, and the peasants were eagerly looking to Luther for help.
                    The more moderate party published their programme in twelve articles, with a
                    very remarkable preface, in which they stated that they did not wish for war,
                    and asked nothing that was not in accordance with the gospel. These articles
                    were the following :—</p>
                <p>(1) the whole congregation to have power to elect their minister, and if he was
                    found unworthy to dismiss him;</p>
                <p>(2) the great tithe, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the legal tithe of corn, to be
                    still payable for the maintenance of the pastor, and what is over to go to
                    support the poor; the small tithes to be no longer payable; (3) serfdom
                    abolished, since Christ has redeemed us all by His precious blood; (4) game,
                    fish, and fowl to be free as God created them; (5) the rich have appropriated
                    the forests, this to be rearranged; (6) compulsory service to be abolished—wages
                    for work; (7) peasant service to be limited by contract, and work done above
                    contract to be paid for; (8) fair rents; (9) arbitrary punishments abolished;
                    (10) the commons restored; (11) the right of heriot, <hi rend="italic">ue.,</hi>
                    the right of the lord to take the vassal’s best chattel, to be abolished; (12)
                    all these propositions to be tested by Scripture, and what cannot stand the test
                    to be rejected. Most impartial historians have declared that their demands were
                    on the whole just, and most of them have become law in Germany. The words of
                    Scripture brought forward by the peasants prove clearly that Luther’s preaching
                    of the gospel had acted, not as an incentive, but <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0092-0079"/> as a corrective. The peasants declared their
                    desire to uphold the injunctions of the gospel, peace, patience, and union. Like
                    the Puritans in the following century, the peasants say that they raise their
                    voice to God who saved the people of Israel; and they believe that God can save
                    them from their powerful oppressors, as he did the Israelites from the hand of
                    Pharaoh. Luther evidently felt himself appealed to. The crisis was difficult,
                    and, in spite of what has been said in his defence, he failed, as he failed
                    afterwards in the conference with the Swiss deputies at Marburg. Had Luther
                    thrown the weight of his influence into the peasants’ scale, and brought the
                    middle classes, who would certainly have followed him, to the side of the
                    peasants, a peaceful solution would in all probability have been arrived at, and
                    the horrors of massacre averted. But Luther, bold enough against the pope or the
                    emperor, never had courage to withstand that authority to which he was
                    constantly accustomed, the German prince. He began by speaking for the peasants
                    in his address to the lords, and had courage enough to tell them some plain
                    truths, as when he said that some of the twelve articles of the peasants are so
                    equitable as to dishonour the lords before God and the world, when he told them
                    that they must not refuse the peasants’ demands to choose pastors who would
                    preach the gospel, and when he said that the social demands of the peasants were
                    just, and that good government was not established for its own interest nor to
                    make the people subservient to caprice and evil passion, but for the interest of
                    the people. “Your exactions are intolerable,” he said, “you take away from the
                    peasant the fruit of his labour in order to spend his labour upon your finery
                    and luxury.” He was courageous enough also in asking the peasants to refrain
                    from violence, and in telling them that they would put themselves in the wrong
                    by rebellion, But what Luther did not see was that the time for good advice had
                    gone by, and that he had to take his stand on one side or the other. He trusted
                    too much in fine language. His advice that arbiters should be chosen, some from
                    the nobility and some from towns, that both parties should give up something,
                    and that the matter should be amicably settled by human law, came ten months too
                    late. The bloody struggle came; the stream of rebellion and destruction rolled
                    on to Thuringia and Saxony, and Luther apparently lost his head, and actually
                    encouraged the nobles in their sanguinary suppression of the revolt, in his
                    pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Against the Murdering, Robbing Rats of
                        Peasants,</hi> where he hounds on the authorities to “stab, kill, and
                    strangle.” The princes leagued together, and the peasants were routed
                    everywhere. One army, with neither military arms nor leaders, was utterly routed
                    at Frankenhausen, another in Würtemberg. Fifty thousand were slain or butchered
                    by wholesale executions. Among this number many of the quietest and most
                    moderate people were made victims in the general slaughter, because they were
                    known or suspected to be friends of the Reformation and of Luther, which indeed
                    all the citizens and peasants of Germany were at that time. None felt more
                    deeply, when it was too late, this misery, and what it involved in its effects
                    on the cause of the gospel in Germany, than Luther; and he never recovered the
                    shock. He thus unburdens his soul at the close of this fatal year, which crushed
                    for centuries the rights and hopes of the peasants and labourers, and weakened
                    the towns and cities, the seats of all that was best in the national life,—“The
                    spirit of these tyrants is powerless, cowardly, estranged from every honest
                    thought. They deserve to be the slaves of the people ;” and in the next year—“I
                    fear Germany is lost; it cannot be otherwise, for they will employ nothing but
                    the sword.”</p>
                <p>The prospect was dark enough for the Reformer. Ferdinand of Austria and the duke
                    of Bavaria were imprisoning and slaying Christians on account of the gospel. The
                    emperor, fresh from his victory at Pavia, and the pope were combining to crush
                    the Reformation, and it was rumoured that the kings of France and England were
                    to lend their aid. The convention of Ratisbon had resulted in a Roman Catholic
                    league in which Duke George of Saxony, Albert elector-archbishop of Mainz, and
                    the duke of Brunswick were the leaders. Luther also found that the war had
                    demoralized the Protestant congregations, and that they were becoming ignorant
                    and savage. And in May 1525 the elector Frederick died.</p>
                <p>It was under such auspices that Luther decided at last to take a wife, as he had
                    long advised his friends among the priests and monks to do. He married Catherine
                    von Bora, a lady twenty-four years of age, of a noble Saxon family, who had left
                    her convent together with eight other sisters in order to worship Christ without
                    the oppression of endless ceremonies, which gave neither light to the mind nor
                    peace to the soul. The sisters had lived together in retirement, protected by
                    pious citizens of Torgau. Luther married her on June 11, 1525, in the presence
                    of Lucas Cranach and of another friend as witnesses. Catherine von Bora had no
                    dowry, and Luther lived on his appointment as professor; he would never take any
                    money for his books. His marriage was a happy one, and was blessed with six
                    children. He was a tender husband, and the most loving of fathers. In the close
                    of the year 1525 Luther was engaged in controversy with Erasmus on the freedom
                    of the will.</p>
                <p>The princes who were friendly to the Reformation gradually gained more courage.
                    The elector John of Saxony established the principle in his state that all rites
                    should be abrogated which were contrary to the Scriptures, and that the masses
                    for the dead be abolished at once. The young landgrave Philip of Hesse gained
                    over the son of the furious Duke George to the cause of the Reformation. Albert,
                    duke of Prussia, had established it at Königsberg, as hereditary duke,
                    abolishing the vows of the order whose master he had been, saying :—“There is
                    only one order, and that is Christendom.” At the request of the pope, Charles
                    placed Albert under interdict as an apostate monk. The evangelical princes found
                    in all these circumstances a still stronger motive to act at Augsburg as allies
                    in the cause of the evangelical party; and when the diet opened in December 1525
                    they spoke out boldly :—“It is violence which brought on the war of the
                    peasants. If you will by violence tear the truth of God out of the hearts of
                    those who believe, you will draw greater dangers and evils upon you.” The
                    Romanist party was startled. “The cause of the holy faith” was adjourned to the
                    next diet at Spires. The landgrave and the elector made a formal alliance in
                    February 1526 at Torgau.</p>
                <p>Luther, being consulted as to his opinion, felt helpless. “You have no faith; you
                    put not your trust in God; leave all to Him.” The landgrave, the real head of
                    the evangelical alliance, perceived that Luther’s advice was not practical—that
                    Luther forsook the duty of self-defence and the obligation to do one’s duty
                    according to the dictates of reason, in religious matters as well as in other
                    political questions. But the alliance found no new friends. Germany showed all
                    her misery by the meanness of her princes and the absence of any great national
                    body to oppose the league formed by the pope, the emperor,, and the Romanists
                    throughout Europe. The archbishop of Treves preferred a pension from Charles to
                    the defence of the national cause. The evangelically-disposed elector of the
                    palatinate desired to avoid getting into trouble. The imperial city of
                    Frankfort, surrounded by open <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0093-0080"/> enemies and timid friends, declined to accede
                    to the alliance. There was more national feeling and courage in the Anglo-Saxon
                    north of Germany. The princes of Brunswick, Luxemburg, Mecklenburg, Anhalt, and
                    Mansfeld assembled at Magdeburg, and made a solemn and heroic declaration of
                    their resolution “to pledge their estates, lives, states, and subjects for the
                    maintenance of the holy word of God, relying on Almighty God, as whose
                    instruments they would act.” The town of Magdeburg (which then had about three
                    times as many inhabitants as now) and Duke Albert of Prussia adhered to the
                    alliance. The league doubled its efforts. Charles, strong and rendered safe by
                    the peace of Madrid concluded with Francis, sent word from Seville in March
                    1526, through the Romish Duke Henry of Brunswick, that he would soon come
                    himself to crush the heresy. Luther saw the dangers crowding around him; his
                    advice was,—“We are threatened with war; let us force our enemies to keep the
                    peace, conquered by the Spirit of God, before whose throne we most now combat
                    with the arms of prayer; that is the first work to be done.”</p>
                <p>The emperor commissioned his brother Ferdinand to preside at the diet of Spires
                    and carry out his wishes. But before the diet met Francis and the pope had
                    formed a league against him, and Charles had commissioned Count Frundsberg to
                    levy an army of Germans to fight against the pope, while Ferdinand was called to
                    Hungary to maintain against the Turks and others the kingdoms of Hungary and
                    Bohemia, bequeathed to him by King Louis after the battle of Mohacz. When the
                    diet at Spires met (June 1526), after some deliberation a proposition presented
                    by the free cities was accepted that until a general council met “every state
                    shall live, rule, and bear itself as it shall be ready to answer for to God and
                    his imperial majesty,”—a decision which foreshadowed the famous Augsburg formula
                        <hi rend="italic">cujιιs</hi><hi rend="italic">regio ejus religio,</hi> the
                    principle on which the German Protestant church was afterwards legally based.
                    The Reformation had thus the three years, 1526-1529, to organize and consolidate
                    itself. The man of Germany at that time among the princes was Philip, landgrave
                    of Hesse, and he was taught what to do by a citizen James Sturm, the deputy of
                    Strasburg at Spires. Sturm had convinced Philip that the basis of the true
                    evangelical church was the acknowledgment of the self-government of the church
                    by synods composed of the representatives of the whole Christian people; and
                    this was embodied in the first Protestant constitution, the <hi rend="italic"

                    acknowledged the episcopal element, but not episcopal rule; the <hi
                        rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">episcopale</hi> was invested in the
                    Christian community, and the flock of Christ were to hear only the voice of
                    their shepherd Christ. Bishops and deacons were to be elected by the Christian
                    people; bishops were to be consecrated by imposition of the hands of three
                    bishops, and deacons instituted by the imposition of the hands of elders; while
                    elders were associated with the pastors in the pastoral care of the
                    congregation. A general or land synod was to be held annually, consisting of the
                    pastor of each parish and of pious men elected from the various congregations,
                    and there were provisions made for provincial and congregational synods. Three
                    men were to be elected annually to exercise the right of visitation. This was
                    afterwards found to be inconvenient, and six and then thirteen superintendents
                    for life were substituted. This board of superintendents became afterwards an
                    oligarchy, and at last a mere instrument of state, overriding the original
                    democratic constitutions of the church, a consequence of the disruption of
                    Germany and of the paralysis of all national institutions. Luther had in 1523
                    and 1524 professed principles almost identical with those established in 1526 in
                    Hesse. His action ceased there; after the peasants’ war he abandoned his more
                    liberal ideas, and insisted on leaving everything to the princes, and what could
                    a people do cut up into four hundred sovereignties? Luther never acknowledged
                    Caesaropapism or Erastianism as a principle and as a right. He considered the
                    rights of the Christian people as a sacred trust provisionally deposited in the
                    hands of the princes their representatives. “Where,” he asked, “are the people
                    to form the synods? I cannot find them.” It was Melanchthon’s influence that
                    facilitated the despotic system and hampered the thorough reform of the forms of
                    worship. Luther withdrew from a sphere which he felt was not his. He busied
                    himself during these years with plans to improve and simplify the church
                    services at Wittenberg. Some portions of the music in the communion service were
                    too difficult for the people. Luther induced the elector to provide music
                    teachers, and also to permit a simpler service. This led to the <hi
                        rend="italic">German Mass and Order of Worship for Wittenberg.</hi> The
                    churches too throughout electoral Saxony were becoming better attended, and
                    Luther had to consider and devise plans for church extension and supervision.
                    His letters to Philip of Hesse, disapproving of the new constitution of the
                    church there, show how jealous he had become of the entrance of democratic
                    ideas. He asked the elector of Saxony to take charge of the church within his
                    dominions, and Melanchthon’s articles for the visitation of the churches in
                    Saxony, which foreshadowed the Lutheran consistorial organization, show that
                    Luther distinctly contemplates the transfer of the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">episcopale</hi> to the princes and magistrates. It is true
                    that he called these magistrates <hi rend="italic">Notfιebisch'ofe,</hi> but he
                    could not see any other solution of the difficulty, and undoubtedly from the
                    legal point of view it was easy to transfer the right of supervision from one
                    external authority to another, and difficult to hand it over from the bishops to
                    the congregation. The new ecclesiastical organization adopted in Hesse and
                    electoral Saxony had the effect of making the archbishop of Mainz renounce in
                    1528 the spiritual jurisdiction he had hitherto exercised over these two
                    districts.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the emperor had been again successful in his political schemes. His
                    German army under the Constable Bourbon and General Frundsberg had seized upon
                    Italy and had sacked Rome, and again he had brought the pope and Francis to
                    terms. It only remained to subdue the Reformation, and the mediaeval empire
                    might be restored. He first sent a dispatch saying that the edict of Worms was
                    to be held as in force. When the diet met at Spires in 1529, the imperial
                    commissioners forbade the celebration of worship according to the reformed usage
                    in churches, and afterwards in the houses of the elector and of the landgrave.
                    The Act of Toleration of 1526 was to be abrogated. The diet appeared to be
                    hopelessly divided, a majority with the emperor and a minority with the elector
                    and. the landgrave, and the majority passed an edict which amounted to this that
                    where the edict of Worms could not be executed without fear of revolution no
                    further reforms were to be allowed. The minority prepared a protest. “The diet
                    has overstepped its authority,” they said; “our acquired right is that the
                    decree of 1526, unanimously adopted, remains in force until a council can be
                    convened. Up to this time the decree has maintained the peace, and we protest
                    against its abrogation.” Ferdinand, who represented his brother, assured the
                    princes that nothing remained for them but to submit; he threatened the free
                    cities with the loss of their privileges <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0094-0081"/> and with an interdict, and he left the diet
                    while the evangelical members were.deliberating. In spite of these threats the
                    protest was signed by John of Saxony, George of Brandenburg, Ernest of Lüneburg,
                    Philip of Hesse, and Wolfgang of Anhalt among the princes, and by the
                    representatives of the free cities of Strasburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Costnitz
                    (Constance), Lindau, Memmingen, Kempten, Nördlingen, Heilbronn, Reutlingen,
                    Isny, St Gall, Weissenburg, and Windsheim. This celebrated protest of April 15,
                    1529, from which comes the name Protestant, is one of the noblest documents of
                    Christian history. The protesting princes and cities claimed as their right as
                    Germans the sacred duty freely to preach the word of God and the message of
                    salvation, that all who would hear it might join the community of believers. It
                    was also an earnest of true evangelical union; for it was well known that most
                    of the cities were more inclined towards Zwingli’s than towards Luther’s view of
                    the sacrament.</p>
                <p>If this great act be considered impartially, it is impossible not to see that
                    neither Luther nor Melanchthon was the real leader of the time. Luther had no
                    real comprehension of what had to be done in Germany to preserve the gospel from
                    destruction. He had shown little sympathy with the first attempt made in Hesse
                    at the selfgovernment of the church; still less did he see the importance of the
                    protest at Spires, and of the unity it gave to the evangelical cause. It was
                    evident that nothing but the inroad of the Turks had saved the Protestant
                    princes after the diet, and that Charles was so far master of Germany as to make
                    it impossible for Germany to become a Protestant nation. The Protestants w ere
                    lost unless they strengthened the alliance which they had just founded at
                    Spires. But Luther disliked such alliances; he dissuaded the elector from
                    sending deputies to the meeting agreed to be held at Smalkald, and when the
                    Saxon deputies prevented any business being done he was proud of the result.
                    This apparent blindness and perversion of mind requires explanation. Luther
                    lived under the shadow of the Middle Ages, and had been trained in scholastic
                    law as well as in scholastic theology. To the mediaeval jurist the emperor was
                    the impersonation of all social order and moral law; he was the vicar of God. In
                    the later Middle Ages the jurists had exaggerated this sacredness of the
                    emperor, and had done so quite naturally in order to protect civil law from
                    canon law, and to uphold the state against the church. Luther could throw off
                    scholastic theology, but he could not throw off that scholastic jurisprudence
                    that all his mediaeval heroes, Occam, Wickliffe, and Huss had found so useful in
                    their attacks on the papacy, and that Luther himself had found so serviceable
                    when he appealed from the church defined by the pope to the church defined by
                    the empire. He could not bear to think of an alliance against the holy Roman
                    empire. Luther too had been trained in the school of Tauler and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Theologia Germanica,</hi> and partook greatly of their
                    quietism. “Suffer God to do His work in you and about you” was their motto.
                    There was a theological scruple also at the bottom of Luther’s opposition to a
                    vigorous Protestant alliance and a national attitude. This betrayed itself,
                    first, in an uneasiness about Zwingli’s rising influence in Germany, and,
                    secondly, as a doctrinal idiosyncrasy respecting the sacrament of the Eucharist.
                    Philip of Hesse saw through this instantly, and said, “I see they are against
                    the alliance on account of these Zwinglians; well, let us see whether we cannot
                    make these theological differences disappear.”</p>
                <p>When Luther was raised above himself by the great problem before him in that
                    glorious period of action from 1518 to 1524, he had considered the sacrament as
                    a part of the services of the church, and a secondary matter compared with the
                    right view of faith or the inward Christianity which implies necessarily an
                    unselfish believing and thankful mind. He was convinced that there was no virtue
                    inherent in the elements apart from the communion, and it was a matter
                    indifferent how the spirituality of the action and the real presence, even the
                    transubstantiation, might be reconciled with faith. But the peasants’ war and
                    Carlstadt’s mystical enthusiasm alarmed him. Where was this to lead to, he
                    asked, and he seems to have settled down into a great resolve to abide by the
                    tradition of the church, and alter as little as possible provided room was found
                    for the exercise of living faith. So when he felt called upon to form a theory
                    of the doctrine of the sacrament of the Eucharist he went back to his
                    scholasticism to find there some theory which should be traditional and yet
                    afford room for the spiritual priesthood of all believers, and for the exercise
                    of faith on the promises of God. He found it in the writings of that schoolman
                    whom he more than once calls “his dear master,” the daring Englishman William of
                    Occam. Transubstantiation, the Romish doctrine, offended Luther in his two
                    essential requirements: it demanded a miracle which could be performed by a
                    priest only, and this miraculous power so separated clergy from laity that it
                    denied the spiritual priesthood of all believers: and, when the elements had
                    been made by the priest’s creating word the body and blood of the Lord, their
                    supernatural efficacy, apart from the faith of the communicant, imparted grace.
                    Occam had championêd a theory which in some form or other had been in the church
                    since the 10th century at least, and which openly rejected one of these
                    stumbling blocks, and, as Luther saw, really did away with the other also.
                    According to Occam’s scholastic distinctions, matter can be present in two
                    ways—(1) when it occupies a distinct place by itself, excluding every other
                    body, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> two stones mutually exclude each other, and
                    (2) when it occupies the same space as another body at the same time. Everything
                    which is omnipresent or ubiquitous must be able to occupy the same space as
                    other things, else it could not be ubiquitous. Christ’s resurrection body, said
                    Occam, had this power when our Lord appeared among His disciples while they were
                    in a room with the doors shut; at a certain moment of time it and a portion of
                    door or wall must have been in the same place at the same time; and besides
                    Christ’s body is ubiquitous. It is therefore in the elements bread and wine, in,
                    with, and under them. Luther took over this doctrine from Occam without
                    alteration. The very illustrations he uses in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bekenntηiss</hi><hi rend="italic">vom Abendmahl</hi> are taken almost
                    verbatim from Occam, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Altaris</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sacramento.</hi> From this it followed that consubstantiation
                    involved no miracle. Christ’s body was not brought into the elements by the
                    priest; it was there naturally. But its presence in these elements on
                    sacramental occasions brought with it a blessing, and imparted grace, not
                    because of the presence, but because God had promised that this particular
                    presence of the everywhere present body of Christ would bring blessings to the
                    faithful partaker. Occam’s theory of consubstantiation fulfilled all Luther’s
                    wants, and above all it involved no explaining away of the plain meaning of the
                    sentence, “This is my body,” such as had offended him in Carlstadt. It is easy
                    to see therefore how Luther was alarmed at Zwingli. The Swiss Reformer seemed to
                    attack everything that Luther prized. He did not care for tradition or church
                    usage; he seemed engaged in a rationalistic attack on the presence of Christ in
                    the church, and on the word of God, and so he was guilty, in Luther’s
                    estimation, both of self-confidence and of a rationalism. On the other hand,
                    Zwingli could not understand what Luther meant; and yet he was anxious to unite
                    with him, and was willing to leave this one difficulty an open question. It was
                    in these circumstances—suspicion on the part of Luther, blank amazement on the
                    part cf <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n95/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0095-0082"/> Zwingli—that Philip of Hesse induced the
                    Swiss and the German theologians to meet at Marburg. Luther was gloomy and
                    suspicious, “as he had never been seen before,” a friend said. The frank
                    declarations of the Swiss Reformers soon cleared away all shadows of difference
                    and dissent on all points but one, and fourteen articles defining the chief
                    heads of Christian doctrine were adopted by both parties. Then came the
                    discussion on the fifteenth, the doctrine of the Eucharist. Luther took a piece
                    of chalk and wrote upon the table <hi rend="italic">Hoc</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >est</hi><hi rend="italic">corpus meum,</hi> and when worsted in argument,
                    as he usually was, appealed to the sentence. The discussion, which lasted four
                    days, however, resulted in the parties recognizing exactly where the point of
                    difference lay, and in reducing it to its smallest dimensions. Both declared
                    that they agreed in recognizing the Eucharist to be a sacrament of the true body
                    and blood of Christ, and that a spiritual partaking of this body was a means of
                    grace. They differed whether the true body and blood of Christ were <hi
                        rend="italic">corporeally</hi> in the sacrament. It was hoped that time
                    would bring about alliance if not agreement, but Luther was obstinate. “Submit
                    yourselves, believe as we do, or you cannot be acknowledged as Christians.” He
                    refused Zwingli’s hand; “You have another spirit from us,” he said, meaning that
                    there was no objective basis of faith between them owing to what he thought to
                    be Zwingli’s rationalism. The result was a sad one, but Zwingli was to some
                    extent a gainer; his view became naturalized in Germany, where Swabia adopted
                    it, as did many of the imperial cities, and Philip of Hesse indicated that he
                    preferred it.</p>
                <p>The Marburg conference was a sad prelude to the decisive diet to be held at
                    Augsburg in 1530. The new diet was anxiously awaited. Charles had made known his
                    intention to be present, and that he intended to enforce obedience to the edict
                    of Worms. He entered Augsburg with great magnificence, and was in fact at the
                    zenith of his power. He had broken the might of France, humbled the papacy, been
                    crowned at Bologna, reorganized Italy, and driven back the Turk. His only
                    remaining task, and it seemed easy, was to crush the Reformation. He first
                    summoned before him the protesting princes and asked them to withdraw the
                    protest. This they refused to do; they had a clear constitutional right,
                    founding on the decision of Spires, to resist the emperor, and they resolved to
                    exercise it. Divine service after Lutheran fashion was held at their quarters,
                    and they refused to join in the procession of the host at the festival of Corpus
                    Christi. Meanwhile Luther, Melanchthon with him, was at Coburg, near enough at
                    hand for consultation and yet beyond the emperor’s reach. Melanchthon was
                    preparing a confession with a defence, the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apology,</hi> in case the emperor should require a statement of their
                    doctrines. Luther was writing commentaries on the Psalms and the prophets, and
                    was also preparing a popular edition of <hi rend="italic">Aesop's</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Fables.</hi> He also wrote comforting letters to the elector,
                    and addressed one of his most powerful writings to the Roman Catholic clergy
                    assembled in the diet at Augsburg. Melanchthon was sent for to consult about the
                    confession which the emperor had asked for, and Luther remained alone at Coburg
                    full of anxiety, for he knew his friend’s helplessness in the actual bustle of
                    life. When Melanchthon got to Augsburg he really became a source of weakness. He
                    induced the elector for the sake of peace to give up the services in the
                    Franciscan church, and the Protestant preachers left the town in despair. Luther
                    all the while had been quiet, waiting in patience; but this was too much for
                    him, and he wrote to encourage the elector to resist. At length the Protestants
                    were asked to present their confession. The emperor ordered it to be read in
                    Latin. “No,” said the elector, “we are Germans and on German ground. I hope
                    therefore your majesty will allow us to speak German.” When the vice-chancellor
                    of the elector, Dr Christian Baier, had read the first part of the confession,
                    which expounds the principles of the Reformation, and in particular the doctrine
                    of justification by faith, “that faith which is not the mere knowledge of an
                    historical fact, but that which believes, not only the history, but also the
                    effect of that history upon the mind,” it is said that an indescribable effect
                    was produced upon the assembly. The opponents felt that there was a reality
                    before them which they had never imagined; and others said that such a
                    profession of faith by such princes was a more effectual preaching than that
                    which had been stopped. “Christ,” said Jonas, “is in the diet, and he does not
                    keep silence; the word of God is indeed not to be bound.” The Roman Catholic
                    theologians present answered the confession, and then the emperor engaged
                    Protestant and Roman Catholic theologians in negotiations in which Melanchthon
                    soon showed his yielding character, even granting that the Protestants might
                    acknowledge the jurisdiction of the bishops and the supremacy of the pope. At
                    this critical moment Luther’s indignation found vent. “I understand,” he wrote
                    to Melanchthon, “that you have begun a marvellous work, to make Luther and the
                    pope agree together, but the pope will say that he will not, and Luther begs to
                    be excused. Should you, however, after all succeed in your affair, I will follow
                    your example and make an agreement between Christ and Belial. Take care that you
                    give not up justification by faith; that is the heel of the seed of the woman to
                    crush the serpent’s head. Take care not to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the
                    bishops; they will soon take all. In short, your negotiations have no chance of
                    success unless the pope will renounce papacy.” The Romanists fortunately
                    demanded too much. Not even Melanchthon could yield the acknowledgment of
                    private masses, of auricular confession, and of the meritorious character of
                    good works; and the negotiations ceased. While they were in progress the emperor
                    tried to intimidate the princes by calling the imperial troops into the free
                    city of Augsburg and closing the gates. The landgrave escaped, and this
                    frightened the Catholics. Unfortunately the Protestants had confessed their want
                    of union by presenting three confessions of faith :—the Lutherans had presented
                    the Augsburg confession; Strasburg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau, which
                    sympathized to some extent with Zwingli, presented the Confessio Tetrapolitana;
                    and Zwingli had sent a confession which was not, however, laid before the diet.
                    The diet broke up with the final decision that the Protestants should have till
                    next spring to consider whether they would voluntarily return to the church, and
                    that, if they proved obstinate, then measures would be taken for their
                    extermination.</p>
                <p>To the student of Luther’s life the diet of Augsburg is noteworthy chiefly
                    because it was the occasion of the composition of the Augsburg confession, or
                        <hi rend="italic">Augustana,</hi> which afterwards became the symbol or
                    confession of faith for the Lutheran Church. It was prepared by Melanchthon,
                    founding on the fifteen articles of the Marburg conference, on the seventeen
                    articles of Schwabach, and on the articles of Torgau. These various sets of
                    articles had been written by Luther, and therefore the Augsburg confession was
                    strictly Luther’s own. It consists of two parts—one dogmatic, in twenty-one
                    articles, which states the principal doctrines of the evangelical church,
                    beginning with the Trinity and ending with the worship of saints; and the other
                    in seven articles, rejecting the celibacy of the clergy, the sacrifice of the
                    mass, auricular confession, ceremonial feasts and fasts, monastic vows, and the
                    secular jurisdiction of bishops. It was signed at Augsburg by John of <pb

                    Lüneburg, Philip of Hesse, and Wolfgang of Anhalt, and by the representatives of
                    the towns of Nuremberg and Reutlingen, and during the sitting of the diet by the
                    representatives of Kempten, Heilbronn, Windsheim, and Weissenburg.</p>
                <p>The edict of the diet was published on November 19, and the Protestant princes,
                    after having overcome the resistance of Luther, met for conference at Smalkald
                    on Christmas 1530, and formed an armed league for mutual defence. It had been
                    declared that the edict would be put into execution in the spring of 1531, but
                    when the time came the emperor had other work on hand: France had become
                    troublesome, and the Turks were again moving. He found also that he could not
                    count on the support of the Roman Catholic princes in the suppression of the
                    Protestants. In presence of danger the Zwinglians and Lutherans showed a united
                    front, and the Smalkald league grew to be a formidable power. The emperor
                    resolved to come to terms with his Protestant subjects, and the result was the
                    religious peace or rather truce of Nuremberg, which left things as they were
                    until a general council should settle matters. The years following this peace of
                    Nuremberg were comparatively prosperous to the Reformation. The Smalkald league
                    was the only organized power in Germany, and very effectually prevented the
                    oppression of Protestants by Roman Catholics. Year by year their numbers
                    increased, and Luther saw the evangelical cause prospering. First Würtemberg was
                    won back for young Duke Christopher, who had become a Protestant, and found on
                    his entry to his dukedom that his people were already secret Protestants. In
                    northern and central Germany whole districts embraced the evangelical doctrines.
                    Electoral Brandenburg and ducal Saxony had received Protestant rulers, who found
                    their people more than willing to accept the creed of their new sovereigns. At
                    last the only large states that were able to maintain a firm front against the
                    Lutheran doctrines were Austria, Bavaria, the Palatinate, and the great
                    ecclesiastical provinces on the Rhine, and even in these regions visitations of
                    the churches had shown that the people were forsaking the old faith. It appeared
                    that a more serious defection than any might at any moment be made. The
                    electorarchbishop of Cologne showed signs of abandoning the Roman Catholic faith
                    and secularizing his vast episcopal territories, and this threatened defection
                    made Charles bestir himself. If the elector became a Protestant the Lutherans
                    would be in a majority in the electoral college, and a Protestant emperor might
                    he elected.</p>
                <p>During all these years Luther was quietly at work at Wittenberg, lecturing,
                    preaching, and writing. At first he felt anxious lest civil war should break
                    out, and he had scruples about many of the doings, and even about the very
                    existence, of that league which was really giving the land peace. Under Philip
                    of Hesse the Reformation was assuming a national and political shape which
                    alarmed Luther, who was more than ever content to keep out of public life and
                    keep himself to his books. He began publishing his lectures on various portions
                    of Scripture, on the Epistle to the Galatians and on the Psalms of Degrees. He
                    wrote one or two controversial tracts, mainly to show how the Reformed could not
                    accept the conditions offered by the Roman Catholics at Augsburg. In 1534, to
                    his great joy, the first complete translation of the whole Bible was published,
                    and next year appeared a new edition of the Wittenberg hymn-book, containing
                    several new hymns. Philip of Hesse, notwithstanding the failure of the
                    conference at Marburg, still thought that something might be done to remove the
                    theological differences between Switzerland and Saxony, or at least between
                    Swabia, Strasburg, and Wittenberg. The divines of Switzerland and of South
                    Germany had by their publications made this somewhat easier. The confession of
                    Basel, drafted by Oecolampadius (1531), revised by Myconius, and published by
                    the magistracy of Basel, had declared that in the Lord’s Supper Christ is the·
                    food of the soul to everlasting life, and Bucer and the other South-German
                    divines were anxious for a union. Philip of Hesse, Bucer, and Melanchthon met in
                    conference at Cassel to arrange preliminaries, not without suspicion on Luther’s
                    part, for he could not trust Melanchthon at a conference, and, as he remarked to
                    Justus Jonas, he hated trimmers above all men on the earth’s round. The result,
                    however, was better than he had hoped for. Bucer drew up a short confession
                    which was to be submitted to the Wittenberg theologians, and was favourably
                    received by them, and the South German theologians were invited, to a further
                    conference at Wittenberg. The meeting very fairly represented all the German
                    states, and the result was the document known as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Wittenberg Concordia.</hi> This document, mainly drawn up by Bucer and
                    Melanchthon, contains a statement of the doctrine of the sacrament of the supper
                    expressed according to the Lutheran formula, with the declaration that unworthy
                    or faithless partakers really do not participate in the sacrament. Melanchthon
                    and Bucer had used too much diplomatic skill in drawing up the formula, for the
                    essential differences between the Wittenberg and the Strasburg school were not
                    really faced and explained; they were covered over with ambiguous language. Nor
                    could the document be accepted by the Swiss; but for a time it seemed as if a
                    satisfactory basis of peace had been established. The general satisfaction was
                    increased by the publication of the First Helvetic Confession, which, while
                    stating the doctrine of the sacrament of the supper in a manner essentially
                    Zwinglian, laid special emphasis on the real spiritual presence of Christ in the
                    elements. Luther in a letter to Meyer, burgomaster of Basel, and also in his
                    answer to the Reformed cantons, acknowledged the earnest Christianity of the
                    confession, and promised to do his best to promote union with the Swiss. It is
                    sad to think that only three years later his old animosity to Zwingli and his
                    countrymen broke out again in his book against the Turks, and that he renewed
                    the sacramental controversy with even more than the old fury in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Short Confession of the Holy Sacrament,</hi> published in
                    1544. This first Helvetic confession was drawn up, however, for another purpose
                    than to appease the Wittenberg theologians. Charles V. was urging the pope to
                    call a general council to end the disputes within the Christian church, and it
                    seemed so probable that a council would meet that the Protestants were
                    everywhere preparing themselves by doctrinal statements for taking their share
                    in its work. The German princes and their theologians were also greatly
                    exercised about this council, and the thought of it and how Protestants should
                    bear themselves in its presence was filling Luther’s mind. He wrote several
                    short papers on the subject in the years 1534-39, beginning with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Convocatio Concilii liberi</hi> and ending with <hi
                        rend="italic">Von den</hi><hi rend="italic">Conciliis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >und</hi><hi rend="italic">Kirchen.</hi> The pope, Paul ΠI., yielding to the
                    pressure of the emperor and of such liberal Roman Catholics as Vergerius, his
                    legate in Germany, called a council to meet in May 1537 at Mantua, and invited
                    the Lutherans to be present. The Lutheran princes and theologians felt compelled
                    to face the question whether they could or could not accept the invitation, and
                    Luther, at the request of the elector of Saxony, prepared a creed to be used as
                    a basis of negotiations. This was submitted to the princes and theologians
                    assembled at Smalkald, and was in substance adopted by them. It is called the
                    Smalkald Articles, and is important because in its statement of the doctrine of

                    meet on German soil. The emperor, alarmed at the progress of Protestantism, and
                    at the united front shown by German Protestants, and troubled by the refusal of
                    the pope to consent to a council to be held out of Italy, strove to bring
                    Protestants and Roman Catholics together by means of religious conferences. The
                    first of these, held at Hagenau, came to nothing. Next year (1541) the
                    conference was renewed at Worms, when the Roman Catholic party promised reforms
                    on condition that the Protestants first submitted to the pope. This condition
                    could not be accepted. Representatives met the same year at Ratisbon, and here
                    the conference was wrecked on the doctrine of transubstantiation, but the diet
                    renewed the terms of the edict of Nuremberg of 1532—the Ratisbon Interim. It was
                    felt by all parties that this provisional state of matters must come to an end
                    some time, and that the Protestants must either be allowed to have their own way
                    or win it by fighting. The emperor was not ready for war, and at the diet at
                    Spires in 1544 it was agreed that the Protestants were to maintain their rights
                    until a general council met. Whatever hopes they might have from such a council
                    were soon dissipated. The council of Trent was opened that year, and its
                    earliest acts were to refuse to pass the conciliatory measures proposed by some
                    of the liberal Roman Catholics. The emperor still temporized and promised
                    reforms, if not by a council then by a national assembty, and many of the
                    Protestants, Luther among them, still hoped that matters might settle themselves
                    without civil war. This hope inspired what was called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Wittenberg Deformation,</hi> a document setting forth how near the
                    evangelical church might approach the Roman Catholic and still retain the truths
                    it had upheld. The year 1546 began, however, with unmistakable indications that
                    Charles was now ready to strike a decisive blow.</p>
                <p>Luther had been suffering much during the last few years, and he felt his end to
                    be near. In the month of January 1546 he undertook a journey to Eisleben in very
                    inclement weather, in order to restore peace in the family of the counts of
                    Mansfeld; he caught a violent cold, but preached four times, and took all the
                    time an active part in the work of conciliation. On the 17th of February he felt
                    that his release was at hand; and at Eisleben, where he was born, he died, in
                    faith and prayer, on the following day. Nothing can be more edifying than the
                    scene presented by the last days of Luther, of which we have the most authentic
                    and detailed accounts. When dying, he collected his last strength and offered up
                    the following prayer:—“Heavenly Father, eternal, merciful God, thou hast
                    revealed to me Thy dear Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Him I have taught, Him I
                    have confessed, Him I love as my Saviour and Redeemer, whom the wicked
                    persecute, dishonour, and reprove. Take my poor soul up to Thee !” Then two of
                    his friends put to him the solemn question,— “Reverend Father, do you die in
                    Christ and in the doctrine you have constantly preached!” He answered by an
                    audible and joyful “Yes”; and, repeating the verse, “Father, into thy hands I
                    commend my spirit,” he expired peacefully, without a struggle, on the 18th of
                    February 1546, at four o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>The books on the life and work of Luther are so very numerous that it is
                    impossible to do more than mention one or two. The best editions of Luther’s
                    works are (1) the Wittenberg, 1539-58, 19 vols, folio (7 in Latin and 12 in
                    German; Melanchthon wrote the prefaces, and inserted a life of Luther in the
                    beginning of the 2d vol.); (2) Walch’s edition, 24 vols. 4to, 1740-53; (3) the
                    Erlangen edition, 65 vols, and 2 vols, of indices, in all 67 vols., in German,
                    and 33 vols, in Latin, and not yet complete, 1826-73; (4) the last edition is
                    from Frankfort-on-the-Main, publishing at the expense of the Prussian
                    Government.</p>
