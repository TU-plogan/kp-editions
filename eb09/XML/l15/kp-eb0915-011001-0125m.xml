                    Rhone and the Saône, in 45° 46' N. lat. and 4° 49' 19" E. long., at an altitude
                    above the sea varying from 540 to rather more than 1000 feet. The population of
                    the city and liberties in 1876 was 342,815. The rivers, both flowing south, are
                    separated by the hill of Croix-Rousse. On the right the Saône is bordered by the
                    scarped heights of Fourvières, St Irénée, and Ste Foy, leaving room only for the
                    quaysand one or two narrow streets; this is the oldest part of the city. Where
                    it enters Lyons the Saône has on its right the faubourg of Vaise and on its left
                    that of</p>
                <p>Serin, whence the ascent is made to the top of the hill of Croix-Rousse. The
                    river next takes a semicircular sweep around the hill of Fourvières (410 feet
                    above it), which is fully occupied by convents, hospitals, and seminaries, and
                    has at its summit the famous church, the resort of 1,500,000 pilgrims annually.
                    From this point the best view of the entire city is obtained. First the busy
                    Saône is seen with its thirteen bridges and animated quays. Next, on the
                    peninsula between the two rivers at the foot of the hill of Croix-Rousse, come
                    the principal quarters of the town: the Terreaux, containing the hôtel de ville,
                    the prefecture, and the chief commercial establishments; Bellecour with its
                    large open square, one of the finest in Europe; and the aristocratic Quartier de
                    Perrache. The Rhone and Saône formerly met here, till, a hundred years ago, the
                    sculptor Perrache reclaimed from the rivers the quarter which bears his name; on
                    the peninsula thus formed stands the principal railway station. Here too are the
                    docks of the Saône, factories, the arsenal, gas-works, prisons, and the
                    slaughter-house.</p>

                <p>The Rhone, less confined than the Saône, flows swiftly in a wide channel, broken
                    when the water is low in spring by pebbly islets. On the right hand it skirts
                    first St Clair, sloping upwards to Croix-Rousse, and then the districts of
                    Terreaux, Bellecour, and Perrache; on the left it has a low-lying plain, subject
                    to disastrous inundations, occupied by the Parc de la Tête d’Or and the quarters
                    of Brotteaux and Guillotière. The park, defended by the Grand Camp embankment,
                    comprises 282 acres, and contains a zoological collection, botanical and
                    pharmaceutical gardens, and the finest greenhouses in France, with unique
                    collections of orchids, palm-trees, and <hi rend="italic">Cycadaceae.</hi>
                    Brotteaux is a modern town with boulevards and regular streets, and in this
                    direction Lyons is extending every year. In the old districts there is no room
                    for growth; they are crowded with old buildings of eight or ten stories, or even
                    more, and it has been the task of the last thirty years to open them up by means
                    of thoroughfares. Guillotière, to the south, is a workmen’s quarter of wretched
                    houses.</p>
                <p>The Rhone is lined with broad quays, and crossed by ten fine bridges, two of them
                    for railway traffic. On the right bank stand the lycée and the public library,
                    the Hôtel Dieu, the military hospital, and the Hospice de la Charité; on the
                    left bank is the long range occupied by the medical faculty. In the east of
                    Guillotière the Geneva railway skirts the artillery barracks.</p>
                <p>Northward from Fourvières appear the green slopes of Mont d’Or, descending
                    towards the Saône by pleasant glades sprinkled with villas; to the east, beyond
                    the somewhat monotonous plain, stretch the mountains of Savoy and Dauphiné; to
                    the south, below the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône, the river traverses
                    a rich landscape to pass out of sight at the foot of Mont Pilat; and to the west
                    the horizon is bounded by the Forez hills.</p>
                <p>Since 1852 the communes of Croix-Rousse and Guillotière have been united with
                    Lyons. The Rhone and the old fortifications, which, on the right bank of the
                    Saône, stretched in an unbroken line from the rock of Pierre Seize below Vaise
                    to the bridge of Ainay, continued by those now replaced by the Croix-Rousse
                    boulevard, marked the boundaries of the ancient city. The line of Croix-Rousse
                    has now been thrown forward to the north, and further strengthened by Forts
                    Caluire and Montessuy. On the left bank of the Rhone stand Forts Tête d’Or,
                    Charpennes, Brotteaux and Part-Dieu, Villeurbanne, Lamotte, Colombier, and
                    Vitriolerie. On the right bank of the Saône Forts Ste Foy, St Irénée, Loyasse,
                    Vaise, and Duchère completed the defensive system of Lyons previous to 1870; but
                    since that date the dominant points of the neighbourhood have begun to be
                    crowned with batteries and redoubts; but only Forts Brou and Feyzin on the left
                    bank of the Rhone, St Genis on the right bank, Mont Verdun on Mont d’Or, and
                    Vencia are finished.</p>
                <p>Of the ancient buildings in Lyons, Fourvières is the one which attracts most
                    visitors. It derives its name from the ancient forum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Porum</hi><hi rend="italic">vetus),</hi> whose site it occupies. The first
                    chapel, dedicated to the Virgin, was erected in the end of the 9th century.
                    Consecrated afterwards to St Thomas of Canterbury, and then made a collegiate
                    church, Notre Dame de Fourvières was created superior of twenty-five villages by
                    Louis XL, on occasion of his visit in 1476. Laid waste by the Protestants,
                    plundered at the Revolution, it began to be visited again in 1804, and in 1805
                    Pope Pins VII., returning from the coronation of Napoleon, ascended thither to
                    give his benediction to the city—a ceremony renewed from year to year with great
                    pomp. The church tower, 172 feet high, is surmounted by a statue of the Virgin
                    in gilded bronze, 18 feet high, turned towards the town; on the pedestal are
                    bronze plates with inscriptions assigning to the Virgin the credit of ending the
                    plague of 1643, and of preserving the town during the cholera epidemics of 1832,
                    1835, and 1850. The first stone of a magnificent new church was laid in 1872.
                    The crypt, 219 feet by 62, is as yet the only portion finished. At the foot of
                    Fourvières, on the right bank of the Saône, lies the metropolitan church of St
                    John (the archbishop of Lyons is primate of all Gaul). The choir belongs to the
                    early years, the transept to the close of the 12th century; the building of the
                    nave, carried on during the next three hundred years, was completed only in
                    1480. In one of the two towers there is a bell weighing nearly 10 tons. To the
                    right and left of the altar stand two crosses preserved since the council of
                    1274 as a symbol of the union then agreed upon between the Greek and Latin
                    Churches. St Martin d’Ainay, in the Perrache quarter, is the oldest church in
                    Lyons, dating from the beginning of the 6th century; the chapels of the apse are
                    adorned by paintings by Flandrin. St Nizier, in the heart of the city, was the
                    first cathedral of Lyons; and the crypt in which St Pothinus officiated still
                    exists. The present church is a Gothic edifice of the 15th century, with the
                    exception of the porch, constructed by Philibert Delorme. In the crypt of the
                    church of St Irenaeus are the tomb of that saint and a vast quantity of bones,
                    alleged to be those of 19,000 martyrs put to death in the persecution of
                    Severus. The Place Bellecour is adorned west and east by two monumental façades
                    briginally erected after plans by Mansard, but destroyed in 1793, and rebuilt
                    under the consulate in a somewhat modified style. In the middle stands an
                    equestrian statue of Louis XIV. by Lemot. The Rue de I’Hotel de Ville,
                    connecting the Place Bellecour and the Place des Terreaux, and the Rue de la
                    Republique running parallel with it are among the finest streets of the modern
                    city. The east side of the Place des Terreaux (so called from the “terreaux” now
                    occupying the place of the canal which formerly connected the Rhone and the
                    Saône) is formed by the hôtel de ville, which, however, turns a better front in
                    the opposite direction towards the theatre; the south is occupied by the Palais
                    St Pierre (formerly a convent), which gives accommodation to the faculties of
                    science and literature, and to the school of fine arts, the picture gallery, the
                    museums of sculpture, archaeology and natural history, and the art library. In
                    the Rue de la Republique, between Place de la Bourse and Place des Cordeliers,
                    each of which contains one of its highly ornamented fronts, stands the building
                    occupied by the exchange and the commercial court. The former has its offices on
                    the ground floor round the central glass-roofed hall; besides the court, the
                    upper stories accommodate the council of prud’hommes, the chamber of commerce,
                    and the industrial museum. The palais de justice, a fine building with a
                    Corinthian colonnade, on the right bank of the Saône, occupies the site of the
                    palace of the counts of Forez. A statue of Jacquart the inventor stands in Place
                    Sathonay, and one of Marshal Suchet in Place Tholozan.</p>
                <p>The Academy of Lyons has the five faculties of Catholic theology, science,
                    literature, medicine and pharmacy, and law, with two lyceums, and a number of
                    schools; and the Catholic institute has three faculties—law, science, and
                    theology. The school of fine arts was founded in the 18th century to train
                    competent designers for the textile manufactures, but has also done much for
                    painting and sculpture. The veterinary school of Lyons, instituted in 1761, was
                    the first of its kind in Europe; its laboratory for the study of comparative
                    physiology is admirably equipped. L’École la Martinière (founded by the legacy
                    of Claude Martin) furnishes gratuitous teaching of the sciences and industrial
                    arts. The school of commerce and the Lyons central school complete the list of
                    institutions for industrial education.</p>

                <p>Besides the Académie des Sciences, Belles Lettres, et Arts (founded in 1700),
                    Lyons possesses societies of agriculture, natural history, useful arts and
                    sciences, geography, and horticulture.</p>
                <p>The Hôtel Dieu, instituted in the beginning of the 6th century by King
                    Childebert, is still one of the chief establishments of its kind in the city,
                    and contains 929 beds. Its façade, fronting the Quai du Rhone for 1060 feet, was
                    commenced according to the designs of Soufflot, architect of the Pantheon at
                    Paris. The Hospice de la Charité and the military hospital are a little larger
                    than the Hôtel Dieu. The Hospice de l’Antiquaille, at Fourvières (2000 beds),
                    occupies the site of the ancient palace of the praetorian prefects, in which
                    Germanicus, Claudius, and Caracalla were born. Lyons has many other benevolent
                    institutions, and is also the centre of the operations of the Propagation de la
                    Foi.</p>
                <p>The museum is one of the best provincial collections in France, alike in its
                    ancient, mediaeval, and modern departments. Among the Gallo-Roman inscriptions,
                    in which it is particularly rich, are the bronze tables discovered at Lyons in
                    1528, which contain the speech of the emperor Claudius in regard to the
                    admission of the citizens of Gallia Comata into the Roman senate. The numismatic
                    collection (30,000 pieces) includes a series of the coins struck at Lyons from
                    43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 1857. There is a special gallery of works
                    of Lyonese painters; and the Bernard collection of about 300 pictures is kept
                    entire.</p>
                <p>The museum of natural history (for which a new building is to be erected in the
                    Parc de la Tête d’Or) contains a zoological department ranking next to that of
                    Paris, and mineralogical, geological, and anthropological sections— the last
                    enriched with specimens from the classic site of Solutré (Saône and Loire). The
                    museum of art and industries, founded in 1864 by the chamber of commerce, is
                    divided into three sections, the first intended to illustrate the various
                    conceptions of the beautiful formed by different peoples, the second to show the
                    whole method of the textile industry, and the third to give an historical
                    conspectus of woven textures. The Guimet Museum, in a special building in the
                    Tête d’Or, consists of objects brought from the extreme East (mainly by M. Emile
                    Guimet) and designed to facilitate the comparative study of religions,
                    especially those of the Eastern world. Since 1880 the institution has published
                    its <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> consisting of original essays or
                    translations of foreign works.</p>
                <p>The library of the school of arts contains 65,000 volumes and 22,000 engravings,
                    and the town library 108,000 volumesand 1300 manuscripts,—about 600 of the
                    printed works being incunabula, and 25 of the MSS. belonging to the Carlovingian
                    period. In the latter institution is the great terrestrial globe made at Lyons
                    in 1701, indicating the great African lakes, the rediscovery of which has been
                    one of the events of the present century.</p>
                <p>Under the Romans Lyons was admirably provided with water. Three ancient aqueducts
                    on the Fourvières level, from Montroman, Mont d’Or, and Mont Pilat, can still be
                    traced; and the last was no less than 52 miles long, and capable of supplying
                    11,000,000 gallons per day. Magnificent remains of this work may be seen at St
                    Irénée and Chaponost. Traces also exist along the Rhone of a subterranean canal
                    conveying the water of the river to a naumachia. At present the water supply of
                    Lyons is obtained from the Rhone by powerful hydraulic engines situated above
                    the town, which raise the water to the Montessuyand the Fourvières plateaus, 456
                    feet above the low level of the river. The reservoirs are capable of supplying
                    1,765,829 cubic feet of water per day.</p>
                <p>Agrippa made Lyons the starting-point of the principal Roman roads throughout
                    Gaul; and it still remains an important centre in the general system of
                    communication. The Saône above the town and the Rhone below have large barge and
                    steamboat traffic; and the latter river above the town may be used by steamboats
                    during summer as far as Aix in Savoy. Navigation, however, is often interrupted,
                    even below the town, by the lowness of the water, and a canal is projected to
                    remedy this defect. The current of the Saône is less rapid than that of the
                    Rhone, and is controlled by weirs.</p>
                <p>The railway from Paris to Marseilles has two stations (Vaise and Perrache) in
                    Lyons; and the line from Lyons to Geneva two (Brotteaux and St Clair). The
                    Montbrison line starts from St Paul, on the right of the Saône. The terminus of
                    Part-Dieu for the newly-opened East of Lyons line is between Perrache and
                    Brotteaux. Within the town there are two rope railways,—the first mounting to
                    Fourvières, and the second, popularly called the <hi rend="italic">ficelle,</hi>
                    from Rue Terme to Croix-Rousse.</p>
                <p>In a city of such importance as Lyons the number of industries is naturally
                    large, but by far the most extensive of them all is the silk manufacture.
                    Derived from Italy, this industry rapidly developed under the patronage of
                    Francis I., Henry II., and Henry IV.; and from time to time new kinds of fabrics
                    were invented—silk stuffs woofed with wool or with gold and silver threads,
                    shawls, watered silks, poplins, velvets, satinades, moires, Arc. In the
                    beginning of the present century Jacquart introduced his famous loom by which a
                    single workman was enabled to produce elaborate fabrics as easily as the
                    plainest web, and by changing the “cartoons” to make the most different textures
                    on the same looms. In the 17th century the silk manufacture employed at Lyons
                    9000 to 12,000 looms. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes the number
                    sank to 3000 or 4000; but after the Reign of Terror was past it rose again about
                    1801 to 12,000. At present there are about 70,000 in operation when no great
                    commercial crisis comes to diminish production, giving employment to about
                    140,000 weavers. There are also a large number of persons engaged in the
                    silk-worm hatcheries established in I’rance. The workmen live for the most part
                    in the Croix-Rousse quarter, but many of them inhabit the outskirts. The mean
                    annual value of the silk goods manufactured is estimated at 375,000,000 francs
                    (£15,000,000),—250,000,000 representing the value of the raw material and
                    125,000,000 the value of the labour. Including the purchase of raw materials and
                    the sale of the manufactured goods, the silk trade gives a total turnover of
                    1000 million francs (£40,000,000). A special office (known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >La</hi><hi rend="italic">Condition</hi><hi rend="italic">des Soies)</hi>
                    determines the weight and nature of the silk. Extensive dye-works, chemical
                    works, breweries, pork factories, engineering works, printing establishments,
                    and hat factories represent the secondary industries of the place. A large trade
                    is carried on in chestnuts brought from the neighbouring departments, and known
                    as <hi rend="italic">marrons</hi><hi rend="italic">de Lyon.</hi></p>
                <p>The earliest Gallic occupants of the territory at the confluence of the Rhone and
                    the Saône were the Segusians. In 59 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> some Greek
                    refugees from the banks of the Hérault, having obtained permission of the
                    natives to establish themselves beside the Croix Rousse, called their new town
                    by the Gallic name Lugdunum; and in 43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Munatius
                    Plancus brought a Roman colony to Fourvières from Vienne. This settlement soon
                    acquired importance, and was made by Agrippa the starting point of four great
                    roads. Augustus, besides building aqueducts, temples, and a theatre, gave it a
                    senate and made it the seat of an annual assembly of deputies from the sixty
                    cities of Gallia Comata. Under the emperors the colony of Forum Vetus and the
                    municipium of Lugdunum were united, receiving the/ws <hi rend="italic"
                    >scηαtus.</hi> The town was burnt by Nero in 59 A.τ&gt;., and afterwards rebuilt
                    by him in a much finer style; it was also adorned by Trajan, Adrian, and
                    Antoninus. The martyrdom of Pothinus and Blandina occurred under Marcus Aurelius
                    (177 A.τ&gt;.), and in 197 a still more savage persecution of the Christians
                    took place under Septimius Severus, in which Irenaeus, according to <pb

                    by the barbarians and abandoned by the empire, Lyons in 478 became capital of
                    the kingdom of the Burgundians. It afterwards fell into the hands of the Franks,
                    and suffered severely from the Saracens, but revived under Charlemagne, and
                    after the death of Charles the Bald was made the capital of the kingdom of
                    Provence. From 1024 it was a fief of the emperor of Germany. Subsequently the
                    superioιity over the town was a subject of dispute between the archbishops of
                    Lyons and the counts of Forez; but the royal supremacy was finally established
                    under Louis IX. and Philip the Handseme. The citizens were constituted into a
                    commune ruled by freely elected consuls (1320). In the 13th century two
                    ecclesiastical councils were held at Lyons—one in 1245, presided over by
                    Innocent 1V., at which the emperor Fre&lt;leriek II. was deposed; the second,
                    the oecumenical, under the presidency of Gregory X., in 1274, at which five
                    hundred bishops met. Pope Clement V. was crowned here in 1305, and his successor
                    John XXII. elected in 1316. The Protestants obtained possession of the place in
                    1562; their acts of violence were fiercely avenged in 1572 after the St
                    Bartholomew massacre. Under Henry III. Lyons sided with the League; but it
                    pronounced in favour of Henry IV. In 1793 it rose against the Convention, but
                    was compelled to yield to the army of the republic after enduring a siege of
                    seven weeks (October 10). Terrible chastisement ensued: the name of Lyons was
                    changed to that of Ville-affr anchie; thedenroli-tion of its buildings was set
                    about on a wholesale scale; and vast numbers of the proscribed, whom the
                    scaffold had spared, were butchered with grape shot. The town resumed its old
                    name after the fall of Robespierre, and the terrorists in their turn were
                    drowned in large numbers in the Rhone. Napoleon rebuilt the Place Bellecour,
                    reopened the churches, and made the bridge of Tilsitt over the Saône between
                    Bellecour and the cathedral. In 1814-15 Lyons was occupied by the Austrians,
                    under the government of Louis Philippe, and in 1870-71 there were several bloody
                    émeutes; in 1856 a disastrous flood laid waste the Brotteaux and rendered 20,000
                    persons homeless. An international exhibition was held here in 1872. Among the
                    many distinguished natives of Lyons may be mentioned Germanicus and the emperors
                    Claudius, Marcus Aurelius, and Caracalla; Ampère the physicist; Richerand,
                    Récamier, and Bonnet; De Jussieu the naturalist, J. B. Say the economist, Barème
                    the mathematician, Suchet the marshal, Roland the Girondin, and Jacquard the
                    inventor. (G. ME.)</p>
