                    rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> (1797-1875), one of the greatest of geological
                    thinkers, was the eldest son of Charles Lyell of Kinnordy, Forfarshire, and was
                    born November 14, 1797, on the family estate in Scotland. His father wasa man of
                    literary and scientific tastes, known both as a botanist and as the translator
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Convitο</hi>
                    of Dante. From his boyhood Lyell had a strong inclination for natural history,
                    especially entomology, a taste which he was able to cultivate in the New Forest,
                    to which his family had removed soon after his birth. He was educated chiefly at
                    Midhurst, and then at Exeter College, Oxford, where the lectures of Dr Buckland
                    first opened out to him that field of geological study which became the passion
                    of his life. After taking his degree in 1821, he entered Lincoln’s Inn, and in
                    1825, after a delay caused by chronic weakness of the eyes, he was called to the
                    bar, and went on the western circuit for two years. During the whole of this
                    time, though not neglecting his profession, he was slowly gravitating towards
                    the life of a student of science. In 1819 he had been elected a member of the
                    Linnean and Geological Societies, communicating his first paper, “On the Marls
                    of Forfarshire,” to the latter society in 1822, and acting as one of the
                    honorary secretaries in 1823. In that year he went to France, with introductions
                    to Cuvier, Humboldt, and other men of science, and in 1824 made a geological
                    tour in Scotland in company with Dr Buckland. In 1826 he was elected a fellow of
                    the Royal Society, from which in later years he received both the Copley and
                    Royal medals; and in 1827 he finally abandoned the legal profession, and devoted
                    himself to geology.</p>
                <p>Long prior to this, however, he had already begun the sketch of his principal
                    work, <hi rend="italic">The Principles of Geology.</hi> The subsidiary title,
                    “An Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the Earth’s Surface by Reference to
                    Causes now in Operation,” gives the keynote of the task to which Lyell devoted
                    his life, and in pursuance of which he made geological tours over large portions
                    of the Continent, and in later years to Madeira and to the United States and
                    Canada. The journey undertaken with Murchison in 1828 was especially fruitful in
                    results, for not only did it give rise to two joint papers on the volcanic
                    district of Auvergne and the Tertiary formations of Aix-en-Provence, but it was
                    apparently while examining Signor Bonelli’s collection of Tertiary shells at
                    Turin, and subsequently when (after parting with Murchison) he studied the
                    marine remains of the Tertiary rocks of Ischia and Sicily, that Lyell conceived
                    the idea of dividing the Tertiaries into three or four principal groups,
                    characterized by the proportion of recent to extinct species of shells. To these
                    groups, after consulting Dr Whewell as to the best nomenclature, he gave the
                    names now universally adopted—Eocene <hi rend="italic">(dawn of recent},</hi>
                    Miocene <hi rend="italic">(less of recent),</hi> and Pliocene <hi rend="italic"
                    >(7nore of recent}</hi> Upper and Lower; and with the assistance of M. Deshayes,
                    who had arrived by independent researches at very similar views, he drew up a
                    table of shells in illustration of this classification. The first volume of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Principles of Geology</hi> appeared in 1830, and the second in
                    January 1832. Received at first with considerable opposition, at least so far as
                    its leading theory was concerned, the work had ultimately a great success, and
                    it had already reached a second edition in 1833 when the third volume, dealing
                    with the successive formations of the earth’s crust, was added.<note

                    editions of this work were published, each so much enriched with new material
                    and the results of riper thought as to form a complete history of the progress
                    of geology during that interval. Only a few days before his death Sir Charles
                    finished revising the 12th edition, which appeared in 1876.</p></note></p>
                <p>In August 1838 Lyell published the <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geology,</hi>
                    which, from being originally an expansion of the fourth book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles,</hi> became a standard work of reference in
                    stratigraphical and palaeontological geology. This book went through six
                    editions in Lyell’s lifetime (some intermediate ones being styled <hi
                    rend="italic">Manual of Elementary Geology},</hi> and in 1871 a smaller work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Student's Elements of Geology,</hi> was based upon it. His
                    third great work, <hi rend="italic">The Antiquity of Man,</hi> appeared in 1863,
                    and ran through three editions in one year. In this he laid before the world a
                    general survey of the arguments for man’s early appearance on the earth, derived
                    from the discoveries of worked flint implements in Post-Pliocene strata in the
                    Somme valley and elsewhere, and in it also he first gave in his adhesion to
                    Darwin’s theory of the origin of species. A fourth edition appeared in 1873.</p>
                <p>While thus occupied with his writings, Lyell lost no opportunity of carrying out
                    original investigations, and whenever absent from his literary work in London
                    was always to be heard of in the field either in England or on the Continent. In
                    1831 he held for a short time the post of professor of geology at King’s
                    College, London, and delivered while there a highly appreciated course of
                    lectures, which became the foundation of the <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Geology.</hi> In 1832 he married Mary, eldest daughter of Leonard Horner, who
                    became thenceforward associated with him in all his literary and scientific
                    labours, aiding him substantially with her ready intellect, and by her
                    pre-eminent social qualities making his home a centre of attraction to all men
                    of talent. In 1834 he made an excursion to Denmark and Sweden, the result of
                    which was his celebrated paper to the Royal Society, “On the Proofs of the
                    Gradual Rising of Land in Certain Parts of Sweden,” and another to the
                    Geological Society, “On the Cretaceous and Tertiary Strata of Seeland and Möen.”
                    In 1837 he was again in Norway and Denmark, and in 1841 he spent a year in
                    travelling through the United States, Canada, and Nova Scotia. This last
                    journey, together with a second one to America in 1845, when he visited Boston,
                    Philadelphia, New Orleans, and the alluvial plain of the Mississippi, gave rise,
                    not only to numerous original papers, but also to the publication of two works
                    not exclusively geological, <hi rend="italic">Travels in North America</hi>
                    (1845) and <hi rend="italic">A Second Visit to the United States</hi> (1849). In
                    the second work especially he did much to promote good feeling between England
                    and America, by showing a just appreciation of American society and
                    institutions. It was in the course of these journeys that he estimated the rate
                    of recession of the falls of Niagara, and of the annual average accumulation of
                    alluvial matter in the delta of the Mississippi, and studied those vegetable
                    accumulations in the “Great Dismal Swamp” of Virginia, which he afterwards used
                    in illustrating the formation of beds of coal. He also studied with great care
                    the coal-formations in Nova Scotia, and discovered in company with Dr Dawson of
                    Montreal the earliest known land shell, <hi rend="italic">Pupa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vetusta,</hi> in the hollow stem of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sigillaria.</hi> But it was chiefly in bringing a thorough knowledge of
                    European geology to bear upon the more widely extended and massive formations of
                    the North American continent that Lyell rendered immense service to geologists
                    on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
                <p>Besides these Transatlantic journeys Lyell undertook geological excursions at
                    different times to all parts of the British Isles, to Belgium, Switzerland,
                    Germany, Spain, Madeira, and Teneriffe, in which latter islands, which he
                    visited in company with G. Hartung, he accumulated much valuable evidence on the
                    age and deposition of lava-beds and the formation of volcanic cones. He also
                    revisited Sicily in 1858, when he made such observations upon the structure of
                    Etna as entirely refuted the theory of “craters of elevation” upheld by Von Buch
                    and Elie de Beaumont (see <hi rend="italic">Roy. Soc. Proc.,</hi> 1859).</p>

                <p>Lyell received the honour of knighthood in 1848, and was created a baronet in
                    1864, in which year he was president of the British Association, meeting at
                    Bath. His services to the science of geology were now universally recognized
                    both at home and abroad, and he was a member of almost every Continental and
                    American Society. He was elected corresponding member of the French Institute
                    and of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was created a knight of the
                    Prussian Order of Merit.</p>
                <p>During the latter years of his life his sight, always weak/failed him altogether,
                    and he became very feeble. He died on February 22, 1875, in his seventy-eighth
                    year, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His funeral was attended by an
                    immense concourse of public men, all his personal friends; for by young and old
                    the veteran master of geology was deeply loved and revered. His gentle nature,
                    his intense love of truth, his anxiety to help and encourage those who
                    cultivated his favourite science, endeared him to all who approached him; while
                    the extreme freshness of his mind kept him free from that dogmatism which is so
                    often the accompaniment of old age, and enabled him to accept and appreciate
                    heartily the work of younger men.</p>
                <p>In order to appreciate justly the influence of Lyell’s works upon the geology of
                    the 19th century, it is necessary to bear in mind what was the state of
                    knowledge upon this subject at the time when he entered the field in 1822. The
                    rival schools of Werner and Hutton were then at the height of their famous
                    contest, and, while the vehement discussions between the Neptunists and
                    Vulcanists gave an impetus to the study of rock-masses, the one true principle
                    upon which Hutton himself had so strongly insisted had dropped into oblivion,
                    namely, that “in examining things present we have data from which to reason with
                    regard to what has been,” and that therefore we have no need to imagine other
                    causes than those now in action to account for the past. Meanwhile a reaction
                    against the speculative discussions which had so long occupied the world
                    inclined many of the leaders of geological study to confine themselves to the
                    collection of facts, and the science became for a time a mere branch of
                    mineralogy, which, though most valuable in laying a true foundation, was quite
                    inadequate to deal with the earth’s history, since it took little or no account
                    of organic remains, and their real significance was not in the least understood.
                    Both in England and France, however, materials were being accumulated which
                    prepared the way for a wider basis. In 1799 William Smith, travelling over
                    England, first grouped the formations according to the fossils contained in
                    them, and in 1815 he published his geological map of England, thus making the
                    first step in stratigraphical geology; and almost simultaneously, in 1812,
                    Cuvier’s restorations of the extinct mammalia of the Paris basin, and Lamarck’s
                    classification of recent and fossil shells, gave the first impulse to
                    palaeontology. But the older schools of geologists, hampered by preconceived
                    theories, were not prepared to make full use of the new facts. Cuvier himself,
                    while insisting on the value of fossils in the chronology of the earth, yet
                    retained all the old notions of sudden and violent convulsions, attributing the
                    destruction of the fauna of the Paris basin to the deluge, or to the bursting of
                    lakes caused by a sudden revolution of the globe; and in like manner Buckland,
                    Sedgwick, and their compeers still explained everything by the diluvial theory,
                    attributing the erratic blocks strewn over the Continent to the universal
                    deluge, and accepting as demonstrated Elie de Beaumont’s theory of the sudden
                    elevation of mountain chains. Sedgwick in his address to the Geological Society
                    in 1834 even spoke confidently of the extinct forms in geological strata as
                    “indications of change and of an adjusting power altogether different from what
                    we commonly understand by the laws of nature.”</p>
                <p>To shake off the influence of preconceived opinions such as these there was
                    needed a fresh impartial mind capable of appreciating the evidence which had
                    been accumulating during the past thirty years, and especially alive to the
                    discoveries of palaeontology. These requisites were found in Lyell. His early
                    study of natural history gave him advantages possessed by few of his
                    contemporaries, while the clear insight and calm judgment for which he was thus
                    early remarkable led him alone of the younger school of geologists to grasp the
                    truth enunciated by Hutton of the power of gradual changes to produce great
                    results if only time enough be allowed. This truth he illustrated with such a
                    wealth of facts, derived from his own observation and that of others, that in
                    the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principles</hi> we find sketched in
                    broad outline, and demonstrated by actual examples, nearly all those fundamental
                    truths which, though often vehemently opposed at the time, have now become so
                    much the accepted basis of geology that it is difficult to realize how novel
                    they were in 1830.</p>
                <p>Even the opening historical chapters cut boldly at the root of catastrophic
                    geology by showing how the prejudices concerning the short duration of past time
                    on the globe had led men to the mistaken conclusion that “centuries were implied
                    where the characters imported thousands, and thousands where the language of
                    nature signified millions”; and the arguments for the uniform action of nature
                    followed with overwhelming force, as Lyell proceeded to lay under contribution
                    all countries of the world to show how the face of the earth is now being
                    altered by rivers, torrents, springs, currents and tides, volcanoes and
                    earthquakes.</p>
                <p>In the second volume the changes in the organic world were used to teach the same
                    lesson. The proofs of extinction of specific forms in historical times were
                    accumulated to explain that the presence of extinct forms in geological
                    formations was the effect of gradual causes and not of sudden and violent
                    catastrophes, while the tranquil imbedding of organic remains now in progress
                    was used to strengthen the previous argument derived from inorganic causes for
                    the slow and gradual accumulation of fossiliferous strata. It was in this volume
                    that Lyell made in 1830 his celebrated attack upon Lamarck’s theory of the
                    transmutation of species, and, though this has often been held as a want of
                    appreciation on his part of the arguments of the great naturalist, yet, as we
                    shall see presently, it was really a curious illustration of the impartiality of
                    Lyell’s mind (though acting under what he himself would have called the
                    influence of “inherited belief”) that this theory, so eminently calculated to
                    harmonize with his own views of the power of minute causes to work appreciable
                    change, was rejected by him because it rested upon an assumption of a law of
                    innate progressive development, which could not be shown to be in accordance
                    with natural facts.</p>
                <p>The third volume of the <hi rend="italic">Principles,</hi> which did not appear
                    till two years later, completed the task which Lyell had set himself, by
                    interpreting the fragmentary record which remains to us of the successive
                    geological formations of the earth’s crust with their imbedded remains and the
                    associated volcanic rocks, and thus restoring as far as possible the past
                    history of the earth. Through all its successive editions this volume has
                    remained the standard text-book of geological history, as its two predecessors
                    have of the philosophical principles of the science.</p>
                <p>So immediate was the effect of this remarkable work that from the time of its
                    publication the earlier cosmogonies disappeared from the field, and even
                    Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Earth</hi> never reached another
                    edition. Yet, although geologists began insensibly to follow the lines which
                    Lyell had marked out, they were long in receiving the principles upon which
                    these were founded. Sedgwick, in the address already quoted, while pronouncing a
                    eulogy on the book as a whole, regretted that “from the very title-page of his
                    work Mr Lyell seems to stand forward as the champion of a great leading doctrine
                    of the Huttonian hypothesis,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the explanation of
                    former changes by reference to causes now in operation; and Lyell’s oldest
                    friend and fellow-labourer Murchison remained to the last the exponent of the
                    converse truth, that we have no evidence forbidding the possibility of a greater
                    intensity of the forces in action during past periods. This form of catastrophic
                    geology has indeed always prevailed upon the Continent, and still does so in a
                    great degree. There is, however, nothing necessarily antagonistic in the two
                    theories; and, if Lyell in his earlier years accentuated perhaps somewhat too
                    strongly the necessity for making unlimited drafts upon the “bank of time,” as
                    he often called it, to the exclusion of intensified volcanic or aqueous action,
                    it was because he had to combat the opposite and deeply rooted error.</p>
                <p>Between the year 1853, when the 9th edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles</hi> was published, and 1863, when he “read his recantation,” as he
                    himself would sometimes express it, in the <hi rend="italic">Antiquity of
                    Man,</hi> the discovery of the flint implements associated with bones of extinct
                    mammalia at Abbeville, and subsequently in the valley of the Thames and
                    elsewhere, threw an entirely new light upon the data of human existence upon the
                    earth, allowing far more time for the development of the numerous varieties of
                    mankind than had hitherto been supposed possible. In conjunction with these
                    discoveries came also the evidence adduced by Darwin and Wallace of the action
                    of natural causes in producing modifications in living forms,—thus applying the
                    very same principle to organic life which Hutton and Lyell had used to explain
                    the gradual modification of the earth’s surface. Then it was that L·yell, who
                    had rejected Lamarck’s theory because it rested on a purely imaginary law of
                    innate progressive development, at once accepted “natural selection” as a <hi
                    rend="italic">vera causa</hi> helping to explain those evidences of the gradual
                    change in organic forms presented in successive geological formations. By
                    recognizing the value of the new principle, and incorporating its results in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Principles,</hi> Lyell completed in 1872 in a fuller sense
                    than he had contemplated in 1850 the task of “explaining former changes of the
                    earth’s surface (including the history of its living inhabitants) by reference
                    to causes now in action”; while at the same time he gave to hi⅛ original
                    conception that element of expansion and pliability which <pb break="no"

                    influence and the permanent celebrity of its author.</p>
                <p>Besides his books, Lyell contributed seventy-six geological papers to various
                    societies. The only authorities yet published for his life are Life and Letters
                    of Sir Charles Lyell, 1881, edited by Mrs Lyell, and the obituary notices in
                    1875 at the Royal and other Societies. (A. B. B.)</p>
