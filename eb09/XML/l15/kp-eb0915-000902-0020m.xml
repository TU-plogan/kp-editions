                    duke of Saxony by the emperor Henry V., against whom he afterwards repeatedly
                    rebelled. After the death of Henry V. in 1125, the party which supported
                    imperial in opposition to papal claims wished to grant the crown to Duke
                    Frederick of Swabia, grandson of Henry IV. The papal party, however, headed by
                    Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, managed to secure the election of Lothair, who
                    obtained their favour by making large concessions by which he was afterwards
                    seriously hampered. In 1133 he was crowned emperor in Rome by Innocent II., whom
                    he had supported in a disputed papal election. In later times the church
                    pretended that he had done homage to the pope for the empire, but what he really
                    received in fief was the hereditary territory of the Countess Matilda. Meanwhile
                    he had been engaged in bitter strife with the Hohenstaufen family, from whom he
                    had demanded the allodial lands which they had inherited from the emperor Henry
                    V. Duke Frederick of Swabia, and his brother Conrad, had resisted these
                    pretensions; and Conrad had even been crowned king in Milan. The quarrel was
                    ultimately settled by the lands in dispute being granted in fief to the house of
                    Hohenstaufen. In order to strengthen his position, Lothair had given his
                    daughter Gertrude (a child of eleven) in marriage to Henry the Proud, duke of
                    Bavaria, whom he made also duke of Saxony. Henry was further enriched by
                    receiving the hereditary and imperial territories of the Countess Matilda, so
                    that the Guelphs became by far the most powerful family in the empire. Lothair
                    secured other important adherents by giving North Saxony (afterwards
                    Brandenburg) to Albert the Bear, and Thuringia (which he took from Landgrave
                    Hermann) to Count Louis. In his relations to the neighbouring populations
                    Lothair acted with great vigour. The duke of Bohemia and the duke of Poland were
                    compelled to do homage, and the margraviate of Meissen and the county of
                    Burgundy he gave to two of his supporters, the former to Count Conrad of Wettin,
                    the latter to Duke Conrad of Zähringen. The kingdom of the Abotrites he granted
                    to the Danish king Cnut; and Cnut’s successor Magnus was forced to accept it as
                    a fief of the empire. In 1136 Lothair undertook a second expedition to Italy for
                    the defence of Pope Innocent II. against Roger of Sicily, and after
                    accomplishing his object he died on the 3d of December 1137, in an Alpine hut
                    near Trent, on his way back to Germany. During his reign the papacy gained
                    ground in its rivalry with the empire, but he displayed courage and resource in
                    maintaining the rights of the crown against all his secular opponents.</p>
