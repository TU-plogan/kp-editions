                    born about 396-93 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.</hi> His father was named Lycophron,
                    and he belonged to the old Attic family of the Eteobutadae. He is said to have
                    been a pupil both of Plato and of Isocrates. His early career is quite unknown,
                    but after the real character of the great struggle with Philip of Macedon was
                    becoming manifest he was recognized along with Demosthenes and Hyperides as one
                    of the chiefs of the national party. He left the care of external relations to
                    his colleagues, and devoted himself to the internal organization and the
                    financial administration of the state. He managed the finances of Athens for
                    twelve successive years, being chosen ταμ,iας ττ)ς κοινήν προσόδου, probably, in
                    341 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> for a term of four years, and in the two
                    succeeding terms, when the actual office was forbidden him by law, directing it
                    through a nominal official chosen from his party. Part of one of the deeds in
                    which he rendered account of his term of office is still preserved in an
                    inscription <hi rend="italic">(Corp. Inscr. Gr.,</hi> i. No. 247 <hi
                    rend="italic">; Corp. Inscr. Λtt.,</hi> ii. pt. 2, No. 289). During this time
                    18,900 talents passed through his hands, and he raised the public income to 1200
                    talents yearly. His integrity and his skilful management were highly appreciated
                    by the people, who refused to deliver him up when Alexander the Great demanded
                    his surrender; many private persons deposited money under his charge. He was
                    also appointed to various other offices connected with the preservation and
                    improvement of the city. He was very strict in his superintendence of the public
                    morals, ajιd passed a sumptuary law to restrain extravagance. On the other hand
                    he showed a noble and liberal spirit in all that concerned public expenditure;
                    he did much to beautify and improve the city by fine buildings; and he passed a
                    famous law ordering that statues of the three great tragedians should be
                    erected, and that a careful edition of their tragedies should be made and
                    preserved among the state archives.</p>
                <p>Lycurgus was a man of action and not of words: his orations, of which fifteen
                    were published, are criticized by the ancients for their awkward arrangement of
                    matter, harshness of style, and the tendency to digressions about mythology and
                    past history, while the noble spirit and the lofty morality that breathe through
                    them are highly praised. Only one of the orations, that against Leocrates, has
                    been preserved, and fully bears out the criticism of the ancients. He was
                    evidently one of the last examples of the finest Athenian type—full of religious
                    feeling, as became one of the Eteobutadae·, the family in which the priestlιood
                    of Athene Polias was hereditary, proud of the history and the religion of his
                    country, and resolved to act worthily of it and to make others do the same,
                    severe and stern in his treatment of offenders and frequently prosecuting them
                    in the public courts, but generous and liberal in all that concerned the glory
                    of Athens.</p>
