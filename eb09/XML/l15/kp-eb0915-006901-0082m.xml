                    occupied in the 7th century by the Milcieni, a Slavonic tribe. In the 10th
                    century it was annexed to the German kingdom by the margraves of Meissen, and
                    from this time for several centuries it was called Budissin (Bautzen), from the
                    name of the principal fortress. In the 11th and 12th centuries Budissin changed
                    hands several times, being connected at different periods with Meissen, Poland,
                    and Bohemia. The emperor Frederick I. granted it in 1158 to King Ladislaus of
                    Bohemia, and under him and his immediate successors it was largely colonized by
                    German immigrants. Between 1253 and 1319 it belonged to Brandenburg, to the
                    margrave of which it was given in pledge by Ring Ottocar II. of Bohemia; and in
                    1268 it was divided into an eastern and a western part—Budissin proper and
                    Görlitz. In 1319 Budissin proper was restored to Bohemia, which also recovered
                    Görlitz in 1346. It was during this period that the fortunes of Budissin were
                    associated with those of the country afterwards called Lower Lusatia, but
                    originally Lusatia. It was inhabited by a Slavonic tribe, the Lusici, and
                    reached in the earliest times from the Black Elster to the Spree. The Lusici
                    were conquered by Margrave Gero in 963, and their land was soon formed into a
                    separate march, sometimes attached to, sometimes independent of, the march of
                    Meissen. In 1303 it passed, as Budissin had done, to Brandenburg, and in 1373,
                    after several changes, it fell into the hands of the emperor Charles IV. as king
                    of Bohemia. During the Hussite wars the people of Lusatia and Budissin remained
                    loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, and in 1467 they recognized as their
                    sovereign King Matthias of Hungary. Twenty-three years later they were again
                    united to Bohemia, but in the meantime they had received from the Hungarian
                    Government the names which they have since retained. In the 16th century the
                    Reformation made way rapidly in Lipper Lusatia, and the majority of the people
                    became Protestants. The two countries were «conquered in 1620, with the sanction
                    of Ferdinand II,, by the Saxon elector, John George I., to whom they were ceded
                    in 1635, the emperor as king of Bohemia retaining a certain supremacy for the
                    purpose of guarding the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church. In
                    1815 the whole of Lower Lusatia and the half of Upper Lusatia were transferred
                    from Saxony to Prussia. Lower Lusatia has 395,800 inhabitants, of whom 50,000
                    are Wends; the portion of Upper Lusatia belonging to Prussia has 243,500
                    inhabitants,of whom 32,000 are Wends. There are 300,000 inhabitants, including
                    50,000 Wends, in Saxon Upper Lusatia. Laws relating to Upper Lusatia, which are
                    passed by the Saxon Parliament, must still be .submitted to the Lusatian diet at
                    Bautzen.</p>
