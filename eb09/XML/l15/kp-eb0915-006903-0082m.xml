                    among the Greeks it is not consistently observed. The conception of sin never
                    reached a high moral standard, and the methods of lustration are purely
                    ritualistic. Guilt and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0083-0070"/> impurity arose in various ways; among the Greeks,
                    besides the general idea that man is always in need of purification, the species
                    of guilt most insisted on by religion are incurred by murder, by touching a dead
                    body, by sexual intercourse, and by seeing a prodigy or sign of the divine will.
                    The last three of these spring from the idea that man had been without
                    preparation and in an improper manner brought into communication with God, and
                    was therefore guilty. The first, which involves a really moral idea of _ guilt,
                    is far more important than the others in Hellenic religion. Among the Romans we
                    hear more of the last species of impurity; in general the idea takes the form
                    that after some great disaster the people become convinced that some guilt has
                    been incurred somewhere and must be expiated. The methods of purification
                    consist in ceremonies performed with water, fire, air, or earth, or with a
                    branch of a sacred tree, especially of the laurel, and also in sacrifice and
                    other ceremonial. Before entering a temple the worshipper dipped his hand in the
                    vase of holy water <hi rend="italic">{τrepLppavτηpcov, a(∕ua</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lustralis)</hi> which stood at the door; before a sacrifice
                    bathing was a common kind of purification; salt-water was more efficacious than
                    fresh, and the celebrants of the Eleusinian mysteries bathed in the sea (dλαδε
                    <hi rend="italic">μvστai)</hi>; the water was more efficacious if a firebrand
                    from the altar were plunged in it. The torch, fire, and sulphur <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(to</hi><hi rend="italic">θeiov)</hi> were also powerful
                    purifying agents. Purification by air was most frequent in the Dionysiac
                    mysteries; puppets suspended and swinging in the air <hi rend="italic"
                    >{oscilla)</hi> formed one way of using the lustrative power of the air. Rubbing
                    with sand and salt was another excellent method. The sacrifice chiefly used for
                    purification by the Greeks was a pig; among the Romans it was always, except in
                    the Lupercalia, a pig, a sheep, and a bull <hi rend="italic"
                    >{suovetaurilia).</hi> In Athens a purificatory sacrifice and prayer was held
                    before every public meeting; the Maimacteria in honour of Zeus Meilichios was an
                    annual festival of purification, and several other feasts had the same
                    character. On extraordinary occasions lustrations were performed for a whole
                    city. So Athens was purified by Epimenides after the Cylonian massacre, and
                    Delos in the Peloponnesian War. In Rome, besides such annual ceremonies as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ambarvalia, Lupercalia, Cerealia, Paganalia,</hi> &lt;tc.,
                    there was a lustration of the fleet before it sailed, and of the army before it
                    marched. Part of the ceremonial always consisted in leading or carrying the
                    victims round the impure persons or things. After any disaster the <hi
                    rend="italic">lustratio classium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">xxercitus</hi> was
                    often again performed, so as to make certain that the gods got all their due.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Amburbium</hi> was a similar ceremonial performed for the
                    whole city on occasions of great danger or calamity. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ambilustrium</hi> was the purificatory ceremony, consisting in sacrifice and
                    prayer, performed after the regular quinquennial census of the Roman pèople.</p>
