                    most perfect masters. He never acquired the Athenian citizenship, but most of
                    his years were passed at Athens; and his life has the interest of close personal
                    association with the most critical period in the history of the Athenian
                    democracy.</p>
                <p>His extant work belongs to the space from 403 to 380 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> but the date of his birth is uncertain. Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
                    and the author of the life ascribed to Plutarch, give 459 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> This date was evidently obtained by reckoning back from the
                    foundation of Thurii (444 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> since there was a
                    tradition that Lysias had gone thither at the age of fifteen. Modern critics
                    would place his birth later,—between 444 and 436 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    —because, in Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi> of which the scene is laid
                    about 430 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Cephalus, the father of Lysias, is
                    among the <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae,</hi> and the emigration of Lysias
                    to Thurii was said to have followed his father’s death. The latter statement,
                    however, rests only on the Plutarchic life; nor can Plato’s dialogue be safely
                    urged as a minutely accurate authority for a biographical detail. We must be
                    content to say that, while the modern view avoids some difficulties, the higher
                    date assigned by the ancient writers is not inconsistent with any ascertained
                    fact, while it agrees better with the tradition that Lysias reached, or passed,
                    the age of eighty. On the other view, all traces of his industry, previously
                    unremitting, would cease abruptly at the age of sixty-six.</p>
                <p>Cephalus, the father of Lysias, was a native of Syracuse. On the invitation of
                    Pericles’ he had settled at Athens as a “resident alien” (p,eτoικoς). The
                    opening scene of Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> is laid at the house of
                    his eldest son, Polemarchus, in the Peiraeus. Cephalus complains that the visits
                    of Socrates have been rare of late, and expresses the hope that he will come
                    offener, and without ceremony, as to intimate friends. The tone of the picture
                    warrants the inference that the Sicilian family were well known to Plato, and
                    that their houses must often have been hospitable to such gatherings as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic</hi> supposes. Thus we have an indirect, but very
                    interesting, confirmation of the phrase used by Dionysius in regard to
                    Lysias—“he grew up in the society of the most distinguished Athenians.”</p>
                <p>At the age of fifteen—when Cephalus, according to'the Plutarchic life, was now
                    dead—Lysias removed from Athens to Thuni, the Athenian colony newly planted on
                    the Tarentine Gulf, near the site of the ancient Sybaris. There the boy may have
                    seen the historian Herodotus,— another of Thurii’s early residents,—now a man in
                    middle life; and it pleases the imagination to think that, in their new Italian
                    home, a friendship may have grown up between these two, neither of them an
                    Athenian by birth, yet alike in a simple grace which Athens loved, and alike
                    also in the love which they bore to Athens. At Thurii Lysias is said to have
                    commenced his studies in rhetoric,—doubtless under a master of the Sicilian
                    school,—possibly, as tradition said, under Tisias, the pupil of Corax, whose
                    name is associated with the first attempt to formulate rhetoric as an art. In
                    413 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Athenian armament in Sicily suffered that
                    crushing disaster which at the moment seemed to imperil the existence of Athens
                    itself. The desire to link famous names is curiously illustrated by the ancient
                    ascription to Lysias of a rhetorical exercise purporting to be a speech in which
                    the captive general Nicias appealed for mercy to the Sicilians. The terrible
                    blow to Athens quickened the energies of an anti-Athenian faction at Thurii.
                    Lysias and his elder brother Polemarchus, with three hundred other persons, were
                    “accused of Atticizing” (Αττtκtσ-∕zov <hi rend="italic">tγκλ-ηθeiσi),—</hi> a
                    charge which, under the circumstances, implies an honourable loyalty. They were
                    driven from Thurii.</p>
                <p>Lysias and Polemarchus now settled at Athens (412 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> They were rich men, having inherited property from their father,
                    Cephalus; and Lysias claims that, though merely resident aliens, they discharged
                    public services with a liberality which shamed many of those who enjoyed the
                    franchise <hi rend="italic">C&gt;vχ</hi> ό/Λοίως μ∈τoικomας <hi rend="italic"
                    >ωaπep</hi> &lt;wrot <hi rend="italic">eττολcτeυοvτο, In Hratοsth.,</hi> § 20).
                    The fact that they owned house property shows that they were classed as <hi
                    rend="italic">lσοτeλel&lt;s, i.c.,</hi> foreigners who paid only the same tax as
                    citizens, being exempt from the special tax (μ,∈τoikιoι∕) on resident aliens.
                    Polemarchus occupied a house in Athens itself, Lysias another in the Peiraeus,
                    near which was their shield manufactory, employing a hundred and twenty skilled
                    slaves. This life of comparative peace and prosperity was broken up by the
                    defeat of Athens at Aegospotami (405 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). In the
                    next spring Athens surrendered to Lysander. The Thirty Tyrants were established
                    at Athens under the protection of a Spartan garrison. One of their earliest
                    measures was an attack upon the resident aliens, who were represented as
                    disaffected to the new government. As foreign residents <pb break="no"

                    the Jews in a mediaeval city, or in modern Russia. Lysias and Polemarchus were
                    on a list of ten singled out to be the first victims. Polemarchus was arrested,
                    and received “the usual message” <hi rend="smallcaps">(to</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the help of a large bribe and a lucky accident. He slipped by a back-door out of
                    the house in which he was a prisoner, and took boat to Megara.</p>
                <p>After the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants, the democracy was formally restored in
                    the autumn of 403 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Lysias appears to have rendered
                    valuable services to the exiles during the reign of the tyrants, both by his own
                    liberality and by procuring aid from other quarters. Thrasybulus now proposed
                    that these services should be recognized by the bestowal of the citizenship. The
                    proposal happened to be informal in one particular. The senate of five hundred
                    had not yet been reconstituted, and hence the measure could not be introduced to
                    the ecclesia by the requisite “preliminary resolution” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πpοβοvXεvμα)</hi> of the senate. On this ground it was successfully opposed;
                    and Lysias missed the reward which he had so well earned. That passage of his
                    ’Ολυμπιακός (§ 3) in which he claims to give advice as a good citizen seems to
                    breathe the feeling that, if he was still but an alien at Athens, he was at
                    least a true τroλiτ7js of Greece.</p>
                <p>The last chapter of his life now opens. He is no longer the wealthy merchant,
                    superintending his shield manufactory in the Peiraeus. The pillage by the
                    tyrants, and his own generosity to the Athenian exiles, had probably left him
                    poor. He now appears as a hard-working member of a new profession,—that of
                    writing speeches to be delivered in the law-courts. The thirty-four compositions
                    extant under his name are but a small fraction of those which the ancient world
                    possessed. From 403 to about 380 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> his industry
                    must have been great and incessant. The notices of his personal life in these
                    years are scanty. In 403 he came forward as the accuser of Eratosthenes, one of
                    the Thirty Tyrants, and delivered the splendid oration which we possess. This
                    was his only direct contact with Athenian politics. The story that Lysias wrote
                    a defence for Socrates, which the latter declined to use, probably arose from a
                    confusion. Several years after the death of Socrates the sophist Polycrates
                    composed a declamation against him; and to this Lysias replied with a defence of
                    the philosopher. A more authentic tradition represents Lysias as having spoken
                    his own “Olympiacus” at the Olympic festival of 388 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The occasion was one of peculiar interest. Dionysius I., tyrant of
                    Syracuse, had sent to the festival a magnificent embassy. Tents embroidered with
                    gold were pitched within the sacred enclosure; and the wealth of Dionysius was
                    vividly brought before the minds of the Panhellénic concourse by the number of
                    chariots which he had entered for the most costly and brilliant of the Olympic
                    contests. This was the moment at which Lysias lifted up his voice to denounce
                    Dionysius as, next to Artaxerxes, the worst enemy of Hellas, and to impress upon
                    the assembled Greeks that one of their foremost duties was to deliver Sicily
                    from a hateful oppression. The latest work of Lysias which we can date (a
                    fragment of a speech “For Pherenicus”)belongs to 381 or 380 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> He probably died in or soon after 380 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The qualities of the man are expressed in his work; indeed, it is through this,
                    rather than through the recorded facts of his biography, that he becomes a
                    living person to us. It is a kindly and genial nature which we see reflected
                    there,—warm in friendship, loyal to country,—with a keen perception of
                    character, and a fine, though strictly controlled, sense of humour. The literary
                    tact which is so remarkable in the extant speeches is that of a singularly
                    flexible intelligence, always obedient to an instinct of gracefulness. Among the
                    earlier artists of Greek prose Lysias owes his distinctive place to the power of
                    concealing his art. The clients of the professional “speech-writer,” like those
                    of the modern advocate, might be of all sorts and conditions. The modern
                    advocate, however, speaks in his own person. The Athenian “logographer” merely
                    wrote the speech which his client delivered. It was obviously desirable that
                    such a speech should be suitable to the age, station, and circumstances of the
                    person into whose mouth it was put. Lysias was the first disciple of Greek
                    rhetoric who succeeded in making this adaptation really artistic. He aimed, not
                    merely at impressive effect in eloquence, pathos, or argument, but at dramatic
                    propriety. Hence it was absolutely essential for him to abandon the stiff and
                    monotonous splendour of the earlier and cruder rhetoric. He could not achieve
                    his purpose unless he brought his art into harmony with the ordinary idiom of
                    everyday life. His client must appear to be speaking as the citizen, who was not
                    a professed rhetorician, might conceivably speak. Lysias achieved this
                    reconciliation with a skill which can be best appreciated if we turn from the
                    easy flow of his graceful language to the majestic emphasis of his predecessor
                    Antiphon, or to the self-revealing art of his successor Isaeus. Translated into
                    terms of ancient criticism, the achievement of Lysias is described by saying
                    that he became the model of the “plain style” (urχvoς <hi rend="italic"
                    >χαρακτηp, lσχyη,</hi> λtτr∕, <hi rend="italic">αφελής</hi> λε£ις; <hi
                    rend="italic">genus</hi><hi rend="italic">ternie</hi><hi rend="italic">or
                    subtile).</hi> From the latter part of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> onwards, Greek, and then Roman, critics distinguished three styles of
                    rhetorical composition—the “grand” (or “elaborate”), the “plain,” and the
                    “middle.” These epithets were relative to the language of daily life,—the
                    “plain” being nearest to this, and the “grand” furthest from it. Greek rhetoric
                    began in the “grand” style; then Lysias set an exquisite pattern of the “plain”;
                    and Demosthenes might be considered as having effected an almost ideal
                    compromise. We moderns perhaps cannot fully seize that nameless and undefinable
                    grace (χα∕∏s) of Lysias which the Greek critic of the Augustan age indicates in
                    such striking words :—</p>
                <p>“When I am puzzled about one of the speeches ascribed to him,” says Dionysius,
                    “and when it is hard for me to find the truth by other marks, I have recourse to
                    this excellence, as to the last piece on the board. Then, if the graces of
                    speech seem to me to make the writing fair, I count it to be of the soul of
                    Lysias; and I care not to probe the question further. But if the stamp of the
                    language has no winningness, no loveliness, 1 am chagrined, and suspect that,
                    after all, the speech is not by Lysias; and I do no more violence to my instinct
                    <hi rend="italic">(oi&gt;κετι</hi><hi rend="italic">βιάζομαι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τ⅛v</hi><hi rend="italic">άλογον</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >atσθησιv),</hi> even though in all else the speech seems to me clever and well
                    finished,— believing that to write well, in special styles other than this, is
                    given to many men, but that to write winningly, gracefully, with loveliness, is
                    the gift of Lysias” (Dionys., <hi rend="italic">Be Lys.,</hi> ii.).</p>
                <p>The more salient traits of the Lysian style can be recognized by all. The
                    vocabulary is pure and simple. Most of the rhetorical “figures” are sparingly
                    used,— except such as consist in the parallelism or opposition of clauses. The
                    taste of the day,—not yet emancipated from the influence of the Sicilian
                    rhetoric,—probably demanded a large use of antithesis as an essential condition
                    of impressive speaking. Lysias excels in vivid description; he has also a happy
                    knack of marking the speaker’s character by light touches. The structure of his
                    sentences varies a good deal according to the dignity of the subject. He has
                    equal command over the “periodic” style <hi rend="italic">(κατεστραμμένη</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">λεξιf)</hi> and the non-periodic or “continuous” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(εlpoμεvη, 8ιaλελυμεvη)-</hi> using now one now the other, or blending them,
                    according to circumstances. His disposition of his subject-matter is always
                    simple. The speech has usually four parts,—introduction <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πpooiμιov),</hi> narrative <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n134/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0134-0119"/> of facts <hi rend="italic">(διηγησc&lt;s),</hi>
                    proofs (τriστεις), which may be either external, as from witnesses, or internal,
                    derived from argument on the facts, and, lastly, conclusion (επίλογος). It is in
                    the introduction and the narrative that Lysias is seen at his best. In his
                    greatest extant speech—that “Against Eratosthenes ”—and also in the fragmentary
                    “Olympiacus,” he has pathos and fire; but these were not characteristic
                    qualities of his work. In Cicero’s judgment, Demosthenes was peculiarly
                    distinguished by force <hi rend="italic">(vis),</hi> Aeschines by resonance <hi
                    rend="italic">(sonitus),</hi> Hyperides by acuteness <hi rend="italic"
                    >(acumen),</hi> Isocrates by sweetness <hi rend="italic">(suavitas)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the distinction which he assigns to Lysias is <hi
                    rend="italic">subtilitas,</hi> an Attic refinement,—which, as he elsewhere says,
                    is often joined to an admirable vigour <hi rend="italic">(lacerti),</hi> (Cic.,
                    <hi rend="italic">De Or.,</hi> iii. 7, § 28; <hi rend="italic">Brutus,</hi> §
                    64). The judgment is interesting as showing how a Roman critic of unquestionable
                    competence recognized the peculiar place of Lysias in the development of Greek
                    oratory. Nor was it oratory alone to which Lysias rendered service; his work had
                    an important effect on all subsequent Greek prose, by showing how perfect
                    elegance could be joined to plainness. Here, in his artistic use of familiar
                    idiom, he might fairly be called the Euripides of Attic prose. And his style has
                    an additional charm for modern readers, because it is employed in describing
                    scenes from the everyday life of Athens.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Thirty-four speeches (of which three are fragmentary) have come down under the
                    name of Lysias; no fewer than one hundred and twenty-seven more, now lost, are
                    known from smaller fragments or from titles. In the Augustan age four hundred
                    and twenty-five works bore his name, of which more than two hundred were allowed
                    as genuine by the critics. The enormous number of ascriptions indicates that
                    Lysias was reputed to have been a fertile writer. Our thirty-four works may be
                    classified as follows :—</p>

                    regarded as Plato’s own work; but the certainty of this conclusion will be
                    doubted by those who observe (1) the elaborate preparations made in the dialogue
                    for a recital of the <hi rend="italic">Ερωτικός</hi> which shall be <hi
                    rend="italic">verbally exact,</hi> and (2) the closeness of the criticism made
                    upon it. If the satirist were merely analysing his own composition, such
                    criticism would have little point. Lysias is the earliest writer who is known to
                    have composed <hi rend="italic">ερωτικοί</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is as
                    representing both rhetoric and a false <hi rend="italic">ερως</hi> that he is
                    the object of attack in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus.</hi></p>
                <p>F. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fragments.</hi> —Three hundred and fifty-five of these
                    are collected by Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici,</hi> ii. 170-216.
                    Two hundred and fifty-two of them represent one hundred and twenty-seven
                    speeches of known title; and of six the fragments are comparatively large. Of
                    these, the fragmentary speech “For Pherenicus” belongs to 381 or 380 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and is thus the latest known work of Lysias.</p>
                <p>In literary and historical interest, the first place among the extant speeches of
                    Lysias belongs to that “Against Eratosthenes” (403 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> one of the Thirty Tyrants, whom Lysias arraigns as the murderer of
                    his brother Polemarchus. The speech is an eloquent and vivid picture of the
                    reign of terror which the thirty established at Athens; the concluding appeal,
                    to both parties among the citizens, is especially powerful. Next in importance
                    is the speech “Against Agoratus” (399 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), one of
                    our chief authorities for the internal history of Athens during the months which
                    immediately followed the defeat at Aegospotami. The “Olympiacus” (388 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) is a brilliant fragment, expressing the spirit of
                    the festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common
                    foes. The “Plea for the Constitution” (403 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) is
                    interesting for the manner in which it argues that the wellbeing of Athens—now
                    stripped of empire—is bound up with the maintenance of democratic principles.
                    The speech “For Mantitheus” (392 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> o. ) is a graceful
                    and animated portrait of a young Athenian <hi rend="italic">ίππεύς,</hi> making
                    a spirited defence of his honour against the charge of disloyalty. The defence
                    “For the Invalid” is a humorous character-sketch. The speech “Against Pancleon”
                    illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us
                    some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who
                    had been charged with destroying a <hi rend="italic">moria,</hi> or sacred
                    olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech “Against
                    Theomnestus” deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the
                    ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 B.c.</p>
                <p>All MSS. of Lysias yet collated have been derived, as H. Sauppe first showed,
                    from the Codex Palatinus X (Heidelberg). The next most valuable MS. is the
                    Laurentianus C (15th century), which I. Bckker chiefly followed. Speaking
                    generally, we may say that these two MSS. are the only two which carry much
                    weight where the text is seriously corrupt. In Οratt. i.-ix. Bekker occasionally
                    consulted eleven other MSS., most of which contain only these nine ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> eches: viz., Marciani F, G, I, K (Venice);
                    Laurentiani D, E (Florence); Va.ιcani M, N; Parisini U, V; Urbinas O.</p>
