                    province of western Persia, with ill-defined limits, but lying mainly between
                    31° and 33° N. lat. and between 47° and 52° E. long., and bounded N. and E. by
                    Irak-Adjemi, S. by Farsistan, W. by Khuzistan and the Turkish vilayet of
                    Baghdad. It thus stretches north-west and south-east some 260 miles, with a mean
                    breadth of 70 miles and an area of rather less than 20,000∙ square miles. The
                    surface is mostly mountainous, being occupied in the west by the Pusht-i-koh
                    range, which forms the frontier line towards Turkey, in the east by the
                    Bakhtiari (Zagros) range, which runs northwest and south-east, thus connecting
                    the Kurdistan· with the Kuh-Dinar or Farsistan highland systems. Between the
                    parallel Pusht-i-koh and Bakhtiari chains there stretch some naturally fertile
                    plains and low hilly districts, which, however, are little cultivated, although
                    well-watered by the Karan, Dizful, and Kerkhah, the three· chief rivers of the
                    province. There are two main divisions— Luri Buzurg, or “Great Luristan,”
                    comprising the Bakhtiari highlands westwards to river Dizful, and Luri Kuchak,
                    or “Little Luristan,” stretching thence to Khuzistan and Turkey. The latter is
                    again divided into the Pesh-koh and Pusht-i-koh districts (“before” and “behind”
                    the mountains), and notwithstanding its name is by far the most populous and
                    productive of the two. From the 12th to the 17th century it formed an
                    independent principality under hereditary rulers with the title of “atabeg,” the
                    last of whom was deposed by Shah Abbas, and the government transferred to Husen
                    Khan, chief of the Faili tribe, with the title of “vali.” His descendants are
                    still at the head of the administration; but the power of the valis has been
                    much reduced since the transfer of the Pesh-koh district to Kirmanshah.</p>
                <p>Lriristan takes its name from the Luri,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    still form the vast majority of the population. Great uncertainty has hitherto
                    prevailed regarding the nomenclature, the main divisions and the true affinity
                    of the Luri to the other branches of the Iranian family. Thus, from the name of
                    the present ruling clan all the tribes of Luri Kuchak are commonly spoken of as
                    “Faili,” a term which is now rejected by the Pesh-koh tribes, and which, if used
                    at all as a general ethnical expression, ought to be restricted to those of
                    Pusht-i-koh, still under the rule of the vali. The classifications of Layard,
                    Bawlin-son, and A. H. Schindler differ materially, while contradictory
                    statements are made by well-informed writers regarding the physical and
                    linguistic relations of the Luri to the neighbouring Kurds and Persians. From a
                    careful consideration of the available evidence it would appear that the Luri
                    are the true aborigines of their present domain, where they occupy an
                    intermediate position between the Kurds and Persians, but resembling the former
                    much more than the latter in speech, temperament, social habits, and physical
                    appearance. Although they themselves reject the name of Kurd, the two languages
                    are essentially one, so that the natives of Kirmanshah and Dizful have little
                    difficulty in conversing together. Like the Kurds, they are also of a restless
                    and unruly disposition, averse from a settled life, still dwellers in tents,
                    mostly owners of flocks and herds, holding agriculture in contempt, and of
                    predatory habits. “In appearance the Bakhtiari look rather fierce, owing
                    probably to the mode of life they lead; the features of their face are cast in a
                    rough mould, but although coarse they are in general regular. Their black eyes
                    look wild and expressive, and the two black tufts of hair behind their ears give
                    them, if possible, a still darker appearance. They are muscular built, and are
                    chiefly of a middle stature” (E. Balfour). In a word, the Luri must be classed
                    anthropologically in the same group as the Kurds. They are excellent
                    stockbreeders, and their horses and mules are regarded as the very best in
                    Persia. Of the mules, about a thousand are annually exported to the surrounding
                    provinces. Most of the hard work is left to the women, who tend the flocks, till
                    the little land under cultivation, tread out the corn, and weave the carpets,
                    black goat-hair tents, and horse cloths for which Luristan is famous. The men
                    put their hands to no useful work, go about armed, and are always ready for a
                    foray. Their constant intertribal feuds render the country unsafe for trade and
                    travel, while their revolts against the central government often cause a total
                    interruption of communication<pb break="no"

                    however, has somewhat abated since the tribal chiefs have been compelled to give
                    hostages as security for their good behaviour.</p>
                <p>Outwardly Mohammedans of the Shiah sect, the Lιiri show little veneration either
                    for the Prophet or the Koran. Their religion seems to be a curious mixture of
                    Ali-∏ahism, involving a belief in successive incarnations and the worship of the
                    national saint, Baba Buzurg, combined with many mysterious rites, sacrifices,
                    and secret meetings certainly anterior to Islam, and possibly traceable to the
                    ancient rites of Mithras and Anaitis.</p>
                <p>The chiefs enjoy almost unlimited authority over their subjects, and the tribal
                    organization is strongly marked by the feudal spirit.</p>
                <p>The total population of Luristan is about 320,000, and the average revenue nearly
                    £40,000 sterling.</p>
