                    dealer is sometimes permitted to deal the cards in any order he pleases; but the
                    best rule is to require that the cards be dealt one at a time in rotation, as at
                    whist. During the deal each player contributes to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pool</hi> a sum previously agreed upon, the dealer contributing double. The
                    unit for a single stake should be divisible by three without a remainder, <hi
                    rend="italic">e,g.,</hi> three counters or three pence. The players are bound to
                    put in the stake before the deal is completed; sometimes a penalty is enforced
                    for neglect. The deal being completed and the pool formed, each player in
                    rotation, beginning from the dealer’s left, looks at his cards, and declares
                    whether he will play, resign, or take miss. If the former, he says “I play.” If
                    he takes miss he places his cards face downwards in the middle of the table, and
                    takes up the extra hand. If he resigns, he similarly places his cards face
                    downwards in the middle of the table. If miss is taken, the subsequent players
                    only have the option of playing or resigning. A player who takes miss must play.
                    Those who have declared to play, and the one—if there is one—who has taken miss,
                    then play one card each in rotation, beginning from the dealer’s left, the cards
                    thus played constituting a <hi rend="italic">trick.</hi> The trick is won by the
                    highest card of the suit led, or, if trumped, by the highest trump, the cards
                    ranking as at whist. The winner of the trick leads to the next, and so on, until
                    the hand is played out. The cards remain face upwards in front of the persons
                    playing them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rules of Play.—</hi> If the leader holds ace of trumps he must
                    lead it (or king, if ace is turned up). If the leader has two trumps he must
                    lead one of them, and if one is ace (or king, ace being turned up) he must lead
                    it. With this exception the leader is not bound to lead his highest trump if
                    more than two declare to play; <hi rend="italic">but if there are only two
                    declared players</hi> the leader with more than one trump must lead the highest.
                    Except with trumps as above stated he may lead any card he chooses. The
                    subsequent players must head the trick if able, and must follow suit if able.
                    Holding none of the suit led, they must head tlιe trick with a trump, if able.
                    Otherwise they may play any card they please. The winner of the first trick is
                    subject to the rules already stated respecting the lead, and in addition he must
                    lead a trump if able (called <hi rend="italic">trump after trick).</hi></p>
                <p>When the hand has been played out, the winners of the tricks divide the pool,
                    each receiving one-third of the amount for each trick. If only one declared to
                    play, the dealer plays miss either for himself or for the pool. If he plays for
                    the pool he must declare before seeing miss that he does not play for himself.
                    Any tricks he may win, when playing for the pool, remain there as an addition to
                    the next pool.</p>
                <p>If each declared player wins at least one trick it is a <hi rend="italic">single,
                    i.e.,</hi> a fresh pool is made as already described; but if one of the declared
                    players fails to make a trick he is <hi rend="italic">looed.</hi> Then, only the
                    player who is looed contributes to the next pool, together with the dealer, who
                    puts in a single stake. If more than one player is looed, each has to
                    contribute. At <hi rend="italic">unlimited loo</hi> each player looed has to put
                    in the amount there was in the pool. But it is generally agreed to <hi
                    rend="italic">limit</hi> the loo, so that it shall not exceed a certain fixed
                    sum. Thus, at eighteen-penny loo, the loo is generally limited to half a guinea.
                    If there is less than the limit in the pool the payment is regulated as before;
                    but if there is more than the limit, the loo is the fixed sum agreed on.</p>
                <p>The game is sometimes varied by <hi rend="italic">forces, i.e.,</hi> by
                    compelling every one to play, either whenever there is no loo the previous deal
                    (α <hi rend="italic">single),</hi> or whenever clubs are trumps <hi
                    rend="italic">{club law).</hi> When there is a force no miss is dealt. <hi
                    rend="italic">Irish loo</hi> is played by allowing declared players to exchange
                    some or all of their cards for cards dealt from the top of the pack. There is no
                    miss, and it is not compulsory to lead a trump with two trumps, unless there are
                    only two declared players. At <hi rend="italic">five-card loo</hi> each player
                    has five cards instead of three, and a single stake should be divisible by five.
                    <hi rend="italic">Pam</hi> (knave of clubs) ranks as the highest trump, whatever
                    suit is turned up. There is no miss, and cards may be exchanged as at Irish loo.
                    If ace of trumps is led, the leader says “Pam be civil,” when the holder of that
                    card must pass the trick if he can do so without revoking. A flush (five cards
                    of the same suit, or four with Pam) <hi rend="italic">loos the board, i.c.,</hi>
                    the holder receives the amount of a loo from every one, and the hand is not
                    played. A tramp flush takes precedence of flushes in other suits. If more than
                    one flush is held, or if Pam is held, the holder is exempted from payment. As
                    between two flushes which do not take precedence, the elder hand wins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Declaring to Play, and Playing</hi> (three-card loo).—Play on
                    two tramps. The first to declare should play on an honour in tramps <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n13/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0013-0002"/> and an ace in plain suits. Play also on king of
                    trumps; but some players throw up king of trumps single unless with it another
                    king or a guarded queen is held. Also play on one tramp with two other cards as
                    high as queens; some players throw up this hand. Holding a trump and two aces,
                    lead the trump if three others declare to play; but otherwise lead an ace. Do
                    not play on a hand without a trump; except, play on any cards that give a
                    reasonable chance of a trick, or take miss, if the amount in the pool is
                    considerable, and the loo is limited. If the number of players is less than
                    five, or if several throw up, weaker hands may be played; on the other side, if
                    several have declared to play, only a very strong hand should be risked. If
                    there are only three left in, all others having thrown up, miss should be taken,
                    but not when there are more than two to follow the player whose turn it is to
                    declare.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laws of Loo.—</hi> These vary greatly, and should be agreed on
                    before commencing to play. The ordinary rules, which loo the player for nearly
                    every error, are very bad. The following are based on the laws of the late
                    Blenheim Club. 1. First knave deals. 2. Each player has a right to shuffle. 3.
                    The player to the dealer’s right cuts the pack. 4. The dealer must deliver the
                    cards, one by one, in rotation, as at whist, and must deal one card for miss at
                    the end of each round; he must turn up the top card of the undealt cards for
                    trumps. 5. If the dealer deals without having the pack cut, or shuffles after it
                    is cut, or deals except as provided in law 4, or deals two cards together and
                    then deals a third without rectifying the error, or exposes a card, or deals too
                    many cards, he forfeits a single to the pool, and deals again.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The law which loos a player·
                    for misdealing is atrocious, and should always be opposed.</p></note> 6. The
                    player to the left of the dealer deals next. If a player deals out of turn, he
                    may be stopped before the tramp card is turned, otherwise the deal stands good,
                    and the player to his left deals next. 7. Players must declare to play in
                    rotation, beginning to the dealer’s left. A player looking at his cards before
                    his turn forfeits a single to the pool. 8. A player who declares before his
                    turn, or who exposes a card, forfeits a single to the pool, and must throw up
                    his hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Forfeits of a
                    single go to increase the pool already formed, and see note to law 5.</p></note>
                    9. If a declared player exposes a card before his turn to play, or plays out of
                    turn, or before all have declared, or detaches a card so that it can be named by
                    any other declared player, or revokes, he must leave in the pool any tricks he
                    may make, and forfeit four times the amount of a single. If he makes no trick he
                    is looed, and there is no further penalty. 10. If the leader holds ace of trumps
                    and does not lead it (or king, ace being turned up), or if he holds two tramps
                    and does not lead one, or the highest of two or more trumps when there are only
                    two declared players (unless his cards are sequence cards or cards of equal
                    value), or if a player does not head the trick when able, or if he does not lead
                    trump after trick (if he holds a trump), he is liable to the same penalty as in
                    law 9.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tricks left in
                    the pool and fines under laws 9 and 10 go to the next pool and not to the pool
                    already formed. Many players inflict the penalty of a loo for the offences named
                    in laws 9 and 10; but the rule above, as played at the Blenheim, is the
                    best.</p></note> 11. In case of revokes or errors in play the hand must be
                    replayed if so desired by any one except the offender. 12. The place of an
                    aftercomer is decided by dealing a card between every two of the players. The
                    aftercomer sits where the first knave falls. (H. J. )</p>
