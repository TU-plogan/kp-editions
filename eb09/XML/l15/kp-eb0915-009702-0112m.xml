                    Public affairs were not more unsettled during his lifetime than during the
                    lifetime of Chaucer. Like Chaucer, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0113-0098"/> Lydgate enjoyed the patronage of the royal
                    family. He was the “poet laureate” of his generation. He translated Benoît de St
                    Maure’s <hi rend="italic">History of Troy "</hi> at the commandment” of Henry
                    V.; he wrote a poem on the battle of Agincourt; the coronation of Henry VII.
                    furnished him with another theme; the “Good Duke Humphrey” of Gloucester
                    “commanded” his translation of <hi rend="italic">Bochas upon the Fall of
                    Princes.</hi> The monk of Bury was in short a professional poet. According to
                    Warton he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the nobility
                    the arts of versification and the elegancies of composition, and it would seem
                    from the character and the variety of the pieces attributed to
                    him—“disguisings,” “mummings,” lives of saints, translations of standard works,
                    devotional pieces in metre, metrical paraphrases of proverbs—that he was ready
                    to write to order on any theme submitted to him. Lydgate attracted a good deal
                    of attention from our early printers and antiquaries, his <hi rend="italic">Fall
                    of Princes</hi> being reprinted four times before the accession of Elizabeth.
                    The fact that it was the largest poem in English of a tragic cast may have had
                    something to do with the popularity of this work. The <hi rend="italic">Story of
                    Thebes,</hi> based on Statius and Boccaccio, is generally supposed to have been
                    one of his first essays. It is told as one of the Canterbury tales,— the poet in
                    his prologue feigning himself to have joined Chaucer’s pilgrims at Canterbury,
                    and recited this tale at the host’s command as they rode back. Possibly more
                    than one of two hundred and fifty-one separate poems, most of them short,
                    ascribed to Lydgate by Ritson, have been ascribed to him on very slender
                    authority. But the works undoubtedly his are so commonplace in thought and
                    sentiment, and so clumsy in execution,—with all allowance for transcribers’
                    errors and imperfect editing,— that no injustice can have been done to his
                    reputation by attributing any doggerel to his facile pen. He was evidently a
                    great reader of poetry, a scholar accomplished in amount, had probably a large
                    indiscriminate enjoyment of poetry, and probably also a boisterous enjoyment of
                    his own facility in building up stanzas. His own mental life was probably the
                    reverse of dull. But, like many another self-satisfied versifier, he is the
                    cause of dulness in others. In reading him with his own contented spirit, one
                    catches some faint reflexion of the gleeful happiness with which he seems to
                    have poured out his abundant store of thrice-repeated phrases and images. Of
                    artistic sensibility he was entirely destitute. He claims our sympathy by his
                    warm admiration for Chaucer, but admiration gave him no share of Chaucer’s
                    economy of touch, rapid vivacious movement, and subtle wit. His lines are eked
                    out by tautologous and feeble epithets, and garrulous repetitions— “as clerkes
                    can you tell,” “in bookes as I rede,” “the story saith certain,” “the story can
                    devise,” “the story can reherse,” “the story specifies,”.“the story maketh
                    mind.” Something is expressed in learned terms, and then the same thing is
                    repeated “in plain English.” Lydgate is seen at his best in his illustrations of
                    proverbs and maxims of homely morality, and by far his most successful metre is
                    a stave of eight four-beat lines with a rhyme from the first half recurring in
                    the second. <hi rend="italic">A Satirical Balad on the Times,</hi> with the
                    refrain “So as the crab gothe forwarde”; <hi rend="italic">A Satirical
                    Description of his Lady,</hi> with the refrain “When she hath on hire hood of
                    green” <hi rend="italic">; A Lover's Complaint; Thonke God of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Alle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Make</hi><hi rend="italic">Amendes</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> all in this
                    metre—are among the most favourable specimens of his powers. A line of five
                    accents seems always to have driven him into prolixity. <hi rend="italic">The
                    London Lackpenny,</hi> to the refrain of “But for lack of money I might not
                    speed,” the best known of his humorous poems, is also in four-beat lines, though
                    there are seven lines in the stanza. Lydgate’s copiousness of detail in
                    describing customs, dresses, architecture, as well as in making literary com
                    parisons, render his verses useful as materials for the historian; but in
                    artistic skill he is a sad falling off from Chaucer. Personally he seems to have
                    been a lively monk enough. In his <hi rend="italic">Testament</hi> he makes
                    confession to having been a terrible boy, “disposed to many unbridled passions.”
                    He fought with his schoolfellows, and scoffed and made mouths at them “like a
                    wanton ape”; he played truant, and “forged leesings” in excuse; neither hedge
                    nor wall could keep him out of orchards; he “told cherry-stones” when he ought
                    to have been at church, and threw his paternoster and his creed at the cock.
                    Highly decorous respectable old men often take a pleasure in looking back, as
                    Justice Shallow did, to the follies of their youth, and perhaps exaggerating
                    them, but there is nothing in Lydgate’s confession inconsistent with his poetry.
                    A dull writer is generally a person of high animal spirits; only that could
                    sustain him through platitudes which other people find so dreary. (w. Μ.)</p>
