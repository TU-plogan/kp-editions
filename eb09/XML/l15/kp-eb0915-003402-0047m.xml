                    on each other. The object is to lessen the friction, which is injurious both in
                    wearing away the surfaces, and thus destroying the fit between them, and in
                    dissipating and rendering useless part of the energy transmitted through the
                    machine. The difference between the wear on unlubricated and that on lubricated
                    surfaces is so serious that a comparison between the cost of lubrication and the
                    money saving in avoidance of repairs is superfluous. But the difference in wear
                    when two different lubricants are used is not very great, and the proper choice
                    between the two lubricants depends on a comparison of their cost with the amount
                    of working power they save from dissipation. If the price of oil per gallon,

                    oil any one working surface or set of such surfaces, ,it is necessary to use the
                    fraction <hi rend="italic">g</hi> of a gallon of oil per hour; if, with the use
                    of this quantity of the oil, there is still wasted in friction at these surfaces
                    H horse-power; and if the cost in fuel, water, wages, repairs, &amp;c., of the
                    working energy is P per hour per horse-power; then the money loss per hour
                    caused by the friction is 2⅛7 + PH. By comparing the values of this quantity for
                    two oils, it can be determined which it is more advantageous to use. Of the
                    commonly used oils, the higher priced are much more efficient as lubricants. If
                    two oils of which the same amount requires to be used have the prices <hi

                <p>Considering the meaning of this inequality in the two cases of a high-priced and

                    better lubricator. Thus with the dearer oil the limit beyond which it is
                    uneconomical to increase the consumption of oil is reached sooner than with the
                    cheaper, and it follows that of the cheaper oils it is best to use a large
                    quantity, while of the dearer a smaller amount is what is most usefully
                    employed. If the law according to which H varies with <hi rend="italic">g</hi>

                <p>Of the animal oils and fats suitable for lubrication those commonly used are
                    sperm, lard, neats-foot, tallow, and common whale oil. Of vegetable oils olive,
                    cotton-seed, and rape-seed are extensively employed, the first mostly in those
                    countries where the olive is grown, and generally in the pure condition, while
                    the last two are more used for mixing with higher class and more expensive oils.
                    Various fish oils are also much used, and mineral oils now form a <pb break="no"

                    compositions that are in use. For machinery where considerable pressure is
                    exerted between the bearing surfaces the mineral oils are too thin, or, as it is
                    termed, are too wanting in “body” to be quite suitable without being mixed with
                    an animal or vegetable oil. Unless a lubricant has considerable “body” it is
                    quickly pressed out of the bearing, and an unnecessarily rapid supply has to be
                    provided. The same oil may be used several times over, and several ingenious
                    designs of bearings for rotating shafts, such as Player Brothers’ or Taylor
                    &amp; Challen’s, whereby the shaft itself as it runs round continually pumps up
                    again to the top of the bearing the oil that has once been used, have been very
                    successful in practice. If an automatic arrangement of this sort is not
                    employed, the oil dripping from the bearing should be collected in a pan and
                    used again to fill the oil-cups. The oil gets gradually worn out as a lubricant
                    by becoming filled with dirt, partly the dust of the atmosphere and partly the
                    minute iron and brass dust that is continually rubbed off the bearing surfaces.
                    Oils that have been used two or three times can be to a certain extent
                    repurified by washing in a solution of carbonate of soda or potash and chloride
                    of calcium in boiling water. But it must not be supposed that with
                    repurification an oil may be used an indefinite time as a lubricant. A large
                    portion of it is actually evaporated by the heat caused by the friction at the
                    journal, and the unevaporated portion seems to undergo some chemical change
                    injurious to its lubricating properties. Vegetable oils are peculiarly rich in
                    volatile constituents, and it is this fact probably, even more than the greater
                    cheapness of mineral oils, that has led to the largely increased use of the
                    latter in the lubrication of machinery.</p>
                <p>The quality of an oil may be tested by chemical analysis; by measurement of
                    density and viscosity; by observation of the temperature necessary for ignition
                    in the atmosphere, or, as it is called, the “flashing” temperature; by
                    observation of the succession of figured patterns produced when a single drop of
                    the oil is let fall upon the surface of pure water in a clean dish; by the
                    measurement of the temperatures to which a journal rises when running at
                    different speeds and under different pressures, and when supplied with a given
                    amount of the lubricant per minute; and by the measurement of the coefficient of
                    friction at the same journal with varying speeds of rotation and pressures. The
                    last two methods of test are the most interesting and directly useful from a
                    mechanical point of view, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> considering the oil as a
                    lubricant simply.</p>
                <p>The machine designed and used by Professor Thurston of the Stevens Institute of
                    technology is the best that has yet been constructed to carry out these tests.
                    In it a spindle is revolved in horizontal bearings by a belt from the main shaft
                    of the workshop of the Institute. On the overhanging end of this spindle is
                    formed a journal from which is hung a heavily-weighted rod. The bearings in this
                    rod by which it hangs on the journal are of brass, and the two halves are
                    pressed down upon the journal with any desired pressure by means of a spiral
                    spring placed in the centre of the rod. The weight of this pendulum prevents it
                    revolving along with the spindle, but the friction at the journal deflects the
                    pendulum from the vertical through an angle whose sine is a measure of the
                    frictional effort. There is also inserted in the bearings a thermometer by which
                    the effect of the friction in increasing the temperature is observed. With this
                    machine Professor Thurston has obtained extremely interesting results regarding
                    the variation of the coefficient of friction with temperature, pressure, and
                    velocity of rubbing. These are summar.zed as follows. With great intensity of
                    pressure and low velocity, the friction increases as the temperature is raised;
                    but for each low velocity the rate of increase of friction with temperature
                    becomes slower as the pressure diminishes, and becomes zero at a certain limit
                    of pressure which is higher the higher the velocity is. With high velocities the
                    variation of friction with temperature is in the opposite direction within the
                    limits of pressure commonly used. Again at a given temperature and a given
                    pressure the friction first decreases very rapidly with increase of velocity,
                    and then above a certain limit of velocity increases again slowly with further
                    increase of velocity. The limit of velocity at which the direction of variation
                    changes from · negative to positive does not appear to depend on the intensity
                    of pressure, but the change occurs at much lower velocity-limits with low than
                    with high temperatures. Thirdly, with a given temperature and a given velocity
                    the coefficient of friction, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the ratio of friction
                    to normal pressure, at first decreases rapidly with increase of pressure at low
                    pressures, and then at higher pressures increases again with the pressure. This
                    law seems to hold for all temperatures and all velocities; but how the limit of
                    pressure at which the variation changes in direction is altered by alteration of
                    temperature and velocity is not as yet certainly determined.</p>
                <p>It is thus seen that the variation of friction at lubricated journals is
                    extremely complicated, and has no resemblance to the simple law of constant
                    proportionality between the friction and the normal pressure which until lately
                    was commonly believed to hold good for unlubricated flat surfaces. This simple
                    law is really true for many unlubricated surfaces and through a tolerably wide
                    range of conditions, but is not true for all such surfaces, or under all, and
                    especially extreme, conditions of pressure, velocity, and temperature.</p>
                <p>Professor Thurston has endeavoured to represent these results in algebraic
                    formulae, but the number of his experiments seems hardly sufficient to establish
                    any general mathematical law which will be trιιe under all circumstances, and
                    the particular formulae which he has adopted give values differing very
                    considerably from those given by some of his experiments.</p>
                <p>The friction at a lubricated journal depends really much more on the viscosity of
                    the lubricant than on the frictional properties of either of the solids, which
                    never come in contact when the lubrication is carefully attended to. The layer
                    of oil immediately in contact with either solid probably does not move at all
                    relatively to the solid. The rubbing, therefore, in all probability takes place
                    between two surfaces, or rather between an indefinitely large number of pairs of
                    surfaces, ρf oil. The viscosity of the oil, which hinders this relative motion,
                    is, however, very likely affected by the adhesive force between the solid and
                    liquid surfaces, because, especially if the intensity of bearing pressure be
                    great and the film of lubricant consequently very thin, some at least of the
                    liquid motion will take place within the sphere of action of the cohesive
                    forces.</p>
                <p>It is of the greatest importance in order to secure economy in the use of
                    lubricants to maintain the supply to each journal at a constant uniform rate. To
                    effect this, numberless “automatic lubricators” have been invented. The common
                    syphon oil-cup is very efficient so long as the rate of working is steady; but
                    the supply does not automatically vary with the requirements. The “needle”
                    lubricator allows the oil to How down to the journal through a small straight
                    tube in which is placed a wire which nearly blocks up the tube. When the wire is
                    motionless the dimensions of the space between the wire and the tube are
                    capillary, and no oil flows. When the shaft runs, however, its surface scraping
                    on the end of the wire throws it into continual vibration, and this allows a
                    slow stream of oil to pass downwards which is automatically regulated in
                    accordance with the speed of revolution. The necessity of very perfect
                    lubrication of the cylinders of gas engines, which run at a high speed and at a
                    high temperature, has led to the adoption by Messrs Crossley Brothers of an
                    extremely neat and perfect arrangement. A small crank on the end of a spindle,
                    driven at a rate proportional to that of the engine, has suspended from the
                    crank pin a short wire pendulum. At the lower part of the revolution this
                    pendulum dips into a basin of oil and lifts a drop from it. In the upper half of
                    the circular motion, the wire is dragged over a little scraper extending over
                    the open mouth of a pipe. This scrapes the drop off the pendulum, and the drop
                    falls from the scraper into the tube, along which it flows to the surface to be
                    lubricated. The number of drops is thus accurately proportioned to the speed of
                    the engine, and the size of drop can be varied by using smaller or larger wire
                    for the pendulum.</p>

                    and 1⅜ inches long. With a larger journal the results would probably not be
                    exactly the same. (B. H. S.*)</p>
