                    Taurus. The region thus designated is one strongly marked by nature, as
                    constituting a kind of peninsula or promontory projecting towards the south from
                    the great mountain masses of the interior. It was also inhabited from a very
                    early period by a distinct people, known to the Greeks as Lycians, but whose
                    native name, according to Herodotus, was Termike, or (as it is written by
                    Hecataeus) Tremilae, and this is confirmed by native inscriptions, in which the
                    name is written Tramilae. Herodotus tells us also that they were not the
                    original inhabitants of the country, which was previously occupied by the
                    Milyans, and this is rendered probable by the fact that a people of that name
                    was still found in the rugged mountainous district in the north-east, who appear
                    to have always continued distinct from the Lycians. But <pb break="no"

                    originally came from Crete is in the highest degree improbable; and the attempts
                    to connect them with the Greek legendary history through Sarpedon and Lycus, a
                    son of Pandion, 'may be safely rejected as mere fictions.</p>
                <p>The Lycians alone among the nations in the west of Asia Minor preserved their
                    independence against the kings of Lydia; but after the fall of the Lydian
                    monarchy (in 546 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) they were subdued by Harpagus,
                    the general of Cyrus, though not till after an obstinate resistance in which
                    Xanthus, their chief city, was utterly destroyed. But, though they were from
                    this time nominally subject to Persia, they appear to have enjoyed a
                    considerable amount of independence, which they afterwards maintained by joining
                    the Athenian maritime league. They were conquered almost without resistance by
                    Alexander, and thus passed under the Macedonian dominion, sometimes of the
                    Ptolemies, sometimes of the Seleucidans. But through all these vicissitudes, as
                    well as after their ultimate submission to the Roman power, they continued to
                    preserve their federal institutions, which remained unimpaired, in form at
                    least, as late as the time of Augustus. Strabo, who has preserved to us an
                    account of their constitution, which he regards as the wisest form of federal
                    government with which he was acquainted (a judgment confirmed by the high
                    authority of Montesquieu), tells us that the league consisted of twenty-three
                    cities in all, of which the six principal were Xanthus, Patara, Pinara, Olympus,
                    Myra, and Tlos. These six had each three votes in the general assembly; of the
                    remaining cities the more considerable had each two votes, and the rest only
                    one. The payment of taxes and other public burthens were apportioned in the same
                    manner, and the choice of the supreme magistrate, who was styled Lyciarch, and
                    the other magistrates of the league rested with the federal assembly. At the
                    same time the internal affairs of each city were managed by a senate or council
                    (Boule), and a general assembly of the people (Demos), in the same manner as was
                    usual with Greek cities. This system of government continued to subsist under
                    the Roman empire, though of course subject to the control as well as protection
                    of the sovereign power; but in the time of Claudius dissensions among the
                    separate cities afforded a pretext for the intervention of Rome, and Lycia
                    became formally annexed to the Roman empire. It was at first united in the same
                    province with Pamphylia; but in the reign of Theodosius it was constituted a
                    separate province.</p>
                <p>Almost the whole of Lycia is a rugged mountainous country, traversed by offshoots
                    and branches of the great range of Mount Taurus, which occupies the whole
                    interior or northern part of the district, and sends down to the sea great arms
                    or branches, constituting lofty promontories. The consequence is that the coast,
                    though less broken and irregular than that of Caria, is indented by a succession
                    of bays,—the most marked of which is that called in ancient times the Glaucus
                    Sinus, now the Gulf of Macri, in the extreme west of the province, and
                    separating Lycia from Caria. A number of smaller bays, and broken rocky
                    headlands, with a few small islets lying off them, constitute the coast-line
                    from thence to the south-eastern promontory of Lycia, formed by a long narrow
                    tongue of rocky hill, known in ancient times as the Sacred Promontory, with
                    three small adjacent islets, called the Chelidonian islands, which was regarded
                    by some ancient geographers as the commencement of Mount Taurus—an opinion
                    justly controverted by Strabo. But it really forms an important point in the
                    geography of Asia Minor, where the coast trends abruptly to the north till it
                    reaches the confines of Pamphylia. It was believed by Strabo to be directly
                    opposite to Canopus in Egypt, and to be the point where the interval between the
                    two continents was the shortest.</p>
                <p>Though the mountain ranges of Lycia may all be considered as in reality offshoots
                    of Mount Taurus, several of them in ancient times were distinguished by separate
                    names. Such were Mount Daedala in the west, adjoining the Gulf of Macri, Mount
                    Cragus on the sea-coast, west of the valley of the Xanthus, and Mount Massicytus
                    nearly in the centre of the region, rising to a height of 10,000 feet, while
                    Mount Solyma in the extreme east, above Phaselis, rises abruptly from the sea to
                    an elevation of 7800 feet. The steep and rugged pass between this mountain and
                    the sea, called the Climax, or Ladder, was the only direct communication between
                    Lycia and Pamphylia.</p>
                <p>The only two considerable rivers in Lycia are (1) the Xanthus, which descends
                    from the central mass of Mount Taurus, and flows through a narrow valley till it
                    reaches the city of the same name, below which it forms a plain of some extent
                    before reaching the sea, and (2) the Limyrus, which enters the sea near Limyra.
                    The Arycandus and the Andriacus, which are intermediate between the two, are
                    much less considerable streams, and do not flow from the central chain. The
                    small alluvial plains at the mouths of these rivers are the only level ground in
                    Lycia; but the slopes of the hills that rise from thence towards the mountains
                    are covered with a rich arborescent vegetation of the most beautiful character.
                    (See the description of it by Forbes, quoted in <hi rend="smallcaps">Asia
                    Minor,</hi> vol. ii. p. 709.) The upper valleys and mountain sides afford good
                    pasture for sheep, and the main range of Mount Taurus encloses several extensive
                    <hi rend="italic">yailahs</hi> or upland basin-shaped valleys of the peculiar
                    kind so characteristic of that range throughout its extent (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Asia Minor,</hi> p. 704).</p>
                <p>It is very difficult to determine the limits of Lycia towards the interior; and
                    the boundary seems to have varied repeatedly at different times. The high and
                    cold upland tract to the north-east, called Milyas (which was supposed to retain
                    some remains of the aboriginal population of Lycia), was by some writers
                    included in that province, though it is naturally more connected with Pisidia. A
                    similar tract to the west of this, and also situated to the north of the
                    watershed of Mount Taurus, was termed Cabalia; but this had no natural connexion
                    with Lycia, nor was in early times ever politically united with it, the four
                    cities that were situated in this region—Cibyra, with its dependent towns of
                    Oenoanda, Balbura, and Bubon— having always formed a separate league or
                    Tetrapolis, which had no connexion with the Lycian league. It was not till after
                    their annexation to Rome that Cibyra, with the district adjoining it, termed the
                    Cibyratis, was united to Phrygia, while the three other towns above enumerated
                    were annexed to Lycia.</p>
                <p>According to Artemidorus (whose authority is followed by Strabo), the towns that
                    formed the Lycian league in the days of its integrity were twenty-three in
                    number; but Pliny tells us that Lycia once possessed seventy towns, of which
                    only twenty-six remained in his day. Recent researches have fully confirmed the
                    fact that, notwithstanding its rugged character, the sea-coast and the valleys
                    that ran up into the interior were thickly studded with towns, which in many
                    cases are proved by existing remains to have been places of considerable
                    importance. The names have been for the most part identified by means of
                    inscriptions, and we are thus enabled to fix the position of the greater part of
                    the cities that are mentioned in ancient authors. On the Gulf of Glaucus, near
                    the frontiers of Caria, stood Telmessus, an important place, while a short
                    distance from it in the interior were the small towns of Daedala and Cadyanda.
                    At the entrance of the valley of the Xanthus were Patara, Xanthus itself, and, a
                    little higher up, Pinara on the west and Tlos on the east side of the valley,
                    while Araxa stood at the head of the valley, just at the foot of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0109-0094"/> the pass leading into the interior. Sidyma, on
                    the slope of Mount Cragus, seems also to have borne the name of the mountain, as
                    was also the case with Massicytus, if there was really a city of the name at
                    all. Myra, one of the most important cities of Lycia, occupied the entrance of
                    the valley of the Andriacus; on the coast between this and the mouth of the
                    Xanthus stood Antiphellus, while in the interior, at a short distance, were
                    found Phellus, Cyaneae, and Candyba. In the alluvial plain formed by the outlets
                    of the rivers Arycandus and Limyrus stood Limyra, and encircling the same bay
                    the three small towns of Rhodiapolis, Corydalla, and Gagae. Arycanda commanded
                    the upper valley of the river of the same name. On the east coast stood Olympus,
                    one of the cities of the league, though it could never have been more than a
                    small town, while Phaselis, a little farther north, which was a much more
                    important place, never belonged to the Lycian league, and appears to have always
                    maintained an independent position. We have thus in all twenty-one towns of
                    which the sites have been ascertained, but the occurrence of other considerable
                    ruins, to which no names can be attached with any certainty, confirms the
                    statement of Pliny as to the great number of the Lycian towns.</p>
                <p>The cold upland district of the Milyas appears never to have contained any town
                    of importance. Podalia seems to have been its chief place. Between the Milyas
                    and the Pamphylian Gulf was the lofty mountain range of Solyma, which was
                    supposed to derive its name from the Solymi, a people mentioned by Homer in
                    connexion with the Lycians and the story of Bellerophon. No such name was known
                    in historical times as an ethnic appellation, but they were supposed by some
                    writers to be the same people with the Milyans, while others regard them as a
                    distinct people of Semitic origin. It was in the flank of this mountain, near a
                    place called Deliktash, that the celebrated fiery source called the Chimaera,
                    which gave rise in ancient times to so many fables, was found. It has been
                    visited in modern times by Captain Beaufort, Messrs Spratt and Forbes, and other
                    travellers, but is merely a stream of inflammable gas issuing from crevices in
                    the rocks, such as are found in several places in the Apennines. No traces of
                    recent volcanic action exist in Lycia.</p>
                <p>Few parts of Asia Minor were less known in modern times than Lycia until a very
                    recent period. Captain Beaufort was the first to visit several places on the
                    sea-coast, and the remarkable rockhewn tombs of Telmessus had been already
                    described by Dr Clarke, but it was Sir Charles Fellows who first discovered and
                    drew attention to the extraordinary richness of the district in ancient remains,
                    especially of a sepulchral character. His two visits to the country, in 1838 and
                    1840, were followed by a more regular expedition sent out by the British
                    Government in 1842 for the purpose of transporting to England the valuable
                    monuments now in the British Museum, while Lieutenant (now Admiral) Spratt and
                    Professor Edward.Fθrbes explored the interior of the district, and laid down its
                    physical features on an excellent map. The monuments thus brought to light are
                    certainly among the most interesting of any that have been discovered in Asia
                    Minor, and, while showing the strong influence of Greek art, both in their
                    architecture and sculpture, prove also the existence of a native architecture of
                    wholly distinct origin, especially in the rock-cut tombs, some of which present
                    a strange resemblance to our English Elizabethan style, while others distinctly
                    evince their derivation from the simple construction of the mud and timber built
                    cottages of the natives. But the theatres that are found in almost every town,
                    some of them of very large size, are alone sufficient to attest the pervading
                    influence of Greek civilization; and this is confirmed by the sculptures, which
                    are for the most part wholly Greek. None of them, indeed, can be ascribed to a
                    very early period, and hardly any trace can be found of the influence of
                    Assyrian or other Oriental art.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting results of these recent researches has been the
                    discovery of numerous inscriptions in the native language of the country, and
                    written in a character, or at least an alphabet, before unknown, and which
                    appears to have been peculiar to Lycia. A few of these inscriptions are
                    fortunately bilingual, in Greek and Lycian, which has afforded a clue to their
                    partial interpretation, and the investigations of Mr Daniel Sharpe in the first
                    instance, followed by the more mature essays of Moritz Schmidt and Savelsberg,
                    have established the fact that the Lycian language belonged to the great Aryan
                    family, and had close affinities with the Zend. The alphabet in which the
                    inscriptions are written is obviously derived from the Greek, no less than
                    twenty-four of the letters being identical, while most of the additional letters
                    appear to have been invented in order to express vowel sounds which were not
                    distinguished in Greek. None of the Lycian inscriptions, however, any more than
                    the sculptures, can lay claim to a high antiquity. It is remarkable that the
                    Greek alphabet upon which it was founded appears not to have been the Ionic
                    alphabet which was in general use in Asia Minor, but was more akin to the Doric
                    alphabet in use in the Peloponnese.</p>
