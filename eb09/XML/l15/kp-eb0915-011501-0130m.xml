                    reached England in the following year, it was described by General Davies as
                    forming a new genus of birds, in a paper read before the Linnean Society of
                    London, November 4, 1800, and subsequently published in that Society’s <hi

                    but Latham, who considered it a Gallinaceous bird, in 1801 knew of only five
                    having arrived. The temporary cessation of hostilities in 1802 permitted
                    Vieillot to become acquainted with this form, though not apparently with any
                    published notice of it, and he figured and described it in a supplement to his

                <p>It would be needless here to enter at any length on the various positions which
                    have been assigned to this singular form by different systematizers—who had to
                    judge merely from its superficial characters. The first to describe any portion
                    of its anatomy was Eyton, who in 1841 <hi rend="italic">{Ann. Hat. History,</hi>
                    vii. pp. 49-53) perceived that it was truly a member of the Order then called

                    take advantage of this step in the right direction. In 1867 Professor Huxley

                    was partially adopted in the following year by Garrod, who <hi rend="italic"

                    is corroborated by Mr Sclater, who has recently <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi>
                    1880, p. 345) recognized at once the alliance and distinctness of the Families

                    of them a group which he calls <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscines.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the appearance in 1865 of Gould’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook to the Birds
                    of Australia,</hi> little if any fresh information has been published concerning
                    the habits of this form, and the account therein given must be drawn upon for
                    what here follows. Of all birds, says that author, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Menura</hi> is the most shy and hard to procure. He has been among the rocky
                    and thick “brushes ”—its usual haunts—hearing its loud and liquid call-notes for
                    days together without getting sight of one. Those who wish to see it must
                    advance only while it is occupied in singing or scratching up the earth and
                    leaves; and to watch its actions they must keep perfectly still—though where
                    roads have been made through the bush it may be more often observed and even
                    approached on horseback. The best way of procuring an example seems to be by
                    hunting it with dogs, when it will spring upon a branch to the height of 10 feet
                    and afford an easy shot ere it has time to ascend further or escape as it does
                    by leaps. Another method of stealing upon it is said to be practised by the
                    natives, and is attained by the hunter fixing on his head the erected tail of a
                    cock-bird, which alone is allowed to be seen above the brushwood. The greater
                    part of its time is said to be passed upon the ground, and seldom are more than
                    a pair to be found in company. One of the habits of the cock is to form small
                    round hillocks, which he constantly visits during the day, mounting upon them
                    and displaying his tail by erecting it over his head, drooping his wings,
                    scratching and pecking at the soil, and uttering various cries—some his own
                    natural notes, others an imitation of those of other animals. The wonderful
                    tail, his most characteristic feature, only attains perfection in the bird’s
                    third or fourth year, and then not until the month of June, remaining until
                    October, when the feathers are shed to be renewed the following season. The food
                    consists of insects, especially beetles and myriapods, as well as snails. The
                    nest is always placed near to or on the ground, at the base of a rock or foot of
                    a tree, and is closely woven of fine but strong roots or other fibres, and lined
                    with feathers, around all which is heaped a mass, in shape of an oven, of
                    sticks, grass, moss, and leaves, so as to project over and shelter the interior
                    structure, while an opening in the side affords entrance and exit. Only one egg
                    is laid, and this of rather large size in proportion to the bird, of a
                    purplish-grey colour, suffused and blotched with dark purplish-brown.<note

                <p>Incubation is believed to begin in July or August, and the young is hatched about
                    a month later. It is at first covered with white down, and appears to remain for
                    some weeks in the nest. How much more is needed to be known for a biography of
                    this peculiar and beautiful creature may be inferred by those who are aware of
                    the diligence with which the habits of the much more easily observed birds of
                    the northern hemisphere have been recorded, and of the many interesting points
                    which they present. It is greatly to be hoped that so remarkable a form as the
                    Lyre-bird, the nearly sole survivor apparently of a very ancient race of beings,
                    will not be allowed to become extinct—its almost certain fate so far as can be
                    judged—without many more observations of its manners being made and fuller
                    details of them placed on record. The zoologists of Australia alone can -do
                    this, and the zoologists of other countries expect that they will.</p>
                <p>Several examples of <hi rend="italic">Menura</hi> have been brought alive to
                    Europe, but none have long survived in captivity. Indeed a bird of such active
                    habits, and requiring doubtless facilities for taking violent exercise, could
                    not possibly be kept long in confinement until the method of menageries is
                    vastly improved, as doubtless will be the case some day, and, we may hope,
                    before the disappearance from the face of the earth of forms of vertebrate life
                    most instructive to the zoologist.</p>
                <p>Three species of <hi rend="italic">Menura</hi> have been indicated—the old <hi

                    known for more than eighty years, which inhabits New South Wales, the southern
                    part of Queensland, and perhaps some parts of the colony of Victoria; <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">victoriae,</hi> separated from the former
                    by Gould <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Soc.,</hi> 1862, p. 23), and said to
                    take its place near Melbourne; and <hi rend="italic">Μ. alberti,</hi> first
                    described by C. L. Bonaparte <hi rend="italic">(Coηsp. Avium,</hi> i. p. 215) on
                    Gould’s authority, and, though discovered on the Richmond river in New South
                    Wales, having apparently a more northern range than the other two. All those
                    have the apparent bulk of a hen Pheasant, but are really much smaller, and their
                    general plumage is of a sooty brown, relieved by rufous on the chin, throat,
                    some of the wing-feathers, and the tailcoverts. The wings, consisting of
                    twenty-one remiges, are rather short and rounded; the legs<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The metatarsals are very remarkable in form,
                    as already noticed by Eyton (Zoe. <hi rend="italic">cit.∖</hi> and their tendons

                    claws. In the immature and female the tail is somewhat long, though affording no
                    very remarkable character, except the possession of sixteen rectrices; but in
                    the fully-plumaged male of <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >superba</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">victoriae,</hi> it
                    is developed in the extraordinary fashion that gives the bird its common English
                    name. The two exterior feathers (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a, b)</hi> have the
                    outer web very narrow, the inner very broad, and they curve at first outwards,
                    then somewhat inwards, and near the tip outwards again, bending round forwards
                    so as to present a lyre-like form. But this is not all; their broad inner web,
                    which is of a lively chestnut colour, is apparently notched at regular intervals
                    by spaces that, according to the angle at which they are viewed, seem either
                    black or transparent; and this effect is, on examination, found to be due to the
                    barbs <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n132/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0132-0117"/> at those spaces being destitute of barbules. The
                    middle pair of feathers (fig. 2, α, δ) is nearly as abnormal. These have no
                    outer web, and the inner web very narrow; near their base they cross each other,
                    and then diverge, bending round forwards near their tip. The remaining twelve
                    feathers (fig. 3) except near the base are very thinly furnished with barbs,
                    about a quarter of an inch apart, and those they possess, on their greater part,
                    though long and flowing, bear no barbules, and hence have a hair-like
                    appearance. The shafts of all are exceedingly strong. In the male of <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. alberti</hi> the tail is not only not lyriform, but the
                    exterior rectrices are shorter than the rest. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
