                    (λογογράφοι) and satirists of the post-Christian era, the silver age of Greek

                    precise date of his birth, but it is probable that he flourished about or after
                    the middle of the 2d century, as he mentions Marcus Aurelius and his war with
                    the German Marcomanni and Quadi (170-74 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> (§ 43). He tells us in the <hi rend="italic"

                    small he was at first apprenticed to his maternal uncle, a statuary, or rather
                    sculptor of the stone pillars called Hermae.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    disliked his uncle.</p></note> When a schoolboy he had been in the habit of

                    unlucky beginning by breaking a marble slab, and having been well beaten for it,
                    he absconded and returned home. Here he had a dream or vision of two women,
                    representing Statuary and Literature. Both plead their cause at length, setting
                    forth the advantages and the prospects of their respective professions; but the
                    youth chooses Παιδεία, and decides to pursue learning. For some time he seems to
                    have made money as a <hi rend="italic">pητωp,</hi> following the example of
                    Demosthenes, on whose merits and patriotism he expatiates in the dialogue <hi

                    his numerous writings that he was very familiar with the rival schools of
                    philosophy, and he must have well studied their teachings; but he lashes them
                    all alike, the Cynics, perhaps, being the chief object of his derision.<note

                    valued at <hi rend="italic">twopence</hi> (§ 11). That Lucian had practised in
                    law courts, and turned his eloquence afterwards against the philosophers, is
                    asserted in <hi rend="italic">Piscat.,</hi> § 25.</p></note> A large number of
                    philosophers, both ancient and contemporary, are mentioned by name, nearly
                    always in ridicule or disparagement. Lucian was not only a sceptic; he was a
                    scoffer and a downright unbeliever. He felt that men’s actions and conduct
                    always fall far short of their professions, and therefore he concluded that the
                    professions themselves were worthless, and a mere guise to secure popularity or
                    respect. Of Christianity he shows some knowledge, and it must have been somewhat
                    largely professed in Syria at the close of the 2d century.<note anchored="true"

                    to have come from the same source, though the notion of a written catalogue of

                    Euripides.</p>
                <p>As a satirist and a wit Lucian stands without a rival. In these respects he may
                    be said to occupy in prose literature the unique position which Aristophanes
                    holds in Greek poetry. But whether he is a mere satirist, who laughs while he
                    lashes, or a misanthrope, who hates while he derides, is not very clear. In
                    favour of the former view it may be said that the two main objects of his
                    ridicule are mythology and the sects of philosophy; in favour of the latter, his
                    bitter exposure of imposture and chicanery in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexander,</hi> and the very severe attacks he makes on the “humbug” of
                    philosophy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At p. 792

                    In <hi rend="italic">Icarornenippus</hi> (§ 5) he says he always guessed who
                    were the best physical philosophers “by their sour-faced looks, their paleness
                    of complexion, and the length of their beards.” See also <hi rend="italic"
                    >ibid.,</hi> § 29.</p></note> which he everywhere assails with the most
                    acrimonious and contemptuous epithets.</p>
                <p>As a writer Lucian is fluent, easy, and unaffected, and a close follower of the
                    best Attic models, such as Plato and the orators. His style is simpler than
                    Plutarch’s, and some of his compositions, especially the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues of the Gods</hi> (pp. 204-287) and <hi rend="italic">of the Marine
                    Deities</hi> (288-327), and, above all, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of the
                    Dead</hi> (329-454), are models of witty, polished, and accurate Greek
                    composition. Not less clever, though rather lax in morality, are the <hi
                    rend="italic">ίταιρικοί διάλογοι</hi><hi rend="italic">(pp.</hi> 280-325), which
                    remind us somewhat of the letters of Alciphron. The sarcasms on the popular
                    mythology, the conversations of Pluto, Hermes, Charon, and others of the powers
                    in Hades, show a positive disbelief of any future state of existence. The model
                    Lucian followed in these dialogues, as well in the style as in the sparkling and
                    playful repartee, was the Platonic conversations, founded on the drama, of which
                    the dialogue may be called the prose representative. Aristotle never adopted it,
                    perhaps regarding it as beneath the true dignity of philosophy. The dialogue, in
                    fact, was revived and improved by Lucian,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He says (speaking as 2υpos in <hi rend="italic">Bis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">accusatus,</hi> § 34) that he found dialogue somewhat out of
                    repute from the too numerous questions <hi rend="italic">{j.e.,</hi> employed by
                    Plato), and brought it up to a more human and natural standard, substituting
                    banter and repartee for dialectic quibbles and close logical
                    reasoning.</p></note> the old traditions of the λoγoτroιoi and <hi rend="italic"
                    >λογογράφοι,</hi> and above all, the immense influence of rhetoric as an art,
                    having thrown some discredit on a style of composition which, as introduced by
                    Plato, had formed quite a new era in Greek prose composition. For rhetoric loved
                    to talk, expatiate, and declaim, while dialectic strove to refute by the
                    employment of question and answer, often in the briefest form.</p>
                <p>In his language, as tested by the best classical models, Lucian is at once
                    elegant and correct. But he occasionally indulges in idioms slightly solecistic,
                    as in the use of <hi rend="italic">κu,v</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n56/mode/1up"

                    misplaced or wrongly added, and a subjunctive mood instead of an optative.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus in p. 591, <hi

                    laws of Attic Greek.</p></note> Nevertheless, he evinces a perfect mastery over
                    a language as wonderful in its inflexions as in its immense and varied
                    vocabulary; and it is a well-merited praise of the author to say that to a good
                    Greek scholar the pages of Lucian are almost as easy and as entertaining as an
                    English or French novel. In this respect they form a contrast with the somewhat
                    “crabbed” style of Plutarch, many of whose moral treatises are by no means easy
                    reading.</p>
                <p>Of course Greek, like every other language, is progressive, and the notion of
                    fixing it to any given period as absolutely the best is quite arbitrary. We
                    shall not be surprised at finding in Lucian some forms and compounds which were
                    not in use in the time of Plato or Demosthenes. Thus, he has <hi rend="italic"
                    >ΰπερείδει.&lt;;</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vτrepopa&lt;s</hi> (p. 99), <hi
                    rend="italic">τrεπeμμεvo&lt;s</hi> as the participle of the perfect passive of
                    <hi rend="italic">ττεμπω</hi> (p. 240), εvσ∈σ∈ικε the perfect of ∈Vσειω (p.
                    705), to which a purist would object; and there are occasional tendencies to
                    Latinism which can hardly surprise us. From a writer living under Roman rule we
                    may expect some Latin words in his vocabulary, as ≤ακ∈pδως for <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sacerdos,</hi> and Roman names like Μάγνος, Keλσoς, K∈λτyp <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Celer),</hi> 'Ρουτιλλίανος, etc. In the <hi rend="italic">Lexiphanes</hi> a
                    long passage is read from a treatise composed in words of the strangest and most
                    out of-the-way form and sound, on hearing which Lucian pretends to be almost
                    driven crazy (p. 342). His own sentiments on the propriety of diction are shown
                    by his reproof to Lexiphanes (§ 24), “if anywhere you have picked up an
                    out-of-the-way word, or coined one which you think good, you labour to adapt the
                    sense of it, and think it a loss if you do not succeed in dragging it in
                    somewhere, even when it is not really wanted.” The free use of such a

                <p>Lucian founded his style, or obtained his fluency, from the successful study of
                    rhetoric, by which he appears to have made a good income from composing speeches
                    which attracted much attention.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    lucrative office in Egypt. When he “all but had one foot in Charon’s boat” (he
                    says in <hi rend="italic">Apologia,</hi> § 1), “he lent his neck to be bound by
                    a golden collar.” This office was to register the actionsand verdicts of the law
                    courts,—he was a kind of “Master of the Rolls,” who had the custody of the state
                    documents, and received his salary directly from the king <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.,</hi> § 12). He speaks of the emoluments as oυ <hi rend="italic"
                    >σμu&lt;pος μιxrθδς</hi> αλλά πολυτάλαντος. We do not know the date of Lucian’s
                    death, but he may have lived till about 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>The extant works of this writer are so numerous that of some of the principal
                    only a short sketch can be given. To understand them aright we must remember
                    that the whole moral code, the entire “dutyof man,” was included, in the
                    estimation of the pagan Greek, in the various schools of philosophy. As these
                    were generally rivals, and the systems they taught were more or less directly
                    antagonistic, truth presented itself to the inquirer, not as one, but as
                    manifold. The absurdity and the impossibility of this forms the burden of all
                    Lucian’s writings. He could only form one conclusion, viz., that there is no
                    such a thing as truth.</p>
                <p>One of the best written and most amusing treatises of antiquity is Lucian’s <hi
                    rend="italic">True History,</hi> which forms a rather long narrative in two
                    books. It is composed, he says in a brief introduction, not only as a pastime
                    and a diversion from severer studies, but avowedly as a satire <hi rend="italic"
                    >(οiκ ακωμωδητως,</hi> p. 71) on the poets and logograplιers who have written so
                    many marvellous tales, πολλά τεράστια και <hi rend="italic">μυθώδη.</hi> He
                    names Ctesias and Homer; but Hellanicus and Herodotus, perhaps other λoγoπoιoι
                    still earlier, appear to have been in his mind.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In p. 127 he says that he saw punished in
                    Hades, more severely than any other sinners, writers of false narratives, among
                    whom were Ctesias of Cnidus and Herodotus. Yet in the short essay inscribed <hi
                    rend="italic">Herodotus,</hi> p. 831, he wishes it were possible for him to
                    imitate the many excellencies of that writer.</p></note> The only true statement
                    in his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> he wittily says (p. 72), is that it

                <p>The main purport of the story is to describe a voyage to the moon. He set out, he
                    tells us, with fifty companions, in a well-provisioned ship, from the “Pillars
                    of Hercules,” intending to explore the western ocean. After eighty days rough
                    sailing they came to an island on which they found a Greek inscription, “This
                    was the limit of the expedition of Heracles and I)ionysus and the visit of the
                    wine-god seemed attested by some miraculous vines which they found there. After
                    leaving the island they were suddenly carried up, ship and all, by a whirlwind
                    into the air, and on the eighth day came in sight of a great round island
                    shining« with a bright light (p. 77), and lying a little above the moon. In a
                    short time they are arrested by a troop of gigantic “horse-vultures”
                    (ίππόγυποι), and brought as captives to the “man in the moon,” who proves to be
                    Endymion. He is engaged in a war with the inhabitants of the sun, which is ruled
                    by King Phaethon, the quarrel having arisen from an attempt to colonize the
                    planet Venus (Lucifer). The voyagers are enlisted as “Moonites,” and a long
                    description follows of the monsters and flying dragons engaged in the contest. A
                    fight ensues, in which the slaughter is so great that the very clouds are tinged
                    with red (p. 84). The long description of the inhabitants of the moon is
                    extremely droll and original, and has often been more or less closely imitated.
                    After descending safely into the sea, the ship is swallowed by a huge “sea
                    serpent” more than 100 miles long. The adventures during the long confinement in
                    the creature’s belly are most amusing; but at last they sail out through the
                    chinks between the monster’s teeth, and soon find themselves at the “Fortunate
                    Islands.” Here they meet with the spirits of heroes and philosophers of
                    antiquity, on whom the author expatiates at some length. The tale comes to an
                    abrupt end with an allusion to Herodotus in the promise that he “will tell the
                    rest in his next books.” The story throughout is written in easy and elegant
                    Greek, and shows the most fertile invention.</p>
                <p>Another curious and rather long treatise is entitled Λoυκιoς <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi> ovoς. The authorship is regarded as doubtful; the style, as it seems to
                    us, does not betray another hand. Parts of the story are coarse enough; the
                    point turns on one Lucius visiting in a Thessalian family, in which the lady of
                    the house was a sorceress. Having seen her changed into a bird by anointing
                    herself with some potent drug, he resolves to try a similar experiment on
                    himself, but finds that he has become an ass, retaining, however, his human
                    senses and memory. The mistake arose from his having filched the wrong ointment;
                    however, he is assured by the attendant, Palaestra, that if he can but procure
                    roses to eat, his natural form will be restored. In the night a party of bandits
                    break into the house and <pb break="no"

                    the back of the unfortunate donkey, who gets well beaten for stumbling on the
                    rough road. Seeing, as he fancies, some roses in a garden, he goes in quest of
                    them, and again gets beaten as a thief by the gardener (p. 585). After many
                    adventures with the bandits, he attempts to run away, but is caught. A council
                    is held, and he is condemned to die along with a captive girl who had essayed to
                    escape on his back. Suddenly, however, soldiers appear, and the bandits are
                    arrested (p. 595). Again the ass escapes “to the great and populous city of
                    Beroea in Macedonia” (p. 603). Here he is sold to a strolling conjurer,
                    afterwards to a marketgardener; and both experiences are alike painful. Again he
                    passes into the possession of a cook, wdιere he gets fat and sleek on food more
                    suited to his concealed humanity than the hard fare he has of late lived upon
                    (p. 614). At last, during an exhibition in the theatre, he sees some roses being
                    carried past, and, making a successful rush to devour them, he recovers his
                    former shape. “I am Lucius,” he •exclaims to the wondering president of the
                    exhibition, “and my brother’s name is Caius. It was a Thessalian witch that
                    changed me into a donkey.” Thus all ends well, and he returns safe to his
                    country. Droll and graphic as many of the adventures are, they but too clearly
                    show the profligate morals of the age.</p>
                <p>The treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Syrian Goddess</hi> (Mylitta, the
                    moongoddess, the Semitic Venus) is written in the Ionic dialect in imitation
                    perhaps of the style of Herodotus, though the resemblance is by no means close.
                    The writer professes to be an Assyrian (p. 452), and to describe the wonders in
                    the various temples of Palestine and Syria; he descants on the eunuchs of Syria
                    and the origin of the self-imposed privation of manhood professed and practised
                    by the Galli. The account of the temples, altars, and sacrifices is curious, if
                    really authentic; after the manner of Pausanias it is little more than a list,
                    with the reasons in most cases added, or the origin of the custom explained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Horte Peregrini</hi> is a narrative of
                    one Proteus, a Cynic, who after professing various doctrines, and among them
                    those of Christianity, ended his own life by ascending a burning pyre (p. 357).
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The founder of the Christian religion is
                    described (p. 334) as “the man who had been crucified (or fixed to a stake,
                    αvασκoλo∙7rt&lt;r0∈i'τα) in Palestine,” and as one “still worshipped for having
                    introduced a new code of morals into life.” The zeal of the early converts is
                    shown by their flocking to the prison when Proteus had been arrested, by the
                    sympathy conveyed from distant cities of Asia (p. 336), by contributions of
                    money for his support, and by their total indifference to life; for “the poor
                    wretches have persuaded themselves that they will live for ever.’’ The founder
                    of the religion, “that first lawgiver of theirs,” says Lucian, “made them
                    believe that they are all brothers when once they have abjured the gods of
                    Greece and worshipped the crucified man who is their teacher, and have begun to
                    live according to his laws” (p. 337).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bis</hi><hi rend="italic">accusatus</hi> is a dialogue
                    commencing with a satire on the folly of the popular notion that the gods alone
                    are happy. Zeus is represented as disproving this by enumerating the many and
                    heavy duties that fall to their lot in the government of the world, and Hermes
                    remarks on the vast crowds of philosophers of rival sects, by whose influence
                    the respect and worship formerly paid to the gods have seriously declined. A
                    trial is supposed to be held under the presidency of the goddess Δύο?, between
                    the Academy, the Porch, the schools of the Cynics and Epicureans, and Pleasure,
                    Revelry, Virtue, Luxury, &lt;frc,, as variously impugned or defended by them.
                    Then Conversa tion and Rhetoric come before the court, each having an action for
                    defamation to bring against Syrus the essayist, who of course is Lucian himself
                    (p. 823). His defence is heard against the charges of both, and in both cases he
                    is triumphantly acquitted. This essay is brilliant from its clever parodies of
                    Plato and Demosthenes, and the satire on the Socratic method of arguing by short
                    questions and answers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lover of Lying (Φιλοψeυ⅛-ης)</hi> discusses the reason why
                    some persons seem to take pleasure in falsehood for its own sake, and when there
                    is nothing to be gained by it. Under the category of lying all mythology <hi
                    rend="italic">(eg.,</hi> that of Homer and Hesiod) is included, and the question
                    is asked, why the hearers of such stories are amused by them? Quack remedies,
                    charms, and miraculous cures are included among the most popular kinds of
                    falsehood; witchcraft, spiritualism, exorcism, expulsion of devils, spectres,
                    are discussed in turn, and a good ghost story is told in p. 57. An anecdote is
                    given of Democritus, who, to show his disbelief in ghosts, had shut himself up
                    in a tomb, and when some young men, dressed up with death’s heads, came to
                    frighten him at night, and suddenly appeared to him while he was engaged in
                    writing, he did not even look up, but called out to them, “Stop your joking” (p.
                    59). This treatise, a very interesting one, concludes with the reflexion that
                    truth and sound reason are the only remedies for vain and superstitious
                    terrors.</p>
                <p>The dialogue <hi rend="italic">Navigium seu</hi><hi rend="italic">Vota</hi>
                    (Πλοίον <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">eνχαC)</hi> gives an
                    apparently authentic account of the measurements and fittings of an Egyptian
                    ship which has arrived with a cargo of corn at the Piraeus, driven out of its
                    course to Italy by adverse winds. The full length is 180 feet, the breadth
                    nearly 50, the depth from deck to the bottom of the hold 43 feet. The “wishes”
                    turn on a party of friends, who have been to see the ship, declaring what they
                    would most desire to possess. One would have the ship filled with gold, another
                    a fine house with gold plate; a third would be a “tyrant” with a large force
                    devoted to his interests; a fourth would like to make himself invisible, enter
                    any house that he pleased, and be transported through the air to the objects of
                    his affection. After hearing them all, the first speaker, Lycinus (Lucian), says
                    that he is content with the privilege of laughing heartily at the vanity of
                    human wishes, especially when they are those of professed philosophers.</p>
                <p>The dialogue between Philo and Lycinus, <hi rend="italic">Convivium sen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lapithae,</hi> is a very amusing description of a banquet, at
                    which a party of dignified philosophers quarrelled over their viands at a
                    marriage feast, and came to blows. The style is a good imitation of Plato, and
                    the scene reminds one of the “clients’ dinner” in the fifth satire of Juvenal.
                    One of the party is so irritated by taunts that he flings a goblet half full of
                    wine at the head of another, who retorts by spitting in the face of the
                    aggressor (p. 441). Matters come to a climax by the attempt of one of the
                    guests, Zenothemis, to secure for himself a fatter fowl which had been served to
                    his next neighbour Hermon. Each seizes his bird and hits the other with it in
                    the face, at the same time pulling his beard. Then a general fight ensues, and
                    serious wounds are inflicted. The story is, of course, a satire on philosophy,
                    the favourite topic of a writer who believed neither in gods nor in men.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Piscator,</hi> a dialogue between Lucian, Socrates,
                    Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato, and others, commences with a general attack on
                    the author as the enemy of philosophy. Socrates proposes that the culprit should
                    be tried, and that Philosophia should assist in the prosecution. Lucian declares
                    that he does not know where such a person lives, long as he has been looking for
                    her (§ 11). She is found at last, but declares Lucian has never disparaged <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It is open to controversy whether he was not a martyr

                <p>her, but only impostors and pretenders under her name (§ 15). He makes a long
                    defence (pp. 598-606), abusing the philosophers in the sort of language in which
                    some schools of theologians abuse the monks of the Middle Ages (§ 34). The trial
                    is held in the Acropolis of Athens, and the sham philosophers, dreading a
                    verdict against them, throw themselves from the rock. A Cynic flings away his
                    scrip in the hurry, and on examination it is found to contain, not books or
                    loaves of bread, but gold coins, dice, and fragrant essences (§ 44). The title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Fisherman</hi> is given to this witty treatise, because at
                    the end Lucian baits his hook with a fig and a gold coin, and catches gluttonous
                    strollers in the city while seated on the wall of the Acropolis.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Voyage Home</hi> (Κατάπλους) opens with the complaint that
                    Charon’s boat is kept waiting for Hermes, who soon appears with his troop of
                    ghosts to be ferried over the infernal river. Among them is a τύραννος, one
                    Megapenthes, who, as his name is intended to express, mourns greatly over the
                    life he has just left. Amusing appeals are made by other souls for leave to
                    return to life, and even bribes are offered to the presiding goddess of destiny,
                    but Clotho is, of course, inexorable. The moral of the piece is closely like
                    that of the parable of Dives and Lazarus: the rich and prosperous bewail their
                    fate, while the poor and afflicted find rest from their troubles, and have no
                    desire to return to them. The τύραννος here is the man clothed in purple and
                    fine linen, and Lucian shows the same bitter dislike of tyrants which Plato and
                    the tragic writers display. The heavy penalty is adj udged to Megapenthes that
                    he may ever remember in the other world the misdeeds done in life.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sale of Lives</hi> is an auction held by Zeus to see what
                    price the lives of philosophers of the rival sects will bring. A Pythagorean,
                    who speaks in the Ionic, first undergoes an examination as to what he can teach,
                    and this contains an enumeration of the doctrines usually ascribed to that sect,
                    including metempsychosis. He is valued at 7s. 6d., and is succeeded by Diogenes,
                    who avows himself the champion of truth, a cosmopolitan (§ 8), and the enemy of
                    pleasure. Socrates brings two talents, and is purchased by Dion, tyrant of
                    Syracuse (§ 19). Chrysippus, who gives some specimens of his clever

                    till he has fully considered the matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> is a very amusing and witty dialogue. The
                    misanthrope, once wealthy, has become a poor farmlabourer, and reproaches Zeus
                    for his indifference to the injustice of man. Zeus declares that the noisy
                    disputes in Attica have so disgusted him that he has not been there for a long
                    time (§ 9). He tells Hermes to conduct Plutus to visit Timon, and see what can
                    be done to help him. Plutus, who at first refuses to go, is persuaded after a
                    long conversation with Hermes, and Timon is found by them digging in his field
                    (§31). Poverty is unwilling to resign her votary to wealth; and Timon himself,
                    who has become a thorough misanthrope, objects to be made rich again, and is
                    with difficulty persuaded to turn up with his mattock a crock of gold coins. Now
                    that he has once more become rich, his former flatterers, who had long left him,
                    come cringing with their congratulations and respects, but they are all driven
                    off with broken heads or pelted with stones. Between this dialogue and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plutus</hi> of Aristophanes there are many close resemblances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hermotimus</hi> (pp. 739-831) is one of the longer dialogues,
                    Hermotimus, a student of the Stoic philosophy for twenty years (§ 2), and Lucian
                    (Lycinus) being the interlocutors. The long time—forty years at the
                    least—required for climbing up to the temple of virtue and happiness, and the
                    short span of life, if any, left for the enjoyment of it, are discussed. That
                    the greatest philosophers do not always attain perfect indifference, the Stoic
                    <hi rend="italic">ultimatum,</hi> is shown by the anecdote of one who dragged
                    his pupil into court to make him pay his fee (§ 9), and again by a violent
                    quarrel with another at a banquet (§11). Virtue is compared to a city with just,
                    and good, and contented inhabitants; but so many offer themselves as guides to
                    the right road to virtue that the inquirer is bewildered (§ 26). What is truth,
                    and who are the right teachers of it, still remains undetermined. The question
                    is argued at length, and illustrated by a peculiar custom of watching the pairs
                    of athletes and setting aside the reserved combatant (τrαp∈δpoς) at the Olympian
                    games by the marks on-the ballots (§§ 40-43). This, it is argued, cannot be done
                    till all the ballots have been examined; so a man cannot select the right way
                    till he has tried all the ways to virtue. But to know the doctrines of all the
                    sects is impossible in the term of a life (§ 49). To take a taste of each, like
                    trying a sample of wine, will not do, because the doctrines taught are not, like
                    the crock of wine, the same throughout, but vary or advance day by day (§ 59). A
                    suggestion is made (§ 68) that the searcher after truth should begin by taking
                    lessons in the science of discrimination, so as to be a good judge of truth
                    before testing the rival claims. But who is a good teacher of such a science? (§
                    70). The general conclusion of this well-argued inquiry is that philosophy is
                    not worth the pursuit. “If I ever again,” says Hermotimus, “meet a philosopher
                    on the road, I will shun him as I would a mad dog.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> or <hi rend="italic">False Prophet</hi> is a
                    severe exposure of a clever rogue who seems to have incurred the personal enmity
                    of Lucian (pp. 208-265). Born at Abonoteichus in Bithynia, a town on the
                    southern shore of the Euxine, he is denounced as having filled all the Roman
                    province of Asia with his villainy and plundering. Handsome, clever, and
                    unprincipled, he had been instructed in the arts of imposture by one of the
                    disciples of Apollonius of Tyana. Trusting to the natural credulity of Asiatics
                    (§ 9), he sets up an oracle in his native town, having buried some brazen
                    tablets which pretended that Aesculapius would be worshipped in a temple there.
                    A long account is given of the frauds and deceptions of this pretended
                    hierophant, and the narrative ends with his treacherous attempt to drown Lucian
                    off the coast of Amastris by a secret order given to the pilot,—a design which
                    was frustrated by the honesty of the man (§ 56).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anacharsis</hi> is a dialogue between Solon and the
                    Scythian philosopher, who has come to Athens on purpose to learn the nature of
                    the Greek institutions. Seeing the young men performing athletic exercises in
                    the Lyceum, he expresses his surprise at such a waste of energy and the
                    endurance of so much useless pain. This gives Socrates an opportunity of
                    descanting at length on training as a discipline, and emulation as a motive for
                    excelling. Love of glory, Solon says, is one of the chief goods in life. The
                    argument is rather ingenious and well put; the style reminds us of the minor
                    essays of Xenophon.</p>
                <p>In all, one hundred and twenty-four extant treatises of Lucian (excluding about
                    fifty epigrams and two iambic poems of no great merit) are considered genuine.
