                    was born in 1120, and was associated with his father on the death of his elder
                    brother Philip in 1131, being crowned at Rheims on October 25 by Pope Innocent
                    II. He succeeded to the undivided sovereignty in 1137, the news of his father’s
                    death reaching him as he was engaged at Poitiers in the festivities connected
                    with his unlucky marriage to Eleanor of Aquitania. In 1141 he made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to assert his rights as duke of Aquitania over the
                    countship of Toulouse, and in 1142 he fell into a vehement quarrel with Pope
                    Innocent II., who <pb break="no"

                    well brought-up young prince by appointing a nephew of his own to the
                    archbishopric of Bourges. In the course of the contest Louis, who had been
                    excommunicated, pursued the new archbishop into the territory of the count of
                    Champagne, and stormed Vitry, in the sack of which the cathedral was burned,
                    causing the death of three hundred persons who had taken refuge within its walls
                    (1143). Louis, horrorstruck, made peace with the pope and his secular adversary,
                    but found that nothing less than a pilgrimage to the Holy Land would suffice to
                    expiate his offence. The capture of Edessa and the massacre of the Christians in
                    1144 led to the preaching of the second crusade by St Bernard, and in 1147 the
                    king, leaving the regency in the hands of the Abbé Suger and Raoul, count of
                    Vermandois, set out for the East, accompanied by his queen, a large company of
                    nobles, and twenty-four thousand men. The disastrous results of the expedition,
                    personal, domestic, and public, have already been recorded in the article <hi
