                    imagination of his countrymen, and give expression to their highest ideal of
                    national life, he exactly hit their ordinary mood, and expressed the energetic,
                    critical, and combative temper which they carried into political and social
                    life. He was thus regarded as the most genuine literary representative of the
                    pure Roman spirit. The reputation which he enjoyed in the best ages of Roman
                    literature is proved by the terms in which Cicero and Horace speak of him.
                    Persius, Juvenal, and Quintilian vouch for the admiration with which he was
                    regarded in the first century of the empire. The popularity which he enjoyed in
                    his own time is attested by the fact that at his death in 102 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> although he had filled none of the offices of state,
                    he received the honour of a public funeral.</p>
                <p>His chief claim to distinction is his literary originality. He alone among Roman
                    writers established a new form of composition. He may be called the inventor of
                    poetical satire, as he was the first to impress upon the rude inartistic medley,
                    known to the Romans by the name of <hi rend="italic">satura,</hi> that character
                    of aggressive and censorious criticism of persons, morals, manners, politics,
                    literature, &amp;c., which the word satire has ever since denoted. In point of
                    form the satire of Lucilius owed nothing to the Greeks. It was a legitimate
                    development of an indigenous dramatic entertainment, popular among the Romans
                    before the first introduction of the forms of Greek art among them; and it seems
                    largely also to have employed the form of the familiar epistle which
                    circumstances had developed among them about the time when Lucilius flourished.
                    But the style, substance, and spirit of his writings were apparently as
                    c∙riginal as the form. He seems to have commenced his <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0060-0047"/> poetical career by ridiculing and parodying the
                    conventional language of epic and tragic poetry, and to have used in his own
                    writings the language commonly employed in the social intercourse of educated
                    men. Even his frequent use of Greek words, phrases, and quotations, reprehended
                    by Horace, was probably taken from the actual practice of men, powerfully
                    stimulated by the new learning, who found their own speech as yet inadequate to
                    give free expression to the new ideas and impressions which they derived from
                    their first contact with Greek philosophy, rhetoric, and poetry. Further, he not
                    only created a style of his own, but, instead of taking the substance of his
                    writings from Greek poetry, or from a remote past, he treated of the familiar
                    matters of daily life, of the personal interests and peculiarities of himself or
                    his contemporaries, of the politics, the wars, the government of the provinces,
                    the administration of justice, the fashions and tastes, the eating and drinking,
                    the money-making and money-spending, the scandals and vices, the airs and
                    affectations, which made up the public and private life of Rome in the· last
                    quarter of the second century before our era. This he did in a singularly frank,
                    independent, and courageous spirit, with no private ambition to serve, or party
                    cause to advance, but with an honest desire to expose the iniquity or
                    incompetence of the governing body, the sordid aims of the middle class, and the
                    corruption and venality of the city mob. There was nothing of stoical austerity
                    or of rhetorical indignation in the tone in which he treated the vices and
                    follies of his time. His character and tastes were much more akin to those of
                    Horace than of either Persius or Juvenal. But he was what Horace was not, a
                    thoroughly good hater; and he lived at a time when the utmost freedom of speech
                    and the most unrestrained indulgence of public and private animosity were the
                    characteristics of men who took a prominent part in affairs. Although Lucilius
                    took no active part in the public life of his time, he regarded it in the
                    spirit, not of a recluse or a mere student of books, but of a man of the world
                    and of society, as well as a man of letters. His ideal of public virtue and
                    private worth had been formed by intimate association with the greatest and best
                    of the soldiers and statesmen of an older generation.</p>
                <p>The dates assigned by Jerome for his birth and death are 148 and 103 or 102 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But it is impossible to reconcile the first of these
                    dates with other facts recorded of him. We learn from Velleius that he served
                    under Scipio at the siege of Numantia in the year 134 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> We learn from Horace that he lived on the most intimate terms of
                    friendship with Scipio and Laelius, and that he celebrated the exploits and
                    virtues of the former in his satires. Fragments of those books of his satires
                    which seem to have been first given to the world (books xxvi.-xxix.) clearly
                    indicate that they were written in tho lifetime of Scipio. Some of these bring
                    the poet before us as either corresponding with, or engaged in controversial
                    conversation with, his great friend. One line—</p>
                <p>“Percrepa pugnam Popilii, facta Comeli cane—”</p>
                <p>in which the defeat of M. Popillius Laenas, in 138 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> is contrasted with the subsequent success of Scipio, bears the stamp
                    of having been written while the news of the capture of Numantia was still
                    fresh. It is in the highest degree improbable that Lucilius served in the army
                    at the age of fourteen; it is still more unlikely that he could have been
                    admitted into the familiar intimacy of Scipio and Laelius at that age. It seems
                    a moral impossibility that between the age of fifteen and nineteen— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> i</hi>
                    between 133 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and 129 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b,c.,</hi> the year of Scipio’s death—he could have come before the world as
                    the author of an entirely new kind of composition, and one which, to be at all
                    successful, demands especially maturity of judgment and experience. It may
                    further be said that the well-known words of Horace, in which he characterizes
                    the vivid portraiture of his life, character, and thoughts, which Lucilius
                    bequeathed to the world,</p>
                <p>“quo fit ut omnis Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita senis,” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> lose much of their force unless <hi rend="italic"
                    >senis</hi> is to be taken in its ordinary sense,—which it cannot be if Lucilius
                    died at the age of forty-six. Two explanations have been given of the error. One
                    is that, from a similarity in the names of the consuls for the years 180 and 148
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Jerome had confused the one year with the other,
                    and thus that the date of the birth of Lucilius must be thrown back thirty-two
                    years. He would thus have been nearly fifty when he served at Numantia, and when
                    he first began to write satire. But the terms which Horace applies to the
                    intimacy of Lucilius and Scipio, such as “discincti ludere,” indicate the
                    relations of an older to a much younger man; and the verve and tone of his
                    satires are those of a man not so far advanced in years as he would have been if
                    born in the year 180 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> A simpler explanation of the
                    error is supported by Mr Munro, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of
                    Philology</hi>, No/xvi, He supposes that Jerome must have written the words
                    “anno xlvi” for “anno lxiv” or “lxvi”; which would make the birth of Luailius
                    eighteen or twenty years earlier than that usually assigned. Lucilius would thus
                    have been about thirty-three or thirty-five years of age when he served at
                    Numantia, and two or three years older when he gave his first satires to the
                    world. As he lived for about thirty years longer, and as he seems to have
                    continued the composition of his satires during most of what remained of his
                    life, and as it was his practice to commit to them all his private thoughts, the
                    words of Horace would naturally and truthfully describe the record of his
                    observation and experience between the age of thirty-five and his death. His
                    birthplace was Suessa Aurunca in Campania, from which circumstance Juvenal
                    describes him as “magnus Auruncae alumnus.” He belonged to the equestrian order,
                    a fact indicated by Horace’s notice of himself as “infra Lucili censum.” He was
                    granduncle to Pompey, on the mother’s side. Though not himself belonging to any
                    of the great senatorian families, he was in a position to associate with them on
                    equal terms, and to criticize them with independence. And this circumstance
                    contributed to the boldness, originality, and thoroughly national character of
                    his literary work, Had he been a “semi-Graecus,” like Ennius and Pacuvius, or of
                    humble origin, like Plautus, Terence, or Accius, he would scarcely have
                    ventured, at a time when the senatorian power was strongly in the ascendant, to
                    revive the rôle which had proved disastrous to Naevius; nor would he have had
                    the intimate knowledge of the political and social life of his day which fitted
                    him to be its painter. Another* circumstance determining the bent of his mind to
                    satire was the character of the time in 'which he began the work of his life.
                    The origin of Roman political and social satire is to be traced to the same
                    disturbing and disorganizing forces which led to the revolutionary projects and
                    legislation of the Gracchi.</p>
                <p>The remains of Lucilius extend to about eleven hundred lines. But much the
                    largest number of his fragments are unconnected lines, preserved by late
                    grammarians, as illustrative of peculiar verbal usages. He was, for his time, a
                    voluminous as well as a very discursive writer. He left behind him thirty books
                    of satires, and there is reason to believe that each book, like the books of
                    Horace and Juvenal, was composed of different pieces. The order in which they
                    were known to the grammarians was not that in which they were written. The
                    earliest in order of composition were probably <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    “And so it happens that the whole life of the old man stands clearly before us,
                    as if it were represented on a votive picture.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0061-0048"/> those numbered from xxvi. to xxix., which were
                    written in the trochaic and. iambic metres that had been employed by Ennius and
                    Pacuvius in their <hi rend="italic">Saturae.</hi> In these he made those
                    criticisms on the older tragic and epic poets of which Horace and other ancient
                    writers speak. In them too he speaks of the Numantine War as recently finished,
                    and of Scipio as still living. Book i., on the other hand, in which the
                    philosopher Carneades, who died in 128 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is spoken
                    of as dead, must have been written after the death of Scipio. With the exception
                    of books xxvi.-xxix., and one satire in which he seems to have made an
                    experiment in the unfamiliar elegiac metre, all the satires of Lucilius were
                    written in hexameters. So far as an opinion can be formed from a number of
                    unconnected fragments, he seems to have written the trochaic tetrameter with a
                    smoothness, clearness, and simplicity which he never attained in handling the
                    hexameter. The longer fragments produce the impression of great discursiveness
                    and carelessness, but at the same time of considerable force. The words of
                    Horace, “fluere lutulentum,” seem exactly to express the character of his style.
                    He appears, in the composition of his various pieces, to have followed no
                    settled plan, but to have treated everything that occurred to him in the most
                    desultory fashion, sometimes adopting the form of dialogue, sometimes that of an
                    epistle or an imaginary discourse, and often to have spoken in his own name,
                    giving an account of his travels and adventures, or of amusing scenes that he
                    had witnessed, or expressing the results of his private meditations and
                    experiences. Like Horace he largely illustrated his own observations by personal
                    anecdotes and fables. The fragments clearly show how often Horace has imitated
                    him, not only in expression, but in the form of his satires (see for instance i.
                    5 and ii. 2), in the topics which he treats of, and the class of social vices
                    and the types of character which he satirizes. For students of Latin literature,
                    the chief interest of studying the fragments of Lucilius consists in the light
                    which they throw on the aims and methods of Horace in the composition of his
                    satires, and, though not to the same extent, of his epistles. But they are
                    important also as materials for linguistic study; and they have a considerable
                    historical value as throwing light on the feeling, temper, circumstances, and
                    character of a most interesting time, of which there is scarcely any other
                    contemporary record.</p>
                <p>The best edition of the <hi rend="italic">Fragments</hi> is that of L. Miiller
                    (1872). A collection of them by Lachmann has appeared since his death. The
                    emendation of these fragments still employs the ingenuity of both German and
                    English scholars. Important contributions to the subject have been made by Mr
