                <p>Lucius I., whose pontificate of about eight months (253-54) fell between those of
                    Cornelius and Stephen I., had been one of the presbyters who accompanied
                    Cornelius when he withdrew from Rome. After his own election also he appears to
                    have lived for some time in exile, but ultimately to have been permitted to
                    return. No facts of his official life have been recorded, but he is referred to
                    in several letters of .Cyprian as having been in agreement with his predecessor
                    Cornelius in preferring the milder view on the question as to how the penitent
                    lapsed should be treated. The manner of his death is uncertain; according to
                    some accounts he was decapitated. In the <hi rend="italic">Catalogus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Liberiamιs</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Corbeiensis</hi> he is said to have been pope for more than three
                    years; but there can be no doubt of the correctness of the statement of
                    Eusebius, that his pontificate was of less than eight months’ duration. Like all
                    the early popes he has been canonized in the Church of Rome; and he is
                    commemorated as a martyr on March 4.</p>
                <p>Lucius II. (Gherardo de Caccianimici), a Bolognese, succeeded Celestine II. on
                    March 4, 1144. Soon after his accession the people of Rome chose a patrician,
                    for whom they claimed the temporal sovereignty; Lucius at the head of the
                    oligarchical party appealed to arms, and perished in an attempt to storm the
                    Capitol on February 25, 1145. He was succeeded by Eugenius III.</p>
                <p>Lucius III. (Ubaldo Allucingoli), a native of Lucca, was bishop of Ostia and
                    Velletri when he was chosen to succeed Alexander III. on September 1, 1181. For
                    six months he lived at Rome, but in March 1182 he was driven forth by rebellion,
                    and resumed his abode at Velletri; he afterwards lived at Anagni, and finally at
                    Verona. While at the last-named place he pronounced sentence of excommunication
                    against the Cathari, Paterines, Humiliati, Waldensians, and Arnoldists in 1184;
                    but “left the papal thunders to their own unaided effects.” He died at Verona on
                    November 25, 1185, and was succeeded by Urban III.</p>
