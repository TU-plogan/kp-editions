                    long. Situated 50 feet above the level of the sea, in the valley of the Serchio,
                    the city looks out for the most part on a horizon of hills and mountains. The
                    fortifications—pierced by four gates—were commenced in 1504 and completed in
                    1645, and long ranked among the most remarkable in the peninsula. The city has a
                    well-built and substantial appearance, its chief attraction lying in the
                    numerous churches, which belong in the main to a well-marked basilican type, and
                    present richly decorated exteriors, fine apsidal ends, and quadrangular
                    campaniles. The cathedral or church of St Martin was begun in 1063 by Bishop
                    Anselm; but the great apse with its tall columnar arcades is probably the only
                    remnant of the early edifice. The west front, “built during the first forty
                    years of the 13th century, consists of a vast portico of three magnificent
                    arches, and above them three ranges of open galleries covered with all the
                    devices of an exuberant fancy.” The ground plan is a Latin cross, the nave being
                    273 feet in length and 84 feet in width, and the transepts 117 feet in length.
                    In the nave is a little octagonal temple or chapel built (1484) by Matteo
                    Civitali, which serves as a shrine for the most precious of the Lucchese relics,
                    a cedar-wood crucifix, carved, according to the legend, by Nicodemus, and
                    miraculously conveyed to Lucca in 782. The Sacred <pb break="no"

                    built of marble within and without, has a lofty and magnificent western façade
                    (1188)—an architectural screen rising much above the roof of the church. St
                    Frediano or Frigidian dates originally from the 7th century; the front (of the
                    13th century) occupies the site of the ancient apse; in one of its chapels is
                    the tomb of Santa Zita, patroness of servants and of Lucca itself. San Giovanni
                    (originally of the 12th century), San Romano (rebuilt in the 17th century, by
                    Vincenzo Buonamici), and Santa Maria Forisportam (of the 13th century) also
                    deserve to be mentioned. Among the secular buildings are the old ducal palace,
                    begun in 1578 by Ammanati, and now the residence of the prefect and seat of the
                    provincial officers and the public picture gallery; the Palazzo Pretorio, or
                    former residence of the podesth, now the seat of the civil and correctional
                    courts; the palace, erected in the 15th century by a member of the great Guinigi
                    family, and now serving as a poorhouse; and the 16th century palace of the
                    Marquis Guidiccioni, now used as a depository for the archives. The principal
                    market-place in the city <hi rend="italic">{Piazza del</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercato)</hi> has taken possession of the arena of the ancient amphitheatre,
                    the arches of which can still be seen in the surrounding buildings. Besides the
                    academy of sciences just mentioned, which dates from 1584, there are several
                    institutions of the same kind—a royal philomathic academy, a royal academy of
                    arts, and a public library of 50,000 volumes. The silk manufacture, which was
                    introduced at Lucca about the close of the 11th century, and in the early part
                    of the 16th became for a time the means of subsistence for 30,000 of its
                    inhabitants, now gives employment (in reeling and throwing) to only about 1500.
                    The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture. Tn 1871 the city had
                    21,286 inhabitants. The commune has increased from 61,175 in 1834 to 68,063 in
                    1881.</p>
                <p>Lucca (Latin, <hi rend="italic">Luca)</hi> is probably a place of Ligurian
                    origin. First mentioned as the place to which Sempronius retired (218 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) before the victorious Hannibal, it passes out of
                    sight again till 177, when it became the seat of a Roman colony. In the time of
                    Julius Caesar it is frequently heard of as a town in his province of Cisalpine
                    Gaul and Liguria, to λvhich he repaired for consultation with his political
                    associates. By Augustus it was transferred to Etruria. Though plundered and
                    deprived of part of its territory by Odoacer, Lucca appears as an important city
                    and fortress at the time of N arses, and under the Lombards it λvas the
                    residence of a duke or marquis and had the privilege of a mint. The dukes
                    gradually extended their power over all Tuscany, but after the death of the
                    famous Matilda the city began to constitute itself an independent community, and
                    in 1160 it obtained from Welf VI., duke of Bavaria and marquis of Tuscany, the
                    lordship of all the country for 5 miles round. Internal discord afforded an
                    opportunity to Uguccione della Faggiola to make himself master of Lucca in 1314;
                    but the Lucchese expelled him two years afterwards, and handed over their city
                    to Castrudcio, under whose masterly tyranny it became “for a moment the leading
                    state of Italy.” Occupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, sold to a rich
                    Genovese Gherardo Spinola, seized by John, king of Bohemia, pawned to the Rossi
                    of Parma, sold to the Florentines, surrendered to the Pisans, nominally
                    liberated by the emperor Charles IV., and governed by his vicar, Lucca was
                    subjected to endless vicissitudes, but managed, at first as a democracy, and
                    after 1628 as an oligarchy, to maintain “its independence alongside of Venice
                    and Genoa, and painted the word Libertas on its banner till the French
                    Revolution.” In the beginning of the 16th century one of its leading citizens,
                    Francesco Burlamacchi, made a noble attempt to give political cohesion to Italy,
                    but perished on the scaffold (1548); his statue by Ulisse Cambi was erected on
                    the Piazza San Michele in 1863. As a principality formed in 1805 by Napoleon in
                    favour of his sister Elisa and her husband Baciocchi, Lucca was for a few years
                    wonderfully prosperous. It was occupied by the Neapolitans in 1814; from 1816 to
                    1847 it was governed as a duchy by Maria Luisa, queen of Etruria, and her son
                    Charles Louis; and it afterwards formed one of the divisions of Tuscany.</p>
                <p>The bishops of Lucca, who can be traced back to 347, gradually acquired a variety
                    of exceptional marks of distinction, such as the pallium in 1120, and the
                    archiepiscopal cross from Alexander II.; and at length in 1726 Benedict XIII.
                    raised their see to the rank of an archbishopric, without suffragans.</p>
