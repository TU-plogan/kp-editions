                    bronze wolf which is still preserved in the Capitol was placed in it in 296 B.c.
                    But the festival itself, which was held on February 15th under the direction of
                    the <hi rend="italic">flamen dialis,</hi> contains no reference to the Romulus
                    legend, which is probably later in origin (see Mommsen in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermes,</hi> 1881). The celebrants, who were called Luperci, offered in
                    sacrifice goats and a dog; the <hi rend="italic">flamen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dialis</hi> himself was forbidden to touch either kind of animal, and it can
                    hardly be doubted that the Lupercal sacrifice is older than the prohibition.
                    After the sacrifice two of the Luperci were led to the altar, their foreheads
                    were touched with a bloody sword, and the blood wiped off with wool dipped in
                    milk; then the ritual required that the two young men should laugh. The
                    sacrificial feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs from the skins of
                    the victims and ran in two bands round the walls of the old Palatine city,
                    striking the people who crowded near. A blow from the thong prevented sterility
                    in women. These thongs were called <hi rend="italic">Februa,</hi> the festival
                    <hi rend="italic">Februαtw,</hi> and the day <hi rend="italic">Dies
                    Februetus</hi>; hence arose the name of the month February, the last of the old
                    Roman year. The nearest analogy in the Roman religion to the Lupercalia is the
                    occasional Amburbium, in which the victims were led round the walls of Rome and
                    then sacrificed. The Lupercalia was associated with the circuit of the Palatine
                    city, which had been a city long before the seven-hilled Rome, and the line of
                    the old Palatine walls was marked with stones for the Luperci to run round.
                    Unger has proved that the festival was originally a rite peculiar to the tribe
                    of the Ramnes, the old dwellers on the Palatine, and that it was in the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> widened to a festival of the whole city.
                    It is probable that then the whole ceremonial was modified; the Luperci, who
                    were originally chosen from the Ramnes alone, were chosen from the whole body of
                    the Equites, the people assembled round the hill, and the ceremony of scourging
                    to avert sterility was added. Originally therefore the Luperci simply
                    encompassed the walls as the victims did at the Amburbium, and the ceremonial
                    connected with the two young men has generally been taken as a proof that they
                    were at one time actually sacrificed after being led round the walls, and that a
                    vicarious sacrifice was afterwards substituted for the ancient human offering.
                    The Lupercalia was therefore a ceremony of purification performed for the walls
                    and for the whole of the old Palatine city, from which it follows that it was
                    dedicated to the peculiar god of that city. In early time the name of the god
                    was kept strictly secret, as it was unsafe that an enemy should know it and be
                    able to invoke him. Hence arise many conflicting statements as to the name. In
                    later times, when the bonds of early religion were relaxed, the name became
                    known. The god was, as Livy relates, Inuus, an old Italian deity known chiefly
                    in southern Etruria, wh⅛re there existed two towns named Castrum Inui. He was a
                    form of the supreme heaven-god, very like Mars in character, and the rites with
                    which his anger was averted may be compared with those of Zeus on Mount Pelion
                    or with the Maimacteria in Athens. The Luperci were divided into two <hi
                    rend="italic">collegia</hi> called Quintiliani or Quinetiales (the form is
                    doubtful, see Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Rom.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Forsch.,</hi> i. 17) and Fabiani; at the head of each was a <hi rend="italic"

                    Antony.</p>
                <p>This account follows in almost every particular that of Unger <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Rhein. Mιιs.,</hi> 1881). He derives Lupercus from <hi rend="italic">luα</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">parcο</hi> in the old sense of restrain, and Inuus from a
                    root seen in <hi rend="italic">avis inubra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inebra,
                    hvaivouai,</hi> &amp;c., meaning to avert or prohibit, and sees in the festival
                    a national ceremony of the Palatine city, not with Marquardt <hi rend="italic"
