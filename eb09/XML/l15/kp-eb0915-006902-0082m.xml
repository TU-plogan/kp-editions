                    wild and imperfectly known tract of country on the north-eastern frontier of
                    India, extending along the southern border of the Assam district of Câchâr and
                    the eastern border of the Bengal district of Chittagong. On the east, the Lushâi
                    Hills stretch away into the unexplored mountains of Independent Burmah. This
                    extensive region is occupied by a numerous family of tribes known to us
                    indifferently as Lushâis or Kukis. All these tribes are nomadic in their habits,
                    and subject to successive waves of migration. It is said that at the present
                    time the entire race of the Lushâis is being forced southwards into British
                    territory under pressure from the Soktis, a tribe advancing upon them from
                    Independent Burmah. The principal characteristic common to all the Lushâis, and
                    in which they markedly differ from the other tribes on the Assam frontier, is
                    their feudal organization under hereditary chiefs. Each village is under the
                    military command of a chief, who must come of a certain royal stock. The chief
                    exercises absolute power in the village; and his dignity and wealth are
                    maintained by a large number of slaves and by fixed contributions of labour from
                    his free subjects. Cultivation is carried on according to the nomadic system of
                    tillage on temporary clearings in the jungle; but the main occupation of the
                    people is hunting and warfare</p>
                <p>From the earliest times the Lushâis have been notorious for their sanguinary
                    raids into British territory, which are said to be instigated by their desire to
                    obtain human heads for use at their funeral ceremonies.· The first of which we
                    have record was in 1777. In 1849 a colony of Lushâis settled within Câchâr, was
                    attacked by their independent kinsmen, and forced to migrate northwards across
                    the Barak river, where they now live as peaceable British subjects, and are
                    known as “Old Kukis.” In 1860a raid was made upon Tiρperah district, in which
                    186 Bengali villagers were massacred and 100 carried away into captivity.
                    Retributive expeditions, consisting of small forces of sepoys, were repeatedly
                    sent to punish these raids, but, owing to the difficult nature of the country
                    and the fugitive tactics of the enemy, no permanent advantage was gained. At
                    last the disturbed state of the frontier attracted the attention of the supreme
                    government. A military demonstration in 1869 had entirely failed in its object.
                    Relying upon their belief in the impracticable character of their native
                    country, the Lushâis made a series of simultaneous attacks in January 1871 upon
                    British villages in Câchâr, Sylhet, and Tipperah, as well as on the independent
                    state of Manipur. The outpost of Monierkhâl repelled a number of attacks,
                    lasting through two days, made by a second body of Lushâis from the eastern
                    tribes, who finally retired with a large amount of plunder, including many
                    coolies and guns. Lord Mayo, the viceroy, resolved to make a vigorous effort to
                    stop those inroads, once and for all. A punitive expedition was organized,
                    composed of two Gιirkha battalions, two Punjab and two Bengal native infantry
                    regiments, two companies of sappers and miners, and a detachment of the Peshâwar
                    mountain battery. This little army was divided into two columns, one advancing
                    from Câchâr and the other from the Chittagong side. Both columns were completely
                    successful. The resistance of the Lushâis, though obstinate in parts, was
                    completely overcome, and the chiefs made their personal submission and accepted
                    the terms offered them. Upwards of one hundred British subjects were liberated
                    from captivity. The actual British loss in fighting was very small, but a large
                    number of soldiers and camp-followers died from cholera. Since this expedition,
                    the Lushâis have remained quiet along the entire frontier, and active measures
                    have been taken to open commercial intercourse between them and the people of
                    the plains. Many <hi rend="italic">bdzdιrs</hi> have been established for this
                    purpose, and trade by barter is now freely carried on.</p>
