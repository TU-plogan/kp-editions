                    to Rome he was considered to have acquitted himself so discreditably that he was
                    prosecuted on a charge of bribery and corrupt practices, and was condemned to
                    exile. His mother was Caecilia, of the family of the Metelli, and was the sister
                    of the distinguished Metellus Numidicus. The career of Lucullus coincides with
                    the first half of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It appears that
                    he was rather senior to Pompey, who was born in 106 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> We hear of him when quite a young man as making a determined though
                    unsuccessful attempt to avenge his father’s downfall on the author of the
                    prosecution, and this won him credit and popularity. Early in life he attached
                    himself to the party of Sulla, and to that party <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n69/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0069-0056"/> he remained constant to his life’s end. Sulla’s
                    favourable notice was secured by good military service in the so-called Social
                    War, which finally completed the subjugation of Rome’s Italian allies and in
                    fact of the whole peninsula. In 88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> came the great
                    Mithridatic war in the East, with the direction of which Sulla was charged. In
                    that year the young Lucullus went with him as his quaestor to Greece and Asia
                    Minor, and, while Sulla was besieging Athens, he raised a fleet and drove
                    Mithridates out of the Mediterranean. He won a brilliant victory off Tenedos,
                    and it seems probable that, had he been as faithful to Rome as he was to Sulla
                    and his party, he might have ended a perilous war. But, like many of his
                    contemporaries, Lucullus was too much of a party man to be a genuine
                    patriot.</p>
                <p>In 84 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> peace was concluded with Mithridates, and
                    the great king had to cede the Greek islands and a large part of his Asiatic
                    possessions, and was practically reduced to the position of a mere Roman
                    dependant. Sulla returned to Rome, while Lucullus remained in Asia, and by a
                    series of wise and generous financial reforms laid the foundation of the future
                    wealth and prosperity of the province. The result of his policy was that he
                    stood particularly well with the provincials, but unfortunately for himself made
                    a host of enemies among the powerful class which farmed the public revenue. He
                    was in Asia till 80 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> and then returned to Rome as
                    curule aedile, in which capacity he exhibited together with his colleague, his
                    brother Marcus, games which were long remembered by the citizens of Rome for
                    their exceptional magnificence. We may infer that thus early in life he had
                    found the means of acquiring an immense fortune, which throughout his whole
                    career it was his delight lavishly to display. Soon afterwards he was elected
                    praetor, and was next appointed to the province of Africa, where again he won a
                    good name as a just and considerate governor. In the year 74 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he became consul, with Aurelius Cotta as his
                    colleague. An attempt was made at this time by a leader of the democratic party
                    to repeal the legislation of Sulla, and its failure appears to have been mainly
                    due to the strenuous efforts of Lucullus.</p>
                <p>The East was now again unsettled, and Bithynia, which had been bequeathed to Rome
                    by its king Nicomedes, was threatened by Mithridates. The new province with the
                    command of the fleet fell to Cotta, but Lucullus was called to lead the armies
                    of Rome against this dangerous enemy. In 74 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he
                    was in Asia at the head of a force of about 30,000 foot and 2000 horse. The king
                    of Pontus was already on Roman ground in Bithynia, and Cotta was shut up in
                    Chalcedon on the Propontis by a vast host of 150,000 men. The enemy’s fleet had
                    forced its way into the harbour, and had burnt all the Roman vessels lying at
                    anchor. The advance of Lucullus, however, forced the king to raise the siege and
                    retire along the sea-coast, till he halted before the strong city of Cyzicus,
                    the key of Asia, as it was called, built on an island at a little distance from
                    the mainland, with which it was connected by a bridge. All the attempts of
                    Mithridates on the place were foiled by a gallant defence, and it was not long
                    before Lucullus took up a threatening position in the rear of his army, which
                    cut off all his land communications and left him only master of the sea. Bad
                    weather and violent storms and scant supplies soon drove the king from the walls
                    of Cyzicus, and his vast army was dispersed without having had the chance of
                    fighting a single pitched battle. His fleet too, which as yet had had the
                    command of the Aegean, was soon afterwards destroyed by Lucullus, and thus his
                    whole power for offensive warfare had completely collapsed. He himself withdrew
                    into his own proper territory, and all that the Roman general had to fear was
                    that he might baffle pursuit by a flight eastward into the remote wilds of
                    Armenia. However, in the autumn of 73 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Lucullus
                    pushed into the heart of Rontus far beyond the Halys, the limit of the famous
                    Scipio’s advance eastward, and continued his onward march, regardless of the
                    murmurs of his weary soldiery, to Cabeira or Neocaesarea (now Niksar), where the
                    king had gone into winter quarters with a vague hope that his son-in-law,
                    Tigranes, the powerful king of Armenia, and possibly even the Parthians, might,
                    for their own sakes, come to his aid against a common foe. It was by a very
                    toilsome march through difficult roads that the Roman army at last reached
                    Cabeira, to find themselves confronted by a greatly superior force. But the
                    troops of Mithridates were no more a match for the Roman legionaries than were
                    the Persians for Alexander, and a large detachment of his army was decisively
                    cut up by one of Lucullus’s lieutenant-generals. The king decided on instant
                    retreat, but the retreat soon became a disorderly flight, and Lucullus, seizing
                    the moment for attack, annihilated his enemy, Mithridates himself escaping with
                    difficulty over the mountain range between Pontus and Cappadocia into Lesser
                    Armenia. He found a sort of refuge in the dominions of Tigranes, but he was in
                    fact detained as a prisoner rather than received as an honoured friend and
                    ally.</p>
                <p>Pontus thus, with the exception of some of the maritime cities, such as Sinope,
                    Heraclea, and Amisus, which still clung to the king under whom they had enjoyed
                    a free Greek constitution, became Roman territory. Two years were occupied in
                    the siege and capture of these strongholds, while Lucullus busied himself with a
                    general reform of the administration of the province of Asia. His next step was
                    to demand the surrender of Mithridates and to threaten Tigranes with war in the
                    event of refusal. He had indeed no direct authority from the home government to
                    attempt the conquest of Armenia, but he may well have supposed that in invading
                    the country he would be following out Sulla’s policy, and securing Rome in the
                    East from a serious danger. Nor was it unnatural that there should be a
                    fascination in the idea of winning renown in the distant and almost unknown
                    regions beyond the Euphrates. In the spring of the year 69 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> at the head of only two legions, which, it appears, by no means
                    liked the hardships of the expedition, he marched through Sophene, the
                    southwestern portion of Armenia, crossed the Tigris, and pushed on to the
                    newly-built royal city, Tigranocerta, situated on one of the affluents of that
                    river. A motley host, made up out of the tribes bordering on the Black Sea and
                    the Caspian, hovered round his small army, but failed to hinder him from laying
                    siege to the town. On this occasion Lucullus showed consummate military
                    capacity, contriving to maintain the siege and at the same time to give battle
                    to the enemy with a force which must have been inferior in the ratio of
                    something like one to twenty. According to his own account he put the Armenians
                    to rout with a loss of five Roman soldiers, leaving 100,000 dead on the field of
                    battle. The victory before the walls of Tigranocerta was undoubtedly a very
                    glorious one for the arms of Rome, and it resulted in the dissolution of the
                    Armenian king’s extensive empire. There might now have been peace but for the
                    interference of Mithridates, who for his own sake pressed Tigranes to renew the
                    war and to seek the aid and alliance of Parthia. The Parthian king, however, was
                    disposed to prefer a treaty with Rome to a treaty with Armenia, and desired
                    simply to have the Euphrates recognized as his western boundary. Mithridates
                    next appealed to the national spirit of the peoples of the East generally, and
                    endeavoured to rouse them to a united effort against Roman aggression. He hoped
                    to crush his enemy amid the mountains of Armenia, and indeed the position of
                    Lucullus was highly critical. The home government <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n70/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0070-0057"/> was for recalling him, and seemed to think little
                    of his splendid successes; and his little army, which one might have been
                    supposed would have been proud of their general, was on the verge of mutiny. One
                    can hardly understand how under such circumstances Lucullus should have
                    persisted in marching his men northwards from Tigranocerta over the high
                    table-land of central Armenia, with the enemy’s cavalry and innumerable mounted
                    archers hanging on his columns, in the hope of reaching the distant Artaxata on
                    the Araxes. The vexation of his troops broke out into an open mutiny, which
                    compelled him to recross the Tigris into the Mesopotamian valley. Here, on a
                    dark tempestuous night, he surprised and stormed Nisibis, the capital of the
                    Armenian district of Mesopotamia, and in this city, which yielded him a rich
                    booty, he found satisfactory winter quarters.</p>
                <p>Meantime Mithridates was again in Pontus, and the Roman forces which had been
                    left there were soon overwhelmed. In one disastrous engagement at Ziela the
                    Roman camp was taken and the army slaughtered to a man. Lucullus was still
                    thwarted by the mutinous spirit of his troops, and after all his brilliant
                    achievements he was obliged to pursue his retreat into Asia Minor with the full
                    knowledge that Tigranes and Mithridates were the unresisted masters of Pontus
                    and Cappadocia. The work of eight years of war was undone. Commissioners sent
                    from Rome to settle the affairs of the East had to report to the senate that a
                    large part of Asia Minor was in the enemy’s hands. In the year 66 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Lucullus was recalled, and superseded in his command
                    by Pompey.</p>
                <p>He had indeed fairly earned by his brilliant victories the honour of a triumph,
                    but he had powerful enemies at Rome, and charges of maladministration, to which
                    no doubt his immense wealth gave no unreasonable colour, caused it to be
                    deferred for three years. In 63 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> however, it was
                    celebrated with extraordinary magnificence. By this time Lucullus seems to have
                    felt that he had done his work. He had little taste for the increasingly
                    turbulent political contests of the time, and, with the exception of occasional
                    appearances in public life, he gave himself up to elegant luxury, with which,
                    however, he combined a sort of dilettante pursuit of philosophy, literature, and
                    art. Cicero, who was on terms of close intimacy with him, always speaks of him
                    with enthusiasm and in terms of the highest praise. Lucullus is with him a <hi
                    rend="italic">vir fortissimus et clarissimus,</hi> and a man too of the highest
                    and most refined intellectual culture. As a provincial governor, in his humane
                    consideration for the conquered and his statesmanlike discernment of what was
                    best suited to their circumstances, he was a man after Cicero’s own heart. In
                    this respect he reminds us of the younger Pliny. Very possibly Cicero may have
                    spoken too flatteringly of him, but we cannot think his praise was altogether
                    undeserved.</p>
                <p>As a soldier, considering what he achieved and the victories he won with but
                    small forces under peculiarly unfavourable conditions, he must have been a man
                    of no ordinary capacity. It is true that he does not seem to have had the
                    confidence of his troops to the extent to which a great general ought to possess
                    it, and it is just possible that he may have erred on the side of an excessive
                    aristocratic hauteur, which to his men may have looked like a selfish
                    indifference to their hardships. But it is also possible that out of a strict
                    regard to the lives and property of the provincials he may have been too strict
                    a disciplinarian for the taste of the soldiers. Some of his unpopularity, it is
                    pretty certain, was due to the restraints which he had put on the rapacity of
                    the capitalists, who thought themselves aggrieved if they could not make rapid
                    and enormous fortunes by farming the revenue of the rich provinces of the East.
                    We can hardly doubt that with very decided aristocratic feeling and thorough
                    devotion to his political party Lucullus combined much generous uprightness and
                    kindliness of heart.</p>
                <p>His name calls up before the mind visions of boundless luxury and magnificence,
                    and among the Roman nobles who revelled in the newly acquired riches of the East
                    Lucullus, it is certain, stood pre-eminent. His park and pleasure grounds in the
                    immediate vicinity of the capital were the wonder and admiration of his own and
                    of the succeeding age. Pompey is said to have styled him the Roman Xerxes, in
                    allusion, not only to his splendour, but also to the costly and laborious works
                    to be seen in his parks and villas at Tusculum, near Naples, where rocks and
                    hills had been pierced at an almost infinite expense. On one of his luxurious
                    entertainments he is said to have spent upwards of &lt;£2000. Far the most
                    pleasing trait in his character is the liberal patronage which he gave more
                    especially to Greek philosophers and men of letters, and the fact that he
                    collected a vast and valuable library, to which such men had free access. On the
                    whole we may take Lucullus to have been a man who in many respects rose above
                    his age, and was a decidedly favourable specimen of a great Roman noble.</p>
                <p>Of his latter years but little is recorded. He had, as we have seen, almost
                    wholly retired from public life. It appears that he sank into a condition of
                    mental feebleness and imbecility some years before his death, and was obliged to
                    surrender the management of his affairs to his brother Marcus. The usual funeral
                    panegyric was pronounced on him in the Forum, and the people would have had him
                    buried by the side of the great Sulla in the Campus Martius, but he was laid at
                    his brother’s special request in his splendid villa at Tusculum.</p>
                <p>The best account of Lucullus’s campaign in the East is to be found in Mommsen’s
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Rome,</hi> bk. v. chap. 2. Our knowledge of him is
                    drawn mainly from Plutarch, Appian’s <hi rend="italic">Mithridαtic War,</hi> the
                    epitomes of the lost books of Livy, and very frequent allusions to him in
                    Cicero’s works. (W. J. B. )</p>
