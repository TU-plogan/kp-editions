                    Like most of the Swiss cantons its form is very irregular, and it includes,
                    besides a part of the Lake of Lucerne, the Lakes of Sempach and Baldegg, and
                    several smaller sheets of water. To this circumstance is probably due the
                    discrepancy in the various estimates of the area, which range from 498 to 585
                    square miles. The greater part of its territory lies in the low hilly region of
                    north-western Switzerland, most of which is under cultivation; but it has one
                    considerable valley, the Entlebuch, enclosed by mountains, several of which
                    exceed 5000 feet in height, which is devoted to pasturage. The only considerable
                    mountain in the canton is the Pilatus, a steep jagged ridge with numerous perks,
                    the highest of which is 7290 feet above the sea, forming the boundary between
                    this and the canton of Unterwalden. The only river is the Reuss, which issues
                    from the lake at the town of Lucerne, but soon turns abruptly to the north-east,
                    and passes the boundary of the canton. Of many smaller streams that water its
                    surface, the most important is the Little Emme, which drains the Entlebuch and
                    its tributary valleys. The soil is moderately fertile, and produces good crops
                    of cereals, but the vine is grown only in a few exceptionally favourable
                    situations. Some of the higher valleys, especially the Entlebuch, are mainly
                    devoted to pasture, and furnish cheese and butter in considerable quantities, of
                    which the surplus is exported. The population in December 1880 was 134,806, of
                    whom all but 5634 were Roman Catholics. The language is exclusively German, and
                    the people belong to the Teutonic stock. Excepting the inhabitants of the town
                    of Lucerne, they are mainly employed in agriculture. The men of the Entlebuch,
                    leading a pastoral life and little exposed to intercourse with strangers, have
                    preserved more of the original simplicity of manners and costume than is now
                    often found elsewhere in Switzerland. They are famed for their strength and
                    skill in wrestling and other athletic exercises, as may be seen at the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schιvingfeste,</hi> still frequently held in that district.</p>
                <p>Like the rest of northern Switzerland, Lucerne was subject to the house of
                    Austria until 1332, when its people joined the league of the forest cantons,
                    Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, thus forming the fourth in date of the
                    confederation. They bore their share in the brilliant victory of Sempach, fought
                    in ] 386 near the village of that name, ami in 1402 acquired the Entlebuch by
                    purchase from the Austrian duke. The government was until the end of the 18th
                    century an oligarchy in the hands of a few families, but in 1798 the French
                    invasion substituted democratic institutions. These, with several changes all
                    tending to give more complete power to the people, have continued to the present
                    time. The constitution now in force dates from the 17th February 1869, and is
                    based on the principle which prevails throughout the whole of Switzerland, that
                    the sovereign power is vested exclusively in the people, but may be exercised
                    either directly or through delegates elected by universal suffrage. Lucerne
                    formerly sent a contingent of 1734 men to the federal army, but according to the
                    latest return the number of men belonging to the canton on the rolls (in 1879)
                    was 5176. In 1846 Lucerne took a leading part in the formation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Soηderbuηd,</hi> a league of several of the Catholic cantons to
                    oppose forcible resistance to the decree of the federal government for the
                    expulsion of the Jesuits from Switzerland. In the brief campaign that ensued in
                    the following year, the forces of the Sonderbund were utterly routed, and after
                    a few days the conflict ceased. Since that date the canton seems to have enjoyed
                    complete internal tranquillity. Lucerne has produced a fair proportion of men
                    who have distinguished themselves in science, literature, philosophy, and art.
                    Among many others whose reputation is confined to their own country, the names
                    of the naturalists Cappeler and Lange, the historians Etterlin and Balthasar,
                    and the philosopher Troxlerhave acquired more permanent reputation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lucerne,</hi> the chief town of the Swiss canton of that
                    name, stands on both banks of the Reuss, where that river issues from the
                    north-west end of the chief arm of the lake of Lucerne. The position of the town
                    is singularly beautiful. Beyond the lower hills, rich with planting and
                    cultivation, which slope towards the shores of the lake and the river, loftier
                    summits of very varied form rise in the background. Most prominent of these is
                    the many-peaked Pilatus, only about 7 miles distant, while the double summit of
                    the Mythen, at the opposite end of the lake, is flanked by other less imposing
                    summits, amongst which the Righi draws attention, owing to the fame of its
                    panoramic view. The picturesque aspect of the town is much enhanced by the
                    ancient walls, now partly removed, and the circular or octagonal towers which
                    surround it. One of these, called the Wasserthurm, rising from the water’s edge,
                    is said to have served as a lighthouse <hi rend="italic">(lucerna),</hi> and to
                    have originated the name of the town and canton. The town appears to owe its
                    origin to a Benedictine monastery which stood on the site of the present
                    Hofkirche. The buildings which clustered round gradually increased, until, early
                    in the 14th century, the walls were erected for protection, and bridges were
                    carried across the river. The Rathhaus, which is the seat of the cantonal
                    Government, is an ancient building adorned with wood carving and quaint
                    pictures. In a large hall are preserved the portraits of the chief magistrates
                    <hi rend="italic">(Schultheissen)</hi> from the earliest times to the year 1814.
                    The libraries of Lucerne are said to possess the most complete and important
                    collection of documents connected with the history of Switzerland during the
                    Middle Ages. The town library, now in the museum, contains about 12,000 volumes,
                    and is especially rich in manuscript chronicles. The cantonal library, reckoned
                    at over 80,000 volumes, with many incunabula, was chiefly formed from the
                    libraries of suppressed monasteries. Other curious books are to be found in the
                    library of the Capuchins at Wesemlin outside the town.</p>
                <p>Besides two modern bridges which span the river, there are two wooden causeways,
                    roofed over, and passable only on foot, which anciently served the wants of the
                    inhabitants; a third, the longest of all, was removed in the progress of modern
                    improvements. Of those remaining, the more ancient, called the Mühlbrücke, was
                    adorned with illustrations of the “Dance of Death,” a favourite subject with
                    German and Swiss mediaeval artists; though much injured by time, they are still
                    visible. The other wooden bridge—the Kapellbrücke—is decorated with numerous
                    paintings representing events in Swiss history and in the lives of Saints
                    Leodegar and Mauritius, the patrons of the city. The principal church, which has
                    little architectural merit, possesses a fine organ. Along with various religious
                    and charitable institutions which seem fully adequate to the wants of the
                    population, a museum has been opened of late years which, among various other
                    objects, contains an interesting archaeological collection, going back to the
                    prehistoric period, and including relics of historical interest, such as
                    trophies taken on the field of Sempâch, formerly preserved in the arsenal. The
                    town contains one object of genuine artistic interest—the colossal lion designed
                    to commemorate the men of the Swiss guard who fell in the defence of the
                    Tuileries in Paris on the 10th August 1792. The idea, which might easily have
                    led an inferior artist into extravagance and vulgarity, was well suited for the
                    simple and manly genius of Thorwaldsen, who supplied the model; and, although
                    the execution is necessarily somewhat rude, the effect is touching and
                    impressive. In an architectural point of view the most notable part of the town
                    is the wide quay formed on land reclaimed from the lake in 1852, planted on one
                    side with trees, and on the other showing a succession of those great hotels
                    which everywhere in Switzerland have been built to accommodate and to tempt the
                    strangers who annually resort to the <pb break="no"

                    to a large increase of population; that of Lucerne, which twenty years before
                    was little over 10,000, was 17,850 at the census of 1880. <hi rend="smallcaps"
