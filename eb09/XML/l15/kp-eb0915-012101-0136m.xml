                    the Revolution of 1688 and during the following reign was one of the ablest Whig
                    debaters of the House of Commons. Lyttelton was educated at Eton and Oxford, and
                    in 1728 set out on the grand tour, spending considerable periods at Paris and
                    Rome. On his return to England he sat for Okehampton, Devonshire, beginning
                    public life in the same year with Pitt; and from 1744 to 1754 he held the office
                    of a lord commissioner of the treasury. In 1755 he succeeded Legge as chancellor
                    of the exchequer, but in the following year he quitted office, on which occasion
                    he was raised to the peerage as Lord Lyttelton, baron of Frankley, in the county
                    of Worcester. In the political crisis of 1765, before the formation of the
                    Rockingham administration, it was at one time suggested that he might be placed
                    at the head of the treasury, but he firmly declined to take part in any such
                    scheme. The closing years of his life were devoted chiefly to literary pursuits.
                    He died on August 22, 1773.</p>
                <p>Lyttelton’s earliest publication (1735), <hi rend="italic">Letters from a Persian
                    in England to his Friend at Ispahan,</hi> appeared anonymously. Much greater
                    celebrity was achieved by his <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Conversion
                    and Apostleship of St Paul,</hi> also anonymous, published in 1747. It takes the
                    form of a letter to Gilbert West, and is designed to show that St Paul’s
                    conversion is of itself a sufficient demonstration of the divine character of
                    Christianity. The drift of the argument is that it is equally inconceivable that
                    the apostle could have been the victim or the originator of a cheat, and that
                    therefore he must have been divinely inspired. It is interesting to know that Dr
                    Johnson regarded the work as one “to which infidelity has never been able to
                    fabricate a specious answer.” Lord Lyttelton’s <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of
                    the Dead,</hi> a creditable performance, though hardly rivalling either Lucian
                    or Landor, appeared in 1760. His <hi rend="italic">History of Henry II.</hi>
                    (1764-67), the fruit of twenty years’ labour, is not now cited as an authority,
                    but is painstaking and fair. Lyttelton was also a writer of verse; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Monody</hi> on his wife’s death has been praised by Gray for its
                    elegiac tenderness, and his <hi rend="italic">Prologue</hi> to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> of his friend Thomson shows genuine feeling. He
                    was also the author of the well-known stanza in the <hi rend="italic">Castle of
                    Indolence,</hi> in which the poet himself is described. A complete collection of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> of Lord Lyttelton was published after his death
                    by his nephew, G. E. Ayscough. See <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence
                    of Lord Lyttelton,</hi> 1734-1773 (2 vols., 1845).</p>
