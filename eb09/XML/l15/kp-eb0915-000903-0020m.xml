                    extended from the Forth to the Tweed. The Forth separated it from Celtic Alba,
                    and the Tweed from the southern part of Bryneich (Bernicia). Its western
                    boundaries appear to have been the Cheviots and the Lowthers. After the
                    Anglo-Saxon migration it formed part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumberland,
                    founded by Ida the Flame-bearer in 547, which in its <pb break="no"

                    kings of the 7th century, reached from the Humber to the Forth. A different but
                    allied branch of the Angles settled along the tributaries of the Tweed, and the
                    Cheviot, Lowther, Moorfoot, and Pentland (Pictish) hills separated the colonists
                    of southern Scotland from the British kingdom of Strath Clyde or Cumbria. The
                    victories of Catraeth (59G) and Daegsastan (603) in the reign of Ethelfrith
                    represent the close of the struggle which drove the British or Cumbrian Celts
                    (Cymry) into the western hill country, afterwards known ∙as Westmoreland and
                    Cumberland, and the Picts to the north of the Forth and Clyde, so that Anglian
                    Northumberland secured the former river as its northern boundary, and even for a
                    time threatened to pass it. Edwin of Deira (617-33), the chief king of England
                    in his time, probably founded Edinburgh, although its Celtic name Dun Eden has
                    been thought by some to suggest a different derivation. Egfrid at the close of
                    the 7th century established an Anglian bishop at Abercorn on the Forth, but was
                    defeated and slain at Nechtansmere, or Dunnichen, in Forfarshire by the Pictish
                    king Brude (685), and Trumwine the bishop at Abercorn was forced to retire to
                    Whitby. In the 8th century the Northumbrian kings were engaged in a conflict
                    with Mercia, and in 827 the supremacy of Egbert, the founder of the West Saxon
                    monarchy, was acknowledged, although on the part of the Northumbrians the
                    recognition must have been at first almost nominal, for it was not until more
                    than a century later that Athelstan, by the victory of Brunanburg (937) over the
                    allied Welsh, Scots, and Northumbrian Danes, really extended the boundaries of
                    the Wessex kingdom over the greater part of Northumbria, which was reduced to an
                    earldom by Edred in 954. Athelstan had in 934 ravaged Scotland north of the
                    Forth, and must for a time have reduced Lothian, the northern district of
                    Northumberland, but it does not appear that either he or any of his successors
                    had real sovereignty over Lothian, which was left to the rule of Northumbrian
                    earls, sometimes of Anglian and at other times of Danish race. Its population
                    continued Anglian, as is proved by the fact that there are no Danish monuments
                    and few Danish place names between the Tweed and the Forth. The Scottish Celts,
                    like the English Anglo-Saxons, were during this period occupied with warding off
                    the Danes and Norsemen, but about the middle of the 9th century Kenneth
                    Macalpine united the Scottish and Pictish kingdoms, and fixed the capital at
                    Scone. This monarch is said by the Pictish chronicle to have six times invaded
                    Saxony (the name given by the Celts to the Anglo-Saxon territory), and to have
                    burnt Dunbar and Melrose. The Anglians of Northumbria had been converted to
                    Christianity by Paulinus in 627, and reconverted by a Celtic mission from Iona
                    between 635 and 651 under Aidan, who planted a mission station—a southern
                    Iona—on the Holy Island, and became first bishop of Lindisfarne. Cuthbert, one
                    of his successors in this bishopric, which had become Anglian and conformed to
                    the Roman ritual and discipline after the council of Whitby (664), has the
                    credit of spreading the gospel in Lothian, where he had been first monk and then
                    prior of the recently founded monastery of Melrose.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the 10th century (954-62) Edinburgh was abandoned by the
                    Northumbrian Angles and occupied by Indulph, son of Constantine, king of the
                    Scots. According to John of Wallingford and Roger of Wendover, Edgar the West
                    Saxon king ceded in 966 Lothian to Kenneth III., son of Malcolm I., on condition
                    that he should do homage for it and give pledges not to deprive the people of
                    that region of their ancient customs, and that they should still retain the name
                    and language of the Angles. This cession, which is not in the older chronicles,
                    has been matter of controversy between Freeman <hi rend="italic">(Norman
                    Conquest,</hi> i., note B, p. 610), y <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ho accepts
                    the statement, and E. W. Robertson <hi rend="italic">(Scotland under her Early
                    Kings,</hi> i. 390) and Skene <hi rend="italic">(Celtic Scotland,</hi> i. 370),
                    who reject it upon what appear better grounds. But the dispute is of small
                    importance, as it is admitted on the authority of Simeon of Durham that, whether
                    or not it was then ceded on condition of homage, it was annexed to Scotland by
                    conquest in 1018 in consequence of the victory at Carham by Malcolm the son of
                    Kenneth over the Northumbrian earl Eadulf Ciudel,—“Hoc modo,” says Simeon
                    writing before 1129, “Lodonium adjectum est regno Scotiae.” Canute and William
                    the Conqueror made temporary conquests of Scotland including Lothian, and homage
                    of various kinds was rendered to them and other Norman monarchs, but there is no
                    trace of any special homage for Lothian except in two dubious charters by Edgar
                    to William Rufus, so that it seems certain that from the beginning of the 11th
                    century it was an integral part of Scotland. Freeman, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historical Geography,</hi> styles it an English earldom, but it is never so
                    called in any authentic record. While it was an integral part of Scotland its
                    population was recognized as a distinct branch of the Scottish nation, and the
                    men of Lothian are frequently separately named, as in the contemporary account
                    of the Battle of the Standard (1138). It also retained its language, customs,
                    and laws, which were those of the Angles of Northumbria. Although united in
                    civil government to Scotland, Lothian, or at least many places in it, continued
                    ecclesiastically subject to the see of Durham, which had succeeded that of
                    Lindisfarne, until the beginning of the 12th century (Stubbs and Haddan, <hi
                    rend="italic">Concilia,</hi> ii. p. 161), but it then came under the bishop of
                    St Andrews, and was divided into three rural deaneries, the Merse, Haddington,
                    and Linlithgow, with an archdeacon of Lothian, who first distinctly appears
                    under that name at the commencement of the 13th century.</p>
                <p>The division of Scotland into shires was probably made by David I., and Lothian
                    included the shires of Berwick or the Merse (the march or borderland, as English
                    Mercia and Spanish Murcia), Roxburgh, and Edinburgh, which included the
                    constabularies of Haddington and Linlithgow, afterwards erected into separate
                    counties. Its principal burghs — Berwick, Roxburgh, and Edinburgh — formed along
                    with Stirling the court of the four burghs, whose laws were collected by David
                    I. (“Leges Quatuor Burgorum,” <hi rend="italic">Act.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pari.</hi><hi rend="italic">Scot.,</hi> i. 327), and whose meeting-place was
                    Haddington, but the frequent occupation of Berwick and Roxburgh by the English
                    caused Lanark and Linlithgowto be substituted, and the place of meeting to be
                    changed to Stirling in 1368. The convention of royal burghs may be traced back
                    to this court.</p>
                <p>The independence of Scotland, including Lothian, though frequently disputed by
                    the English sovereigns, was always maintained by the Scotch, except when
                    surrendered by William the Lion as a prisoner by the treaty of Falaise 1174,
                    cancelled by Richard I. in 1189. It was finally acknowledged by Edward I. in the
                    treaty of Brigham, but after the death of the Maid of Norway this acknowledgment
                    was repudiated, and it was only finally established by the war of independence,
                    and definitely recognized in the treaty of Northampton in 1328.</p>
                <p>By a singular but fortunate series of events, of which the first was the marriage
                    of Malcolm Canmore with the Saxon princess Margaret, Lothian, the Anglian part
                    of the Scottish kingdom, though its borderland, became its centre. Edinburgh,
                    its chief town, was from that time a favourite residence of the court, and under
                    the Stuart kings became the capital of the kingdom. Its language, the dialect of
                    northern England, became the basis of the Lowland Scots, <pb break="no"

                    Scotch, when Celtic, Erse, or Gaelic had ceased to be spoken in the lowland
                    districts, in distinction from southern English. Its customary law, with
                    additions prior to the war of independence of Norman feudal institutions from
                    England, is the basis of those parts of the common law of Scotland which are not
                    taken from Roman jurisprudence. And it was from Lothian that Anglo-Saxon and
                    Anglo-Norman civilization radiated to the remotest parts of the Highlands and
                    Islands. <hi rend="smallcaps">(ae.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">μ.)</hi></p>
