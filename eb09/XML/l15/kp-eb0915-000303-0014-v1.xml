                <p><label type="entry">LORETO</label>, a city in the province and circondario of
                    Ancona, Italy, is situated some 15 miles by rail south-west from Ancona on the
                    Ancona-Foggia railway, 16 miles north-east from Macerata, and 3 from the sea. It
                    lies upon the right bank of the Musone, at some distance from the railway
                    station, on a hill-side commanding splendid views from the Apennines to the
                    Adriatic. The city itself consists of little more than one long narrow street,
                    lined with booths for the sale of rosaries, medals, crucifixes, and similar
                    objects, the manufacture of which is the sole industry of the place. The
                    population in 1871 was only 1241; but, when the suburbs Montereale, Porta
                    Marina, and Casette are included, the population is given as 4755, that of the
                    commune being 8083. The number of pilgrims is said to amount to about 500,000
                    annually. The principal buildings, occupying the four sides of the piazza, are
                    the college of the Jesuits, the Palazzo Apostolico (designed by Bramante), and
                    the architecturally insignificant cathedral church of the Holy House (Chiesa
                    della Casa Santa). The handsome façade of the church was erected under Sixtus
                    V., who fortified Loreto and gave it the privileges of a town (1586); his
                    colossal statue stands in the middle of the flight of steps in front. Over the
                    principal doorway is a life-size bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by
                    Girolamo Lombardo; the three superb bronze doors executed under Paul V.
                    (1605-21) are also by Lombardo, his sons, and his pupils. ' The richly decorated
                    campanile, by Vanvitelli, is of great height; the principal bell, presented by
                    Leo X. in 1516, weighs 11 tons. The <pb break="no"

                    Domenichino and Guido Reni, a beautiful bronze font and other works of art; but
                    the chief object of interest is the Holy House itself, which occupies a central
                    place. It is a plain brick building, measuring 28 feet by 12J, and 13£ feet in
                    height; it has a door on the north side and a window on the west; and a niche
                    contains a small black image of the Virgin and Child, in Lebanon cedar, and
                    richly adorned with jewels. St Luke is alleged to have been the sculptor; its
                    workmanship suggests the latter half of the 15th century. Around the Santa Casa
                    is a lofty marble screen, designed by Bramante, and executed under Popes Leo X.,
                    Clement VIL, and Paul III., by Andrea Sansovino, Girolamo Lombardo, Bandinelli,
                    Guglielmo della Porta, and others. The four sides represent the Annunciation,
                    the Nativity, the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto, and the Nativity of the
                    Virgin respectively. The treasury of the church contains a large variety of rich
                    and curious votive offerings.</p>
                <p>The legend of the Holy House, by which Loreto became what has been not
                    inappropriately called the Christian Mecca, seems to have sprung up, how is not
                    exactly known, at the close of the crusading period. It is briefly referred to
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Italia</hi><hi rend="italic">Illustrata</hi> of Flavius
                    Blondus, secretary to Popes Eugenius I V.,Nicholas V.,Calixtus III., and Pius
                    II. <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1464); it is to be read in all its fulness in
                    the “Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesiae Lauretana historia,” by a certain
                    Teremannus, contained in the <hi rend="italic">Opera Omnia</hi> (1576) of
                    Baptista Mantuanus. According to this narrative the house at Nazareth in which
                    Mary had been born and brought up, had received the annunciation, and had lived
                    during the childhood of Jesus and after His ascension, was converted into a
                    church by the apostles, and worship continued to be held in it until the fall of
                    the kingdom of Jerusalem. Threatened with destruction by the Turks, it was
                    carried by angels through the air and deposited (1291) in the first instance on
                    a hill at Tersato in Dalmatia (some miles inland from Zengg), where an
                    appearance of the Virgin and numerous miraculous cures attested its sacredness,
                    which was confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the
                    governor of Dalmatia. In 1294 the angels carried it across the Adriatic to a
                    wood near Recanati; from this wood (lauretum), or from the name of its
                    proprietrix (Laureta), the chapel derived the name which it still retains
                    (“sacellum gloriosae Virginis in Laureto”). From this spot it was afterwards
                    (1295) removed to the present hill, one other slight adjustment being required
                    to fix it in its actual site. Bulls in favour of the shrine at Loreto were
                    issued by Sixtus IV. in 1491 and by Julius II. in 1507, the last alluding to the
                    translation of the house with some caution (“ut pie creditur et fama est ”). The
                    recognition of the sanctuary by subsequent pontiffs has already been alluded to.
                    In the end of the 17th century Innocent XII. appointed a “missa cum officio
                    proprio” for the feast of the Translation of the Holy House, and the Festum
                    Translationis Almae Domus Lauretanae B. Μ. V. is still enjoined in the Spanish
                    Breviary as a “duplex majus” (December 10). In the sixth lesson it is stated
                    that “the house in which the Virgin was born, having been consecrated to the
                    divine mysteries, was by the ministry of angels removed from the power of the
                    infidels first to Dalmatia and afterwards to the Lauretan field during the
                    pontificate of Celestine V. That it is the identical house in which the Word was
                    made flesh and dwelt among men is attested by papal documents, by the veneration
                    of all the world, by continued miracles, and by the grace of heavenly
                    blessings.”</p>
