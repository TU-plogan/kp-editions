                    province of western Persia, with ill-defined limits, but lying mainly between
                    31° and 33° N. lat. and between 47° and 52° E. long., and bounded N. and E. by
                    Irak-Adjemi, S. by Farsistan, W. by Khuzistan and the Turkish vilayet of
                    Baghdad. It thus stretches north-west and south-east some 260 miles, with a mean
                    breadth of 70 miles and an area of rather less than 20,000∙ square miles. The
                    surface is mostly mountainous, being occupied in the west by the Pusht-i-koh
                    range, which forms the frontier line towards Turkey, in the east by the
                    Bakhtiari (Zagros) range, which runs northwest and south-east, thus connecting
                    the Kurdistan· with the Kuh-Dinar or Farsistan highland systems. Between the
                    parallel Pusht-i-koh and Bakhtiari chains there stretch some naturally fertile
                    plains and low hilly districts, which, however, are little cultivated, although
                    well-watered by the Karan, Dizful, and Kerkhah, the three· chief rivers of the
                    province. There are two main divisions— Luri Buzurg, or “Great Luristan,”
                    comprising the Bakhtiari highlands westwards to river Dizful, and Luri Kuchak,
                    or “Little Luristan,” stretching thence to Khuzistan and Turkey. The latter is
                    again divided into the Pesh-koh and Pusht-i-koh districts (“before” and “behind”
                    the mountains), and notwithstanding its name is by far the most populous and
                    productive of the two. From the 12th to the 17th century it formed an
                    independent principality under hereditary rulers with the title of “atabeg,” the
                    last of whom was deposed by Shah Abbas, and the government transferred to Husen
                    Khan, chief of the Faili tribe, with the title of “vali.” His descendants are
                    still at the head of the administration; but the power of the valis has been
                    much reduced since the transfer of the Pesh-koh district to Kirmanshah.</p>

                    people of Iranian stock and speech, who still form the vast majority of the
                    population. Great uncertainty has hitherto prevailed regarding the nomenclature,
                    the main divisions and the true affinity of the Luri to the other branches of
                    the Iranian family. Thus, from the name of the present ruling clan all the
                    tribes of Luri Kuchak are commonly spoken of as “Faili,” a term which is now
                    rejected by the Pesh-koh tribes, and which, if used at all as a general ethnical
                    expression, ought to be restricted to those of Pusht-i-koh, still under the rule
                    of the vali. The classifications of Layard, Bawlin-son, and A. H. Schindler
                    differ materially, while contradictory statements are made by well-informed
                    writers regarding the physical and linguistic relations of the Luri to the
                    neighbouring Kurds and Persians. From a careful consideration of the available
                    evidence it would appear that the Luri are the true aborigines of their present
                    domain, where they occupy an intermediate position between the Kurds and
                    Persians, but resembling the former much more than the latter in speech,
                    temperament, social habits, and physical appearance. Although they themselves
                    reject the name of Kurd, the two languages are essentially one, so that the
                    natives of Kirmanshah and Dizful have little difficulty in conversing together.
                    Like the Kurds, they are also of a restless and unruly disposition, averse from
                    a settled life, still dwellers in tents, mostly owners of flocks and herds,
                    holding agriculture in contempt, and of predatory habits. “In appearance the
                    Bakhtiari look rather fierce, owing probably to the mode of life they lead; the
                    features of their face are cast in a rough mould, but although coarse they are
                    in general regular. Their black eyes look wild and expressive, and the two black
                    tufts of hair behind their ears give them, if possible, a still darker
                    appearance. They are muscular built, and are chiefly of a middle stature” (E.
                    Balfour). In a word, the Luri must be classed anthropologically in the same
                    group as the Kurds. They are excellent stockbreeders, and their horses and mules
                    are regarded as the very best in Persia. Of the mules, about a thousand are
                    annually exported to the surrounding provinces. Most of the hard work is left to
                    the women, who tend the flocks, till the little land under cultivation, tread
                    out the corn, and weave the carpets, black goat-hair tents, and horse cloths for
                    which Luristan is famous. The men put their hands to no useful work, go about
                    armed, and are always ready for a foray. Their constant intertribal feuds render
                    the country unsafe for trade and travel, while their revolts against the central
                    government often cause a total interruption of communication<pb break="no"

                    however, has somewhat abated since the tribal chiefs have been compelled to give
                    hostages as security for their good behaviour.</p>
                <p>Outwardly Mohammedans of the Shiah sect, the Lιiri show little veneration either
                    for the Prophet or the Koran. Their religion seems to be a curious mixture of
                    Ali-∏ahism, involving a belief in successive incarnations and the worship of the
                    national saint, Baba Buzurg, combined with many mysterious rites, sacrifices,
                    and secret meetings certainly anterior to Islam, and possibly traceable to the
                    ancient rites of Mithras and Anaitis.</p>
                <p>The chiefs enjoy almost unlimited authority over their subjects, and the tribal
                    organization is strongly marked by the feudal spirit.</p>
                <p>The total population of Luristan is about 320,000, and the average revenue nearly
                    £40,000 sterling.</p>
