                <p><label type="entry">LUBECK</label>, a free city of Germany, situated in 53° 52'
                    N. lat. and 10° 41' E. long., on a gentle ridge between the rivers Trave and
                    Wakenitz, 10 miles S.W. of the mouth of the former, and 40 miles by rail N.E. of
                    Hamburg. Old Lübeck, the chief emporium of the Slav inhabitants of Wagria (East
                    Holstein), stood on the left bank of the Trave, where it is joined by the river
                    Schwartau, and was ultimately destro ed in 1138. Five years later Count Adolphus
                    II. of Holstein founded new Lübeck, a few miles farther up, on the peninsula
                    Buku, where the deep current of the Trave is joined on the right by the
                    Wakenitz, the broad emissary of the Lake of Ratzeburg. A most excellent harbour,
                    well sheltered against pirates, it became almost at once a successful competitor
                    for the commerce of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0045-0032"/> the Baltic. Its foundation coincided with the
                    beginning of the general advance of the Low German tribes of Flanders,
                    Friesland, and Westphalia along the southern shores of the great inland sea,—
                    the second great emigration of the colonizing Saxon element. In 1140 Wagria, in
                    1142 the country of the Pυlabes (Ratzeburg and Lauenburg), had been annexed by
                    the Holtsaetas (the Transalbingian Saxons). From 1166 onwards there was a Saxon
                    count at Schwerin. Frisian and Saxon merchants from Soest, Bardewieck, and other
                    localities in Lower Germany, who already navigated the Baltic and had their
                    factory in the distant isle of Gothland, settled in the new town, where Wendish
                    speech and customs never entered. About 1157 Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony,
                    forced his vassal, the count of Holstein, to give up Lübeck; and in 1163 he
                    removed thither the tottering episcopal see of Oldenburg (Stargard), founding at
                    the same time the dioceses of Ratzeburg and Schwerin. He issued the first
                    charter to the citizens, and deliberately constituted them a free Saxon
                    community having its own magistrate, an inestimable advantage over all other
                    towns of his dominions. He invited the traders of the towns and realms of the
                    north to visit his new market free of toll and custom, provided his subjects
                    were promised similar privileges in return. From the very beginning the king of
                    Denmark granted them a settlement for their herring fishery on the coast of
                    Schoonen. Adopting the statutes of Soest in Westphalia as their code, Saxon
                    merchants exclusively ruled the city. In concurrence with the duke’s reeve they
                    recognized only one right of judicature within the town, to which nobles as well
                    as artisans had to submit. Under these circumstances the population grew rapidly
                    in wealth and influence by laud and sea, so that, when Henry was attainted by
                    the emperor, who had come in person to besiege Lübeck, Barbarossa, “in
                    consideration of its revenues and its situation on the frontier of the empire,”
                    fixed by charter, dated September 19, 1188, the limits, and enlarged the
                    liberties, of the free town. Evil times, however, were in store when the
                    Hohenstaufen dynasty became more and more involved in its Italian projects. In
                    the year 1201 Lübeck was conquered by Waldemar II. of Denmark, who prided
                    himself on the possession of such a city. But in 1223 it regained its liberty,
                    after the king had been taken captive by the count of Schwerin. In 1226 it was
                    incorporated as an independent city of the empire by Frederick II., and took an
                    active part with the enemies of the Danish king in the victory of Yornhövd,
                    1227. The citizens, distinguished by the firmness and wisdom with which they
                    pursued their objects, and fully conscious that they were the pioneers of
                    civilization in the barbarian regions of the north-east, repelled the persistent
                    encroachments of their dynastic neighbours alike in Holstein and in Mecklenburg.
                    On the other hand their town, being the principal emporium of the Baltic by the
                    middle of the 13th century, acted as the firm ally of the Teutonic knights in
                    Livonia. Generation after generation of crusaders embarked to found new cities
                    and new sees of Low German speech among alien and pagan races; and thus in the
                    course of a century the commerce of Lübeck had fully supplanted that of
                    Westphalia. In close connexion with the Germans at Wisby, the capital of
                    Gothland, and at Riga, where they had a house from 1231, the people of Lübeck
                    with their armed vessels scoured the sea between the Trave and the Neva. They
                    were encouraged by papal bulls in their brave contest for the rights of property
                    in wrecks, and for the protection of shipping against pirates and slave-hunters.
                    Before the close of the century the statutes of Lübeck were adopted by most
                    Baltic towns having a German population, and Wisby raised her protest in vain
                    that the city on the Trave had become the acknowledged court of appeal for
                    nearly all these cities, and even for the German settlement in Russian Novgorod.
                    In course of time more than a hundred places were embraced in this relation, the
                    last vestiges of which did not disappear until the beginning of the 18th
                    century. Hitherto only independent merchants, individual Westphalian and Saxon
                    citizens, had flocked together at so many out-lying posts. From about 1299
                    Lübeck presided over a league of cities, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald,
                    and some smaller ones, commonly called the Wendish towns. A Hansa of towns
                    became heir to a Hansa of traders simultaneously on the eastern and the western
                    sea, after Lübeck and her confederates had been admitted to the same privileges
                    with Cologne, Dortmund, and Soest at Bruges and in the Steelyards of London,
                    Lynn, and Boston. Such progress of civic liberty and federal union held its own,
                    chiefly along the maritime outskirts of the empire, rather against the will of
                    king and emperor. Nevertheless Rudolf of Hapsburg and several of his successors
                    issued new charters to Lübeck. Charles IV., who, like his son after him,
                    deliberately opposed all confederacies of the Franconian and Swabian towns in
                    Upper Germany, surrendered to the municipal government of Lübeck the little that
                    remained of imperial jurisdiction by transferring to them the chief
                    responsibility for preserving the public peace within the surrounding
                    territories. Under these circumstances the citizens, like independent members of
                    the empire, stood valiantly together with their sister towns against encroaching
                    princes, or joined the princes against the lawless freebooters of the nobility.
                    As early as 1241 Lübeck, Hamburg, and Soest had combined to secure their common
                    highways against robber knights. Solemn treaties to enforce the public peace
                    were concluded in 1291 and 1338 with the dukes of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, and
                    Pomerania, and the counts of Holstein. From Lübeck families, the descendants of
                    Low German immigrants with a certain admixture of patrician and even junker
                    blood, arose a number of wise councillors, keen diplomatists, and brave warriors
                    to attend almost incessantly the many diets of the league, to decide squabbles,
                    petty or grave, of its members, to interfere with shrewd consistency when the
                    authorities in Flanders, or king and parliament in England, touched their
                    ancient commercial privileges, to take the command of a fleet against the kings
                    of Norway or Denmark. Though the great federal armament against Waldemar IV.,
                    the destroyer of Wisby, was decreed by the city representatives assembled at
                    Cologne in 1367, Lübeck was the leading spirit in the war which ended with the
                    surrender of Copenhagen and the glorious peace concluded at Stralsund on 24th
                    May 1370. Her burgomaster, Brun Warendorp, who commanded in person the combined
                    naval and land forces, died bravely in harness. In 1368 the seal of the city, a
                    double-headed imperial eagle (which in the 14th century took the place of the
                    more ancient ship), was expressly adopted as the common seal of the confederated
                    towns <hi rend="italic">{civitates</hi><hi rend="italic">marüimae),</hi> some
                    seventy of which had united to bear the brunt of the strife. By and by, however,
                    towards the end of the 15 th century, the power of the Hanseatic League began
                    slowly to decline, owing to the rise of Burgundy in the west, of Poland and
                    Russia in the east, and the emancipation of the Scandinavian kingdom from the
                    fetters of the union of Calmar. Still Lübeck, even when nearly isolated, strove
                    manfully to preserve its predominance in a war with Denmark (1501-12),
                    supporting Gustavus Vasa in Sweden, lording it over the north of Europe during
                    the years 1534 and 1535 in the person of Jürgen Wullenwever, the democratic
                    burgomaster, who professed the most advanced principles of the Reformation, and
                    engaging with Sweden in a severe naval war (1563-70). Before the end of the
                    century the old privileges of the London Steelyard were definitely suppressed by
                    Elizabeth. As early as 1425 the regular <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0046-0033"/> shoals of herring, a constant source of early
                    wealth, began to forsake the Baltic waters. Later on, by the discovery of a new
                    continent, general commerce was diverted into new directions. Finally, with the
                    Thirty Years’ War, misfortunes and ruin came thick. The last Hanseatic diet met
                    at Lübeck in 1630, shortly after Wallenstein’s unsuccessful attack on Stralsund;
                    and from that time merciless sovereign powers stopped free intercourse on all
                    sides. Danes and Swedes battled for the possession of the Sound and its heavy
                    dues. The often changing masters of Holstein and Lauenburg abstracted much of
                    the valuable landed property of the city and of the chapter of Lübeck. Still,
                    towards the end of the 18th century, there were signs of improvement. Though the
                    Danes temporarily occupied the town in 1801, it preserved its freedom and gained
                    some of the chapter lands when the imperial constitution of Germany was broken
                    up by the Act of February 25, 1803. Trade and commerce prospered marvellously
                    for a few years. But in November 1806, when General Blücher, retiring from the
                    catastrophe of Jena, had to capitulate in the vicinity of Lübeck, the town was
                    taken and sacked by the enemy. Napoleon annexed it to the empire in December
                    1810. But it rose against the French, March 19, 1813, was reoccupied by them
                    till the 5th December, and was ultimately declared a free and Hanse town of the
                    German Confederation by the Act of Vienna, June 9, 1815. The Hanseatic League,
                    however, having never been officially dissolved, Lübeck still enjoyed its
                    traditional connexion with Bremen and Hamburg. In 1853 they sold their common
                    property, the London Steelyard. Till 1866 they enlisted by special contract
                    their military contingents for the German Confederation. Down to the year 1879
                    they had their own court of appeal at Lübeck. The town, however, joined the
                    Prussian Customs Union as well as the North German Union in 1866, profiting by
                    the final retirement from Holstein and Lauenburg of the Danes, whose
                    interference had prevented as long as possible a direct railroad between Lübeck
                    and Hamburg.</p>
                <p>Lübeck through many changes in the course of eight centuries has preserved its
                    republican government. At the first rise of the town, justice was administered
                    to the inhabitants by the <hi rend="italic">vogt</hi> (reeve) of the count.
                    Simultaneously with the incorporation by Henry the Lion, who presented the
                    citizens with the privileges of mint, toll, and market of their own, there
                    appears a magistracy of six persons, elected probably by the reeve from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schöffen</hi><hi rend="italic">{scabini,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >probi</hi><hi rend="italic">homines).</hi> The members of the town council had
                    to be freemen, born in lawful wedlock, in the enjoyment of free property, and of
                    unstained repute. Vassals or servants of any lord and tradespeople were
                    excluded. A third of the number had annually to retire for a year, so that
                    two-thirds formed the sitting, the other third the reposing council. By the
                    middle of the 13th century there were two burgomasters <hi rend="italic"
                    >{magistri</hi><hi rend="italic">burgensium,</hi><hi rend="italic">magistri
                    civium, proconsules).</hi> Meanwhile the number of magistrates <hi rend="italic"
                    >{con-sales)</hi> had largely increased, but was indefinite, ranging from twenty
                    to forty and upwards. The council appointed its own officers in the various
                    branches of the administration,—chancellor, chaplain, surgeon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >stadesscrivere</hi> (recorders), notaries, secretaries, marshal, constable,
                    keeper of the ordnance, messengers, watchmen. In the face of so much
                    self-government the <hi rend="italic">vogt</hi> by and by vanished completely.
                    He is by no means to be confounded with the <hi rend="italic">rector,</hi> a
                    neighbouring prince, whom the Lübeckers occasionally adopted as their honorary
                    guardian. There were three classes of inhabitants—full freemen, half freemen,
                    guests or foreigners. People of Slav origin being considered unfree, all
                    intermarriage with them tainted the blood. Hence nearly all surnames point to
                    Saxon, especially Westphalian, and even Flemish descent.</p>
                <p>Since the end of the 13th century the city has been entered by the same gates and
                    traversed by the same streets as at the present day. Stately churches of the
                    Gothic order in glazed brick rose slowly,—last not least St Mary’s or <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Rathskirche</hi> close to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rathhaus</hi> (town-hall) and the spacious market-place with its
                    long rows of booths and the pillory. Within its precincts is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dom</hi> (cathedral) dedicated to St Nicholas, the patron saint of
                    navigators; in Protestant times down to 1803 the secularized chapter was
                    generally presided over by a prince of the ducal house of Gottorp. There were
                    magnificent convents of the Dominicans, the Franciscans, and the nuns of St
                    Clara. The population, when the city and the Hansa were in full power about
                    1400, can scarcely have been under 80,000. But such prosperity was not obtained
                    by foreign commerce alone, though this was the principal occupation of the upper
                    classes :—the <hi rend="italic">Junker</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Zirkel</hi>
                    company, a sort of patriciate (since 1379); the merchant company, also
                    patricians, but mostly “rentiers”; the “nations” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bergenfahrer, Schonenfahrer,</hi><hi rend="italic">Novgorodfahrer,
                    Rigafahrer,</hi><hi rend="italic">Stockholmfahrer.</hi> From the very beginning
                    various tradespeople and handicraftsmen had settled in the town, all of them
                    freemen, of German parentage, and with property and houses of their own. Though
                    not eligible for the council, they shared to a certain extent in the
                    self-government through the aldermen of each corporation <hi rend="italic"
                    >{amt,</hi> officium, guild), of which some appear as early as the statutes of
                    1240, and many more arise and disappear in course of time under authority of the
                    council and the guidance of certain police magistrates <hi rend="italic"
                    >{wetteherren).</hi> A number still exist, and own their old picturesque gable
                    houses. The rolls of nearly all have been kept most carefully. Naturally there
                    arose much jealousy between the guilds and the aristocratic companies, which
                    exclusively ruled the republic. After an attempt to upset the merchants had been
                    suppressed in 1384, the guilds succeeded under more favourable circumstances in
                    1408. The old patrician council left the city to appeal to the Hansa and to the
                    imperial authorities, while a new council, elected chiefly from the guilds, with
                    democratic tendencies, took their place. In 1416, however, there was a complete
                    restoration, owing to the interference of the confederated cities and of two
                    kings of the Romans, Rupert and Sigismund. The aristocratic government was
                    expelled a second time when democracy and religious sectarianism got the upper
                    hand under the dictatorship of Wullen we ver, till the old order of things was
                    once more re-established in 1535. Nevertheless the mediaeval church had been
                    finally supplanted by the Lutheran Reformation, and the tendency to increase the
                    political privileges of the commonalty appeared again and again. In the
                    constitution of 1669, under the pressure of a great public debt, the seven upper
                    companies yielded to (8) the <hi rend="italic">Gewandschneider</hi> (merchant
                    tailors), (9) the grocers, (10) the brewers, (11) the mariners, and (12) the
                    combined four great guilds, viz., the smiths, bakers, tailors, and shoemakers, a
                    specified share in the financial administration. Nevertheless they continued to
                    choose the magistrates by co-optation among themselves. Three of the four
                    burgomasters and two of the senators, however, henceforth had to be graduates in
                    law. Their constitution, set aside only during the French ascendency, has
                    subsequently been slowly reformed. From 1813 senatorial and civic deputies
                    joined in the administration of an annual budget of income, expenditure, and
                    public debt. But the reform committee of 1814, of which the object was to
                    substitute for the rule of the old companies a wider participation of the
                    citizens in their common affairs (most of the learned professions, many
                    proprietors, and the suburban population being without any representation), had
                    made very little progress, when under the pressure of the events of the year
                    1848 a representative assembly of one hundred and twenty members, elected by
                    universal suffrage, obtained a place beside the senatorial government. By the
                    constitution of the 29th December 1851 the senate, for which all citizens above
                    thirty years of age are eligible, has at present fourteen members. Eight must be
                    taken from the learned professions, of whom six have to be lawyers, while of the
                    rest five ought to be merchants. Every second year the offices and departments
                    are redistributed, to be in most cases administered conjointly with deputies of
                    the assembly. The president of the senate, chosen for two years, retains the old
                    title of burgomaster. The members of the assembly, which participates in all
                    public affairs, are elected for six years, and must be summoned at least six
                    times a year, while a committee of thirty members meets every fortnight
                    simultaneously with the periodical sessions of the senate. These truly
                    democratic institutions have been scarcely at all modified by the resuscitation
                    of the German empire under the king of Prussia. But evidently the ancient
                    republic has lost some important attributes of a sovereign state by giving up
                    its own military contingent, its right of levying customs, its coinage, its
                    postal dues, its judicature, to the new national empire. On the other hand, it
                    has preserved its municipal self-government and its own territory, the
                    inhabitants of which now enjoy equal political privileges with the citizens. The
                    territory, of about 5⅛ German square miles (116 Eng. sq. m.), partly extends
                    towards the mouth of the river Trave, where the borough of Travemünde has been
                    the property of Lübeck since 1329, and partly consists of numerous villages,
                    manors, farms, and corn, pasture, and forest lands scattered over the adjoining
                    portions of the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg. The manor and borough of
                    Bergedorf on the Elbe, 1⅜ German square miles, long held by Lübeck in common
                    with Hamburg, was ceded to the latter by treaty of 1st July 1867. The lands
                    which remain to Lübeck are thinly peopled, for, according to the census of 1875,
                    of the total of 56,912 inhabitants 44,799 lived in Lübeck itself. The vast
                    majority, 55,693, are Lutheran Protestants, whose service continues in the
                    magnificent city churches, the cathedral, two parishes at Travemünde, and the
                    four country parishes. A celebrated high <pb break="no"

                    buildings of St Catharine, formerly the house of the Franciscans. The charitable
                    institutions enjoy a large, well-administered property, chiefly the lands of the
                    monastery of St John and the hospital of the Holy Ghost. Since 1789 there has
                    existed a “Gesellschaft zur Beförderung Gemeinnütziger Thätigkeit,” with a
                    branch union for the history and the antiquities of Lübeck, which has collected
                    a valuable museum and promotes important historical publications, the materials
                    of which are kept in the most unique municipal archives in existence. The income
                    and expenditure of the Lübeck budget of 1881 balance with 2,739,382 marks; the
                    public debt amounts to 23,804,913 marks.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the town are numerous, but not large or important (woollen,
                    linen, cotton, and silk goods, leather wares, hardware, tobacco, and preserves).
                    The commerce, on the other hand, is considerable, the chief exports being corn,
                    cattle, wool, timber, and iron; while wines, silks, cottons, hardware, colonial
                    products, and dye-stuffs are imported. There is regular steamship communication
                    with Copenhagen and the Baltic ports, and four lines of railway converge in
                    Lübeck. Since the deepening of the Trave (1850-54) sea-going ships can come up
                    to Lübeck itself; formerly they required to unload at Travemünde. In 1878 the
                    local shipping of Lübeck amounted to 46 vessels of .10,223 aggregate tonnage (27
                    steamers, 1504 horse-power, 6463 tons). In 1877 2302 vessels (981 steamers) with
                    a tonnage of 301,910 entered, and 2332 vessels (979 steamers) with a tonnage of
                    307,567 cleared the port.</p>
