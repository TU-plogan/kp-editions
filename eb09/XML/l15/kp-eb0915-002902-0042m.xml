                    United States, in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, at the junction of the
                    Concord and Merrimack rivers, 26 miles north-west from Boston. It is often
                    called the “Spindle City,” and the “Manchester of America,” because of the
                    extent of its cotton manufacture. The principal source of its water-power is
                    Pawtucket Falls in the Merrimack, and steam is employed as an auxiliary to the
                    amount of 19,793 horse-power. The first cotton-mill was started in 1823, when
                    the place was the village of East Chelmsford. In 1826 it was made a town, and
                    named Lowell in memory, of Francis Cabot Lowell, from whose plans it had been
                    developed, but who died in 1817. It was incorporated as a city in 1836. It
                    originally comprised 2885 acres, but by annexation from neighbouring towns its
                    area has been increased to 7615 acres, or 11 ∙8 square miles. The population,
                    which in 1836 was 17,633, was 40,928 in 1870, and 59,485 in 1880 (males, 26,855;
                    females, 32,630), and in 1882 was estimated at 64,000.</p>

                <p>The capital invested is $17,300,000; number of mills, 153; spindles, 806,000;
                    looms, 20,521; females employed, 12,809; males, 9750; yards per year, cotton

                    per year, 13,695,520 pairs; cotton consumed annually, 34,087 tons; clean wool,
                    11,750,000 lb; yards cotton dyed and printed, 97,240,000; coal consumed, 80,000
                    tons. There are many secondary industries connected with the cotton manufacture,
                    including the making of machinery, elastic and leather goods, tools, boilers,
                    &amp;c., and also a number of small factories for the production of cartridges,
                    chemicals, wire cloth, paper, doors, sashes, blinds, and carriages. The Lowell
                    machine-shop employs 1400 men in the manufacture of machinery, and consumes 9800
                    tons of iron and steel annually. Lowell has 90 public day schools, 6 evening and
                    4 technical schools, a reform school, and 2 parochial schools. The principal
                    public buildings are the city-hall, court-house, Middlesex county jail, Green
                    school-house, and St John’s Hospital. There are 7 national banks with a total
                    capital of $2,500,000, and 6 savings banks with deposits of $11,000,000. The
                    religious congregations number 35, all but three of which own their places of
                    worship. The two largest Roman Catholic churches, St Patrick’s and the Church of
                    the Immaculate Conception, are among the finest in the State. Seven railroads
                    connect Lowell with the railroad system of the country. The benevolent
                    institutions include a home for young women and children, and one for aged
                    women, 2 orphanages, and 3 hospitals. There are 2 reading-rooms, 5 daily
                    newspapers (one French), 6 weeklies, and 4 public libraries. Lowell was early
                    famed for the high character of its operatives, who for some years published a
                    periodical of considerable literary merit called <hi rend="italic">The Lowell
                    Offering,</hi> which was, it is believed, the only publication of the kind ever
                    sustained by workpeople. Many of the young women rose to positions of prominence
                    in American society, and at least one, Miss Lucy Larcom, is known to readers on
                    both sides of the Atlantic by her contributions to leading magazines.</p>
                <p>In 1843 Charles Dickens visited the place, and devoted a chapter of his <hi
                    rend="italic">American Notes</hi> to its praise. The manufacturers have from the
                    first provided for the moral and social as well as the physical wellbeing of
                    their operatives, so that labour troubles have been exceedingly rare in Lowell.
                    The corporation boarding-houses are model dwellings for the workpeople. The
                    first blood shed in the American civil war was that of two Lowell young men,
                    Luther C. Ladd and A. O. Whitney, who were killed by a mob while their regiment
                    was passing through the streets of Baltimore, on the way to the defence of
                    Washington, April 19, 1861. In their honour a granite monument has been erected
                    in Merrimack Street, and in the same enclosure is a bronze statue of Victory by
                    the German sculptor Rauch to commemorate the triumph of the Northern cause.</p>
                <p>The assessed valuation in May 1881 was $42,785,434 an increase of $3,108,035
                    since 1879); the net debt December 31, 1881, was $1,992,868, of which $1,565,539
                    was on account of the introduction of water in 1873.</p>
