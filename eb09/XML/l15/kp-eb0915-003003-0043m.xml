                <p><label type="entry">LOWTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label> (1710-1787),
                    bishop of London, was born at Buriton, Hampshire, or, according to other
                    authorities, in the Close of Winchester, on November 27, 1710. He was the
                    younger son of Dr William Lowth (1661-1732), rector of Buriton, a man of
                    considerable learning, author of <hi rend="italic">A Vindication of the Divine
                    Authority and Inspiration of the Old and New Testaments</hi> (1692), <hi
                    rend="italic">Directions for the Profitable Reading of the Holy Scriptures</hi>
                    (1708-26), and <hi rend="italic">A Commentary on the Prophets</hi> (4 vols.,
                    1714). Robert was educated on the foundation of Winchester College, and in 1730
                    was elected to a scholarship at New College, Oxford, where he took his degree of
                    M.A. in 1737. In 1741 he was appointed professor of poetry, and it was in this
                    capacity that he delivered the <hi rend="italic">Praelectiones</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Academicae</hi><hi rend="italic">de Sacra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Poesi Hebraeorum,</hi> afterwards published in 1753. Bishop Hoadly appointed
                    him in 1744 to the rectory of Ovington, Hampshire, in 1750 to the archdeaconry
                    of Winchester, and in 1753 to the rectory of East Woodhay, also in Hampshire. In
                    1754 he received the degree of doctor of divinity from his university, and in
                    the following year he went to Ireland along with the duke of Devonshire, then
                    lord-lieutenant, as first chaplain. Soon afterwards he declined a presentation
                    to the see of Limerick, but accepted a prebendal stall at Durham and the rectory
                    of Sedgfield. In 1758 he published his <hi rend="italic">Life of William of
                    Wykeham,</hi> which was followed in 1762 by <hi rend="italic">A Short
                    Introduction to English Grammar.</hi> In 1765, the year of his election into the
                    Royal Societies of London and Göttingen, he engaged in a hot war of pamphlets
                    with Warburton on a now obsolete question about the relations between the book
                    of Job and the Mosaic economy; and (Gibbon being judge), “whatsoever might be
                    the merits of an insignificant controversy, his victory was clearly established
                    by the silent confession of Warburton and his slaves.” In June 1766 Lowth was
                    promoted to the see of St David’s, whence about four months afterwards he was
                    translated to that of Oxford, where he remained till 1777, when he became bishop
                    of London. This last appointment he continued to hold until his death, having
                    declined the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1783. In 1778 appeared his last
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Isaiah, a new Translation, with a Preliminary
                    Dissertation, and Notes, Critical, Philological, and Explanatory.</hi> He died
                    at Fulham on November 1787.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Praelectiones</hi> exercised a great influence both in
                    England and on the Continent. Their chief importance lay in the idea of looking
                    at the sacred poetry as poetry, and examining it by the standards applied to
                    profane literature. Lowth’s aesthetic criticism was that of the age, and is now
                    in great part obsolete, a more natural method having been soon after introduced
                    by Herder. The principal point in which Lowth’s influence has been lasting is
                    his doctrine of poetic parallelism, and even here his somewhat mechanical
                    classification of the forms of Hebrew sense-rhythm, as it should rather be
                    called, is open to serious objections. The <hi rend="italic">Praelectiones</hi>
                    reached a second edition in 1763, and were republished with notes by J. D.
                    Michaelis in 1770; both text and notes were translated by G. Gregory (1787; 4th
                    ed., 1839). The Oxford edition of the original (1821) contains additions by
                    Rosenmüller, Richter, and Weiss. The editions of Lowth’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isaia,h</hi> have been numerous (13th ed., 1842), but the book is now much less
                    read than the <hi rend="italic">Praelectiones.</hi> A volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sermons and other Remains,</hi> with memoir by Hall, was published
                    in 1834, and there is a comparatively recent edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Popular Works</hi> of Robert Lowth, 3 vols., 1843.</p>
