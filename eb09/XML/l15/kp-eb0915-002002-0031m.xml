                <p><label type="entry">LOUISIANA</label>, one of the Southern States of the American
                    Union, situated on the lower course and debouche-ment of the Mississippi river.
                    It is bounded S. by the Gulf of Mexico, W. by Texas, N. by Arkansas, and E. by
                    .Mississippi Its western boundary is a line through the middle of Sabine lake
                    and river, as far north as the 32d parallel, whence it follows the meridian of
                    the point of intersection of the river with that parallel. The northern boundary
                    is the parallel of 33°. The eastern boundary is the mid-channel of the
                    Mississippi river, as far south as the 31st parallel, whence it follows that
                    parallel eastward to the middle of Pearl river, and passes down that stream to
                    the Gulf. The area of the State, according to a late determination made by the
                    Census Bureau, is 48,720 square miles, of which 1060 consist of land-locked
                    bays, 1700 of inland lakes, and 540 of river surface, leaving 45,420 square
                    miles as the total land area of the State.</p>
                <p>The average elevation of the State is only 75 feet, and no part of it reaches 500
                    feet above sea-level. The most elevated portion is near its northern border. The
                    surface is naturally divided into two parts—the upland, and the alluvial and
                    coast swamp regions. Each of the larger streams, as well as a large proportion
                    of the smaller ones, is accompanied by a belt of bottom land, of greater or less
                    width, lying low as regards the stream, and liable to overflow at times of high
                    water. These bottom lands form collectively w hat is known as the alluvial
                    region. It extends in a broad belt down the Mississippi, from the mouth of the
                    Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico, and up the Ouachita and its branches and the Red
                    River, to and beyond the limits of the State. Its breadth along the Mississippi
                    within this State ranges from 10 to 50 or 60 miles, and that along the Red River
                    and Ouachita has an average breadth of 10 miles. Through its great flood-plain
                    the Mississippi river winds upon the summit of a ridge formed by its own
                    deposits. In each direction the country falls away in a succession of minor
                    undulations, the summits of the ridges being occupied by the streams and bayous.
                    Nearly all of this vast flood-plain lies below the level of high water in the
                    Mississippi, and, were it not for the protection afforded by the levees, with
                    which most of the course of the stream is lined, every considerable rise of its
                    waters would inundate vast areas of fertile and cultivated land.</p>
                <p>Stretching along the coast, and extending inland to a varying distance, ranging
                    from 20 to 50 or even 60 miles, is a low, swampy region, the surface of which is
                    diversified only by the slight ridges along the streams and bayous which
                    traverse it, by occasional patches of slightly elevated prairie, and by live oak
                    ridgeâ. It is in and along the borders of this coast swamp region that most of
                    the sugarcane and rice produced in the State are grown.</p>
                <p>The low regions of Louisiana, including the alluvial lands and the coast swamps,
                    comprise about 20,100 square miles, or nearly one-half the area of the State.
                    The remainder consists of uplands of prairie and forest. The borders of these
                    uplands are generally defined by lines of bluffs of no great height.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are the Mississippi, which flows nearly 600 miles through
                    and along the border of the State, the Red River, the Ouachita or Washita,
                    Sabine, and Pearl, all which, excepting the last, are navigable at all stages of
                    the water. Besides those streams which may properly be called rivers, the State
                    is intersected by “bayous,” several of which are of great importance both for
                    navigation and for drainage. They may be characterized as secondary outlets of
                    the rivers. Among them may be mentioned Achafalaya Bayou, Bayou la Fourche, and
                    Bayou Boeuf. The signification of the name has, however, been extended, so that
                    many rivers in this region, particularly if they have sluggish courses, are
                    known as bayous. The alluvial portion of the State, particularly below the mouth
                    of the Red River, is a perfect network of these bayous, which serve, in time of
                    flood, to carry off the invading surplus waters.</p>
                <p>The lakes of the State are mainly comprised in three classes. First come the
                    lagoons of the coast, many of which are merely land-locked bays, whose waters
                    are salt, and which rise and fall with the tides. Of this class are
                    Pontchartrain, Borgne, Maurepas, and Sabine, and indeed all or nearly all those
                    situated in the region of the coast swamps. These are simply parts of the sea
                    which have escaped the filling-in process carried on by the great river and the
                    lesser streams. A second class, large in numbers but small in area, is the
                    result of “cut-offs” and other changes of channel in the Mississippi, and, to a
                    small extent, in the Red River. The part of the river left by this change of
                    channel becomes gradually isolated from the stream by the deposit of silt along
                    the borders of the latter, thus changing what were formerly windings of the
                    river into crescentshaped lakes. A third class may be mentioned, namely, those
                    upon Red River and its branches which are caused by the partial stoppage of the
                    water by the “raft” above Shreveport. These are, of course, much larger at flood
                    season than at other times, and, it may be added, have been much reduced in size
                    by the cutting of a channel through the raft.</p>
                <p>The climate of the State is semi-tropical; the mean annual temperature ranges
                    from 60° to 7δ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, changing approximately with the
                    latitude. The mean temperatu <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e of the hottest
                    month is about 85°, while that of the coldest month ranges in different parts of
                    the State from 45° to 60°. The temperature rarely, if ever, falls below 0°
                    Fahr., while the heats of summer reach 105° in some parts. The rainfall is very
                    heavy along the coast, exceeding 60 inches annually, but decreases inland, and
                    is not more than 50 inches in the northern districts.</p>
                <p>This large amount of moisture, together with the high temperature and the fertile
                    soil, suffices to cover the greater part of the State, and particularly the
                    alluvial regions and the coast swamps, with the most luxuriant sub-tropical
                    vegetation, both arborescent and herbaceous. Much of the latter region is
                    covered with lofty cypress trees, from which hang festoons of Spanish moss. The
                    most common species of the alluvial regions and the drier portions of the coast
                    swamps are live and other species of oaks, sweet gum, magnolia, the tulip tree,
                    black walnut, pine, and cedar. Along the streams in the alluvial region are
                    found willows, cotton-woods, basket oaks, and other species of similar habitat.
                    For the beauty and fragrance of its flowers Louisiana is justly celebrated. Its
                    bottom lands and its upland prairies are decked with them in tropical profusion.
                    Prominent among them in abundance are roses, magnolias, jasmines, camellias, and
                    oleanders. Most fruits common to a semi-tropical region are to be found here,
                    either native or cultivated, such as oranges, olives, figs, peaches, and
                    plums.</p>
                <p>The forests cover a very considerable portion of the area of the State, and are
                    destined in the future to form an important element of its wealth, although up
                    to the present time the lumber interest has not been very extensively developed.
                    The most valuable timber is that of the longleaved pine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">australis)</hi> and the short leaved pine <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pinus mitis).</hi> These are mainly confined to the upland
                    regions, being nowhere found in the alluvial or coast sections. The
                    north-western part of the State is occupied by the short-leaved pine, while the
                    long-leaved pine is found <pb break="no"

                    River, and also in the east of the State.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of these two species of trees, Professor Sargent, of the
                    United States Census Bureau, estimates that there were standing on June 1, 1880,
                    26,558,000,000 feet of the long-leaved and 21,625,000,000 feet of the
                    short-leaved species. The cut of the former for the census year was 61,882,000,
                    and of the latter 22,709,000 feet, the total cut being but <hi

                    probability, however, that the rate of destruction will increase greatly in the
                    future.</p></note></p>
                <p>The native fauna of the State resembles in its general features that of the other
                    Gulf States. Large quadrupeds are comparatively rarely met with, although
                    occasionally there are seen black bears and wolves, and in the swamps an
                    occasional panther. Smaller quadrupeds, such as raccoons, squirrels, wild cats,
                    opossums, &amp;c., are still common. Every bayou contains alligators; and
                    reptiles of various species, such as turtles, lizards, horned toads,
                    rattlesnakes, and moccasin snakes, are abundant. The avifauna of the State is
                    varied and abundant, comprising eagles, vultures, hawks, owls, pelicans, cranes,
                    turkeys, geese, partridges, ducks, &lt;fcc., besides numberless smaller species,
                    many of these, as in other parts of the world in the same latitude, being
                    brilliant of plumage, but harsh of voice.</p>
                <p>The surface geology in its general outlines is very simple. The whole alluvial
                    region and the coast swamps, besides a considerable portion of the prairie and
                    pine flats bordering upon the lowlands, are of the most recent or Quarternary
                    formations, while the remainder of the State, comprised mainly in the region
                    west of the Ouachita and Calcasieu rivers, is Tertiary, with the exception of a
                    few very small islands of the Cretaceous formation in the north-western part of
                    the State.</p>
                <p>In the Tertiary region are found small quantities of iron ore, and an indifferent
                    brown coal. But the only important mineral product of the State is rock salt;
                    the deposit upon Petite Anse Island, in the coast swamp region, has been
                    extensively worked, and produces a very high quality of salt. In 1880 its
                    production was 312,000 bushels.·</p>
                <p>The principal industry of the State is agriculture, and in that cotton takes the
                    first place. Out of a total area of tilled laud of two and a half million acres,
                    more than one-third was planted in 1879 with cotton. The total production was
                    508,569 bales, an average of '59 of a bale per acre. Louisiana stood seventh in
                    the list of cotton-producing States, being exceeded by Mississippi, Georgia,
                    Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and South Carolina. The cotton crop is cultivated both
                    in the alluvial and the upland regions. In the former there were raised in 1879
                    282,390 bales, on 364,790 acres, an average yield per acre of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 77 of a bale. In the latter region 498,080 acres were
                    planted, giving a total yield of 225,385 bales, an average of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 45 of a bale per acre. The great depth and fertility
                    of the alluvial soils are strikingly illustrated by these average yields. In the
                    coast swamp region but little cotton is cultivated,—the total yield in these
                    parishes, as reported by the census, being but 794 bales.</p>
                <p>The production of other agricultural products, as given by the census of 1880, is
                    as follows :—</p>

                <p>Rice is cultivated almost entirely in the lower coast region, on the margin of
                    the swamps, upon their prairie islands, and in the alluvial region south of Red
                    River.</p>
                <p>With the exception of its navigable streams, the State is not well supplied with
                    the means of transportation. The only railroads of importance are—the Chicago,
                    St Louis, and New Orleans, which connects New Orleans with Cairo, Illinois; the
                    Louisiana and Texas Railroad (Morgans), which runs from New Orleans westward to
                    Vermillion ville, and thence northward to Cheneyville; the Louisiana Western
                    Railroad, from Vermillionville to Orange in Texas; the New Orleans and Pacific
                    Railroad, from New Orleans to Shreveport; and the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and
                    Pacific Railroad, running from Delta to Monroe. Besides these there are several
                    minor lines. The total length of railroad is 632⅜ miles, and the cost of
                    construction $44,869,342. The gross returns for 1880 were $3,238,318, and the

                <p>The State is fairly well provided with the means of education. School attendance,
                    however, is not very general. Out of a population of 330,930 between the ages of
                    six and sixteen, 78,528 were enrolled in public schools, and the estimated
                    average attendance was 50,248, or less than one-sixth. There are in the State
                    seven colleges, with 49 instructors and 786 students.</p>
                <p>As in the other States of the Union, the government is distributed among the
                    executive, legislative, and judicial departments. The executive is represented
                    by the governor, lieutenant-governor, secretary of state, State treasurer,
                    auditor of public accounts, attorney-general, and superintendent of
                    instruction—all these offices being elective, and the period of incumbency four
                    years. The legislative power is vested in a general assembly consisting of two
                    branches, the lower one being the house of representatives and the upper one the
                    senate. The members of the former body are elected every two years, and the
                    number is by law never to exceed 120 nor be less than 90. The members of the
                    senate are elected for four years. The number of senators is fixed at 36, and
                    the senatorial districts are apportioned according to the population. The
                    judicial power is vested in a supreme court, district and parish courts, and
                    justices of the peace. The supreme court, except in cases specially provided for
                    by law, has appellate jurisdiction only. It is composed of one chief justice and
                    four associate justices. These are appointed by the governor, by and with the
                    advice and consent of the senate, and hold office for a term of eight years. The
                    State is divided by the legislature into judicial districts, in each of which
                    there is a district court. The number of districts in the State cannot by law be
                    less than twelve nor more than twenty. The district judges are elected by the
                    voters of the district, and hold office for four years. Each parish has its own
                    court. The parish judge is elected by the voters of the parish, and holds his
                    office for two years. In addition to this each parish elects a certain number of
                    justices of the peace with power to try minor cases. The State is divided into
                    fifty-eight parishes (equivalent to counties), and each of these into a certain
                    number of police jury wards which are designated by their numbers.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early history of the exploration of
                    Louisiana forms one of the most interesting chapters in the annals of the
                    country. It was first visited in 1541 by De Soto, cf the Spanish Government
                    service. This daring explorer, landing on the coast of Florida, made his way
                    through the pathless forests and almost impassable swamps to the Mississippi,
                    and even penetrated many leagues ιvest of it, finally leaving his bones upon its
                    shores. In 1673 Marquette and Joliet, starting from the settlements in Canada,
                    descended the great river from northern Illinois to the mouth of the Arkansas.
                    In 1682 La Salle descended the Mississippi, also starting from the French
                    settlements in the Canadas. He navigated the river from the mouth of the
                    Illinois to the Gulf. Returning to France, he originated a scheme for colonizing
                    the country, and succeeded in obtaining from France the desired concessions, and
                    in collecting a company of colonists, which set sail from Rochelle on the 24th
                    of July 1684. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining correct longitudes at sea,
                    the vessel missed the mouth of the Mississippi, and finally landed on the shore
                    of Matagorda Bay, in Texas, where they established a colony. From this point La
                    Salle started to make his way overland to Canada, but was treacherously murdered
                    by his companions. Shortly after his death the colony disappeared.</p>
                <p>The first successful attempt at settlement within the State was made by the
                    French under the leadership of Iberville in 1700. The colony was located at a
                    point on the Mississippi about 38 miles below the present site of New Orleans,
                    now known as “Poverty Point.” At first it was by no means prosperous, and it was
                    only after the treaty of Utrecht that it appears to have gained ground. At that
                    time there were not over five hundred Europeans in the whole territory of
                    Louisiana as then constituted; the greater part were in what is now the State of
                    Louisiana, the others being scattered at a few little posts along the
                    Mississippi and Illinois rivers. Immediately after the treaty of Utrecht the
                    king of France granted the whole territory of Louisiana to Antoine Crozat,
                    ceding to him all the territories watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries
                    below the mouth of the Illinois, with all the privileges of hunting, fishing,
                    commerce, mining, &amp;c., which might arise in this new territory. Crozat
                    appointed Cadillac governor of the colony. Affairs, however, went badly under
                    the new administration, and after a succession of governors, the whole district
                    fell into the hands of John Law, the originator of the famous “Mississippi
                    scheme.” Desiring to control, among other commercial monopolies, the colony of
                    Louisiana, Law found it an easy matter to obtain the charter and privileges from
                    Crozat, who was only too glad to reliuquisi them in his favour. A company was
                    formed under the name of the “Western Company.” Grants made to it were for
                    twenty-five years. Subscribers to the stock were allowed to pay three-fourths of
                    the purchase money in the depreciated bonds of France, one-fourth only of the
                    subscription being asked for in coin. Bienville, brother of Iberville, and* a
                    man possessing great influence in the colony, was appointed governor. One of his
                    first acts was to found the city of New Orleans on its present site. During the
                    year 1718 7 vessels were sent out with stores and emigrants, numbering in all
                    about 1500 persons. The following year 11 ships were despatched, and 500 negroes
                    from the Guinea coast were imported. In 1721 1000 white emigrants arrived, and
                    1367 slaves.</p>
                <p>In the meantime the Western Company had obtained from the regent power to join
                    with it the East India Company grants, and its name was changed to that of the
                    India Company. This inflated scheme burst in due time, but the misfortunes of
                    the company did not check the prosperity of the colony. The year 1721, which was
                    that following the financial ruin of the former, witnessed the greatest
                    immigration to the colony which it had ever received. The company retained its
                    organization and its grant of Louisiana until 1732, when the province reverted
                    to the crown. At that time the population of the colony was said to have been
                    5000 whites and 2000 slaves; but a census taken fifteen years later shows a
                    population of only 4000 whites.</p>
                <p>In 1762, by a secret treaty, the province was transferred from France to Spain.
                    This treaty was not made public till a year and a half after it was signed, and
                    Spain did not obtain possession until 1769. Meanwhile, in February 1763, by a
                    treaty made between France and Spain on the one hand and Great Britain-and
                    Portugal on the other, the portion of Louisiana lying east of the Mississippi
                    from its source to the river Iberville, and thence along the middle of the
                    Iberville and the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the sea, was ceded to
                    Great Britain. In this treaty, by implication, Louisiana was made to extend to
                    the sources of the Mississippi, and this is the view commonly held. The province
                    was governed by Spain till the year 1800, in the meantime making little or no
                    progress owing to the narrow and oppressive policy pursued towards it by the
                    home government. By the treaty of 1783 with Great Britain, the United States
                    were placed in possession of the eastern bank of the Mississippi river, as far
                    down as the 31st degree of latitude, while Spain held possession of the other
                    bank, and had complete possession of the river below the 31st parallel.</p>
                <p>From the time of the first settlement in the valley of the Mississippi and its
                    tributaries, the importance of the river as a means of transportation to the
                    seaboard, and the almost absolute necessity of possessing the country about its
                    mouths, were recognized by the United States. As settlements increased in the
                    valley and spread down the river, and as the hostile policy of Spain became more
                    and more plainly developed, the feeling of the settlers became stronger against
                    the restrictions of the Spanish Government. In 1800, however, Spain ceded the
                    territory back to France, and in 1803 it was sold to the United States by
                    Napoleon, in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of Great Britain.
                    The price was 60,000,000 francs, with a stipulation that the United States
                    should assume the claims of its citizens against France (French spoliation
                    claims), which were estimated to amount to $3,750,000. The province which thus
                    came into the possession of the United States was of vast though ill-defined
                    territorial extent.</p>
                <p>In 1804 nearly all of what is now the State of Louisiana was erected into a
                    territory, under the name of Orleans. In 1810 this was increased by the addition
                    of the south-eastern portion, east of the Mississippi river, and in 1812 it was
                    admitted as a State under its present name, and with its present boundaries.
                    During the war with Great Britain, which followed shortly after, a battle was
                    fought for the possession of New Orleans, between the British forces under
                    Pakcnham and the American army under Jackson, in which the former were signally
                    defeated. Up to 1860 the development of the State was very rapid, especially in
                    the direction of agriculture and commerce.</p>
                <p>Upon the outbreak of the civil war the State promptly joined its fortunes with
                    the Southern Confederacy. Its act of secession from the Union was passed
                    December 23, 1860, and from that time until the final suppression of the
                    rebellion the State government was in the hands of the Confederates, although
                    for the last two years of the war its territory was held in the main by the
                    Federal forces. In the early part of the war the State suffered but little,
                    butin April 1862 Admiral Farragut with a powerful fleet succeeded in passing
                    Forts Jackson and St Philip, which defended the approaches to New Orleans, and
                    captured the city, thus compelling the evacuation of the forts. The navigation
                    of the ^Mississippi being secured by this means and by operations from the
                    north, the State was at the mercy of the Federal Government. At the close of the
                    war, on the reorganization of the State government, the administration fell into
                    the hands of the ignorant negro classes led by unscrupulous whites, and an
                    unfortunate state of affairs ensued, which was brought to an end only by the
                    arbitrary and forcible assumption of power by the better elements of society.
                    This occurred in 1877, and since that time the State has prospered markedly in
                    all material respects. (H. G. )</p>
