                    converted to Christianity, was born at Palma, in the island of Majorca, in 1235.
                    His father had been born at Barcelona, and belonged to a distinguished
                    Catalonian family; but for his services in helping to recover the Balearic
                    islands from the Saracens he was rewarded with a gift of land in the conquered
                    territory, and the paternal estates descended to his enthusiastically-minded
                    son. The younger Lully, however, showed at first but little of the speculative
                    tendencies which he afterwards developed, and his early years were spent in the
                    gaiety and even profligacy of a courtier in the service of James II., of Aragon,
                    who appointed him grand seneschal of the isle. He married, but notwithstanding
                    sought the reputation of a gallant, and was mixed up in more than one intrigue.
                    Something, however, of the nature of a cancer, which attacked one of the objects
                    of his passion, Signora Ambrosia,—such is the way in which we are asked to
                    account for his “conversion,”—affected him so deeply that he abandoned in his
                    thirty-second year his licentious life, and, having distributed the greater
                    portion of his goods to his family and the poor, he withdrew to the retirement
                    Of a cell on Mount Randa, the only part of his property which he had reserved
                    for himself. Visions of a crucified Saviour and like phenomena confirmed him in
                    his devotion to the cause of Christ, and in the course of a nine years’ retreat
                    on Randa he came to regard himself as commissioned by God to refute the errors
                    of Mohammed.</p>
                <p>This missionary call became henceforth the actuating principle in Lully’s life.
                    To realize it, he went to Paris in his fortieth year, to prosecute the study of
                    Latin and logic; and, with a view to becoming familiar with the language of the
                    infidels, he engaged the services of an unlettered Arabian, who, finding that
                    Lully was seeking to demolish the faith of Islam, attempted to assassinate his
                    master. This need of acquiring a knowledge of the language of the church’s
                    adversary became itself now one of Lully’s favourite ideas. In 1286 he began a
                    series of visits, which he made to Rome to induce the supreme pontiff to found
                    colleges for the study of Arabic; but the small success which would attend his
                    efforts in this direction was foreshadowed by the death of Honorius (then pope)
                    before he could attain an audience of him. Meanwhile Lully had become
                    discontented with the methods of science commonly in use, and had set himself to
                    construct his “great art,” a method which, by mechanically presenting all the
                    predicates which could attach to any subject, was adapted to answer any question
                    on any topic, and would (its author imagined) by the cogency of its inferences
                    necessarily convert the heathen. His natural enthusiasm respecting the
                    consequences of this art were strengthened by revelations (as he judged them) of
                    the co-operation of God in his designs, and he gave himself up, with the fervour
                    of a divinely appointed missionary, to the work of spreading a knowledge of his
                    “great art” in every country. He expounded it at Paris and Montpellier in 1286,
                    and after a visit to Pope Nicholas, to solicit his help in founding linguistic
                    colleges, and a serious illness at Genoa, brought on apparently by an isolated
                    fit of nervous cowardice in face of the dangers he was going to encounter, he
                    sailed to Tunis, to apply his new method to the errors of Mohammedanism. At
                    Tunis his attacks upon the religion of the country led to his being cast into
                    prison, and it was only by the mediation of a sheikh, who had been impressed by
                    the earnestness of the Christian preacher, that he managed to escape to sea, not
                    without the roughest treatment at the hands of the mob, and find his way to
                    Naples.</p>
                <p>A new influence was brought to bear on Lully’s life at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0077-0064"/> Naples. He made the acquaintance of the alchemist
                    Arnaud de Villeneuve, and acquired, we may believe, not only that skill in
                    transmuting metals for which Lully himself became in popular tradition famous,
                    but imbibed also something of that spirit which brought down the censure of the
                    church on Villeneuve for maintaining that medicine and charity were more
                    pleasing to God than religious services. For the next few years the scene of
                    Lully’s labours was continually changing. He made an unsuccessful attempt to
                    interest Pope Boniface in the missionary colleges which he wished to see
                    established, and similar appeals to the kings of France and Cyprus met with no
                    more favourable a response. From Cyprus Lully proceeded (1306) to Bougiah in
                    Africa, and repeated the experiences he had already had at Tunis. But, though
                    Mohammedanism showed little disposition to welcome the “great art” and its
                    author, the European world had meanwhile begun to show itself more favourably
                    disposed towards Lully’s projects. In 1297 he had received at Montpellier, from
                    the general of the Franciscans, letters recommending him to the superiors of all
                    Franciscan houses; and in 1309 his “art” was publicly approved by a decree of
                    the university of Paris. Emboldened perhaps by such recognition, he appeared
                    before the council of Vienne in southern France in 1311, and petitioned the
                    assembled fathers to reduce the different and often-contending religious orders
                    to one great order serving simply under Christ, and to meet Mohammedanism abroad
                    and Averroism at home by founding colleges for the study of Arabic. Nothing
                    would seem to have come directly of these petitions, but we may perhaps trace
                    their result in some chairs of Syriac and Arabic which Clement V. instituted at
                    Rome, and in a college for training Franciscans in Oriental languages which
                    James of Aragon established in Majorca. Lully was now nearly eighty years of
                    age, but his zeal in combating the foes of Christianity did not abate. He sailed
                    again for Africa, and received the martyr’s crown, which would seem to have
                    become the ambition of his life. At Bougiah he again proclaimed the doctrines of
                    the church, and his preaching raised such a tumultuous attack that although he
                    managed to get on board a Genoese vessel, he succumbed during the voyage to the
                    injuries he had received, and died in sight of his native town of Palma
                    (1315).</p>
                <p>During his lifetime Lully composed, a vast number of treatises, some of which
                    have never yet been printed. They were written partly in Latin, partly in
                    Catalonian, Lully deserving mention as one of the first in medi&lt;eval times
                    who tried to find a national expression for philosophy in the language of the
                    country. Some of these works may be described as dealing with apologetic
                    theology, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Liber de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gentili</hi><hi rend="italic">et Tribus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sapientibus,</hi> in which a Jew, Christian, and Saracen explain the nature of
                    their faith, or the <hi rend="italic">Disputatio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fidelis</hi><hi rend="italic">et Infidelis</hi>; others again relate to
                    dogmatic divinity, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Liber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">XIV.</hi><hi rend="italic">Articulis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">De Deo</hi><hi rend="italic">et Jesu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Christo·,</hi> a third class refer to particular questions of logic, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">De Prima et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Secunda Intentione, Ars Inveniendi'Particularia in Universalibus, De Venatione
                    Medii</hi>; and a large number are reputed to deal with questions of alchemy.
                    But the “Great Art” of discovery itself is the subject of most or Lully’s
                    treatises. So it is with the <hi rend="italic">Ars Demonstrativa,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Compendium Artis Demonstratives,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Universalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Inventiva</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritatis,</hi><hi rend="italic">De Aιιditu
                    Cabbalistico,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic">Magna</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Ultima.</hi> And even when Lully is
                    engaged with such treatises as the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Medicinae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Juris</hi> it is to the universal key of knowledge which the great
                    art supplies that he invariably falls back.</p>
                <p>The reasonableness and demonstrability of Christianity is the assumption
                    underlying the exercise of this great method. Nothing, Lully holds, interferes
                    more with the spread of Christianity than the attempt of its advocates to
                    present its doctrines as undemonstrated and undemonstrable truths; the very
                    difference between Christianity and Antichrist lies in the fact that the former
                    can <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> the truth of its beliefs; and the glory of the
                    faith, repeats the <hi rend="italic">Liber Magnus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Contemplationis,</hi> is not that it maintains the indemonstrable but simply
                    the supersensuous. The demonstration, however, which is wanted in the service of
                    Christianity is not, Lully thinks, that of the ordinary logic; we require a
                    method which will reason not only from effect to cause, or from cause to effect,
                    butper <hi rend="italic">aequiparantiam,</hi> and show that contrary attributes
                    can coexist together in one subject. This method-, however, must be real, not
                    merely formal and subjective; it must deal not only with the second intentions,
                    but rather with the first intentions, that is, the things themselves. The great
                    art in fact goes beyond logic and metaphysic; as a universal topic it provides a
                    universal art of discovery, and contains the formula* to which every
                    demonstration in every science can be reduced. This <hi rend="italic">ars
                    investigandi,</hi> however, turns out to be not so much a key to all possible
                    knowledge as a tabulation of the different points of view from which
                    propositions may be framed about various objects—a mechanical contrivance for
                    finding out the different ways in which categories apply to things. Just, Lully
                    thought, as by knowing the typical terminations of cases and tenses we could
                    inflect and conjugate any word whatever, so by a knowledge of the different
                    types of existence and their possible combinations as portrayed by his method we
                    should possess implicitly a knowledge of the whole of nature.</p>
                <p>The great art accordingly begins by laying down an alphabet according to which
                    the nine letters from B to K stand for the different kinds of substances and
                    attributes. Thus, in the series of substances, B stands for God, C angel, D
                    heaven, E man, and so on; in the series of absolute attributes, B represents
                    goodness, C greatness, D duration; or again, in the nine questions, B stands for
                    <hi rend="italic">Utrum,</hi> C for <hi rend="italic">Quid,</hi> D for <hi
                    rend="italic">De quo.</hi> The manipulating of these letters in such a way as
                    will show the relationship between different subjects and predicates constitutes
                    accordingly the peculiarity of the “new art,” this manipulation being effected
                    by the help of certain so-called “figures.” The construction of these figures
                    varies somewhat in different parts of Lully’s writings, but their general
                    character is always the same. Circles and other mathematical figures divided
                    into sections and marked by Lully’s symbolical letters are so arranged,
                    sometimes with the help of different colours, as to show the possible
                    combinations of which the letters are capable. Thus for example one figure
                    exhibits the possible combination of the attributes of God, another the possible
                    conditions of the soul, and so on. These figures are fenced about by various
                    definitions and rales, and their use is further specified by various
                    “evacuations” and “multiplications” which show us how to exhaust and draw out
                    <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the possible combinations and sets of questions which
                    the terms under consideration can admit. When so “multiplied,” the fourth figure
                    is, Lully himself says, that by which other sciences can be most easily and
                    rapidly acquired; and it may accordingly be taken as no unfair specimen of
                    Lully’s method. This fourth figure then is simply an arrangement of three
                    concentric circles (made of tin or pasteboard) each divided into nine sections
                    B,C,D, &amp;c., and so constructed that while the upper and smaller circle
                    remains fixed, the two lower and outer revolve round it. Taking then the letters
                    in the sense of the series which seems most fitted for the subject under
                    discussion, we are enabled by making the outer circles revolve to find out the
                    possible relationships between different conceptions and elucidate the agreement
                    or disagreement which subsists between them, while, at the same time, we
                    discover the intermediate terms (in the middle circle) by which they are to be
                    connected or disconnected.</p>
                <p>The weakness of Lully’s art is the weakness of every system which pretends, as
                    Bacon’s also did, to equalize all intellects, and provide a method which will
                    produce discovery as surely as compasses will construct a circle. But it would
                    be unfair to say that Lully supposed that thinking and reasoning could be
                    reduced to a mere rotation of pasteboard circles. The real value of his art lies
                    not in being an <hi rend="italic">a p&gt;riori</hi> compendium of knowledge but
                    a method of investigation—a tabulation of the different sides from which a
                    question must be regarded, and in embodying the ideal which science puts before
                    herself of finally bringing all conceptions into unity and correlation. It is
                    easy, with the Port-Boyal logic, to speak ol Lιιlly ’ s art as merely enabling
                    us “to talk without judgment of that which we do not know”; but in his
                    conception of scientific method as tending to the glory of God and the good of
                    man, in his departure from the school logic and his wish for a real
                    interpretation of nature, in his conception of a universal method and his
                    application of the vernacular languages to philosophy, heappears as a precursor
                    of Bacon himself. And in his assertion of the place of reason in religion, in
                    his demand that a <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> Christianity should be
                    presented to heathendom, in his missionary zeal and his project of linguistic
                    colleges, Lully, with all his quixotic character, goes far beyond the ideas and
                    the aspirations of the century in which he lived.</p>
                <p>A few of Lully’s works were published by Zetzner in 1598 and frequently
                    reprinted; but the first systematic edition was begun by Salzinger in 1721, and
                    after Salzinger’s death completed in 1742, This edition is non inally in 10
                    vols., but vols. vii. and viii. were never published. In addition to older
                    works, such as Perroquet (1667) a d Nie. de Hauteville (1666) and the Acta
                    Sanctorum (vol. xxiv.), the best account of Lully's life is to be found in an
                    arti le by Dclecluze in the Revue d. d. Mondes for 1840, and the fullest account
                    of his method in Prantl, Geschichte d. Logik, iii. 145-177, and Erdmann,
                    Grundriss d. Gesch. d. Philosophie, i. § 206. The philological importance of
                    Lully’s writings is brought out by A. Helfferich, Raymond Lull und die Anfänge
                    d. Catalonischen Literatur, Berlin, 1858. (E. W.) <pb break="no"
