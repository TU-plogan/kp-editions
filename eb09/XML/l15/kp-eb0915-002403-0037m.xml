                    sense to all epizoic parasites on the bodies of other animals. From a more
                    particular point of view, however, it is strictly applicable only to certain of
                    these creatures that affect the bodies of mammals and birds. · The former may be
                    considered as lice proper, the latter are commonly known as bird-lice (although
                    a few of their number infest mammalia). Scientifically they are now generally
                    separated into <hi rend="italic">Anoplura</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >AIaUophaga,</hi> although some authors would include all under the former term.
                    In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Insects</hi> it has been shown that modern
                    ideas tend towards placing the <hi rend="italic">Anoplura</hi> as degraded
                    members of the order <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mallophaga</hi> as equally degraded <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Neuroptera,</hi>
                    according to the different formation of the mouth parts. Both agree in having
                    nothing that can be termed a metamorphosis; they are active from the time of
                    their exit from the egg to their death, gradually increasing in size, and
                    undergoing several moults or changes of skin; but it should be remembered that
                    many insects of the hemimetabolic division would scarcely present any stronger
                    indications of metamorphoses were it not for the usual outgrowth of wings, which
                    are totally wanting in the lice.</p>
                <p>The true lice (or <hi rend="italic">Anoplura)</hi> are found on the bodies of
                    many mammalia, and, as is too well known, occasion by their presence intolerable
                    irritation. The number of genera is few. Two species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pediculus</hi> are found on the human body, and are known ordinarily as the
                    head-louse (Z <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi>. <hi rend="italic">capitis)</hi>
                    and the body-louse (Z <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >vestimenti)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> some appear to recognize a third <hi
                    rend="italic">(P.</hi><hi rend="italic">tabescentium),</hi> particularly
                    affecting persons suffering from disease, burrowing (at any rate when young)
                    beneath the skin, and setting up what is termed “phthiriasis” in such a terrible
                    form that the unhappy victims at length succumb to its attacks; to this several
                    historical personages both ancient and modern are said to have fallen victims,
                    but it is open to very grave doubts whether this frightful condition of things
                    was due to other than the attacks of myriads of the ordinary bodylouse. <hi
                    rend="italic">P. capitis</hi> is found on the head, especially of children. The
                    eggs, laid on the hairs, hatch in about eight days, and the lice are full grown
                    in about a month. Such is the fecundity of lice that it is asserted by
                    Leeuwenhoek that one female (probably of <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vestimenti)</hi> may in the course of eight weeks witness the
                    birth of five thousand descendants. Want of cleanliness undoubtedly favours
                    their multiplication in a high degree, but it is scarcely necessary here to
                    allude to the idea once existing, and probably still held by the very ignorant,
                    to the effect that they are directly engendered from dirt. The irritation is
                    caused by the rostrum of the insect being inserted into the skin, from which the
                    blood is rapidly pumped up. Attempts have been made to prove that the head-louse
                    (and, in a smaller degree, the body-louse) is liable to slight variation in
                    structure, and also in colour, according to the races of men infested. This was
                    probably first enunciated by Pouchet in 1841, and the subject received more
                    extended examination by Andrew Murray in a paper published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Pοyal Society of Edinburgh</hi> in 1861 (vol.
                    xxii. pp. 567-577), who apparently shows that some amount of variation does
                    exist, but there is yet need for further investigation. That lice are considered
                    <hi rend="italic">bonnes</hi><hi rend="italic">bouches</hi> by certain
                    uncivilized tribes is well known. It would be out of place to discuss here the
                    possible interpretation of the Biblical reference to “lice” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{cf.</hi> Exodus viii. 16, 17). A third human louse is known as the crab-louse
                    <hi rend="italic">{Phthirius pubis)</hi>; this disgusting creature is found
                    amongst the hairs on other parts of the body, particularly those of the pubic
                    region, but probably never on the head; although its presence may generally be
                    looked upon as indicating dissolute association, it should not be regarded as
                    always resulting therefrom, as it may be accidentally acquired by the most
                    innocent. The louse of monkeys is now generally considered as forming a separate
                    genus <hi rend="italic">{Pedicinus),</hi> but the greater part of those
                    infesting domestic and wild quadrupeds are mostly grouped in the large genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Haematopinus,</hi> and very rarely is the same species found on
                    different kinds of animals; one species is found on the seal, and even the
                    walrus does not escape, a new species (ZZ. <hi rend="italic">tmchechi)</hi>
                    having been recently discovered affecting the axillae (and other parts where the
                    skin is comparatively soft) of that animal.</p>
                <p>The bird-lice (or <hi rend="italic">Mallophaga)</hi> are far more numerous in
                    species, although the number of genera is comparatively small. With the
                    exception of the genus <hi rend="italic">Tmchodectes,</hi> the various species
                    of which are found on mammalia, all infest birds (as their English name
                    implies). As the mouth parts of these creatures are not capable of being
                    extended into a sucking tube, but are clearly mandibulate, it appears probable
                    that they feed more particularly on the scurf of the skin and feathers;
                    nevertheless great irritation must be caused by their presence, for it is
                    notorious that cage-birds, much infested, will peck themselves to such an extent
                    as to cause death in their endeavours to get rid of the parasites. Several
                    hundred species are already known. Sometimes <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0038-0025"/> two or three species (ordinarily of different
                    genera) infest the same species of bird, and the same species of louse is not
                    often found in different birds, unless those latter happen to be closely allied.
                    But in aviaries and zoological gardens such cases do occasionally occur, as is
                    natural under the circumstances. These are analogous to the occasional presence
                    of the flea of the cat, dog, domestic fowl, &amp;c., on man; temporary annoyance
                    is caused thereby, but the conditions are not favourable for the permanent
                    location of the parasites. Notwithstanding the marked preference shown by a
                    special kind of bird-lice for a special host, there is also a marked preference
                    shown by the individual species of certain genera or groups of lice for allied
                    species of birds, which bears upon the question of the possible variation of
                    human lice according to the race infested.</p>
