                    Bulwer Lytton, Baron</hi></label> (1805-1873), novelist, dramatist, poet,
                    politician, miscellaneous essayist, the most versatile writer and one of the
                    most active and widely discursive theorizers of his generation, was born in May
                    1805, the youngest of the three sons of General Bulwer, of Heydon Hall and Wood
                    Dalling, Norfolk. He was a few months younger than Benjamin Disraeli; the two
                    lives acted not a little one on the other, and offer many curious points of
                    likeness and contrast. Bulwer’s father died when he was two years old; the care
                    of the boy devolved on his mother, one of the Lyttons of Knebworth,
                    Hertfordshire, whose name he afterwards assumed. To this devoted and
                    accomplished mother he always expressed the warmest gratitude for his early
                    training. He was not sent to a public school; he was educated privately.</p>
                <p>In his novels and essays he often discusses the advantages and disadvantages of
                    public schools. One thing is tolerably certain—that if he had been sent to a
                    public school he would not have published at the age of fifteen a volume of
                    poems <hi rend="italic">{Ismael, an Oriental Tale, with other Poems,</hi> 1820).
                    Generous sentiment and eager love of fame are more conspicuous in these juvenile
                    productions, than metrical faculty. One of the poems dwells warmly on the
                    ancient glories of the house of Lytton; the volume as a whole is dedicated to
                    “the British public—that generous public who have always been the fosterers of
                    industry or genius, who have always looked forward from the imperfections of
                    youth to the fruits of maturity.” The youthful poet criticizes Byron from the
                    point of view of a respectable household; but, though he seems to have been
                    taught to make Pope,'Gray, and Collins his models, the Byronic influence is very
                    apparent both in phrase and in sentiment. In the local colouring of the
                    “Oriental Tale <hi rend="superscript"> ,r</hi> he gives promise, afterwards
                    amply fulfilled, of painstaking study of his materials; and “Geraldine, or the
                    Fatal Boon,” gives a good foretaste of his fertility in the invention of
                    romantic incident.</p>
                <p>At Cambridge, in 1825, Bulwer won the chancellor’s medal with a poem on
                    “Sculpture.” In 1826 he printed for private circulation <hi rend="italic">Weeds
                    and Wild Flowers.</hi> In 1827 he published <hi rend="italic">O'Neill, or the
                    Rebel,</hi> a romance, in heroic couplets, of patriotic struggle in Ireland,
                    dedicated to Lady Blessington. These juvenilia, and also a metrical satire,. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Siamese Twins,</hi> issued in 1831, he afterwards ignored,
                    describing <hi rend="italic">The New</hi><hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> as his
                    first publication in verse, with the exception of his dramas and translations
                    from Schiller.</p>
                <p>Bulwer’s first romance, <hi rend="italic">Falkland,</hi> published anonymously in
                    1827, was in the vein of fantastic German romance popular at the beginning of
                    the century, and did not bring him the fame that he coveted so ardently. It was
                    otherwise with <hi rend="italic">Pelham,</hi> published in the following year.
                    In this he went with the native stream of fiction, and at once made himself felt
                    as a power. For two or three years before he wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelham,</hi> the books of the season had been novels of remarkable freshness
                    and brilliancy dealing with fashionable life—Plumer Ward’s now forgotten but
                    then much-talked-of <hi rend="italic">Tremaine,</hi> Theodore Hook’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sayings and Doings,</hi> Lister’s <hi rend="italic">Granby,</hi>
                    Disraeli’s <hi rend="italic">Vivian Grey.</hi> With· these brilliant celebrities
                    Bulwer, always a chivalrous emulator of whatever was famous, entered into direct
                    competition, and at once became at least their equal in popular favour. If we
                    compare this his first novel with any of his last productions, he strikes us as
                    having attained at a bound to the full measure of his powers. That he wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelham</hi> at twenty-two is a much more remarkable fact than that
                    he w r0te ballads at five. The plot is not perhaps so closely woven together as
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Parisians,</hi> but the variety of character introduced
                    from high life, low life, and middle life is quite as great. He had evidently
                    been fascinated by <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister,</hi> and the central
                    purpose of his story is to run the hero through an apprenticeship like
                    Wilhelm’s.. All kinds of human beings and all their works are interesting to
                    Pelham, the man of fashion, the bustling statesman,.</p>

                <p>the selfish epicure, the retiring scholar, the reckless rogue and vagabond, the
                    melodramatic Byronic man of mystery; and his adventures are so contrived as to
                    bring him in contact with many different types. The novel might have been called
                    <hi rend="italic">The Londoners;</hi> most of the criticisms of life and books
                    in <hi rend="italic">England and the English,</hi> published in 1833, may be
                    found in <hi rend="italic">Pelham,</hi> delivered through the mouths of various
                    characters. These characters are great talkers; no subject, from a rare dish or
                    a nicety of costume to a painting or a philosophical treatise, is strange to
                    them. And," curiously enough, the judgments of the youth of twenty-two are as
                    mature, as large, catholic, generous, widely sympathetic, as those of the sage
                    of sixty-six, and his knowledge of men and books hardly less extensive. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelham</hi> displayed—in the literal sense of the word—
                    extraordinary vivacity of intellect and range of interest. The author was yet to
                    prove that with his wonderful powers of reading, observing, and reflecting was
                    combined a faculty rarely found in union with such gifts, untiring rapidity of
                    production. In the preface to his juvenile “Ismael,” he speaks of a habit of his
                    never to leave anything unfinished, and during his long life he began and
                    finished many works in many different veins. <hi rend="italic">Pelham</hi> was
                    followed in quick succession by <hi rend="italic">The Disowned</hi> (1828), <hi
                    rend="italic">Devereux</hi> (1829), <hi rend="italic">Paul Clifford</hi> (1830),
                    <hi rend="italic">Eugene Aram</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Godolphin</hi> (1833).
                    Bulwer was deeply impressed with German theories of art; all these novels were
                    novels with a purpose, moral purpose, psychological purpose, historical purpose.
                    To embody the leading features of a period, of a phase of civilization, to trace
                    the influence of circumstance on character, to show how the criminal may be
                    reformed by the development of his better nature, and how men of fine nature may
                    be led stage by stage into crime, to explain the secrets of success and failure
                    in life—these, apart from the purely dramatic object of exhibiting inward
                    struggles between the first conceptions of desires and their fulfilment, and
                    between triumph and retribution, were his avowed aims as a novelist. He did not
                    leave his purposes to the interpreter; he was a critic as well as a creator, and
                    he criticized his own works frankly, and laboured to admit other critics to a
                    fair point of view. It was perhaps a tribute to the intrinsic interest of his
                    plots, characters, and descriptions that he was under the necessity of begging
                    attention to these higher aims. In <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrims of the
                    Rhine</hi> (1834), a work of graceful fantasy, in which some of his most acute
                    observations on human life are incorporated with the sayings and doings of elves
                    and fairies, an ambitious author is made to complain that “the subtle aims that
                    had inspired him were not perceived,” and that he was often approved for what he
                    condemned himself. The <hi rend="italic">Pilgrims,</hi> charmingly written in
                    many passages, was too German in its combination of serious thought and mundane
                    personages with fairies to be heartily welcomed by the English public. Bulwer
                    was more successful in another attempt to break new ground in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Last Days of Pompeii</hi> (1834) and <hi rend="italic">Rienzi</hi> (1835).
                    No historical romances dealing with times and scenes so remote were ever more
                    widely popular in England, and in aiming at popularity the author laboured hard
                    to secure historical accuracy. In <hi rend="italic">Athens, its Rise and
                    Fall</hi> (1836), we received in the form of historical essays what had probably
                    been acquired industriously as materials for romance. Two romances from Spanish
                    history, <hi rend="italic">Leila</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Calderon,</hi>
                    published in 1838, aimed at a less realistic treatment, and, with all their
                    purely literary excellences, were not so popular. In <hi rend="italic">Ernest
                    Maltravers</hi> (1837) and its sequel <hi rend="italic">Alice, or The
                    Mysteries</hi> (1838), the novelist returned to English ground and psychological
                    and social problems—“the affliction of the good, the triumph of the
                    unprincipled.” Critics to whom he failed to make the full purpose of these works
                    apparent in the execution complained of the low tone of their morality, a fair
                    complaint concerning most exhibitions of vice as a warning.</p>
                <p>To his other literary labours Bulwer superadded for some time the editorship of a
                    magazine. He succeeded Campbell as editor of <hi rend="italic">The New
                    Monthly</hi> in 1833. In 1838 he projected a magazine called <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Monthly Chronicle,</hi> and contributed to it as a serial story the
                    fantastic romance “ZiccL” The magazine expired before the story was completed,
                    and it was afterwards developed into <hi rend="italic">Zaηoηi,</hi> a romance of
                    which he was himself especially proud, and which suffered in public estimation
                    from being tried by realistic standards.</p>
                <p>During the most productive period of his literary life Bulwer was an eminent
                    member of parliament. He was returned for St Ives in 1831, and sat for Lincoln
                    from 1832 to 1841. He spoke in favour of the Reform Bill, and took the leading
                    part in obtaining the reduction, after vainly trying to procure the repeal, of
                    the newspaper stamp duties. His support of the Whigs in parliament, and by a
                    pamphlet on “the crisis” when they were dismissed from office in 1834, was
                    considered so valuable that Lord Melbourne offered him a place in the
                    administration. His intimacy with Radical leaders at this period exposed him to
                    an undeserved charge of tergiversation when later in life he was a member of a
                    Conservative Government. Charles Buller and Charles Villiers were among his
                    friends at Cambridge; he was an admiring student of Bentham; Mill’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Government</hi> was the text-book on which was founded
                    “Pelham’s” instruction by his uncle in the principles of politics; J. S. Mill
                    contributed the substance of the appendices to <hi rend="italic">England and the
                    English,</hi> on Bentham and Mill; Godwin suggested to him the subject and some
                    part of the plot of <hi rend="italic">Eugene Aram</hi>; he even succeeded in
                    winning the good opinion of Miss Martineau; but we have only to read his speech
                    in favour of the Reform Bill to see that it was the situation that had changed
                    and not the man when he assailed the repeal of the corn laws, and took office
                    under Lord Derby. Bulwer’s leading political aim, like his leading artistic
                    aims, was early formulated, and the formula governed all his political
                    reasoning: it was to “aristocratize the community,” “to elevate the masses in
                    character and feeling to the standard which conservatism works in aristocracy,”
                    a standard not of wealth or pedigree but of “superior education, courteous
                    manners, and high honour.” Hence it was “social reforms” from first to last that
                    enlisted his interest, and he sought the motive power for these reforms in the
                    public spirit of the classes enfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832.</p>
                <p>There was a slight break in Bulwer’s career as a novelist between 1838 and 1847.
                    During this interval he applied himself enthusiastically to play
                    writing,—Macready’s management of Covent Garden having inspired men of letters
                    with the hope of reconciling poetry with the stage. In 1836 he had produced <hi
                    rend="italic">The Duchess of</hi><hi rend="italic">La Vallière.</hi> It was a
                    failure. But in 1838 and the two following years he produced three plays which
                    have kept the stage ever since— <hi rend="italic">The Lady of Lyons,
                    Richelieu,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Money.</hi> In his plays as in his novels
                    definite theory preceded execution. The principles on which he wrote his plays
                    were laid down in his chapter on the drama in <hi rend="italic">England and the
                    English.</hi> For many of the details of stagecraft, all-important to success
                    under any principles, he is said to have been indebted to Macready. No
                    Englishman not himself an actor has written so many permanently successful plays
                    as Bulwer Lytton, and this is another instance of his extraordinary plasticity
                    of mind and practical insight. Thirty years afterwards, in 1869, he turned his
                    thoughts again to writing for the stage, recast an old failure with a <pb

                    was a success.</p>
                <p>From 1841 to 1852 Bulwer (he assumed his mother’s name of Lytton on succeeding to
                    her estates in 1843) had no seat in parliament. But the issue of novels and
                    romances was not so rapid as it had been in the full energy of his youth. Before
                    1849, when he opened a new vein with <hi rend="italic">The Caxtons,</hi> he
                    produced five works in his familiar vein :— <hi rend="italic">Night and
                    Morning</hi> (1841, in which the influence of Dickens is traceable), <hi
                    rend="italic">Zaηοni</hi> (1842), <hi rend="italic">The Last of the Barons</hi>
                    (1843, the most historically solid, and perhaps the most effective of his
                    romances), <hi rend="italic">Lucretia, or the Children of the Night</hi> (1847;
                    moral purpose—to exhibit the horrors caused by the worship of money; popular
                    effect—disgust at these horrors, and indignation at the author’s sentiment as
                    morbid), <hi rend="italic">Harold, The Last of the Saxon Kings</hi> (1848).</p>
                <p>The cause of the comparative infertility of this period in prose fiction probably
                    was that Lytton was now making a determined effort to win high rank as a poet.
                    He published a volume of poems in 1842, a volume of translations from Schiller
                    in 1844, <hi rend="italic">The New</hi><hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> a satire,
                    in 1845.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A feeble attack
                    in the last on Mr Tennyson’s poetry provoked a brusque but powerful reply from
                    the enraged laureate, aimed at his assailant’s person.</p></note> Then came the
                    work on which mainly Lytton rested his pretensions, <hi rend="italic">King
                    Arthur,</hi> a romantic epic. “I am unalterably convinced,” he said, “that on
                    this foundation I rest the least perishable monument of those thoughts and those
                    labours which’ have made the life of my life.” But <hi rend="italic">King
                    Arthur</hi> fell flat. The verse, the six-lined stave of elegiac quatrain and
                    couplet, lacks charm and variety; the incidents are monotonous, the personages
                    uninteresting, the plot unexciting, and the allegory obscure. <hi rend="italic"
                    >St Stephen’s,</hi> a gallery of parliamentary portraits from the time of Queen
                    Anne, was a kind of metrical composition that lay more within his powers. In
                    this the satire is keen-edged, the admiration just and generous. It was
                    published in 1860. The <hi rend="italic">Lost Tales of Miletus</hi> (1866) and a
                    translation of Horace’s <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> (1869) were Lytton’s last
                    essays in verse.</p>
                <p>In the skill with which he sustained a new style in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Caxtons</hi> (1848) Lytton gave a more convincing proof of his versatility. This
                    imitation of Sterne (by no means a servile imitation, rather an adaptation of
                    Sterne’s style and characters to the circumstances of the 19th century) appeared
                    anonymously in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine,</hi> and made a
                    reputation before the authorship was suspected. <hi rend="italic">My Novel</hi>
                    (1853) and <hi rend="italic">What will He Do with Itl</hi> (1858) continued in
                    the same strain. The sub-title of <hi rend="italic">My Novel,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> u</hi> Varieties of English life,” shows still
                    operative the same purpose that we find in <hi rend="italic">Pelham,</hi> but
                    the criticism of the “Varieties” is more polemical in spirit. There is more than
                    a shade of defiance in his praise of the virtues of a territorial aristocracy,
                    and a strong spice of hostility to the vulgarities of the manufacturers who
                    threatened to push them from their stools. There is a blindness to defects in
                    the one case and to merits in the other quite foreign to the broad sympathies of
                    the dandy Pelham; Caxton paints the ideal best of the one class and the ideal
                    worst of the other. In these, as in all Lytton’s novels, the characters are
                    placed on the stage and described; they are not left to reveal themselves
                    gradually in action.</p>
                <p>Lytton returned to parliament in 1852 as member for Hertfordshire, and sat on the
                    Conservative side. Early in life he had decided in his mind against the
                    reduction of the corn duties, and, unchanged in 1851, he addressed a “Letter to
                    John Bull,” enlarging on the dangers of their repeal. Incapable of failure in
                    any intellectual exercise that he set his mind to, he was an effective speaker;
                    but the effort was against nature: he could speak only under extreme excitement
                    or after laborious preparation, and he never took a high place among
                    parliamentary orators. He was colonial secretary in Lord Derby’s Government from
                    1858 to 1859, and threw himself industriously into the duties of his office. He
                    was raised to the peerage as Baron Lytton in 1866.</p>
                <p>That he had not forgotten his power of moving the sense of melodramatic and
                    romantic mystery when he adopted the more subdued style of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Caxtons,</hi> Lytton proved by <hi rend="italic">A Strange Story,</hi>
                    contributed to <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> in 1862. A serial story
                    of the kind made a new call on his resources, but he was equal to it, and fairly
                    rivalled the school of Dickens in the art of sustaining thrilling interest to
                    the close.</p>
                <p>When he died, in January 1873, after a short painful illness, two works of high
                    repute, <hi rend="italic">The Coming Race</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Parisians,</hi> were not acknowledged, and were only vaguely suspected to be
                    his. They had freshness enough to be the work of youth, and power enough to
                    shame no veteran. These two books, the fable and the novel, are classed by
                    Lytton’s son and successor in the the title with the romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kenelm Chillingly,</hi> left completed at his death, as forming a
                    trilogy, animated by a common purpose, to exhibit the influence of “modern
                    ideas” upon character and conduct. The moulding force whose operation is traced
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Parisians</hi> is the society of imperial and
                    democratic France, in <hi rend="italic">Chillingly</hi> the society of England
                    in relation to its representative institûtions. The leading purpose is kept well
                    in view throughout both works, and the tendencies to corruption analysed and
                    presented with admirable skill; but the theorist has omitted from his problem
                    certain important regenerating and safeguarding factors in the large world
                    outside the pale of society. Problems and theories apart, these last works show
                    no falling off' of power; he is as vivid as ever in description, as fertile as
                    ever in the invention of humorous and melodramatic situation. If he had been
                    content to abandon his purpose in <hi rend="italic">Chillingly,</hi> and end
                    with the first volume by some such commonplace contrivance as giving “motive
                    power” to his hero in the love of Cecilia Travers, it would have been the most
                    perfect of his works in unity of humorous sentiment. The veteran author died in
                    harness,—two novels all but completed; another, an historical romance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pausanias</hi><hi rend="italic">the Spartan,</hi> outlined and
                    partly written.</p>
                <p>The fact that in the fiftieth year of his authorship, after publishing at least
                    fifty separate works, most of them popular, Lord Lytton had still vigour and
                    freshness enough to make a new anonymous reputation with <hi rend="italic">The
                    Coming Race</hi> would seem to indicate that critics had not fairly gauged his
                    versatility, and also that an erroneous fixed idea had been formed of his style.
                    The explanation probably is that even after the publication of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Caxtons</hi> he was thought of in connexion with that school of
                    melodramatic romance of which he was indisputably the leader, if not the
                    founder, and that heavily loaded rhetorical style which was made ridiculous by
                    his imitators. “Every great genius,” one of his characters is made to say, “must
                    deem himself alone in bis conceptions. It is not enough for him that these
                    conceptions should be approved as good, unless they are admitted as inventive.”
                    Invention and originality are matters of degree, and, though no one can deny
                    that Lytton possessed great inventive powers, he did not put that individual
                    stamp on his work without which no writer is entitled to a place in the foremost
                    rank. He was not self-centred ençugh; he was too generally emulous to win the
                    highest individual distinction. But his freshness of thought, brilliancy of
                    invention, breadth and variety of portraiture, gave him a just title to his
                    popularity, and, with all allowance for superficial affectations, his generous
                    nobility of sentiment made his influence as wholesome as it was widespread. (w.
