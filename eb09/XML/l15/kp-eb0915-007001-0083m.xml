                    to the resonance board or membrane having been originally placed upon a gourd,
                    was strung with silk and played with a plectrum of shell or quill. It was
                    adopted by the Arabs from Persia, the typical instrument being the two-stringed
                    “tanbur,” and ultimately found its way to the West at the time of the crusades.
                    The modern Egyptian “*ûd” is the direct descendant of the Arabic lute, and,
                    according to Lane, is strung with seven pairs of catgut strings played by a
                    plectrum. A specimen at South Kensington, given by the Khedive, has four pairs
                    only, which appears to have been the old stringing of the instrument. When frets
                    are employed they are of catgut disposed according to the Arabic scale of
                    seventeen intervals in the octave, consisting of twelve limmas, an interval
                    rather less than our equal semitone, and five commas, which are very small but
                    quite recognizable differences of pitch.</p>
                <p>The lute family is separated from the guitars, also of Eastern origin, by the
                    formation of the sound body, which is in all lutes pear-shaped, without the
                    sides or ribs necessary to the structure of the flat-backed guitar and cither.
                    Observing this distinction, we include with the lute the little Neapolitan
                    mandoline of 2 feet long, and the large doublenecked Roman chitarrone, which not
                    unfrequently attains to a length of 6 feet. Mandolines are partly strung with
                    wire, and are played with a plectrum, indispensable for metal or short strings.
                    Perhaps the earliest lutes were so played, but the large lutes and theorbos
                    strung with catgut have been invariably touched by the fingers only, the length
                    permitting this more sympathetic means of producing the tone.</p>
                <p>The Neapolitan is the best known mandoline; it was indicated by Mozart in the
                    score of <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni,</hi> to accompany the famous serenade.

                <p>The mandola or mandore is larger than either, with eight pairs of strings. This
                    name has been derived from the Italian word, similarly spelled but differently
                    accented, signifying almond, which the mandola is supposed to resemble in shape,

                    the Arabs changed to “tanbur.” Praetorius <hi rend="italic">{Orgaηographia,</hi>
                    Wolfenbüttel, 1619, a scarce work, of which the only copy in Great Britain is in
                    the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh), writing when the lute was in universal
                    favour, mentions seven varieties distinguished by size and tuning. The smallest
                    would be larger than a mandoline, and the melody string, the “chanterelle,”
                    often a single string, lower in pitch. Praetorius calls this an octave lute,
                    with the chanterelle C or D. The two discant lutes have respectively B and A,
                    the alto G, the tenor E, the bass D, and the great octave bass G, an octave
                    below the alto lute which may be taken as the model lute cultivated by the
                    amateurs of the time. The bass lutes were most likely theorbos, that is,
                    double-necked lutes, as described below. The accordance of an alto lute was i-):

                    C of the violoncello, were not stopped with the fingers. The diapasons were
                    tuned as the key of the piece of music required. The illustration represents an
                    Italian instrument made by one of the most celebrated lute makers, Venere of
                    Padua, in 1600; it is 3 feet 6 inches high, and has six pairs of unisons and
                    eight single diapasons. The fingerboard, divided into approximately equal half
                    tones by the frets, as a rule eight in number, was often further divided on the
                    higher notes, for ten, eleven, or, as in the woodcut, even twelve, semitones.
                    The head, bearing the tuning pegs, was placed at an obtuse or a right angle to
                    the neck, to increase the bearing of the strings upon the nut, and be convenient
                    for sudden requirements of tuning during performance, the trouble of keeping a
                    lute in tune being proverbial.</p>
                <p>The lute was in general use during the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th it
                    declined; still the great J. S. Bach wrote a “partita” for it, which remains in
                    manuscript. The latest date we have met with of an engraved publication for the
                    lute is 1760.</p>
                <p>The large double-necked lute, with two sets of tuning pegs, the lower for the
                    finger-board, the higher for the diapason strings, was known as the theorbo;
                    also, and especially in England, as the archlute; and, in a special form, the
                    neck being then very long, as the chitarrone. Theorbo and chitarrone appear
                    together at the close of the 16th century, and their introduction was
                    synchronous with the rise of accompanied monody in music, that is, of the
                    oratorio and the opera. Peri, Caccini, and Monteverde used theorbos to accompany
                    their newly-devised recitative, the invention of which in Florence, from the
                    impulse of the Renaissance, is well known. The height of a theorbo varied from 3
                    feet 6 inches to 5 feet, the Paduan being always the largest, excepting the
                    Roman 6-feet long chitarrone. These large lutes had very deep notes, and
                    doubtless great liberties were allowed in tuning, but the strings on the
                    finger-board followed the lute accordance already given, or another quoted by
                    Baron <hi rend="italic">(Untersuchung</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Instruments</hi><hi rend="italic">der Lauten,</hi> Nuremberg, 1727) as the old
                    theorbo or “violway” (see Mace, <hi rend="italic">Musick's Monument,</hi>
                    London, 1676) :—</p>
                <p>We find again both these accordances varied and transposed a tone higher, perhaps
                    with thinner strings, or to accommodate local differences of pitch; Praetorius
                    recommends the chanterelles of theorbos being tuned an octave lower on account
                    of the great strain. By such a change, another authority, the Englishman Thomas
                    Mace, says, the life and spruceness of airy lessons were quite lost. The theorbo
                    or archlute had at last to give way to the violoncello and double bass, which
                    are still used to accompany the “recitativo secco” in oratorios and operas.
                    Handel wrote a part for a theorbo in <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> (1720); after
                    that date it appears no more in orchestral scores, but remained in private use
                    until nearly the end of the century.</p>
                <p>We cannot refrain from admiring the beauty of decoration of ivory, mother of
                    pearl, and tortoiseshell, the characteristic patterning of the “knots” or
                    “roses” in the soundboards, all of which was so well allied with the extremely
                    artistic forms of the different lutes, rendering them, now their musical use is
                    past, objects of research for collections and museums. The present direction of
                    musical taste and composition is adverse to the cultivation of such tenderly
                    sensitive timbre as the lute possessed. The lute and the organ share the
                    distinction of being the first instruments for which the oldest instrumental
                    compositions we possess were written. It was not for the lute, however, in our
                    present notation, but in tablature, “lyrawise,” a system by which as many lines
                    were drawn horizontally as there were pairs of strings on the finger-board, the
                    frets being distinguished by the letters of the alphabet, repeated from A for
                    each line. This was the English manner; the Italian was by numbers instead of
                    letters. The signs of time were placed over the stave, and were not repeated
                    unless the mensural values changed.</p>
