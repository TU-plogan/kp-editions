                    Trojans and the mainstay of their city. Like Paris and other Trojans, he had an
                    Oriental name, Darius, as well as a Greek one, an interesting fact on which many

                    favourable colours as a good son, a loving husband and father, and a trusty
                    friend,—religious without superstition, tenderhearted yet courageous. The one
                    blemish apparent in some parts of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (see Geddes’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Homeric Problem)</hi> is a tendency to presumptuous and
                    boastful confidence. He is an especial favourite of Apollo; and later poets even
                    describe him as son of that god. When Achilles, enraged with Agamemnon, deserted
                    the Greeks, Hector drove them back to their ships, which he almost succeeded in
                    burning. Patroclus, the friend of Achilles, who came to the help of the Greeks,
                    was slain by Hector with the help of Apollo. Then Achilles, to revenge his
                    friend’s death, returned to the war, slew Hector, dragged his body behind his
                    chariot to the camp, and afterwards dragged it round the tomb of Patroclus.
                    Priam, guarded by Hermes, went to Achilles and prevailed on him to give back the
                    dead body, which was buried with great honour (ZZ., xxiv.). Hector was
                    worshipped in the Troad by the Boeotian tribe Gephyraei; and he is, like other
                    heroes, probably an ancient god. It would require an inquiry into the whole
                    Trojan legend to determine the conception involved: it is impossible to do more
                    in this place than refer to Ruckert’s essay in this direction.</p>
                <p>Scenes from the life of Hector are favourite subjects in vase paintings. A very
                    ancient pinax from Camirus represents his fight with Menelaus over the dead
                    Euphorbus; and on an amphora, also from Camirus, of not later date than 450 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, he is represented starting for battle, standing
                    beside the quadriga into which his charioteer Cebriones has already mounted.
                    Both vases are now in the British Museum. Though many of the subjects in which
                    he was supposed to appear have now been assigned to other heroes,— for example,
                    the frequently occurring Γarting of Hector and Andromache is by a more searching
                    criticism generally transformed into a scene from the life of Amphiaraus,—yet
                    many undoubted examples remain. We find such scenes as the parting cup given by
                    Hecuba to her son as he departs to the battle, his battle with Achilles in
                    presence of Apollo and Athene, or the dragging of his corpse round the tomb of
                    Patroclus.</p>
