                <p><label type="entry">HEATH</label>, the English form of a name given in most
                    Teutonic dialects to the common ling or heather, but now applied to all species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Erica,</hi> an extensive genus of monopetalous plants,
                    belonging to the order <hi rend="italic">Ericaceoe.</hi> The heaths are
                    evergreen shrubs, with small narrow leaves, in whorls usually set rather thickly
                    on the shoots; the persistent flowers have 4 sepals, and a 4-cleft campanulate
                    or tubular corolla, in many species more or less ventricose or inflated; the dry
                    capsule is 4-celled, and opens, in the true <hi rend="italic">Ericae,</hi> in 4
                    segments, to the middle of which the partitions adhere, though in the ling the
                    valves separate at the dissepiments. The plants are mostly of low growth, but
                    several African kinds reach the size of large bushes, and a Spanish variety, <hi
                    rend="italic">E. arborea,</hi> occasionally attains almost the aspect and
                    dimensions of a tree.</p>
                <p>One of the best known and most interesting of the family is the common heath,
                    heather, or ling, <hi rend="italic">Calluna vulgaris,</hi> placed by most
                    botanists in a separate genus on account of the peculiar dehiscence of the
                    fruit, and from the coloured calyx, which extends beyond the corolla, having a
                    whorl of sepal-like bracts beneath. This shrub derives some economic importance
                    from its forming the chief vegetation on many of those extensive wastes that
                    occupy so large a portion of the more sterile lands of northern and western
                    Europe, the usually desolate appearance of which is enlivened in the latter part
                    of summer by its abundant pink blossoms. When growing erect to the height of a
                    yard or more, as it often does in sheltered places, its purple stems,
                    close-leaved green shoots, and feathery spikes of bell-shaped flowers render it
                    one of the handsomest of the heaths; but on the bleaker elevations and more arid
                    slopes it frequently rises only a few inches above the ground. In all moorland
                    countries the ling is applied to many rural purposes; the larger stems are made
                    into brooms, the shorter tied up into bundles that serve as brushes, while the
                    long trailing shoots are woven into baskets. Pared up with the peat about its
                    roots it forms a good fuel, often the only one obtainable on the drier moors.
                    The shielings of the Scotch Highlanders were formerly constructed of heath
                    stems, cemented together with peat mud, worked into a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0623-0590"/> kind of mortar with dry grass or straw; hovels
                    and sheds for temporary purposes are still sometimes built in a similar way, and
                    roofed in with ling. Laid on the ground, with the flowers above, it forms a soft
                    springy bed, the luxurious couch of the ancient Gael, still gladly resorted to
                    at times by the hill shepherd or hardy deer-stalker. The young shoots were in
                    former days employed as a substitute for hops in brewing, while their
                    astringency rendered them valuable as a tanning material in Ireland and the
                    Western Isles. They are said also to have been used by the Highlanders for
                    dyeing woollen yarn yellow, and other colours are asserted to have been obtained
                    from them, but some writers appear to confuse the dyer’s-weed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genista tinctoria,</hi> with the heather. The young juicy shoots and the seeds,
                    which remain long in the capsules, furnish the red grouse of Scotland with the
                    larger portion of its sustenance; the ripe seeds are eaten by many birds. The
                    tops of the ling afford a considerable part of the winter fodder of the hill
                    flocks, and are popularly supposed to communicate the fine flavour to Welsh and
                    Highlaud mutton, but sheep seldom crop heather while the mountain grasses and
                    rushes are sweet and accessible. In recent times ling has been suggested as a
                    material for paper, but the stems are hardly sufficiently fibrous for that
                    purpose. The purple or fineleaved heath, <hi rend="italic">E.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cinerea,</hi> one of the most beautiful of the genus, abounds on
                    the lower moors and commons of Great Britain and western Europe, in such
                    situations being sometimes more prevalent than the ling. The flowers of both
                    these species yield much honey, furnishing a plentiful supply to the bees in
                    moorland districts; from this heath honey the Picts probably brewed the mead
                    said by Boetius to have been made from the flowers themselves.</p>
                <p>It was until recently supposed that no species of heath existed in America; but
                    of late years isolated plants of ling have been found in various parts of New
                    England, Nova Scotia, and Cape Breton, while it has been stated to occur in some
                    abundance in several places in Newfoundland; probably in distant ages it may
                    have had a wider range on the American continent. The whole group, as observed
                    by Bentham, is “eminently Atlantic” in its present distribution,—of nearly 500
                    known species by far the greater part being indigenous to the western districts
                    of South Africa, and nearly all the remainder limited to Europe and its adjacent
                    islands.</p>
                <p>The Cape heaths have long been favourite objects of horticulture. In the warmer
                    parts of Britain several will bear exposure to the cold of ordinary winters in a
                    sheltered border, but most need the protection of the conservatory. They are
                    sometimes raised from seed, but are chiefly multiplied by cuttings “struck” in
                    sand, and afterwards transferred to pots filled with a mixture of black peat and
                    sand; the peat should be dry and free from sourness. Much attention is requisite
                    in watering heaths, as they seldom recover if once allowed to droop, while they
                    will not bear much water about their roots: the heath-house should be light and
                    well ventilated, the plants requiring sun, and soon perishing in a close or
                    permanently damp atmosphere; in England little or no heat is needed in ordinary
                    seasons. The European heaths succeed well in English gardens, only requiring a
                    peaty soil and sunny situation to thrive as well as in their native localities:
                    <hi rend="italic">E. carnea, mediterranea, ciliaris, vagans,</hi> and the pretty
                    cross-leaved heath of boggy moors, <hi rend="italic">E. tetralix,</hi> are among
                    those most worthy of cultivation. The beautiful large-flowered St D⅛beoc <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s heath, belonging to the closely allied genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Meηziesia,</hi> is likewise often seen in gardens. (c. <hi
