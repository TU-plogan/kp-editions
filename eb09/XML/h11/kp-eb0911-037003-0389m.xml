                <p>The book of Haggai contains four short prophecies delivered between the first day
                    of the sixth month and the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month—that is, between
                    September and December—of the second year of Darius the king. The king in
                    question must be Darius Hystaspis, who came to the throne 521 <hi

                    but this is impossible, since in chap. ii. 3 Haggai speaks of old men as still

                    Jerusalem, and in chronological order should follow chaps, v., vi. The

                    suggests the probability that he was himself one of those whose memories reached
                    across the seventy years of the captivity, and that his prophetic work began in
                    extreme old age. This supposition agrees well with the shortness of the period
                    covered by his book, and with the fact that Zechariah, who began to prophecy in
                    the same autumn and was associated withHaggai’s labours (Ezra v. 1), afterwards
                    appears as the leading prophet in Jerusalem (Zech. vii. 1-4). We know nothing
                    further of the personal history of Haggai from the Bible. Later traditions may

                <p>In his first prophecy (i. 1-11) Haggai addresses Zerubbabel and Joshua, rebuking
                    the people for leaving the temple unbuilt while they are busy in providing
                    panelled houses for themselves. The prevalent famine and distress are due to
                    God’s indignation at such remissness. Let them build the house, and God will
                    take pleasure in it and acknowledge the honour paid to Him. The rebuke took
                    effect, and the people began to work at the temple, strengthened by the
                    prophet’s assurance that the Lord was with them (i. 12-15). In a second prophecy
                    (ii. 1-9) delivered in the following month, Haggai forbids the people to be
                    disheartened by the apparent meanness of the new temple. The silver and gold are
                    the Lord’s. He will soon shake all nations and bring their choicest gifts to
                    adorn His house. Its glory shall be greater than that of the former temple, and
                    in this place He will give peace. A third prophecy (ii. 10-19) contains a
                    promise, enforced by a figure drawn from the priestly ritual, that God will
                    remove famine and bless the land from the day of the foundation of the temple
                    onwards. Finally, in ii. 20-23, Zerubbabel is assured of God’s special love and
                    protection in the impending catastrophe of kingdoms and nations to which the
                    prophet had formerly pointed as preceding the glorification of God’s house on
                    Zion. In thus looking forward to a shaking of all nations Haggai agrees with
                    earlier prophecies, especially Isa. xxiv.-xxvii., while his picture of the glory
                    and peace of the new Zion and its temple is drawn from the great anonymous
                    prophet who penned Isa. lx. and lxvi. The characteristic features of the book
                    are the importance assigned to the personality of Zerubbabel and the almost
                    sacramental significance attached to the temple. The hopes fixed on Zerubbabel,
                    the chosen of the Lord, dear to Him as His signet ring <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Jer. xxii, 24), are a last echo in Old Testament prophecy of the
                    theocratic importance of the house of David. In the book of Zechariah Zerubbabel
                    has already fallen into the background and the high priest is the leading figure
                    of the Judean community.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>After the foundation of the temple Zerubbabel disappears from history and
                    lives only in legend, which continued to busy itself with his story, as we see
                    from the apocryphal book of Esdras (c∕. Derenbourg, <hi rend="italic">Hist, de
                    la Palestine,</hi> chap. i,).</p></note> The stem of David is superseded by the
                    house of Zadok, the kingship has yielded to the priesthood, and the extinction
                    of national hopes gives new importance to that strict organization of the
                    hierarchy for which Ezekiel had prepared the way by his sentence of
                    disfranchisement against the non-Zadokite priests.</p>
                <p>If his attitude to Zerubbabel forms a link of connexion between Haggai and the
                    prophets before the captivity, his post-exile standpoint is characteristically
                    marked in the central importance which he attaches to the temple. The prophets
                    who spoke under the shadow of the first temple held quite another language.<note

                    vii.</p></note> To Isaiah and Jeremiah the religion of Israel and the holiness
                    of Jerusalem have little to do with the edifice of the temple. The city is holy
                    because it is the seat of Jehovah’s sovereignty on earth, exerted in His
                    dealings with and for the state of Judah and the kingdom of David. The proof
                    that Jehovah’s throne is in Jerusalem lies in the history of what He has done
                    for His people, or, if a visible pledge is needed, it must be sought not in the
                    temple but, in accordance with antique ideas, in the ark ( Jer. iii. 16) or in
                    the altar with its sacred flame (Isa. xxix. 1; xxxi. 9).<note anchored="true"

                    desolation of Jerusalem, the extinction of the political life with which all
                    religion had till then been inseparably bound up gave a new meaning to the old
                    prophetic doctrine that the service of Jehovah is the true vocation of Israel—a
                    new significance to the ruined temple and all its ordinances of worship. “The
                    holy and beautiful house where our fathers praised Thee” (Isa. lxiv. 11) was a
                    chief thought of the sorrowing exiles (Lamentations, <hi rend="italic"

                    appears eminently as vengeance for His temple (Jer. 1. 28). The great prophet of

                    longer as an earthly state but as a world-priesthood, a mediatorial people
                    gathered round the sanctuary and holding forth amidst the nations the true
                    pattern of the knowledge and service of the living God till all the ends of the
                    earth shall look to Him and be saved. Under the limitations of the old
                    dispensation neither seer nor people could separate the realization of this
                    great conception from the restoration of the visible centre of Israel’s worship
                    in the temple at Jerusalem. The prophet had pointed to Cyrus by name as the
                    rebuilder of Jerusalem and the founder of the temple (Isa. xliv. 28; lii. 11);
                    and the captives whose hearts were touched by his burning words, and who availed
                    themselves of the decree of that monarch (536 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) to
                    repeople the desolate places of Judah, looked for the speedy advent of the time
                    when the glory of Jehovah displayed in His house on Zion should draw to
                    Jerusalem the willing homage of all nations (Isa. lvL; lx. 7; lxvi. 1-6). The
                    actual experiences of the returning exiles fell as far short of these bright
                    hopes as the Israel of Zerubbabel and Joshua fell short of the ideal regenerate
                    nation to which the prophet had promised the heritage of Jehovah’s glory.
                    Scarcely was a settlement effected when difficulties and misfortunes began to
                    thicken about the little colony. The anger of the Lord seemed still to rest on
                    Jerusalem and the cities of Judah (Zech. i. 12), whose inhabitants soon ceased
                    to find favour from the Persian court, and had to struggle with penury and
                    famine as well as with the hostility of their neighbours. Amidst such
                    discouragements the first zeal soon grew cool, and the work of rebuilding the
                    sanctuary lay practically untouched till Haggai arose sixteen years later.</p>
                <p>What had actually been effected during these years for the restoration of the
                    temple is a question of some difficulty. It seems safest to start from the
                    explicit contemporary evidence of Hag. ii. 18 (c∕. ii. 15 and Zech. viii. 9)
                    which gives the ninth month of the second year of Darius—after Haggai had begun
                    to preach—as the date when the temple was founded by Zerubbabel and Joshua. On
                    the other hand, the book of Ezra, in its present shape as edited and partly
                    composed by the much later author who wrote Chronicles, conveys the impression
                    that large gifts for the temple were offered by the leading Jews on their first
                    return (Ezra ii. 68, 69), that the foundation of the house was laid by Joshua
                    and Zerubbabel in the second year of the return (ch. iii. ), and that the work
                    was thereafter interrupted by the opposition of the Jews’ enemies till the reign
                    of Darius. It appears probable, however, that the Chronicler has somewhat
                    dislocated the order of events, especially by taking the official correspondence
                    in ch. iv. to refer to the temple, whereas it really refers to the building of
                    the city walls. This oversight might readily involve the antedating of the
                    foundation ceremony described in iii. 8-13, which seems to be identical with
                    that which Haggai speaks of, since the actors are the same, and the chief
                    feature in the description which does not belong to the usual liturgical scenery
                    of the Chronicler recalls Hag. ii. 3, Zech. iv. 7-10. Again, the verses Ezra ii.
                    68, 69 seem really to refer to a collection made in the time of Nehemiah, having
                    been transcribed from a history of that period (part of which is preserved in
                    the canonical book of Nehemiah) along with the ancient list which occupies the
                    first part of Ezra ii. But they are not part of the list, as appears from a
                    comparison of Ezra ii. 62-iii. 1 with Neh. vii. 64-viii. 1. If this criticism is
                    just, the Tirshatha of Ezra ii. is Nehemiah, not Zerubbabel, and the usual
                    arguments for identifying the latter with Sheshbazzar—whom Cyrus, according to
                    an Aramaic source preserved in Ezra v., appointed governor and charged with the
                    restoration of the temple— fall to the ground.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ezra ii. 2 seems to show that at the return
                    Zerubbabel was merely one of the Jewish elders. The opposite impression is due
                    solely to the punctuation.</p></note> Sheshbazzar was presumably a Persian
                    official; and the first hope of the Jewish colony, in accordance with Isa, xliv.
                    28, lx. 10, was, no doubt, that the Persians would effect the restoration
                    without effort of theirs. This hope was frustrated, Sheshbazzar presumably
                    having taken up his task with the usual conscientiousness of an Oriental
                    governor, that is, having done nothing, though the work was nominally in hand
                    all along (Ezra v. 16). The advancement of Zerubbabel to the governorship may
                    have given Haggai his opportunity.</p>
                <p>In the confused state of the chronology of the book of Ezra it may also be a
                    question when the Samaritans sought to join the Jews and were repulsed. That the
                    relation of Ezra iv. 1—4 is historical seems to be established against
                    objections which have been taken to it by the reference to Esarhaddon, which A.
                    v. Gutschmidt has vindicated by an ingenious historical combination with the aid
                    of the Assyrian monuments <hi rend="italic">(Neue Beiträge,</hi> p. 145).
                    Compare also Jer. xli. 5 for the antiquity of the Samaritan claim to worship
                    with the Jews. But from Ezra v., and especially from Zech, iii., it may be
                    questioned whether the opposition of the Samaritans arose before the time of
                    Haggai and Zechariah. See on the whole question Schrader, ‘ ‘ Die Dauer des
                    zweiten Tempelbaues,” in the <hi rend="italic">Studien und Kritiken,</hi>
                    1867.</p>
                <p>Such indifference to the undertaking which held a chief place in the first ardour
                    of the returning exiles had a deeper significance than at once occurs to our
                    modern habits of thought. The restoration of the temple and its worship was
                    connected in every mind with the doctrine that the service of Jehovah was the
                    true national vocation of Israel, and the apathy that Haggai rebukes showed the
                    people to have forgotten in the struggle for material welfare their ideal
                    calling as the nation of the true God. His reproofs touched the conscience of
                    the Jews, and the book of Zechariah enables us in some measure to follow the
                    course of a religious revival which, starting with the restoration of the
                    temple, did not confine itself to matters of ceremony and ritual worship. On the
                    other hand, Haggai’s treatment of his theme, practical and effective as it was
                    for the purpose in hand, moves on a far lower level than the aspirations of the
                    great evangelical prophet who inspired the people at their first return. To the
                    latter the material temple is no more than a detail in the picture of a work of
                    restoration eminently ideal and spiritual, and he expressly warns his hearers
                    against attaching intrinsic importance to it (Isa. lxvi. 1). To Haggai the
                    temple appears so essential that he teaches that while it lay waste tire people
                    and all their works and offerings were unclean (Hag. ii. 14). In this he betrays
                    his affinity with Ezekiel, who taught that it is by the possession of the
                    sanctuary that Israel is sanctified (Ezek. xxxvii. 28). In truth the new
                    movement of religious thought and feeling which started from the fall of the
                    Hebrew state took two distinct lines, of which Ezekiel and the anonymous prophet
                    of Isa. xl.-lxvi. are the respective representatives. While the latter developed
                    his great picture of Israel the mediatorial nation, the systematic and priestly
                    mind of Ezekiel had shaped a more material conception of the religious vocation
                    of Israel in that picture of the new theocracy where the temple and its ritual
                    occupy the largest place, with a sanctity which is set in express contrast to
                    the older conception of the holiness of the city of Jerusalem <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Ezek. xliii. 7 <hi rend="italic">seq.</hi> with Jer. xxxi. 40, Isa.
                    iv. 5), and with a supreme significance for the religious life of the people
                    which is expressed in the figure of the living waters issuing from under the
                    threshold of the house (Ezek. xlvii.). It was the conception of Ezekiel which
                    permanently influenced the citizens of the new Jerusalem, and took final shape
                    in the institutions of Ezra. To this consummation, with its necessary
                    accompaniment in the extinction of prophecy, the book of Haggai already
                    points.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> (Miinster, 1868) is the work of a Roman
                    Catholic. Haggai has generally been treated in works on all the prophets, as by
                    Ewald (2d ed., 1868; Eng. trans., vol. iii., 1878); or along with the other
                    minor prophets, as by Hitzig (3d ed., Leipsic, 1863), Keil (1866; Eng. trans.,
                    Edinburgh, 1868), and Pusey (1875); or with the other post-exile prophets as by
                    Koehler, Pressel (Gotha, 1870), Dods (1879), and others. The older literature
                    will be found in books of introduction or in Rosenmuller's still useful <hi
