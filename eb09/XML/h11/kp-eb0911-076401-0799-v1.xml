                    more than sixty different species are known in various parts of the globe. The
                    sprat, pilchard or sardine, and shad are species of the same genus. Of all
                    sea-fishes <hi rend="italic">Clupeoe</hi> are the most abundant; for although
                    other genera may comprise a greater variety of species, they are far surpassed
                    by <hi rend="italic">Clupea</hi> with regard to the number of individuals. The
                    majority of the species of <hi rend="italic">Clupea</hi> are of greater or less
                    utility to man; it is only a few tropical species that acquire, probably from
                    their food, highly poisonous properties, so as to be dangerous to persons eating
                    them. But no other species equals the Common Herring in importance as an article
                    of food or commerce. It inhabits in incredible numbers the German Ocean, the
                    northern parts of the Atlantic, and the seas north of Asia. The herring
                    inhabiting the corresponding latitudes of the North Pacific is another species,
                    but most closely allied to that of the eastern hemisphere. Formerly it was the
                    general belief that the herring inhabits the open ocean close to the Arctic
                    Circle, and that it migrates at certain seasons towards the northern coasts of
                    Europe and America. This view has been proved to be erroneous, and we know now
                    that this fish lives throughout the year in the vicinity of our shores, but at a
                    greater depth, and at a greater distance from the coast, than at the time when
                    it approaches land for the purpose of spawning.</p>
                <p>Herrings are readily recognized and distinguished from the other species of <hi
                        rend="italic">Clupea</hi> by having an ovate patch of very small teeth on
                    the vomer (that is, the centre of the palate). In the dorsal fin they have from
                    17 to 20 rays, and in the anal fin from 16 to 18; there are from 53 to 59 scales
                    in the lateral line, and invariably 56 vertebrae in the vertebral column. They
                    have a smooth gill-cover, without those radiating ridges of bone which are so
                    conspicuous in the pilchard and other <hi rend="italic">Clupeoe.</hi> The sprat
                    cannot be confounded with the herring, as it has no teeth on the vomer, and only
                    47 or 48 scales in the lateral line.</p>
                <p>Herrings grow very rapidly; according to H. A. Meyer’s observations, they attain
                    a length of from 17 to 18 mm. during the first month after hatching, 34 to 36
                    mm. during the second, 45 to 50 mm. during the third, 55 to 61 mm. during the
                    fourth, and 65 to 72 mm. during the fifth. The size which they finally attain
                    and their general condition depend chiefly on the abundance of food (which
                    consists of crustaceans and other small marine animals), on the temperature of
                    the water, on the season at which they have been hatched, &amp;c. Their usual
                    size is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0800-0765"/> about 12 inches, but in some particularly
                    suitable localities they grow to a length of 15 inches, and instances of
                    specimens measuring 17 inches are on record. In the Baltic, where the water is
                    gradually losing its saline constituents, thus becoming less adapted for the
                    development of marine species, the herring continues to exist in large numbers,
                    but as a dwarfed form, not growing either to the size or to the condition of the
                    North-Sea herring. The herring of the American side of the Atlantic is
                    specifically identical with that of Europe. A second species <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">leachu)</hi> has been supposed to exist on
                    the British coast; but it comprises only individuals of a smaller size, the
                    produce of an early or late spawn. Also the so-called “white-bait” is not a
                    distinct species, but consists chiefly of the fry or the young of herrings, and.
                    is obtained “in perfection” at localities where these small fishes find an
                    abundance of food, as in the estuary of the Thames. The important subject of
                    herring-fishing has already been treated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Fisheries</hi> (see vol. ix. pp. 251, 257, &lt;fcc.).</p>
                <p>Several excellent accounts of the herring have been published, as by Valenciennes
                    in the 20th vol. of the <hi rend="italic">Histoire naturelle des</hi><hi
