                <p>THE family name of Nathaniel Hawthorne was spelled Hathorne until it was changed
                    by him in early manhood to its present form. The head of the American branch of
                    the family, William Hathorne of Wilton, Wiltshire, England, emigrated with
                    Winthrop and his company, and arrived at Salem Bay, Mass., June 12, 1630. He had
                    grants of land at Dorchester, where he resided for upwards of six years, when he
                    was persuaded to remove to Salem by the tender of further grants of land there,
                    it being considered a public benefit that he should become an inhabitant of that
                    town. He represented his fellow-townsmen in the legislature, and served them in
                    a military capacity as a captain in the first regular troop organized in Salem,
                    which he led to victory through an Indian campaign inMaine. Originally a
                    determined “Separatist,” and opposed to compulsion for conscience, he signalized
                    himself when a magistrate by the active part which he took in the Quaker
                    persecutions of the time (1657-62), going so far on one occasion as to order the
                    whipping of Anne Coleman and four other Friends through Salem, Boston, and
                    Dedham. He died, an old man, in the odour of sanctity, and left a good property
                    to his son John, who inherited his father’s capacity and intolerance, and was in
                    turn a legislator, a magistrate, a soldier, and a bitter persecutor of witches.
                    Before the death of Justice Hathorne in 1717, the destiny of the family suffered
                    a sea-change, and they began to be noted as mariners. One of these seafaring
                    Hathornes figured in the Revolution as a privateer, who had the good fortune to
                    escape from a British prison-ship; and another, Captain Daniel Hathorne, has
                    left his mark on early <pb break="no"

                    commander of the brig “Fair American,” which, cruising off the coast of
                    Portugal, fell in with a British scow laden with troops for General Howe, which
                    scow the bold Hathorne and his valiant crew at once engaged, and fought for over
                    an hour, until the vanquished enemy was glad to cut the Yankee grapplings and
                    quickly bear away. The last of the Hathornes with whom we are concerned was a
                    son of this sturdy old privateer, Nathaniel Hathorne. He was born in 1776, and
                    about the beginning of the present century married Miss Elizabeth Clarke
                    Manning, a daughter of Richard Manning of Salem, whose ancestors emigrated to
                    America about fifty years after the arrival of William Hathorne. Young Nathaniel
                    took his hereditary place before the mast, passed from the forecastle to the
                    cabin, made voyages to the East and West Indies, Brazil, and Africa, and finally
                    died of .fever at Surinam, in the spring of 1808. He was the father of three
                    children, the second of whom, Nathaniel, was born at Salem, July 4, 1804.</p>
                <p>After the death of her husband Mrs Hathorne removed to the house of her father
                    with her little family of children. Of the boyhood of Nathaniel no particulars
                    have reached us, except that be was fond of taking long walks alone, aud that he
                    used to declare to his mother that he would go to sea some time, and would never
                    return. Among the books that he is known to have read as a child were
                    Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, and Thomson, <hi rend="italic">The Castle of
                    Indolence</hi> being an especial favourite. In the autumn of 1818 his mother
                    removed to Raymond, a town in Cumberland county, Maine, where his uncle, Richard
                    Manning, had built a large and ambitious dwelling. Here the lad resumed his
                    solitary walks, exchanging the narrow streets of Salem for the boundless,
                    primeval wilderness, and its sluggish harbour for the fresh, bright waters of
                    Sebago lake. He roamed the woods by day, with his gun and rod, and in the
                    moonlight nights of winter skated upon the lake alone till midnight. When he
                    found himself away from home, and wearied with his exercise, he took refuge in a
                    log cabin where half a tree would be burning upon the hearth. He had by this
                    time acquired a taste for writing, that showed itself in a little blank-book, in
                    which he jotted down his woodland adventures and feelings, and which was
                    remarkable for minute observation and nice perception of nature.</p>
                <p>After a year’s residence at Raymond, Nathaniel returned to Salem in order to
                    prepare for college. He amused himself by publishing a manuscript periodical,
                    which he called the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> and which displayed
                    considerable vivacity and talent. He speculated upon the profession that he
                    would follow, with a sort of prophetic insight into his future. “I do not want
                    to be a doctor and live by men’s diseases,” he wrote to his mother, “nor a
                    minister to live by their sins, nor a lawyer and live by their quarrels. So I
                    don’t see that there is anything left for me but to be an author. How would you
                    like some day to see a whole shelf full of books, written by your son, with ‘
                    Hawthorne’s Works’ printed on their backs'?”</p>
                <p>Nathaniel entered Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, in the autumn of 1821, where
                    he became acquainted with two students who were destined to distinction—Henry W.
                    Longfellow and Franklin Pierce. He was an excellent classical scholar, his Latin
                    compositions, even in his freshman year, being remarkable for their elegance,
                    while his Greek (which was less) was good. He made graceful translations from
                    the Roman poets, and wrote several English poems which were creditable to him.
                    After his graduation three years later, he returned to Salem, and to a life of
                    isolation. He devoted his mornings to study, his afternoons to writing, and his
                    evenings to long walks along the rocky coast. He was scarcely known by sight to
                    his townsmen, and he held so little communication with the members of his own
                    family that his meals were frequently left at his locked door. He wrote largely,
                    but destroyed many of his manuscripts, his taste was so difficult to please. He
                    thought well enough, however, of one of his compositions to print it anonymously
                    in 1828. A crude melodramatic story, entitled <hi rend="italic">Fanshawe,</hi>
                    it was unworthy even of his immature powers, and should never have been rescued
                    from the oblivion which speedily overtook it. The name of Nathaniel Hawthorne
                    finally became known to his countrymen as a writer in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Token,</hi> a holiday annual which was commenced in 1828 by Mr S. G. Goodrich
                    (better known as “Peter Parley ”), by whom it was conducted for fourteen years.
                    This forgotten publication numbered among its contributors most of the prominent
                    American writers of the time, none of whom appear to have added to their
                    reputation in its pages, except the least popular of all— Hawthorne, who was for
                    years the obscurest man of letters in America, though he gradually made admirers
                    in a quiet way. His first public recognition came from England, where his genius
                    was discovered in 1835 by the late Henry F. Chorley, one of the editors of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Atheηceτιm,</hi> in which he copied three of Hawthorne’s most
                    characteristic papers from <hi rend="italic">The Token.</hi> He had but little
                    encouragement to continue in literature, for Mr Goodrich was so much more a
                    publisher than an author that he paid him wretchedly for his contributions, and
                    still more wretchedly for his work upon an <hi rend="italic">American Magazine
                    of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge,</hi> w <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> hich
                    he persuaded him to edit. This authorpublisher consented, however, at a later
                    period (1837) to bring out a collection of Hawthorne’s writings under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Twice-told Tales.</hi> A moderate edition was got rid of,
                    but the great body of the reading public ignored the book altogether. It was
                    generously reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi> by his
                    college friend Longfellow, who said it came from the hand of a man of genius,
                    and praised it for the exceeding beauty of its style, which was as clear as
                    running waters.</p>
                <p>The want of pecuniary success which had so far attended his authorship led
                    Hawthorne to accept a situation which was tendered him by Mr George Bancroft,
                    the historian, collector of the port of Boston under the Democratic rule of
                    President Van Buren. He was appointed a weigher in the custom-house at a salary
                    of about $1200 a year, aud entered upon the duties of his office, which
                    consisted for the most part in measuring coal, salt, and other bulky commodities
                    on foreign vessels. It was irksome employment, but faithfully performed for two
                    years, when he was superseded through a change in the national administration.
                    Master of himself once more, he returned to Salem, wherø he remained until the
                    spring of 1841, when he wrote a collection of children’s stories entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Grandfather's Chair,</hi> and joined an industrial association at
                    West Roxbury, Mass. Brook Farm, as it was called, was a social Utopia, composed
                    of a number of advanced thinkers, whose object was so to distribute manual
                    labour as to give its members time for intellectual culture. The scheme worked
                    admirably—on paper; but it was suited neither to the temperament nor the taste
                    of Hawthorne, and after trying it patiently for nearly a year he returned to the
                    everyday life of mankind.</p>
                <p>One of Hawthorne’s earliest admirers was Miss Sophia Peabody, a lady of Salem,
                    whom he married in the summer of 1842. He made himself a new home in an old
                    manse, at Concord, Mass., situated on historic ground, in sight of an old
                    revolutionary battlefield, and devoted himself diligently to literature. He was
                    known to the few by his <hi rend="italic">Twice-told Tales,</hi> and to the many
                    by his papers in the <hi rend="italic">Democratic Review.</hi> He published in
                    1842 a second portion of <hi rend="italic">Grandfather's Chair,</hi> and in 1845
                    a second volume of <hi rend="italic">Twice-told Tales.</hi> He edited, during
                    the latter year the <pb break="no"

                    Bridge, an officer of the navy, who had been at college with him; and in the
                    following year he published in two volumes a collection of his later writings,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Mosses from an Old Manse.</hi></p>
                <p>After a residence of nearly four years at Concord, Hawthorne returned to Salem,
                    having been appointed surveyor of the custom-house of that port by a new
                    Democratic administration. He filled the duties of this position until the
                    incoming of the Whig administration again led to his retirement. He seems to
                    have written little during his official term, but, as he had leisure enough and
                    to spare, he read much, and pondered over subjects for future stories. His next
                    work, <hi rend="italic">The Scarlet Letter,</hi> which was begun after his
                    removal from the custom-house, was published in 1850. If there had been any
                    doubt of his genius before, it was settled for ever by this powerful
                    romance.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Scarlet Letter</hi>
                    Hawthorne removed from Salem to Lenox, Berkshire, Mass., where he wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">The House of the Seven Gables</hi> (1851) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Wonder-Book</hi> (1851). From Lenox he removed to West Newton, near Boston,
                    Mass., where he wrote <hi rend="italic">The Blithedale Romance</hi> (1852) and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Snow Image and other Twice-told Tales</hi> (1852). In the
                    spring of 1852 he removed back to Concord, where he purchased an old house which
                    he c tiled The Wayside, and where he wrote a <hi rend="italic">Life of Franklin
                    Pierce</hi> (1852) and <hi rend="italic">Tanglevοοod Tales</hi> (1853). Mr
                    Pierce was the Democratic candidate for the presidency, and it was only at his
                    urgent solicitation that Hawthorne consented to become his biographer. He
                    declared that he would accept no office in case he were elected, lest it might
                    compromise him; but his friends gave him such weighty reasons for reconsidering
                    his decision that he accepted the consulate at Liverpool, which was understood
                    to be one of the best gifts at the disposal of the president.</p>
                <p>Hawthorne departed for Europe in the summer of 1853, and returned to the United
                    States in the summer of 1860. Of the seven years which he passed in Europe five
                    were spent in attending to the duties of his consulate at Liverpool, and in
                    little journeys to Scotland, the Lakes, and elsewhere, and the remaining two in
                    France and Italy. They were quiet and uneventful, coloured by observation and
                    reflexion, as his note-books show, but productive of only one elaborate work,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Marble Faun,</hi> which he sketched out during his
                    residence in Italy, and rewrote and prepared for the press at Leamington,
                    England, whence it was despatched to America and published in 1860.</p>
                <p>Hawthorne took up his abode at The Wayside, not much richer than when he left it,
                    and sat down at his desk once more with a heavy heart. He was surrounded by the
                    throes of a great civil war, and the political party with which he had always
                    acted was under a cloud. His friend ex-President Pierce was stigmatized as a
                    traitor, and when Hawthorne dedicated his next book to him—a volume of English
                    impressions entitled <hi rend="italic">Our Old</hi> 7Zome(1863)—it was at the
                    risk of his own popularity. His pen was soon to be laid aside for ever; for,
                    with the exception of the unfinished story of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Septimius</hi><hi rend="italic">Felton,</hi> which was published after his
                    death by his daughter Una (1872), and the fragment of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Dolliver Romance,</hi> the beginning of which was published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> in July 1864, he wrote no more. His health
                    gradually declined; his hair grew white as snow, and the once stalwart figure
                    that in early manhood flashed along the airy cliffs and glittering sands
                    sauntered idly on the little hill behind his house. In the beginning of April
                    1864 he made a short southern tour with his publisher Mr. William D. Ticknor,
                    and was benefited by the change of scene until he reached Philadelphia, where he
                    was shocked by the sudden death of Mr Ticknor. He returned to The Wayside, and
                    after a short season of rest joined his friend ex-President Pierce. He died at
                    Plymouth, New Hampshire, on May 19, 1864, and five days later was buried at
                    Sleepy Hollow, a beautiful cemetery at Concord, where he used to walk under the
                    pines when he was living at the Old Manse, and where his ashes moulder under a
                    simple stone, inscribed with the single word “Hawthorne.”</p>
                <p>The writings of Hawthorne are marked by subtle imagination, curious power of
                    analysis, and exquisite purity of diction. He studied exceptional developments
                    of character, and was fond of exploring secret crypts of emotion. His shorter
                    stories are remarkable for originality and suggestiveness, and his larger ones
                    are as absolute creations as <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Undine.</hi> Lacking the accomplishment of verse, he was in the highest sense a
                    poet. His work is pervaded by a manly personality, and by an almost feminine
                    delicacy and gentleness. He inherited the gravity of his Puritan ancestors
                    without theiι∙ superstition, and learned in his solitary meditations a knowledge
                    of the night-side of life which would have filled them with suspicion. A
                    profound anatomist of the heart, he was singularly free from morbidness, and in
                    his darkest speculations concerning evil was robustly right-minded. He
                    worshipped conscience with his intellectual as well as his moral nature; it is
                    supreme in all he wrote. Besides these mental traits, he possessed the literary
                    quality of style—a grace, a charm, a perfection of language which no other
