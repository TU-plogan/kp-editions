                    formal recognition of his claims to its possession, and in 1156 Henry
                    Jasomirgott was compelled to deliver it up to him. Besides distinguishing
                    himself in the wars of Frederick in Italy, Henry now devoted his energies to
                    establishing his power in his own dominions, both by conquest and by encouraging
                    agriculture and trade. He extended the boundaries of Saxony beyond the Elbe by
                    successful battles against the Slavs, founded Munich in Bavaria, colonized
                    Mecklenburg and Holstein, and fostered the growth of Hamburg and Lübeck. His
                    ambitious projects and his arrogant bearing awakened, however, the hostility of
                    several of the secular and ecclesiastical potentates, who in 1166 concluded a
                    league against him at Merseburg, and a stubborn contest of two years’ duration
                    ensued, which was finally ended by Frederick in 1169 deciding at the council of
                    Bamberg in Henry’s favour. In February 1168 Henry, having previously divorced
                    dementia of Zähringen, married Matilda, daughter of Henry II. of England; and,
                    elated by such an influential alliance and by the increasing resources of his
                    dominions, he shortly after his return from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in
                    1172 began to manifest a tendency to treat the emperor with coldness and to
                    revive the traditional rivalry of his race with the Hohenstaufens. He took no
                    part in the Italian expedition of 1174, and in 1176 his sudden desertion of
                    Frederick in the crisis of his struggle with the Lombard cities resulted in the
                    disaster at Legnano. On Frederick’s return from Italy in 1177 Henry was summoned
                    to appear before him at the diet of Worms, and declining to do so he was placed
                    under the ban of the empire, and his lands were divided among other princes. For
                    more than a year he endeavoured to resist the execution of the imperial decree,
                    but he found it necessary at last, in November 1181, to give in his submission
                    to Frederick, who, on condition that he remained three years in England, agreed
                    to reinstate him in the possession of Brunswick and Lüneburg. Having in 1189
                    refused to accompany Frederick on his crusade, he was again compelled to
                    withdraw to England, but shortly after Frederick’s departure he returned, and,
                    concluding an alliance with the archbishop of Bremen, made a second attempt to
                    recover his territories; but, though at first he gained several important
                    victories, he was ultimately compelled in July 1190 to conclude a peace at
                    Fulda, which secured to him scarcely any advantages from the contest. Emboldened
                    by the hostile alliance formed against the emperor Henry VI. in 1192, he again
                    renewed the struggle; but after Richard of England fell into the hands of the
                    emperor in the following year, he found it necessary again to give in his
                    submission; and shortly afterwards a pledge of amity between the two houses was
                    given through the marriage of the eldest son of Henry the Lion to Agnes, niece
                    of Frederick I., and cousin of the reigning emperor. Henry died 6th August 1195
                    at Brunswick, and was buried in the church of St Blaise. Otto, his seoond son,
                    became emperor under the title of Otto IV. A colossal statue of Henry was
                    unveiled at Brunswick 4th July 1874. Though ambitious, headstrong, and
                    pugnacious, Henry showed that while he possessed no small skill in the art of
                    war he could appreciate the arts of peace, and he gave <pb break="no"
