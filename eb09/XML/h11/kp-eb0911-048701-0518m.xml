                    π. (15th Feb. 766 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Haroun al Raschid was
                    twenty-two years old when he ascended the throne. His biographers unanimously
                    speak of him as “the most accomplished, eloquent, and generous of the caliphs;”
                    but, though his name is a household word, and few figures stand out more grandly
                    prominent in the history of their times, little is really popularly known about
                    his private life and personal history.</p>

                <p>Raschid owed his own succession to the throne entirely to the prudence and
                    sagacity of Yahya ’bn Khâlid ibn Barmek, his secretary,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to the Mahometan law of succession
                    the eldest brother or male relative of the reigning monarch is the heir apparent
                    to the throne, and almost all Muslim princes have endeavoured to set aside the
                    claims of their relatives in favour of their own children. El Hadi, Haroun’s
                    brother, was no exception to the rule, and conceived the idea of stripping
                    Haroun of his rights and proclaiming his own son Jaafer as his successor. Yahya
                    was then Haroun’s secretary, and expected to exercise the important office of
                    vizier if ever his master should mount the throne, Hadi saw that his first step
                    must be to conciliate Yahya; he therefore took him apart, and having given him a
                    present of 20,000 dinars began to broach the subject nearest his heart. Yahya,
                    however,, brought a very strong argument to bear upon the point: “If you do so,
                    Prince of the Faithful,” said he, “you will set your subjects an example of
                    breaking an oath and disregarding a contract, and other people will be bold
                    enough to do the same. But if you leave your brother Haroun in possession of his
                    title of heir apparent and appoint your son Jaafer as next in succession to him,
                    it will be much more likely to secure his ultimate accession to the throne.”
                    Hadi allowed the matter to rest for some time, but at length paternal affection
                    got the better of him, and he again summoned Yahya into his presence and
                    consulted him, and Yahya urged that if the caliph should die while Jaafer was
                    yet a child the chiefs of the imperial family would never recognize the validity
                    of his succession. Hadi having acknowledged the truth of this, Yahya continued,
                    “Renounce then this project, in order the better to arrive at the consummation
                    of your wishes. Even if your father El Mehdi had not appointed Haroun to succeed
                    you it would be policy on your part to do so, inasmuch as that is the only way
                    to ensure the continuance of the caliphate in the family of the Beni Hashem.”
                    Raschid ever afterwards acknowledged this as the greatest obligation which he
                    owed to Yahya.</p></note> whom, on his accession, he appointed his lieutenant
                    and grand vizier. Yahya, upon whom the whole responsibility of the government
                    really devolved, performed his duties with the most consummate ability and
                    judgment. He fortified the frontiers, and repaired all the deficiencies in the
                    administration of the empire. He filled the treasury, made the provinces
                    flourishing and prosperous by encouraging trade and securing the public safety,
                    and in a word brought the caliphate up to the highest pitch of prosperity and
                    glory. He personally superintended and organized the whole system of government.
                    As a minister he was eloquent, wise, accomplished, and prudent, and he was
                    moreover an able administrator, ruling with a firm hand and proving himself able
                    to cope with any emergency that-might arise. His generosity was munificent in
                    the extreme and gained for him universal encomiums. With a most affable
                    demeanour and great moderation he combined an imposing dignity that commanded
                    universal respect.</p>
                <p>In 182 A.H. (798 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> Al Raschid proclaimed his son
                    'Abdallah as his heir apparent after El Amin, his eldest son, whom he had
                    appointed his successor when only five years old, and gave him the post of
                    viceroy of Khorassan. It was on this occasion that he gave 'Abdallah the name of
                    El Mamιin and confided him to the care of Jaafer, son of Yahya. The historians
                    speak of this act of Raschid’s with natural surprise, for he had seen the
                    results of similar policy on the part of his father and of his grandfather, as
                    well as what his brother Hadi had done in his own case.</p>
                <p>Yahya, ths prime minister, and Jaafer, his son, enjoyed so fully the confidence
                    of Haroun al Raschid that they rapidly rose to wealth and power. The great
                    popularity and influence of the Barmek or Barmecide family, however, at length
                    aroused the caliph’s jealousy, and to make matters worse he heard that Jaafer
                    had secretly married his sister. No sooner had he been made acquainted with the
                    facts than he caused his sister to be put to death, ordered Mesrùr, his slave
                    and executioner, to bring him Jaafer’s head, and next murdered his two
                    inoffending young nephews.</p>
                <p>After the fall of the Barmek family the office of prime minister was exercised by
                    Fadhl ibn Rabi' who had been chamberlain to Haroun himself, and to his
                    predecessors Mensur, Mehdi, and Hàdi. He held the office of vizier until the
                    death of Haroun al Raschid himself, which occurred at Tus, the birthplace of the
                    celebrated Persian epic poet Firdousi. Al Raschid had set out for Khorassan to
                    put down the insurrection of Raff ibn Leith ibn Nasr ibn Sayyar, who had
                    revolted against his authority, made himself master of Samarcand, and killed the
                    governor of that province. The rising had assumed such alarming proportions that
                    Al Raschid determined to march in person against the rebels. He had not,
                    however, got further than Tus when he was surprised by death in 193 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (808-9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi></p>
                <p>The reign of Al Raschid was one of the most brilliant in the annals of the
                    caliphate, and the limits of the empire were then more widely extended than at
                    any other period. The greater part of the Eastern world submitted to his laws,
                    and paid tribute into his treasury; Egypt itself was only a province under his
                    sway, and its ruler an officer appointed by himself. No caliph ever gathered
                    round him so great a number of learned men, poets, jurists, grammarians, cadis,
                    and scribes, to say nothing of the wits and musicians who enjoyed his patronage.
                    Haroun himself was an accomplished scholar and an excellent poet. He was well
                    versed in history, tradition, and poetry, which he could always quote on
                    appropriate occasions. He possessed exquisite taste and unerring discernment,
                    and his dignified demeanour made him an object of profound respect to high and
                    low.</p>
                <p>Haroun al Raschid is best known to Western readers as the hero of many of the
                    stories in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights·,</hi> and in Arabic literature
                    he is the central figure of numberless anecdotes and humorous stories. Of his
                    incognito walks through Baghdad, however, the authentic histories say nothing;
                    and the account of his relations with Charlemagne, of which European historians
                    speak, does not rest on a trustworthy basis. His reign is chiefly remarkable for
                    the fact that a family belonging to the pure Persian aristocracy held for so
                    long the reins of power under a caliph whose boast was that he was the only one
                    who came of unmixed Hashimi blood, that of the family from which the prophet of
                    El Islam sprung.</p>
