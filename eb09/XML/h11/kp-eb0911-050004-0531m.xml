                    work is finished, and the next court to appoint wheare and what building.” In
                    November 1637 “the Colledge is ordered to be at New Towne,” the name of which
                    had been changed to Cambridge, and a committee was appointed “to take order” for
                    it. In March 1638-30 “it is ordered that the colledge agreed upon formerly to
                    bee built at Cambridge shalbee called Harvard Colledge.” The reason was that the
                    Rev. John Harvard, B.A. 1632, and M.A. 1635, of Emmanuel College, Cambridge,
                    England, dying in Charlestown, Massachusetts, September 14, 1638, by will left
                    half his estate, about £800, and his library, to the wilderness seminary. The
                    college charter of 1650 declared the object to be “the education of the English
                    and Indian youth of this country in knowledge and godlynes.” The first brick
                    edifice on the college grounds, having rooms for twenty of the aborigines, was
                    called “the Indian college.” In it was printed the apostle Eliot’s translation
                    of the Bible into the language of the natives, with primers, grammars, tracts,
                    &amp;c. Several of the natives were members of the college; only one graduated
                    from it. By generous aid received from abroad for this special object, the
                    college was greatly helped in its infancy.</p>
                <p>Thus from the beginning private munificence rather than the public treasury
                    fostered and sustained the college, and with steadily increasing preponderance
                    all through its history have its supplies and endowments come from the
                    generosity of individuals. Grants from the colony, province, and State, of small
                    sums for salaries and incidental purposes, made annually or at intervals, wholly
                    ceased more than sixty years ago. With scarce an exception all the present
                    invested funds of the college and of its professional schools, amounting to
                    $3,615,538.87, with the halls, library, and apparatus, are the benefactions of
                    its friends.</p>
                <p>The charter constitutes as a corporation a president, treasurer, and five
                    fellows, who initiate all measures concerning the college, hold its funds, and
                    have the nomination for filling vacancies in their own body, as also of all the
                    officers for instruction aud for the internal government of the institution in
                    all its departments, subject, however, to the advice and approval and final
                    action of a board of overseers. The State, claiming as founder and patron, till
                    quite recently regarded the college as a State institution, over which it should
                    exercise a direct control through the legislature and the executive, by its
                    authority in the membership and the election of the whole or a part of the board
                    of overseers. Various modifications made from time to time in the composition or
                    method of choice of the members of this board not relieving the controversies
                    and embarrassments incident to legislative action, which proved prejudicial to
                    the best interests of the college, its organic connexion with the State by this
                    tie was severed by statute in 1866. The board of overseers as now constituted is
                    composed of thirty of the alumni, besides the president and the treasurer,
                    elected by the ballots of the alumni on commencement day at the college, in
                    sections of five, serving a term of six years. With its complement of
                    professional schools of law, medicine, theology, science, and many special
                    departments of the latter, more than any other institution in America, and with
                    but a few gaps yet to be filled in its completeness of method and equipment to
                    bring it to comparison with foreign institutions of learning, Harvard College
                    may claim to be in the most comprehensive sense of the term a university, a
                    title which is, indeed, assumed, and generally applied to it. Recent changes in
                    the course of study in the college have allowed a wide range for elective
                    studies to undergraduates, the proportions being, one-fourth obligatory,
                    three-fourths elective. In the professional schools most of the studies are
                    obligatory. The number of bound volumes in the library and schools is 232,200.
                    The number of halls owned and occupied for college uses is twenty-nine of brick
                    or stone, including ten for students’ chambers. The whole number of professors,
                    instructors, l <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> c., in all departments, is 135; of
                    librarians, proctors, and other officers in the service of the college, 28. The
                    number of the alumni of the college proper about 9600; the number in all
                    departments about 14,000.</p>
