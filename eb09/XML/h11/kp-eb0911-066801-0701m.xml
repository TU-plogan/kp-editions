                    Henry IV., was born in 1081. In 1098, his elder brother Conrad having forfeited
                    his right to the throne by rebellion, he was appointed his father’s successor.
                    Six years afterwards he himself rebelled against the emperor, towards whom he
                    played the part of a thorough traitor. The papal party, with which he allied
                    himself, took for granted that when he mounted the throne church and state would
                    be instantly reconciled; but their hopes were disappointed. The main point for
                    which Henry IV. had contended was the right of investing the bishops with ring
                    and staff. When Henry V. succeeded him in 1106, Pope Paschal II. demanded that
                    this right should be given up, but he replied that he could not resign powers
                    which had been exercised by his predecessors, and the loss of which would imply
                    that the ecclesiastical lands of Germany would be removed from secular control.
                    In 1110 he entered Italy at the head of 30,000 men. Alarmed by this display of
                    force, Paschal withdrew his claims, and a day was appointed for the coronation
                    of Henry as emperor. The opposition of the Roman prelates made it impossible for
                    the pope to proceed with the ceremony, whereupon he and his cardinals were made
                    prisoners. Paschal then formally recognized the right of investiture, and Henry
                    received the imperial crown. When the Germans had recrossed the Alps Paschal
                    renounced the treaty he had concluded, and the emperor was excommunicated. As
                    many of the princes were pleased to find this opportunity of rebelling, Germany
                    again became the scene of confused contests like those which had brought misery
                    upon it during Henry IV.’s long reign. In 1116 the emperor went a second time to
                    Italy and drove Paschal from Rome; and after Paschal’s death he caused Gregory
                    VIII. to be appointed pope. The extreme papal party, however, selected Gelasius
                    II., who renewed the sentence of excommunication against Henry. The latter
                    returned to Germany in 1119, and at a diet in Tribur succeeded in allaying the
                    hostility of the more important among his enemies. Pope Calixtus II., who
                    succeeded Gelasius in 1119, now found it necessary to offer a compromise; and
                    the controversy between the empire and the papacy was for the time closed by the
                    concordat of Worms, which was concluded in 1122. By this treaty it was agreed
                    that at every election of a prelate the emperor should have the right·</p>

                <p>of being present, either in person or through a representative, and that the
                    chosen bishop, before being consecrated, should receive his lands and secular
                    authority in fief of the crown. So far the advantage rested with the emperor;
                    but the papacy gained by being recognized as a power which had the right of
                    negotiating with the empire on equal terms, and by the acknowledgment of the
                    claim of the church to nominate its own rulers. Notwithstanding this settlement
                    Germany did not long enjoy peace, for a number of petty wars broke out which
                    Henry was not strong enough to quell. He died at Nimegueu in 1125, and with him
                    was extinguished the Franconian dynasty.</p>
