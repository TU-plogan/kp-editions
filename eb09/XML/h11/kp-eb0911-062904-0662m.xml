                    introduces Helena apparently to symbolize the Greek spirit acting on the modern
                    mind. Among later poets the tales of Helen are much more complicated. She was
                    carried off by Theseus to Attica in her childhood, but was recovered by her
                    brothers. Her character often suffers much in the tales followed by lyric and
                    tragic poets. Stesichorus and Euripides <hi rend="italic">(Helena),</hi>
                    however, relate that Paris on his homeward voyage was driven by stress of wind
                    to Egypt. Proteus, king of Egypt, learning the facts, detained the real Helen in
                    Egypt, while a shadowy Helen was taken to Troy and fought for. Menelaus on his
                    way home from Troy was also driven to Egypt, and there found his true wife.
                    After the death of Paris she is also said to have been married to his brother
                    Deiphobus.</p>
                <p>If we turn to the religious ceremonies and the genuine popular tales, we find
                    traces of a more archaic Helen. At Rhamnus in Attica she was connected with the
                    worship of Nemesis, whose daughter she was considered to be. In Argos she was
                    counted mother of Iphigenia, and was said to have founded a temple of
                    Eileithyia, the goddess of birth. At Sparta she was honoured as presiding over
                    the care of children, and festivals were celebrated in her honour by the
                    maidens. A tree appears to have been connected with her worship there (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Τheocr.,</hi> xviii.); and in Rhodes sl:e was worshipped by
                    maidens with the epithet δevδpcrιs, a relic of the very oldest kind of worship,
                    where a sacred tree was worshi] ped as the embodiment of the god. In most of
                    these cults connexion with a moon-goddess, the most important of whose functions
                    was the care over child-birth, is apparent; and we are led to regard <hi
                    rend="italic">ίλίνη</hi> as an epithet of the moon, which has gradually been
                    severed from it and raised to an independent existence (c∕. the account given of
                    Gorgophone under <hi rend="smallcaps">Gorgon).</hi> Beauty is a specially common
                    attribute of the moon and of moon-goddesses, such as Hera. This makes it most
                    probable that the word, like <hi rend="italic">σtK∙i,ν∙η, ⅛</hi> connected with
                    the root <hi rend="italic">svαr,</hi> to shine. The tales connecting Helena with
                    Achilles, who is clearly a sun-god originally, which are known already to the
                    writer of the <hi rend="italic">Cypria,</hi> are also very instructive. Over the
                    Black Sea coasts Achilles and Helena were worshipped as united in the Elysian
                    fields. With this we must compare the story of Cadmus and Harmonia (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Harmonia),</hi> and of Hades and Persephone; and we must
                    remember that these colonies of Miletus were closely connected with Attica. We
                    may then look on it as probable that the rape of Helena by Theseus is merely a
                    device of harmonizing skill to connect the Helena cf Spartan religion with the
                    Helena worshipped in Attica. Probably a similar reason has contributed to mould
                    the tale which has formt d itself round the undoubtedly historical fact of the
                    destruction of Troy by a Greek tribe or army. The worship cf Aphrodite, the
                    goddess whose influence in the story of Paris and Helena is so great, was common
                    to Troy and Cythera. Many facts also point to a close connexion between
                    Aphrodite and Helena. The swan from whose egg she is born is the bird of
                    Aphrodite. By the author of the <hi rend="italic">Cypria</hi> and in Attic
                    tradition Helen is made the daughter of Nemesis; but Nemesis as a goddess of
                    fate is clearly a dawn-goddess (see Kuhn, <hi rend="italic">Zft.,</hi> iii.
                    449), and therefore may be identified in origin with Aphrodite. We have here
                    another instance of the intimate relation of the moon and dawn goddesses, and
                    the impossibility of dividing them by any broad line (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hebe, Hera).</hi> It would be at once a most instructive and a most interesting
                    task <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n663/mode/1up"

                    reek goddess was gradually transformed into the charming heroine round whom the
                    action of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> revolves. The data for reconstructing
                    the history of this figure are more than usually full, and are so clear that
                    writers of the most opposite schools (as Weicker, Gerhard, Mannhardt, Maury,
                    Roscher) have recognized in Helena the ancient goddess.</p>
