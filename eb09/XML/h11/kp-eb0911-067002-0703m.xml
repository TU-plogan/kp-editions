                    as we learn from his sister Margaret of Navarre; but his unstable character soon
                    gave way before his mother’s will, and both Henry and Margaret remained as
                    choice ornaments of the Catholic Church. Henry w on two brilliant victories at
                    Jarnac and Moncontour (1569), and thereby attracted the eyes of the Polish
                    nobles, who elected him their king in 1573. He went to Warsaw, but, on the death
                    of his brother Charles IX. in 1574, came back to France and assumed the crown.
                    He returned to a wretched kingdom, torn with civil war. Now began that “reign of
                    favourites” which has made his career a byword. His mother, ever balancing
                    between parties, first favoured the favourites, then went with the Huguenot
                    chiefs. In these days the famous League was organized (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >France,</hi> vol. ix. p. 562), and Henry declared himself its head in 1576. He
                    took but a feeble part in the sixth and seventh civil wars, and was little in
                    earnest till, in 1584, the death of his younger brother, Francis, duke of Anjou,
                    made Henry of Navarre next heir to the throne, and excited to the utmost the
                    fierce passions of the Guises and the League. The <pb break="no"

                    “sixteen” (1585), with its devotion to Henry, duke of Guise, and its
                    determination to exclude the heretic of Navarre, to depose the wavering Henry
                    III., and to make Cardinal Bourbon king,—this, as well as the menacing attitude
                    of Philip II. of Spain, forced Henry III. to draw towards his distant cousin
                    Henry of Navarre. And so he was driven to desperation by the commanding position
                    assumed by the house of Guise; and in 1588 Henry of Guise and his brother the
                    cardinal were assassinated by his orders. Henry III. now found himself
                    powerless; early in 1589 he again joined Henry of Navarre, and with him laid
                    siege to Paris. There he was murdered by one Jacques Clement, a priest. With
                    Henry III. ended the direct line of the house of Valois. In his young days he
                    had been enthusiastic for learning and the new religious opinions; as he grew
                    older he grew worse; and the last of the sons of Catherine de’ Medici was
                    perhaps the most debauched of the kings who hitherto had sat on the throne of
                    France.</p>
