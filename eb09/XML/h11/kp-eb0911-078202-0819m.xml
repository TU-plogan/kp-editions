                    Fall,</hi> c. 63) :—“When thou art alone in thy cell shut thy door, and seat
                    thyself in a corner; raise thy mind above all things vain and transitory;
                    recline thy beard and chin on thy breast; turn thine eyes and thy thought
                    towards the middle of thy belly, the region of the navel; and search the place
                    of the heart, the seat of the soul. At first all will be dark and comfortless;
                    but if thou persevere day and night, thou wilt feel an ineffable joy; and no
                    sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart than it is involved in a
                    mystic and ethereal light.” About the year 1337 this Hesychasm, the affinity of
                    which with certain well-known forms of Oriental mysticism is obvious, attracted
                    the attention of the learned and versatile Barlaam, a Calabrian monk, who at
                    that time held the office of abbot in the Basilian monastery of St Saviour’s in
                    Constantinople, and who had visited the fraternities of Mount Athos on a tour of
                    inspection. Amid much that he disapproved, what he specially took exception to
                    as heretical and blasphemous was the doctrine entertained as to the nature of
                    this divine light, the fruition of which was the supposed reward of Hesychastic
                    contemplation. It was maintained to be the pure and perfect essence of God
                    Himself, that eternal light which had been manifested to the disciples on Mount
                    Tabor at the transfiguration. This Barlaam held to be polytheistic, inasmuch as
                    it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. On the
                    Hesychastic side the controversy was taken up by Gregory Palamas, afterwards
                    archbishop of Thessalonica, who laboured to establish a distinction between
                    eternal <hi rend="italic">ουσία</hi> and eternal ewpyaa. In 1341 the dispute
                    came before a synod held at Constantinople; the decision, which no doubt was to
                    a large extent determined by the excessive veneration in which the writings of
                    the pseudo-Dionysius were held in the Eastern Church, was adverse to Barlaam,
                    who in consequence returned to Calabria, and afterwards became bishop of Hierace
                    in the Latin communion. Three other synods in relation to the same subject were
                    subsequently held; and at the last of these, held in 1351 under the presidency
                    of the emperor John Cantacuzenus, the uncreated light of Mount Tabor was
                    established as an article of faith for the Greeks, who ever since have been
                    ready to recognize it as an additional ground of separation from the Roman
                    Church. The contemporary historians Cantacuzenus and Nicephorus Gregoras have
                    both dealt very copiously with this subject, which is also more or less
                    discussed in all the church histories. See Engelhardt’s article on the Arsenians
                    and Hesychasts in Illgen’s <hi rend="italic">Zeitschr. f. Hist. Theol.,</hi>
                    viii. 48, and the account of the Hesychasts in Herzog’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encylclopädie.</hi> It may be mentioned that in the time of Justinian the word
                    Hesychast was applied to monks in general simply as descriptive of the quiet and
                    contemplative character of their pursuits.</p>
