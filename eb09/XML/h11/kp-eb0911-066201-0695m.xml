                    founder of the Tudor dynasty. On his mother’s side Henry belonged to the
                    illegitimate branch of the house of Lancaster, being descended from John of
                    Gaunt and Catherine Swinford, and it was only in the absence of nearer heirs
                    that he was accepted as the representative of that house. On the father’s side
                    he was sprung from the marriage of Owen Tudor, a Welsh gentleman, with
                    Catherine, widow of Henry V., and this family name became the name of the line
                    of kings which he founded. On the complete overthrow of the Lancastrians,
                    especially after Richard had won the throne by putting his nephews out of the
                    way, Henry, under the name of the earl of Richmond, appeared as the centre of
                    the opposition. From his exile in Brittany or France he schemed for the
                    overthrow of Richard, and made an expedition to England to support the
                    unsuccessful rising of Buckingham. The increasing unpopularity of Richard gave
                    him greater success in his second enterprise. He landed at Milford Haven in
                    order to profit by the good-will of his kinsmen the Welsh, and marching into
                    Leicestershire defeated Richard at the battle of Bosworth, thus ending the Wars
                    of the Roses (1485). Soon after he married Elizabeth daughter of Edward IV., and
                    so the White Rose and the Red were united. Henry, however, was not allowed to
                    enjoy the crown in peace. Two pretenders, one after another, led a rising
                    against him. Lambert Simnel, personating the earl of Warwick, son of the duke of
                    Clarence, gathered the Yorkists about him in Ireland, and landing in Lancashire
                    advanced as far as Stoke in Staffordshire, where he was defeated and made
                    captive (1487). Next arose Perkin Warbeck, a Fleming, who, pretending to be one
                    of the princes murdered by Richard in the Tower, received much countenance
                    abroad and in Scotland, and had many supporters among the discontented at home.
                    But when he ventured to land in Cornwall, lie was captured and finally executed
                    (1499). These risings troubled the reign of Henry, but did not shake his throne.
                    He ruled with a firm hand; he took care to repress the nobles, already almost
                    exterminated in the civil war, in this case continuing the policy of Edward IV.;
                    he put down the practice of maintenance, by which they kept bodies of retainers
                    ready to support them in battle, and in every way sought to concentrate in the
                    person of the king the whole power of the nation. Henry was a parsimonious and
                    calculating ruler, who avoided war, gained by diplomacy what other sovereigns
                    attempted by force, kept a well-filled treasury, and made two brief expeditions
                    into France the occasion of amassing additional wealth. His avarice led him even
                    to revive old and forgotten statutes, and to exact heavy fines from those who
                    had transgressed them, in which evil work he was assisted by the two well-known
                    lawyers Empson and Dudley. His reign is marked also by two marriage arrangements
                    which had great influence on subsequent history. His son Arthur was wedded to
                    Catherine of Aragon. When Arthur died in 1502, a few months after the marriage,
                    Catherine remained in England in order to be united to the younger son Henry,
                    though the nuptials did not take place till after his accession to the throne.
                    The other marriage was that of the young princess Margaret to James IV. of
                    Scotland (1503), which a century after resulted in the union of the crowns.
                    Henry VII. died in 1509, leaving, it is said, a treasure of two million pounds
                    to his successor. He was by no means an amiable or popular sovereign, but did
                    great service in settling and consolidating the kingdom after the long
                    troubles.</p>
