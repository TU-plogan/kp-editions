                    (1817-1868), was born in 1817, and served his term as apprentice to his father,
                    a house-painter at Dantzic. He was not twenty when he came to Berlin, where he

                    artists who have earned a name for subtle and rapid execution, he worked at
                    first in a formal, smooth, and timid fashion. Several early pieces exhibited
                    after his death,—a breakwater, dated 1838, ships in a breeze off Swinemiinde
                    (1840), and other canvases of this and the following year,—show Hildebrandt to

                    conventionalisms of the formal school to which Krause belonged. It is difficult
                    to say what the outcome of his art would have been if Hildebrandt had not felt
                    other influences than those of his native schools. Accident made him acquainted
                    with masterpieces of French art displayed at the periodical exhibitions of the
                    Berlin Academy, and these awakened his curiosity and envy. He made up his bundle
                    and wandered to Paris, where, about 1842, he entered the atelier of Isabey and
                    became the companion of Lepoittevin. In a short time he sent home pictures which
                    might have been taken for copies from these artists. Gradually he mastered the
                    tricks of touch and the mysterious secrets of effect in which the French at this
                    period were already so perfect. He also acquired the necessary skill in painting
                    figures, and having done this he returned to Germany, unsurpassable in technical
                    execution, and well skilled in the rendering of many kinds of landscape forms.
                    His pictures of French street life, done about 1843, are impressed with the
                    stamp of the Paris school, but they reveal at the same time a spirit eager for
                    novelty, quick at grasping, equally quick at rendering, momentary changes of
                    tone and atmosphere in varying space and medium. After 1843 Hildebrandt, under
                    the influence of Humboldt, extended his travels, and in 1864-65 he actually went
                    round the world, But whilst his experience became enlarged his powers of
                    concentration broke down. He lost the taste for detail in seeking for scenic
                    breadth, and a fatal facility of hand diminished the value of his works for all
                    those who look for composition and harmony of hue as necessary concomitants of
                    tone and touch. In oil he gradually produced less, in water colours more, than
                    at first, and his fame will probably rest on the sketches which he made in the
                    latter form, many of which are known to the general public by means of
                    chromo-lithography. His course may best be compared to that of a meteor, being
                    breathlessly rapid, brilliant, and charged with colour. No other had the same
                    art of combining elements singly unpicturesque into a picturesque and striking
                    whole, and this chiefly by contrasts of tint and observation of natural
                    phenomena. Fantasies in red, yellow, and opal, sunset, sunrise, and moonshine,
                    distances of hundreds of miles like those of the Andes and the Himalaya, narrow
                    streets in the bazaars of Cairo or Suez, panoramas as seen from mastheads, wide
                    cities like Bombay or Pekin, narrow strips of desert with measureless expanses
                    of sky,—all alike display the <hi rend="italic">bravura</hi> of a master who had
                    innumerable admirers in his day on account of this facility, and deserved all
                    the admiration he received, subject to the merited reproach that all these
                    fireworks would have been more satisfactory if combined with deeper meditation
                    on the art of composition and more patient study of detail. Hildebrandt died
                    young at Berlin, on the 25th of October 1868. His pictures are scattered in vast
                    numbers throughout Germany. But good selections are accessible in the royal
                    palaces and in the collections of Borsig, Raabe, and Ravené at Berlin.</p>
