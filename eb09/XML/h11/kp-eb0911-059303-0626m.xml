                    Cheshire in 1783. He early showed remarkable promise, and was entered in
                    November 1800 at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he proved a distinguished
                    student, carrying off prizes for a Latin poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Carmen
                    Seculare,</hi> an English poem on <hi rend="italic">Palestine,</hi> and a prose
                    essay on <hi rend="italic">The Sense of Honour.</hi> In November 1804 he was
                    elected a fellow of All Souls College; and, after finishing his distinguished
                    university career, he made a long tour on the Continent. He was admitted to holy
                    orders in 1807, and was then presented to the family living of Hodnet in
                    Shropshire. In 1809 Heber married Amelia, daughter of Dr Shipley, dean of St
                    Asaph. He was appointed Bampton lecturer for 1815, prebendary of St Asaph in
                    1817, preacher at Lincoln’s Inn in 1822, and bishop of Calcutta in January 1823.
                    Before sailing for India he received the degree of D.D. from the university of
                    Oxford. In India Bishop Hebei-laboured indefutigably, not only for the good of
                    his own diocese, but for the spread of Christianity throughout the East.
                    Animated by apostolic zeal, he undertook numerous tours in India, consecrating
                    churches, founding schools, and discharging other Christian duties. Such
                    devotion to his work in a trying climate told severely on his health. At
                    Trichinopoly he was seized with an apoplectic fit when in his bath, and expired
                    on 3d April 1826.</p>
                <p>Heber was a man of profound learning, refined literary taste, and great practical
                    energy. His Christian character manifested all the beauty and simplicity of the
                    days of the early church. As a poet he has attained a high place. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Palestine</hi> is generally considered the best prize poem ever
                    written at Oxford. Heber’s fame rests mainly on his hymns, which, as literary
                    compositions, rank among the best in the English language. Those beginning as
                    follows may be instanced :—“Lord of mercy and of might”; “Brightest and best of
                    the sons of the morning”; “By cool Siloam’s shady rill”; “God, that madest earth
                    and heaven”; “The Lord of might from Sinai’s brow”; “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
                    Almighty”; “From Greenland’s icy mountains”; “The Lord will come, the earth <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0627-0594"/> shall quake”; “The Son of God goes forth to war.”
                    Heber’s hymns and other poems are distinguished by finish of style, pathos, and
                    soaring aspiration; but they lack originality, and are rather rhetorical than
                    poetical in the strict sense.</p>
                <p>Heber was a voluminous author, as may be seen from the following works <hi
                    rend="italic">-.—Palestine; a Poem, to which is added the Passage of the Red
                    Sea,</hi> 1809; <hi rend="italic">Europe: Lines on the Present War,</hi> 1809;
