                    at the grammar school of Shrewsbury and at Eton, he in 1764 entered St John’s
                    College, Cambridge. While at the university he made the acquaintance of the
                    Methodist preacher Whitfield, and stimulated by his example he somewhat
                    scandalized the university authorities and his own friends by preaching, before
                    he had obtained holy orders, in the surrounding villages, and conducting
                    religious services in the houses of the sick and poor. After graduating with
                    distinction he took orders, and in 1773 was appointed to the parish of Kingston,
                    Somersetshire, where he began to indulge his favourite taste for open air
                    preaching, and soon attracted great crowds to the services which he held nearly
                    every day of the week. Having on the death of his father in 1780 inherited
                    considerable property, he built for his own use Surrey Chapel, in the
                    Blackfriars Road, London. The chapel was opened on the 8th June 1783. Though now
                    practically occupying the ecclesiastical position of a dissenter, Hill conducted
                    his <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n855/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0855-0818"/> services in accordance with the forms of the
                    Church of England, in whose communion he always remained. From the beginning his
                    success was complete, and his chapel soon came to be filled with an audience
                    such as no other preacher in London could boast. During the summer months he
                    made what he called “gospel-tours” into all parts of the country, sometimes
                    extending them to Scotland and Ireland, and attracted wherever he went audiences
                    as numerous and as interested as those which had crowded to hear Whitfield.
                    After these tours he always returned with increased enthusiasm to his duties at
                    Surrey Chapel, where he continued to officiate almost to the day of his death,
                    11th April 1833. The oratory of Rowland Hill, like that of Whitfield, was
                    specially adapted for rude and uncultivated audiences, and it was equally
                    effective although by more varied means. He possessed a voice of great power,
                    and, according to Southey, “his manner” was “that of a performer as great in his
                    own line as Kean or Kemble.” Not unfrequently he violated the laws of good taste
                    in the eccentricities of his wit and humour, but the intensity and purity of the
                    purpose by which he was actuated enabled him always to retain uninjured his
                    moral influence over his audience. Among the various publications of Rowland
                    Hill the best known is his <hi rend="italic">Village Dialogues,</hi> which first
                    appeared in 1810, and reached a 34th edition in 1839.</p>
