                <p><label type="entry">HIERARCHY</label>. From <hi rend="italic">ιεράρχης,</hi>
                    meaning a steward or guardian of holy things, is derived <hi rend="italic"
                        >ιεραρχία,</hi> naturally signifying the office of such a steward or
                    guardian (not a “ruler of priests” or “priestly ruler ”; see Boeckh, <hi
                        rend="italic">Corp. Inscr. Gr.,</hi> No. 1570), but most commonly used in
                    ecclesiastical language to denote the aggregate of those persons who exercise
                    authority within the Christian Church,—the patriarchate, episcopate, or entire
                    threefold order of the clergy. The word, which does not occur in any classical
                    Greek writer, owes its present extensive currency to the celebrated writings of
                    Dionysius Pseudo-Areopagita, which, originating probably in the age of
                    Justinian, exerted during the 9th and following centuries so remarkable an
                    influence on the current of theological speculation, both in the Eastern and in
                    the Western Church. Of these the most important are the two which treat of the
                    celestial and of the ecclesiastical hierarchy respectively. Defining hierarchy
                    as the “function which comprises all sacred things,” or, more fully, as “a
                    sacred order and science and activity, assimilated as far as possible to the
                    godlike, and elevated to the imitation of God proportionately to the Divine
                    illuminations conceded to it,” the author proceeds to enumerate the nine orders
                    of the heavenly host, which are subdivided again into hierarchies or triads, in
                    descending order, thus :—Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones; Dominations, Virtues,
                    Powers; Principalities, Archangels, Angels. These all exist for the common
                    object of raising men through ascending stages of purification and illumination
                    to perfection. The ecclesiastical or earthly hierarchy is the counterpart of the
                    other. In it the first or highest triad is formed by baptism, communion, and
                    chrism. The second triad consists of the three orders of the ministry, bishop or
                    hierarch, priest, and minister or deacon <hi rend="italic">(ιεράρχης,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ιεpευς,</hi><hi rend="italic">λειτουργός)</hi>; this is the
                    earliest known instance in which the title hierarch is applied to a bishop. The
                    third or lowest triad is made up of monks, “initiated,” and catechumens. To
                    Dionysius may be traced, through Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic writers of
                    the intervening period, the definition of the term usually given by Roman
                    Catholic writers—“ccetus seu ordo praesidum et sacrorum ministrorum ad regendam
                    ecclesiam gignendamque in hominibus sanctitatem divinitus institutus”<note

                    authority of the sixth canon of the twenty-third session of the council of
                    Trent, in which anathema is pronounced upon all who deny the existence within
                    the Catholic Church of a hierarchy instituted by divine appointment, and
                    consisting of bishops, priests, and ministers.<note anchored="true"

                            esse hierarchiam divina ordinatione institutam, quae constat ex

                    definition, however, relates only to what is called the “hierarchy of orders,”
                    to which hierarchy, it must further be borne in mind, belong the lesser orders
                    of sub-deacon, acolyth, exorcist, lector, and doorkeeper (to which that of
                    singer is sometimes added); though these are to be regarded as institutions of
                    ecclesiastical authority only, while the other three are of divine right, and
                    therefore preeminently “holy.” The “hierarchy of jurisdiction,” as distinguished
                    from that of “orders,” is represented by the Roman pontiff alone, who enjoys
                    supreme authority over all bishops, even when these are assembled iu general
                    council. This supreme authority he holds by divine right as the successor of
                    Peter, who received immediately from Christ the primacy of honour and of
                    jurisdiction over the universal church.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Between the pope and the bishops occur the metropolitans or archbishops and the
                    patriarchs; but these intermediate grades are not regarded as essential, and,
                    for the present at least, the rank of patriarch may almost be said to be, in the
                    Roman communion, purely titular. The Greek Church, like the Roman, recognizes a
                    threefold clerical order, distinct <hi rend="italic">jure divinο</hi> from other
                    Christians, of bishops, priests, and deacons. The five patriarchs, of equal
                    dignity, hold the highest rank in the episcopate; and the episcopal body united
                    in a general council represents the church, and infallibly decides, under the
                    guidance of the Holy Ghost, all matters of faith and ecclesiastical life. The
                    Anglican Church acknowledges the superior aud divinely conferred authority of
                    the episcopal order, but, seeking its hierarchical doctrine in the records of a
                    comparatively early period of church history, holds the substantial equality of
                    all bishops, and, while acknowledging the validity, does not maintain the
                    necessary infallibility, of their decisions when met in general council. Thus in
                    form of government the Roman Church may be said to be a hierarchical monarchy,
                    the Greek in some sense a patriarchal oligarchy, and the Anglican an episcopal
                    aristocracy. For historical and other details relating to the growth and
                    development of the hierarchical system the reader is referred to the articles
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Apostle, Archbishop, Bishop, Cardinal, Church, Clergy,

                <p>Some kind of hierarchy, both of orders and of jurisdiction, may, from the nature
                    of the case, be looked for in every religious system that has attained any
                    considerable degree of visibility and external organization. The ancient Jewish
                    and Egyptian hierarchies, for example, find parallels in Parsism and
                    Mahometanism; while in some regions Buddhism has attained a degree of complexity
                    in its ecclesiastical government strikingly suggestive of many features of the
                    present Roman hierarchy.</p>
