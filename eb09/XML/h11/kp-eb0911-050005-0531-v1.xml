                    the first opportunity to the bodies of human beings, hares, dogs, cats, and
                    other mammals, and even insects. On reaching the skin, it rapidly burrows deeply
                    into it, causing a painful itching, followed by a swelling of irritation and
                    size varying with the individuals attacked, and enduring for several days. It is
                    usually at the end of July or in August that these mites make their appearance;
                    and the frequency with which they attach themselves to the lower extremities of
                    people walking in fields at harvest time has given rise to their trivial name.
                    The effect of their subcutaneous presence varies in different people, as above
                    mentioned; in some it assumes so intensely painful an aspect as to originate a
                    disease called autumnal erythrema. Such severity of symptoms is generally found
                    in warmer climates than that of Great Britain; the mite however is plentiful,
                    and causes much annoyance, in Scotland. Extraction with a fine needle, under a
                    magnifying power, is the best way to get rid of the pests; but the application
                    of a solution of carbolic acid, benzine, sulphur ointment, or any other powerful
                    and easily diffused insecticide agent will usually soon destroy them.</p>
                <p>The scientific name of this creature is <hi rend="italic">Acarus {Leptus</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">Tetranychus) autumnal is,</hi> and in France it has
                    received various common names, that of “rouget” being the best known. It has
                    been placed in different genera by modern authors, who have hitherto considered
                    it as a fully developed fonn, of somewhat doubtful affinities. The old
                    naturalist Degeer appears to have suspected its correct status as an imperfect
                        <hi rend="italic">Acarus;</hi> but it has been reserved for the French
                    naturalist, Μ. P. Mégnin, to prove from actual observation the fact that it is
                    only the larva of a well-known mite, <hi rend="italic">Trornbidiurn
                        holosericcum,</hi> a silky bright scarlet species often found in spring an I
                    early summer in gardens and fields. This distinguished biologist has in like
                    manner put beyond doubt the identity of various other members of the <hi
                        rend="italic">A car idea,</hi> hitherto dissociated. In April he found both
                    sexes of the perfect mite, but at the end of May and in June only gravid females
                    occurred. These in June and July deposited their eggs, from which was hatched
                    the creature heretofore known as <hi rend="italic">Acanιs</hi> (or <hi
                        rend="italic">Leptus}</hi><hi rend="italic">autumnalis.</hi> As soon as this
                    has implanted its mandibles into the skin of the individual attacked, its
                    abdomen dilates perceptibly, finally becoming about five times as large as on
                    leaving the <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> though the cephalothorax .∙al limbs
                    remain unchanged. It turns to an octopod nymph, or pupa; and after hibernation,
                    during which the nutritive fluids imbibed, in the parasitic stage are
                    assimilated, the adult stage of a purely phytophagous <hi rend="italic"
                        >Trornbidiurn,</hi> capable of reproduction, is reached.</p>
                <p>There seems every reason to believe that the skin irritation caused in Mexico by
                    a supposed insect, called <hi rend="italic">Thalsahuate</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Tlalsa-huτte</hi> by the Indians, is really produced by this
                    or a closely allied mite. Similar complaints are apparently caused by mites in
                    Brazil, Martinique, Honduras, &amp;c.; and the symptoms are naturally aggravated
                    in such tropical localities.</p>
