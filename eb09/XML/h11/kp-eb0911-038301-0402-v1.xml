                    (1796-1865), long a judge of Nova Scotia, and a popular literary satirist, was
                    born at Windsor, Nova Scotia, in 1796, and received his education there, at
                    King’s College. He was called to the bar in 1820, and took part in the
                    legislature of his native province as a member of the House of Assembly. He
                    distinguished himself as a barrister, and in 1828 was promoted to the bench as a
                    chief-justice of the common pleas. But it is as the brilliant humorist and
                    satirist that he is now remembered; for his labours alike as a barrister and a
                    member of parliament were limited to his own province, and could scarcely beget
                    anything beyond a local reputation. Yet confined as he thus was to so narrow a
                    sphere, a true estimate of its disadvantages is necessary in order to do justice
                    to the vigorous individuality of his writings. He was a native of what was then
                    a small and isolated maritime province, detached from Canada. Its exports
                    consisted chiefly of lumber and the produce of its fisheries; and with those
                    trade was carried on with Great Britain, the West Indies, and the United States.
                    Its entire population at the time when Haliburton was called to the bar,
                    including Indians, African refugees from the States, and the Acadian descendants
                    of the original French population, did not amount to 97,000. The English
                    settlers were largely composed of refugees from the former British colonies,
                    animated by the strong Conservative sympathies of the old colonial loyalists.
                    The French Acadians were Roman Catholics, and their national traditions and
                    religion equally tended to alienate them from the neighbouring republic.</p>
                <p>In politics Haliburton adhered through life to the Conservative party; and the
                    influence of his early associations is traceable in most of his writings. He was
                    still at the bar when he wrote <hi rend="italic">An Historical and Statistical
                        Account of Nova Scotia,</hi> in 2 vols. Canada, it will be remembered, then
                    consisted of Upper and Lower Canada only, and, with the French population of the
                    latter and nearer province, was even stranger to the Nova Scotian than the New
                    England States. The leisure which judicial duties secured admitted of literary
                    relaxations in which Judge Haliburton’s fine sense of the humorous had free
                    play; and in 1835 he contributed anonymously to a local paper a series of
                    letters professedly depicting the peculiarities of the genuine Yankee. These
                    sketches, which abounded in clever pictur-ings of national and individual
                    character, drawn with great satirical humour, were collected in 1837, and
                    published under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Clockmaker, or Sayings and
                        Doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville.</hi> A second series followed in 1838,
                    and a third in 1840. <hi rend="italic">The Attache, or Sam Slick in England</hi>
                    (2 vols. 8vo), was the result of a visit there in 1841. This also was followed
                    up by a second series in 1844. His other works include— <hi rend="italic">The
                        Old Judge, or Life in a Colony; The Letter Dag of the Great Western; Ride
                        and Misrule of the English in America; Traits of American Humour</hi>; and
                        <hi rend="italic">Nature and Human Nature.</hi></p>
                <p>While the judge was thus diligent in such literary recreations, he continued to
                    secure popular esteem in his judicial capacity. In 1840 he was promoted to be a
                    judge of the supreme court; but within two years he resigned his seat on the
                    bench, removed to England, and after a time entered parliament as the
                    representative of Launceston, in the Conservative interest. His literary
                    reputation awoke expectations which were not fulfilled. The bar has rarely
                    proved to be an apt school for training the parliamentary debater, and he was
                    too far advanced in life to adapt himself to the novel requirements of the
                    English House of Commons. The last time he spoke he was listened to with
                    interest on the Canadian defences. But the tenure of his seat for Launceston was
                    brought to an end by the dissolution of the parliament in 1865, and he did not
                    again offer himself to the constituency. His death followed in the month of
                    August of the same year, at Gordon House, Isleworth, when he was in his
                    seventieth year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Judge
                            Haliburton was descended from the branch of the Newmains and Merton
                            family which figures in the genealogical memorials of the Haliburtons in
                            their relation to that of Sir Walter Scott, whose paternal grandmother
                            was Barbara Haliburton. The note of all the families of the name drawn
                            up by the father of the poet and novelist was prepared in reply to
                            inquiries of the father of Judge Haliburton, with a view to the
                            establishment of his claims to certain family property. Of a younger
                            branch of the Newmains family that went to Jamaica, one member removed
                            to Massachusetts. A son of his, the father of the judge, migrated to
                            Nova Scotia, and there, in 1790, he revived old hereditary rights, and
                            reclaimed relationship with the original Scottish stock.</p></note></p>
