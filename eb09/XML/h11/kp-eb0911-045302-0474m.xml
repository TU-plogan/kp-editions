                    (originally <hi rend="italic">Habichtsburg,</hi> that is, Hawkscastle), an old
                    German family which has given sovereigns to Germany, Spain, and Austria, takes
                    its name from the old Swiss castle of Habsburg, now in ruins, situated on the
                    river Aar in the canton of Aargau. The first mention of the countship of
                    Habsburg is in a document of 1099, where the name Werner, count of Habsburg,
                    occurs in connexion with the consecration of the monastery of M ’ ari as
                    confirming the grants of the pious foundations made by his ancestors. This
                    Werner of Habsburg was a nephew of Werner, bishop of Strasburg, who built the
                    castle of Habsburg about the year 1020. The succession of the family cannot be
                    traced between this period and the time of the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, but
                    in a document whose date is 30th May 1153, Werner II. and his son Albert the
                    Rich are mentioned as counts of Habsburg. This Albert was by Frederick created
                    landgrave of Upper Alsace, and received the countship of the district of Zürich
                    and the protectorship of the monasteries of Seckingen and Murbach; and on the
                    extinction of the house of Zähringen he also succeeded to a considerable portion
                    of their territories. Albert died in 1199, and was succeeded by his son Rudolf
                    the Old, who, as a reward for placing a large sum of money at the disposal of
                    Frederick II., received from him the countship of Aargau. He held an influential
                    position among the Swabian nobility, and so increased his possessions that they
                    included the territories of the bishops of Strasburg, Constance, Basel, Coire,
                    Ghent, and Lausanne, and of the abbot of St Gall, in addition to which he also
                    obtained the countship of Frickgau. Rudolf left behind him two sons, Albert the
                    Wise and Rudolf II., who shared the possessions between them, and founded
                    respectively the lines of Hapsburg-Hapsburg and Hapsburg Laufenburg,—Albert,
                    besides the castle of Hapsburg, holding the lands in Aargau and Alsace, and
                    Rudolf the countships of Klettgau, Rheinfeld, and Laufenburg, and the
                    possessions in Breisgau. The Laufenburg line also divided into two branches, the
                    former of which became extinct in 1408 and the latter in 1415. Laufenburg
                    thereupon fell to Austria, and Klettgau, through the marriage of the female
                    heiress of the line, to the counts Sutz, from whom it passed by marriage in 1687
                    to the house of Schwarzenberg. Albert the Wise of Hapsburg-Hapsburg was married
                    to the countess of Kyburg, who was descended from the dukes of Zähringen, and
                    related to the emperor Frederick II. From this union there was born on the 1st
                    May 1218, Rudolf, the founder of the royal dynasty of Hapsburg. He was elected
                    king of Germany in 1273, and after the defeat and death of Ottocar, king of
                    Bohemia, in 1278, at Marchfeld on the Danube, he annexed to his possessions
                    Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola. On the death of Rudolf in 1291 Adolf,
                    count of Nassau, was elected his successor to the German crown, but although on
                    the death of Adolf it again reverted to the Hapsbuιg line in the person of
                    Albert I., it passed on his death to Henry, count of Luxembourg, and with the
                    exception of the doubtful period when Frederick, eldest son of Albert, and
                    Lewis, duke of Bavaria, divided the suffrages of the electors and were crowned,
                    the one at Bonn and the other at Aix-la-Chapelle, the Hapsburg line remained
                    excluded from its possession till the time of Albert II., who succeeded
                    Sigismund as king of Bohemia and Hungary in 1437, and was chosen emperor of the
                    Romans in 1438. The greater part of the original lands of the house were
                    gradually lost by the victories of the Eidgenossen, who finally in 1474 obtained
                    Aargau, in which the castle of Habsburg was situated. Philip, son of Maximilian
                    I. and of Donna Juana of Spain, ascended the Spanish throne in May 1506, and on
                    his death in September of the same year, he was succeeded by Charles I., who was
                    chosen emperor in 1519, and was thenceforth known as Charles V. In 1521 Charles
                    granted his Austrian possessions to Ferdinand I., who became the head of the
                    Austrian dynasty. The Spanish branch became extinct in 1700 with the death of
                    King Charles II., and the male line of the Austrian branch became extinct with
                    the death of the emperor Charles VI. in 1740; but the Austrian house was
                    continued in the female line by Maria Theresa, who by her marriage with Francis
                    of Lotharingia, chosen emperor in 1745, founded <pb break="no"
