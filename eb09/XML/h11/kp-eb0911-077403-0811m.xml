                    (1696-1743), the “Narcissus,” “Sporus,” and “Lord Fanny” of Pope’s satire, a
                    nobleman of political and social distinction in the reign of George II., was son
                    of John first earl of Bristol, and was born on October 13,1696. Educated and
                    trained for public life at Westminster and Clare Hall, Cambridge, he became a

                    (afterwards George II. and Queen Caroline), to which Pope, Gay, Arbuthnot,
                    Chesterfield, and other wits resorted, and which was celebrated for the beauty
                    and accomplishments of its ladies, such as Miss Bellenden (afterwards duchess of
                    Argyle), Miss Howe, Miss Lepell, and Mrs Howard, whose names will live for ever
                    in the poetry of Pope, Gay, and Swift, and in the lively memoirs and
                    correspondence of that brilliant circle. Hervey was married to Miss Lepell in
                    1720. Having entered the House of Commons as member for Bury (1725)’, he in 1730
                    received the appointment of vice-chamberlain to the king; in 1733 Sir Robert
                    Walpole called him up to the House of Lords, where he proved a frequent and
                    effective speaker; and in 1740 he succeeded Lord Godolphin as lord privy seal,
                    which office he held until the Walpole administration was driven from power in
                    1742. Notwithstanding miserable health he continued to take an active part in
                    politics until his death, which occurred on August 8, 1743. He was survived by
                    four sons, three of whom became successively earls of Bristol. Destitute of any
                    commanding talents or solid principle, a sceptic in religion and a profligate in
                    morals, Lord Hervey was yet far above the intellectual rank assigned him by his
                    merciless satirist, Pope. He wrote and spoke vigorously on public questions, was
                    studious and laborious, a fair scholar, and a writer of pleasing occasional
                    verses. The origin of the hostility which led to the allusion in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> (iv. 104) in 1728, and afterwards to the attacks in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Prologue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epilogue to the
                    Satires,</hi> remains obscure. “It would be now idle,” as Mr Croker remarks, “to
                    seek for a cause of quarrel which the parties were, a hundred years ago, unable
                    or unwilling to explain; but may it not be sufficiently accounted for by the
                    jealousies almost inevitable between persons of such similar and therefore
                    discordant tastes and tempers, living together in a circle of tittle-tattle,
                    scandal, and pasquinades 1” Political differences had probably something to do
                    with it, Lord Hervey and Lady ^Iary Wortley Montague (who shared with him the
                    poet’s enmity) having at the accession of George II. adhered to Walpole, while
                    Pope and his brother wits were chiefly associated with the opposition. Lord
                    Hervey left behind him <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Peigη of George the
                    Second, from his Accession to the Death of Queen Caroline,</hi> which were not
                    published until 1848, when they appeared in two volumes, edited, with a
                    biographical notice, by Mr Croker. The work throws much light on the interior of
                    the court— its coarseness, dulness, and immorality; but it is as degrading to
                    the author as it is to the English monarchy, for Lord Hervey appears rather in
                    the light of a court parasite and malignant gossip than in that of a fair
                    historian or an English gentleman.</p>
                <p>. HERZEGOVINA, an Illyrian province, ethnographically belonging to the
                    Serbo-Croatian nationality, under the titular dominion of the Turkish sultan,
                    but since 1878 administered by Austria-Hungary. The Turks included it in the
                    vilayet of Bosnia. It is bounded N. and E. by Bosnia, S. by Montenegro, and W.
                    by Dalmatia, only touching the Adriatic by the narrow enclaves of Klek and
                    Suttorina. The province extends about 117 miles in a south-east direction
                    between 17° 10' and 20 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> 15' E. long. By the treaty
                    of Berlin the Herzegovinian districts of Niksich and Dormitor have been placed
                    under the government of the prince of Montenegro.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The Austrians have not yet (1879) had time to
                    complete trustworthy statistics as to the population and resources of the
                    province, and those published in the days of Turkish administration must be
                    received with great reserve. The best statistical accounts of Herzegovina are
                    those collected for the Austrian Government by the staffofficers Majors
                    Roskiewicz and Thoemmel, and their discrepancy is the best proof of the
                    difficulties which have hitherto prevented an exact calculation.</p>
                <p>According to Roskiewicz the population of Herzegovina amounted in 1868 to 230,000
                    souls. Thoemmel (in 1867) gives it as 207,970, of whom 101,348 were Pravoslavs
                    or adherents of the Orthodox Greek Church, 56,000 Mahometans, 49,217 Roman
                    Catholics, 1340 Gipsies, and 65 Jews. Dr Blau (late Prussian consul-general at
                    Seraievo) fixes the Herzegovinian population in 1872 approximately at 230,000,
                    viz., 130,000 of the Orthodox Greek Church, 55,000 Mussulmans, 42,000 Roman
                    Catholics, 2500 Gipsies, and 500 Jews. Klaich, however, the most recent Slavonic
                    authority on the province (1878), reduces the total population to 185,421.
                    During the troubles that ensued on the insurrection of 1875, about two-thirds of
                    the Christian population fled beyond the Dalmatian and Montenegrin border, and
                    the fearful mortality among these refugees has largely diminished the
                    Herzegovinian population during the last three years.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the Gipsies, the Jews, and a small sprinkling of Osmanli
                    officials, the whole population is Slavonic, the Mahometans being for the most
                    part renegade descendants of the feudal nobility that had formed itself here
                    before the Turkish conquest. Much of the old Slavonic customs and family life
                    still holds among the Herzegovinian Mussulmans, and here as in Bosnia polygamy
                    is unknown. The Herzegovinians are tall, broad, and darker, and of greater
                    personal bravery than the Bosnians; they are brachycephalic. In frame as well as
                    character they approach very nearly to the Monténégrin type, and in the mountain
                    districts they are divided, like the Montenegrins and Albanians, into clans or
                    nahias, whose loyalty is reserved for their own waiwodes or military chiefs.
                    Their temperament is pre-eminently poetic, in so much that the recent
                    insurrection has already given rise to many epic lays, which are recited to the
                    sound of the guzla or Serbian lyre by the national minstrels. The Serbo-Croatian
                    language is spoken in its purest form in Herzegovina, and the Narenta valley has
                    been called the Serbian Vai d’Arno. The Orthodox Greek population is chiefly
                    settled in the district east of the Narenta; to the west of that river the
                    population is mostly Roman Catholic, and the Mahometans inhabit the larger
                    towns. According to the <hi rend="italic">Schematismus</hi> of the Franciscan P.
                    Bakula, the population of the capital Mostar amounted in 1873 to 29,116, of whom
                    20,306 were Mahometans, 5008 Greeks, and 2821 Roman Catholics. Of the other
                    towns, Ljubuski has, according to Klaich, a population of about 3000 souls,
                    Stolatz 3500, Focha 10,000, Niksich (now under Montenegro) 4000, and Trebinje
                    3000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural Features.—</hi> Herzegovina, which has been described
                    as the Turkish Switzerland, is divided into a variety of mountain plateaus by
                    the parallel ranges of the Dinaι ’ ic Alps; and the whole country is bisected by
                    the river Narenta, which cleaves its way through the mountains from the Bosnian
                    frontier towards the Adriatic. The valley of the Narenta and its tributaries
                    forms the main artery of the province. There is situated the capital Mostar; and
                    a fine highroad, the only avenue of communication between Seraievo (Bosna Serai)
                    ànd the Adriatic, follows the river bank from the Dalmatian frontier to the
                    Bosnian. The “polyes” or mountain plateaus are the most characteristic feature
                    of the country. The smaller towns and villages group themselves on their level
                    and comparatively fertile surface, and the districts or cantons thus formed are
                    walled round by a natural rampart of white limestone mountains. These “polyes”
                    may be described as oases in what is otherwise a desert expanse of mountains.
                    The surface of some, as <pb break="no"

                    in spring forms a lake; others are watered by streams which disappear in
                    swallow-holes of the rock, and make their way by underground channels either to
                    the sea or the Narenta. The most conspicuous example of these is the
                    Trebinstica, which disappears in two swallow-holes in Popovopolje, and after
                    making its way by a subterranean passage through a range of mountains, wells up
                    in the mighty source of Ombla near Ragusa, and hurries in undiminished volume to
                    the Adriatic. The climate of Herzegovina is cold in winter and oppressively hot
                    (maximum 100° Fahr, in shade) in summer. The scirocco is a prevalent wind, as
                    well as the bora, the fearful north-north-easter of Illyria, which, sweeping
                    down the lateral valleys of the Dinaric Alps, overwhelms everything in its path.
                    The snow-fall is slight, and, except on a few of the loftier peaks, the snow
                    soon melts. In the valleys, as that of the Narenta, the flora approaches that of
                    Dalmatia and Southern Italy, and olives, mulberries, figs, melons, pomegranates,
                    grapes, rice, and maize flourish. The Dinaric Alps, which stretch across the
                    province from N.W. to S.E., are as a rule barer and loftier than those of Bosnh.
                    To the west of the Narenta, indeed, their flanks are in places covered with a
                    forest growth of beech and pine, but north-east of that river they present for
                    the most part a scene of lunar desolation. They are of the Tertiary formation
                    common to the Mediterranean geological zone, but their limestone has a more
                    dolomitic character than that of the Bosnian ranges. The group of mountains in
                    the north-west bend of the Narenta, the Krabac, Liρeta, and Porim Planinas,
                    attain altitudes varying from 4000 to 5000 feet; the dolomitic peaks of Orobac,
                    Samotica, and Veliki Cap rise over 6000; Orien on the Dalmatian-Montenegrin
                    frontier 6300; and Mount Dormitor, in the tract of Herzegovina now ceded to
                    Montenegro, reaches a height of 8500 feet. The river Narenta is navigable for
                    small steamers as far as Metkovitch, the Dalmatian frontier station, and for <hi
                    rend="italic">trabaccol·i</hi> as far as Chaplina beyond Gabella, but the narrow
                    and rocky bed of the stream beyond this point makes it doubtful whether the
                    navigation can ever be extended as far as Mostar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Produce and Industries.—</hi> In mineral wealth Herzegovina
                    cannot compete with Bosnia. Lignite exists in considerable abundance in the
                    Narenta valley near Mostar, at Konjica, and at Stolac. Mineral springs occur
                    near Ljubuska; asphalt towards Metkovitch and Drazcvo on the Dalmatian frontier.
                    Rice is cultivated in the Trebisat valley and about Ljubuska. Mulberries are
                    cultivated in the Narenta valley for silkworms, which were introduced here by
                    the famous vizier Alt Pasha, but the culture is at present small. The wine of
                    Konjica and Mostar resembles Dalmatian, and might be excellent, and the Trebinje
                    tobacco is celebrated. Previous to the insurrection the chief wealth of the
                    inhabitants consisted in cattle. Roskiewicz estimates the numbers as 100,000
                    horned cattle, 1,200,000 sheep and goats, and 100,000 swine; but there has been
                    a terrible decrease during the three years of anarchy. Before the insurrection
                    the annual value of the exports of the province, consisting principally of
                    sheep’s wool, hides, wax, wine, and tobacco, amounted to about 18,170,000
                    piastres (£163,530). The imports, principally cloth and woollen goods, were
                    estimated at 17,500,000 piastres (£157,500).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The old Serbian zupa of Chelm or Zachlumje was
                    incorporated in the banat of Bosnia by the ban Stephen in 1326. Afterwards
                    exchanged for Primorje with the king of Hungary, it was reannexed by the ban
                    Stephen Tvartko, afterwards first king of Bosnia, who granted it as a fief to
                    his distinguished general Vlatko Hranich. Vlatko’s grandson, known as Stephen
                    Cosaccia from his birthplace Cosac, took advantage of the weakness of King
                    Tvartko III. of Bosnia to transfer the immediate suzerainty of his county to the
                    emperor Frederick IV., who in 1440 created him duke, or, as his Slavonic
                    subject, borrowing the German word, expressed it, <hi rend="italic">Her· zegα,
                    of</hi> St Sava. This and the further title of keeper of St Sava’s sepulchre he
                    derived from the tomb of the patron saint of Serbia in his monastery of
                    Milesevo. From this time the Slav population of Illyria begins to know the
                    dominions of Cosaecia as the “Herzegovina” or duchy, a general term which
                    embraced, besides the former county of Chelm, the two old Serbian zupas of
                    Tribunja and Primorje, also governed by the “Herzega.” The original Herzegovina
                    thus extended from the sea-coast of Dalmatia to the confines of Bascia. The duke
                    was prevailed on at the parliament of Konjica to recognize the suzerainty of the
                    Bosnian king; he fixed his residence at Mostar, which he greatly enlarged, and
                    which has since remained the capital of Herzegovina. The shrewd policy of
                    Stephen Cosaccia, which offered an asylum for the Bogomiles or Puritans of
                    Bosnia, hounded from their homes by the bigotry of a priest-ridden king, was
                    greatly instrumental in warding off for a while from the duchy the blow that
                    overwhelmed Bosnia. The duke managed with Bogomilian help to defend Herzegovina
                    with some success; and though in 1464 the country was overrun and rendered
                    tributary by the sultan’s hordes, it was not till 1483, twenty years after the
                    final conquest and extinction of the Bosnian kingdom, that the Turkish Beglerbeg
                    succeeded in dispossessing Stephen Cosaccia’s son and successor Duke Vladislav.
                    The whole country was now incorporated in the Sandjakate of Bosnia. At different
                    times the Venetians succeeded in recovering for Christendom parts of
                    Herzegovina, and by the peace of Carlowitz in 1699 and that of Passarowitz in
                    1718 Primorje or the Herzegovinian coast-land, Castelnuovo, and Bisano were
                    finally merged in Venetian Dalmatia, and have thus descended to the Austrians.
                    The only remaining strips of Herzegovinian seacoast, the narrow enclaves of Klek
                    and Suttorina, were left to the Turks by Bagusan dread of Venetian contact,
                    supported by the good offices of England. The history of Herzegovina under the
                    Turks is to a great extent a blank: the viziers of Herzegovina who resided at
                    Mostar imitated by their quasi-independence of their Bosnian superiors the
                    defiant attitude adopted by the duke of St Sava to his Bosnian suzerain.
                    Feudalism under a Mahometan guise continued to survive here. The spahis, begs,
                    or agas were merely mediaeval lords who had apostatized to Islam. They kept
                    their ancestral castles, their banners,, their mediaeval title deeds and patents
                    of nobility. They exacted feudal service from their serfs and retainers. They
                    indulged in the mediaeval passion for hawking. One of these Mahometan nobles,
                    Ali, aga of Stolac, did such good service for Sultan Mahmoud in his struggle
                    with the Bosnian magnates that he was made vizier of Herzegovina, which was
                    freed for a while from dependence on the Bosnian government. The reforms of
                    Sultan Mahmoud did not by any means remove the grievances of the rayah
                    population of Herzegovina. The serfs had now to satisfy the extortion of
                    imperial tax-farmers and excisemen as well as the demands of their feudal lords.
                    The begs and agas continued to exact their forced labour and a third of the
                    produce; the central Government levied a tithe which at the date of the outbreak
                    had become an eighth. Three kinds of cattle tax, the tax for exemption from
                    military service levied on every infant in arms, forced labour on the roads,
                    forced loan of horses, a heavy excise on grapes and tobacco, and a variety of
                    lesser taxes combined to burden the Christian peasants; but what was more
                    galling than the amount, was the manner in which these various taxes were
                    extorted,—the iniquitous assessment of tax-farmers and excisemen, and the bratal
                    licence of the zaptiehs who were quartered on recalcitrant villagers. Meanwhile
                    the profligate expenditure of the imperial voluptuary at Stamboul and the
                    peculation of his ministers hurried on the crisis. The public bankruptcy of
                    Turkey put the last straw on the rayah’s back. On July 1, 1875, the villagers of
                    Nevesinje, which gives its name to a mountain plateau east of Mostar, unable to
                    bear the extortion of the tax-farmers, and goaded to madness by the outrages
                    inflicted on them by the zaptiehs and bashi-bazouks, rose against their
                    oppressors. The insurrection rapidly spread through Herzegovina and thence to
                    Bosnia. The Herzegovinians under their leaders Peko Pavlovich, Socica,
                    Ljubibratich, and others held out for a year against all the forces that Turkey
                    could despatch against them, and in two struggles in the gorge of Muratovizza
                    alone the Turks lost over 2000 men. In July 1876 the principalities joined in
                    the straggle; the Busso-Turkish war followed, and by the treaty of Berlin the
                    government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was confided to Austria-Hungary, while
                    Niksich and the country about Mount Dormitor were detached from Herzegovina and
                    annexed to Montenegro. On July 31, 1878, the Austrian troops crossed the
                    Herzegovinian frontier, and the news roused the Mahometan fanatics to a
                    desperate effort. On August 2d the Mahometans of Mostar, imitating the example
                    of Seraievo, and believing themselves betrayed by the Turkish Government, rose
                    <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse,</hi> murdered the Turkish
                    governor and officials, and proclaimed a ulema head of a provisional government.
                    The Austrians, however, pressed forward, and crushing some ineffectual efforts
                    at resistance entered Mostar on the 5th of August. By the 29th of September the
                    reduction of Herzegovina was completed by the capture of the hillfort of Klobuk.
                    Since the completion of the occupation, the government of the province has been
                    under the military governor at Seraievo, controlled by the foreign office at
                    Vienna. The sultan still remains sovereign <hi rend="italic">de jure,</hi> nor
