                    with his mother to Tübingen, where he frequented the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schola</hi><hi rend="italic">anαtolica.</hi> In 1818 he was sent to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Klos</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">erschule</hi> at Blaubeuren, and two
                    years later he entered the seminary of Tübingen. After having completed, in
                    1824, his philosophical and theological studies and taken his degree, he acted
                    for two years as private tutor, and assumed, in January 1827, the editorship of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Morgenblatt</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> In the following
                    month he married, and led a happy and quiet life, which was ended by a fatal
                    illness on 18th November of the same year. Hauffs literary activity is comprised
                    within the short space of about two years. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Märchenalmanach</hi> for 1826 he published the <hi rend="italic">Fairy
                    Tales</hi> he used to relate to his pupils during his tutorship. They were
                    distinguished by an originality of conception, a playful though somewhat
                    fantastic humour, and an elegance of style, not usually met with in similar
                    productions. Those fanciful tales founded his fame as a narrator, and form,
                    together with his subsequent novels, several of which belong to the same
                    species, the basis of his permanent reputation as an author. His next
                    publication, <hi rend="italic">Mittheilungen aus den Memoiren des Satans,</hi>
                    “Extracts from the Memoirs of Satan” (2 vols. 1826-27), was of a fragmentary
                    kind, but gave additional proof of his talent as a humorist. In 1826 he wrote a
                    novel— <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Mann im Monde,</hi> “The Man
                    in the Moon”—with the intention of satirizing and parodying the sentimental
                    sensualism of Clauren; but in the course of composition the projected parody
                    became a regular imitation, and, as he issued the novel under the name of that
                    romancer, the latter brought an action against him for the abuse of his name,
                    and gained his lawsuit. Hauff succeeded, however, in morally annihilating that
                    maudlin narrator by his witty <hi rend="italic">Controverspredigt,</hi>
                    “Controversial Sermon” (1826). Animated by the genius of Sir Walter Scott, Hauff
                    wrote a historical romance called <hi rend="italic">Lichtenstein</hi> (1826),
                    which illustrated the most interesting period in the history of Würtemberg, and,
                    being one of the first historical German novels, acquired, in spite of its
                    weakness as a literary composition, great popularity throughout Germany. His
                    fanciful work, <hi rend="italic">Phantasien</hi><hi rend="italic">im
                    Bremer</hi><hi rend="italic">Rathsheller</hi> (1827), is pervaded, especially in
                    the first portion of the book, by an exuberant spirit of conviviality, which
                    exercises a cheering effect on the reader; but his most perfect fiction is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bettlerin vom Pont-des-Arts.</hi> Hauff’s works have gone,
                    collectively and separately, through many editions, and some of his shorter
                    poems have become regular “Volkslieder.”</p>
