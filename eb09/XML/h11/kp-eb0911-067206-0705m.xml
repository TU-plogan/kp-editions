                    from her subjugation by the Moors, and to assume a prominent position among the
                    nations of Europe; his mother was Philippa, daughter of John of Gaunt. Prince
                    Henry and his elder brothers, Duarte and Pedro, were sent <pb break="no"

                    important Moorish city of Ceuta, which, after much hard fighting, they succeeded
                    in taking in one day. All the princes distinguished themselves at the siege, but
                    Prince Henry so pre-eminently that, but for his own entreaties, his father would
                    have knighted him in precedence of his brothers. His renown after this became so
                    high that he was invited severally by the pope, the emperor, and the kings of
                    Castile (Juan II.) and England (Henry V.) to take the command of their
                    respective armies. The prince, however, had set his mind on other and larger
                    plans, involving no less than the hope of reaching India by the south point of
                    Africa. To this end he had several encouragements: the geographical position of
                    Portugal was in his favour; the large revenues of the order of Christ, of which
                    he was grand-master, provided him with means; and he had contrived to gather
                    important information from the Moors with regard to the coast of Guinea and the
                    populous nations of the interior of Africa. Accordingly in 1418-19 he took up
                    his abode on the extreme south-western point of Europe, the promontory of
                    Sagres, in Algarve, of which kingdom he was made governor in perpetuity, with
                    the purpose of devoting himself to the study of astronomy and mathematics, and
                    to the direction and encouragement of the expeditions which he proposed to send
                    forth. There he erected an observatory, the first set up in Portugal, and at
                    great expense procured the services of one Mestre Jacome from Majorca, a man
                    very skilful in the art of navigation and in the making of maps and instruments,
                    to instruct the Portuguese officers in those sciences. An account has already
                    been given of his principal explorations in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Geography,</hi> vol. x. p. 180 <hi rend="italic">(jpvj).</hi> At first his
                    efforts seemed to be crowned with little success, and his various expeditions
                    called down upon him much obloquy from the nobles, who complained of such an
                    amount of useless expenditure; but on the prince vituperation fell harmless. The
                    king died in 1433, and the troubles which followed occupied Prince Henry until
                    1440. In the following year Cape Branco was reached, and in 1443 intercourse was
                    established with negro states in Senegal and Gambia. In 1442-3 Henry VI. of
                    England conferred on the prince the riband of the order of the garter. In 1444-5
                    were discovered the river Senegal, Cape Verd, Cape St Anne, Cabo dos Mastos, and
                    the Rio Grande. During the later years of his life Gomez and others made
                    important voyages of discovery in Prince Henry’s service (see vol. x. p. 180).
                    He died November 13, 1460, in his town on Cape St Vincent, and was buried in the
                    church of St Mary in Lagos, but a year later his body was removed to the superb
                    convent of Batalha. His great-nephew, King Dorn Manuel, had a statue of him
                    placed over the centre column of the side gate of the church of Belem. On July
                    24, 1840, a monument was erected to him at Sagres at the instance of the Marquis
                    de Sa da Bandeira.</p>
                <p>The glory attaching to the name of Prince Henry does not rest merely on the
                    achievements effected during his own lifetime, but on the stupendous subsequent
                    results in maritime discovery to which his genius and perseverance had lent the
                    primary inspiration. The sovereigns loyally continued what the prince had begun.
                    The marvellous results effected within a century from the rounding of Cape
                    Boja&lt;lor in 1433 formed one unbroken chain of discovery, which originated in
                    the genius and the efforts of one man. They were the stupendous issue of a great
                    thought and of indomitable perseverance, in spite of twelve years of costly
                    failure and disheartening ridicule. As Mr Major, in his <hi rend="italic">Life
                    of Prince Henry,</hi> has justly said, “Had that failure and that ridicule
                    produced on Prince Henry the effect which they ordinarily produce on other men,
                    it is impossible to say what delays would have occurred before these .mighty
                    events would have been realized; for it must be borne in mind that the ardour,
                    not only of his own sailors, but of surrounding nations, owed its impulse to
                    this pertinacity of purpose</p>
