                    (Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic">Helm</hi>; Italian, <hi rend="italic">Elme,
                    Elmettο</hi>; French, <hi rend="italic">Heaume</hi>; Icelandic, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hjalmr),</hi> is the term used in a general sense to include the
                    various forms of head defences which were either made in solid metal or of metal
                    plates. The form of helmet used among the Assyrians, as shown by the monumental
                    sculptures, was a close-fitting skull-cap, round or conical, sometimes
                    surmounted by a crest rising from the summit of the cone and curving forwards in
                    a semicircular form. The Greek helmet was also in its simplest form a skull-cap,
                    covering the head in front above the level of the eyes, but reaching down to the
                    nape of the neck from ear to ear. Another form had this lower part prolonged and
                    carried round so as to cover all above the shoulders with the exception of a
                    slit in front, partly protected by a nose-piece. Occasionally hinged
                    cheek-pieces were added to the skull-cap, and the upper part of the casque was
                    sometimes prolonged into a conical shape with a crest curving forwards, or
                    surmounted by a ridged prominence on which was fastened a flowing crest of
                    horsehair. The Greek helmets are often represented as highly decorated, and many
                    examples of the different forms and their varieties of decoration occur on the
                    painted vases, the gems, and the coinage. The Etruscan helmet differed but
                    slightly from that of the Greeks. It was more conical in form, and often
                    furnished with horns or wings in place of a crest. The Roman helmet was usually
                    a skull-cap, with or without crest, and often plain and undecorated. The .
                    Gaulish helmet, of which a beautiful specimen was obtained from an Iron Age
                    burial at Berru in Marne in 1872, was of hammered iron, conical in shape,
                    terminating in an ornamental apex, and having a richly decorated border round
                    the lower part. Conical helmets of an earlier character found at Theil and
                    Auxonne have been assigned to the Age of Bronze. A silver helmet of the Early
                    Iron Age, consisting of a skull-cap with a mask for the face fastened together
                    by a hinge, which was found in the Thorsbjerg Moss in South Jutland, is the only
                    specimen known of .the early Teutonic helmet. An Anglo-Saxon helmet of iron,
                    shaped like a skull-cap, and formed of ribs or flat strips of metal, covered
                    with plates of horn, and surmounted with the figure of a boar, was found in a
                    tumulus at Benty Grange in Derbyshire. Such boar-crowned helmets are referred to
                    in the Anglo-Saxon poem of Beowulf. The helmets worn by the Normans and Saxons
                    at the time of the Conquest, as shown in the Bayeux tapestry, were conical in
                    shape with a projecting nasal. The earliest kuown example of a date subsequent
                    to the Norman Conquest is one which was discovered in the church of Faversham,
                    and is now in the Musée d’Artillerie at Paris. It preserves the conical top of
                    the earlier Norman headpiece, but has a barrel-shaped body, covering all the
                    head and face with the exception of a vertical slit partially protected by a
                    projecting nasal, and having transverse apertures on either side for the eyes.
                    This barrel-shape, with flattened instead of conical top, continued in use
                    during the 12th century in England, although the conical cap with the nasal
                    appears on the great seals of the Scottish kings down to the time of Alexander
                    II. The helm of Edward the Black Prince (died 1370), which still hangs over his
                    tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, has the top shaped like a truncated cone and the
                    lower part more oval than barrel-shaped, the aperture for sight taking the form
                    of a transverse slit between the upper and lower parts of the helm. In the lower
                    portion the perforations for breathing are arranged in the form of a crown on
                    both sides. The helm of Henry V. (died 1422), which hangs with his saddle and
                    shield above his tomb in Westminster Abbey, is lower in the crown, more rounded
                    to the shape of the head, and the <hi rend="italic">ocularium</hi> or
                    perforation for sight is protected by the projection of the lower part beyond
                    the line of the upper. The helm of King Henry VI., which was suspended over his
                    tomb in St George’s Chapel, Windsor, has the lower part contracted to the form
                    of the neck and rounded to the shape of the shoulders. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ocularium,</hi> which is wide, is protected by a series of curved bars riveted
                    across it. The helm of Edward IV. (died 1483), which was also suspended in St
                    George’s Chapel, exhibits a still greater shaping to the form of the neck and
                    shoulders; the top is rounder, and has a spike for a crest. In the end of the
                    15th century the great helm was superseded by the smaller head piece with
                    movable vizor and beaver or chinpiece and neck guard, which is properly styled a
                    helmet. Other varieties of headpiece were the bascinet, of a plain oval form
                    pointed at the top and somewhat compressed on the sides, having holes at the
                    bottom for the attachment of the camail or gorget of chain-mail. The bascinet
                    was sometimes worn alone and sometimes under the helm. It was succeeded in the
                    15th century by the salade, a lighter skull-cap with the hinder part projecting,
                    and occasionally a movable vizor. The armet, the burgonet, and the casque are
                    varieties of the lighter form of headpiece, partaking more or less of the
                    skull-cap form, while the morion and the chapelle de fer were distinguished by
                    their flattened brims.</p>
