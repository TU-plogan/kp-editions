                    egg, and during the two stages of their existence before assuming the perfect
                    form, they move freely about, thus unlike the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> &amp;c., whose pupa state,
                    or that preceding the perfection of the insect, is quiescent. When the
                    transformations have been completed, the insect generally possesses four wings.
                    The superior pair, or hemielytra as they are called by authors, are attached to
                    the mesothorax, and are composed of two substances,—the basal portion
                    coriaceous, or resembling leather, and the apical one membranaceous, or
                    resembling thin, transparent parchment. The lower pair are attached to the
                    metathorax, and are entirely membranous and generally transparent, and capable
                    of being folded when the insect is in repose. This segment of the sternum
                    likewise bears on each side, anteriorly, a more or less reniform-shaped orifice,
                    within which lies a sac containing the fluid or matter from which so many of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Heteropterous</hi> portion of the order emit a most
                    disagreeable odour. They also possess in all stages a mouth (rostrum) composed
                    of three or more joints formed for suctorial purposes.</p>
                <p>The order is divided into two sub-orders, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ηemiρtcrα-Ηctcrορtcrα</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hemiρterα-Hοmορterα,</hi> and
                    these again are separated into divisions and subdivisions, tlιe latter being
                    distributed into families which contain the various genera and species. Jn the
                    first sub-order <hi rend="italic">{Hcmiptera-Heterοptera)</hi> there are two
                    divisions, viz., <hi rend="italic">Gymnοcerata</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptοcerata,</hi> and the families comprised under these heads are 69 in
                    number, the following being the generally accepted order in which they are
                    arranged, viz.: <hi rend="italic">Pachycoridce</hi> (in this family the
                    scutellum is so enlarged as to cover the whole of the upper side of the abdomen,
                    both pairs of wings being concealed beneath it when not in flight; in one genus
                    at least the species might be mistaken for some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buprestidae</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> which they resemble in

                    some two or three of the species in South America are also known to live with

                    >Noto-</hi><hi rend="italic">nectidae</hi> (the species pertaining to the last
                    eight families, except the <hi rend="italic">Galgulidce,</hi> live either in or
                    on the water, and the genus <hi rend="italic">Belostoma</hi> contains the
                    largest insect of the order, <hi rend="italic">Belostoma</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grandis,</hi> which measures 3⅛ inches in length by nearly 1⅜ in breadth). In
                    the second sub-order <hi rend="italic">{Hemiptera-Homoptera)</hi> there are
                    three grand divisions, viz., <hi rend="italic">Cicadina, Phytophthircs,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and Anoplura.</hi> The first embraces the families <hi
                    rend="italic">Stridulantidee,Fulgoridw,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tettigometridae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Membracidee,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicadidce∙,</hi> and in these families are to be found perhaps some of the most
                    curious and wonderful forms of insect life. The well known lantern-fly <hi
                    rend="italic">{Fulgora laternaria,</hi> L.) belongs here, and the whole of the
                    stridulating or singing group is also included. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phytophthircs,</hi> or second division, contains three families, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">Psyllidoe, Aphididce,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coccidoe.</hi>
                    None of the insects composing this group are of large size, and many of them are
                    only about one line in length, The first family affects trees and plants, in
                    many instances distorting the leaves and buds; one of its species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhinocola</hi><hi rend="italic">speciosa,</hi> has been recorded
                    by Lichtenstein in the annals of the French Entomological Society for 1872 as
                    puncturing poplar leaves which afterwards attain the size and form of a
                    cucumber. The <hi rend="italic">Psyllidce</hi> differ from the second family in
                    having the power to leap, their third pair of legs being formed for this
                    purpose. The <hi rend="italic">Aphididce</hi> are perhaps best known by the
                    terms “blight,” “green fly,” &amp;c. These are to be found almost always in
                    large companies on nearly every kind of tree, plant, and shrub. They are said to
                    produce the honey dew found upon maple and other trees, although this has been
                    disputed by Dr Hooker in the <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Chronicle</hi> for
                    July 1873. They are furnished with two setiform pipes or tubes, varying
                    considerably in length in the different species, placed one on each side of the
                    abdomen on the fourth segment from the apex, from which certainly is emitted a
                    sweet fluid which the ants are well known to follow them for and consume. This
                    family also contains the great vine-pest known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylloxera</hi><hi rend="italic">vastatrix.</hi> The third family, <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccidcc,</hi> has amongst its members the well-known cochineal
                    insect <hi rend="italic">{Coccus Cacti),</hi> from the female of which when
                    gathered and killed is obtained the drug or dye used in giving the red colours,
                    scarlet and crimson. It is also used for making carmine. The last division to be
                    dealt with is called the <hi rend="italic">Anoplura,</hi> and contains the most
                    degraded forms of the whole order, viz., the lice, the fullest information
                    concerning which may be obtained by consulting the works of Nitzch, Burmeister,
                    Leach, and Denny.</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">IIemiptera</hi> are of very ancient date, remains
                    of some of the fossil forms having been found in the Primary and other
                    formations, the number of these is but few; they are enumerated in a paper on
                    “Fossil Entomology” by Mr H. Goss in vol. xv. of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entomologist’s Monthly Magazine.</hi></p>
                <p>The whole of the group is extremely widely distributed, being found in almost
                    every portion of the globe; and they are very varied both in form and in their
                    modes of life,— man, animals, birds, insects, and plants being subjected to
                    their attacks. On the Continent they have for a long period engaged the
                    attention of naturalists, but in England little was known of the actual number
                    inhabiting these islands until Douglas and Scott in 1865 published their volume
                    of <hi rend="italic">British Ilemiptera-Heteroptera.</hi> In 1859 Dr A. Dohrn
                    published what may be considered to be the first wholeworld catalogue of the
                    order; and, taking it as a basis, for there is no other approximate list, and
                    adding a reasonable amount of new species collected in each year since that
                    time, their number would amount to nearly 10,500 species, 5300 belonging to the
                    heteropterous sectiou and the remainder to the second sub-order. Out of these
                    Europe lays claim to at least 3000, whilst Great Britain is known to possess not
                    fewer than 1000. There is no record of any one of the species being cosmopolitan
                    (except perhaps the house bug, <hi rend="italic">Acanthia lectularia),</hi>
                    although some of the species inhabiting England are also to be met with in China
                    and Japan. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> sc.)</p>
