                    classes in the Dundee grammar school and in the High School and university of
                    Edinburgh he in 1780 joined H.M.S. “Monarch,” of which his uncle Lord Duncan was
                    at that time in command, and in the following year was transferred to the
                    “Foudroyant,” on board of which, during the night engagement with the “Pegase,”
                    he distinguished himself so much that Captain Jervis (afterwards Lord St
                    Vincent) wrote to Admiral Duncan predicting a brilliant future for his nephew.
                    Haldane was afterwards present at the relief of Gibraltar, but at the peace of
                    1783 he finally left the navy, and soon afterwards settled on his estate of
                    Airthrey, near Stirling. The earlier phases of the French Revolution as they
                    occurred attracted his attention and at first excited his deepest sympathy, a
                    sympathy which induced him, at the cost of making many enemies, to avow his
                    8trong disapproval of the war with France. As his bright and oversanguine
                    visions of a new order of things to be ushered in by political change
                    disappeared, he, unlike Wordsworth’s “Solitary,” began to direct his thoughts to
                    religious subjects, and underwent a spiritual change which, while neither sudden
                    nor violent, was decisive and complete. Resolving to devote himself and his
                    means wholly to the advancement of Christianity, his first proposal for that
                    end, made in 1796, was to organize a vast mission to Bengal, of which he was to
                    provide the entire expense; with this view the greater part of his estate was
                    sold, but after every arrangement had been well nigh completed, the East India
                    Company refused to sanction the scheme, which therefore had to be reluctantly
                    abandoned. In December 1797 he joined his brother and some others in the
                    formation of the “Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home”; and in
                    building chapels or “tabernacles” for its congregations, in supporting its
                    missionaries, and in maintaining institutions for the education of young men to
                    carry on its work, he in the course of the twelve years which followed is stated
                    on good authority to have expended upwards of £70,000. In 1816 he visited the
                    Continent, and first at Geneva and afterwards in Montauban (1817) occupied
                    himself in lecturing with surprising success to theological students, among whom
                    were Malan, Monod, and Merle D’Aubigné. Returning to Scotland in 1819, he lived
                    partly on his estate of Auchengray and partly in Edinburgh, and like his brother
                    took an active part, chiefly through the press, in many of the religious
                    controversies of the time. He died on the 12th of December 1842.</p>
