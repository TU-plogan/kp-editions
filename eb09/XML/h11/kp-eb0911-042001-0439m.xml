                    (1730-1803), antiquary and patron of the fine arts, was born in 1730 of a noble
                    but needy Scottish family. Of his early life and education we know nothing
                    beyond the fact that he was equerry to Prince George, afterwards George III.,
                    whose foster-brother he is said to have been; but in his twenty-fifth year he
                    married a young and beautiful heiress, whose fortune placed him in affluence. In
                    the first parliament of George III. Hamilton sat as member for Midhurst; and in
                    1764 he was accredited ambassador to Naples, an office which he retained till
                    1800. On proceeding to his post his attention and interest were at once awakened
                    by the discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and he took up the study of
                    antiquities with ardour. The Porcinari collection of Greek and Etruscan vases,
                    purchased in 1765, was the nucleus of a valuable collection of his own, now for
                    the most part in the British Museum. Engravings and descriptions of the most
                    valuable pieces are given in the famous <hi rend="italic">Antiquités Etrusques,
                    Grecques, et Domaines, tirées du Cabinet de Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamilton,</hi> edited by D’Hancarville, and published at Naples in 1766-67.
                    Hamilton also contributed liberally to the museum at Portici, and gave much
                    attention to the MSS. and other valuable articles rescued from the buried
                    cities; but his efforts were almost nullified by the inertness of the Neapolitan
                    court, which was even suspicious of his zeal. Natural history and science also
                    were not neglected by him. Between 1764 and 1767 Hamilton paid numerous visits
                    to Vesuvius, Etna, and the Lipari Islands, accompanied by a young artist, Pietro
                    Fabris, who made drawings of the noteworthy objects and appearances under
                    Hamilton’s directions. The result of these excursions, first sent as letters to
                    the Royal Society, of which he became a member in 1766, was afterwards expanded
                    into two works,— <hi rend="italic">Observations upon Mount Vesuvius, Mount Etna,
                    and other Volcanoes of the Two Sicilies,</hi> published at London in 1772, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Campi Phlegraei,</hi> a collection of plates illustrating the
                    volcanic phenomena, accompanied by concise descriptions in English and French,
                    published at Naples in 1776-77. A <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the
                    latter described the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1779. Hamilton’s daughter
                    died in 1775, and his first wife in 1782. In 1772 he was made K.C.B., and in
                    1791 privy councillor. His continued interest in art and antiquity is manifested
                    by his contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of
                    the Royal Society from 1767 <pb break="no"

                    >Arch&lt;xologia</hi> in 1777, as well as by his generosity to artists and
                    antiquaries, such as Morghen, Winckelmann, and Piaggi. Recalled in 1800, he died
                    April 6, 1803.</p>
                <p>Sir William Hamilton’s second wife, Emma Lyon or Harte, whose name is so
                    notoriously associated with that of Nelson, was born of very humble parents at
                    Preston in Lancashire, about April 26, 1764. Her youth was spent in domestic
                    service, and it was first as attendant on a lady of fashion that she learned to
                    develop her talent for singing and mimicry. Having lost this situation she
                    became waitress in a tavern frequented by actors, and soon entered upon a gay
                    and dissolute career. Her beauty attracted among others the painter Romney, who
                    depicted her in no fewer than twenty-three of his works. Sir William Hamilton
                    married her in 1791; and, going with him the same year to Naples, she speedily
                    acquired an ascendency over the mind cf the queen, which at the instigation of
                    Nelson she used for the advantage of the British fleet. On the death of Sir
                    William she lived in a house at Merton Place, provided for her by Nelson, but on
                    his death in 1805 she soon squandered the modest fortune left her by her
                    husband, and after being imprisoned for debt, retired with Nelson’s daughter
                    Horatia to Calais, where she died, January 16,1815. Her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> appeared in the year of her death.</p>
