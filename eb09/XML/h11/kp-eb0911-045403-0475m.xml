                    Harrar-Gay,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ararge,</hi> a city of north-eastern
                    Africa, in the country of the Gallas, at one time the capital of the province of
                    Hadiyah in the Zayla empire, for a long period a small independent state under
                    an emir of its own, and since 1876 subject to the Egyptian crown. The Somali
                    call it Adari and the Gallas Adaray. According to Burton it stands in 9° 20' N.
                    lat. and 42° 17' E. long, but the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin de</hi><hi

                    the latitude 9° 26' and the longitude 42° 6'. The height above the sea is
                    according to Burton 5500 feet, and according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bulletin</hi> 5580. A stone wall, pierced by five gates and flanked by 24
                    towers, encloses the city, which occupies an area of 128 acres on the irregular
                    slope of a hill, and comprises 9560 houses and 346 huts, arranged in narrow
                    streets that run up and down hill. There are five mosques within the walls, but
                    only one, the <hi rend="italic">jami</hi> (or cathedral, so to speak), is a
                    building of considerable dimensions. The palace of the emir is a mere shed,
                    long, single-storied, and windowless. Among the chapels to Mahometan saints it
                    is enough to mention that of Sheikh Umar Abadir El Bakai, the patron of the
                    city. Harar has long been the seat of a considerable commerce, though before the
                    Egyptian conquests the merchants had to submit to the exorbitant exactions of
                    their Galla neighbours, who had command of all the caravan routes. Slaves,
                    ivory, coffee, tobacco, safflower, cotton cloths, mules, holcus, wheat, glue,
                    honey, and gums are mentioned by Burton among their principal articles of trade,
                    in return for which they brought back a great variety of wares for local
                    consumption. The Harar coffee especially has a high repute, and the tobacco also
                    is good. The kât or gât <hi rend="italic">(Catha</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >edulis</hi> of Forskal), the leaves of which are a favourite stimulant or
                    narcotic in north-eastern Africa, grows abundantly in the neighbourhood; and the
                    inhabitants often sit together reading the Koran and enjoying the drug for ten
                    or eleven hours at a time. The rainy season at Harar begins about the 15th of
                    March, and lasts for six months, the heaviest rains occurring about June. In the
                    hot season the thermometer reaches 61° Fahr.; in March and April it is not more
                    than 49°. According to Burton the population of the city was only 8000, of whom
                    2500 were Somali and 3000 Arabs; but the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> states
                    the total at 35,000.</p>
                <p>The Harari proper are of a distinct stock from the neighbouring peoples, and
                    speak a special language. A small glossary in Salt’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abyssinia,</hi> and another in the <hi rend="italic">Philological Journal</hi>
                    for 1845, were the only materials available for the investigation of the
                    language previous to the publication of Burton’s sketch in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >First Footsteps in North-Pastern Africa.</hi> By him it is maintained that the
                    Hararese is semi-Semitic or, like the Galla, Dankali, and Somali, “a Semitic
                    graft inserted into an indigenous stock;” and his opinion is followed by Bleek
                    and Lepsius. The older statement, strongly supported by Burton, that the
                    language is fundamentally Semitic, and has a special affinity with Amharic, has
                    in its favour no less authorities than Friedrich Müller <hi rend="italic"
                    >^Sitzungsbericht der</hi><hi rend="italic">Wiener</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Akademie,</hi> Dec. 1863) and F. Praetorius (“Ueber die Sprache von Harar,” in
                    <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenland. Gesell.,</hi> 1869). The
                    Harari are Mahometans of the Shafa’i or Persian sect; and they employ the solar
                    year and the Persian calendar. Monogamy prevails, and the women exercise great
                    social influence; but the moral character of the people is said to be very low.
                    It was in 1521 that Harar became a Mahometan city. Burton, the first European to
                    put foot within its walls, spent ten days there in 1854-55, but it was only
                    under the guise of an Arab that he was able to do so. Mohammed Mokhtar, the
                    Egyptian general, has drawn up a sketch of the history of Harar from the native
                    manuscripts brought with him to Cairo, and in company with Abd’ Allah Faouzi he
                    has published a plan of the town in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> already
                    quoted (Cairo, 1876).</p>
