                    give an outline of one definite theory, and refer the reader to the works quoted
                    at the end. He was not a god worshipped by the pure Doric or Ionic races, but is
                    found in most places where Aeolian, Achaean, and Pelasgic tribes can be traced.
                    If we begin with the rudest races, summed up generally under the title of
                    Pelasgic, we find Hermes often connected with the mysterious Cabiri. These
                    deities, in the accounts we have, vary in number and sex, being sometimes two,
                    sometimes three or four. We may conclude that originally they were a pair, male
                    and female, whom we may compare with Uranus and Gaea, or with Cronus and Rhea.
                    Often the female is doubled, as mother and daughter, resembling the relation of
                    Demeter and Persephone; while the male also is transformed either into twin
                    brothers, or into a father and his son by one of the female deities. Certainly
                    the male deity seems sometimes to be regarded as Hermes, sometimes as Hephaestus
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hephaestus),</hi> while in other places the two are
                    associated. Hermes and Hephaestus are perhaps local varieties of one type, which
                    after having acquired distinct individuality in their separate homes were
                    brought beside each other by subsequent intercourse. Hence we may understand how
                    the epithet &lt;xγγ∈λoς and the office of messenger between gods and men, which
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Pig Veda</hi> belong to Agni, the fire, are in Greek
                    mythology attached to Hermes. This Pelasgic Hermes is an ithyphallic deity, the
                    god of fertility and reproductive power, and bestower of riches in flocks and
                    herds. Corresponding to this religious conception we have in mythology such
                    epithets as ∈pιoυvιoς, <hi rend="italic">ίκάκητα,</hi> &amp;c.; and in the hymn
                    to Aphrodite (written perhaps in Aeolis in the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), Hermes and the Sileni (Latin <hi rend="italic">Silvani)</hi> are
                    the companions of the mountain nymphs. So in Arcadia, one of the chief seats of
                    his worship, where on Cyllene his birthplace was shown, he was by Penelope the
                    father of Pan. Penelope, the “torch-eyed” (Ahrens in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philol.,</hi> 1879, p. 205), is a form of Athene, Odysseus of Hermes; and
                    Hermes and Athene are associated as Hephaestus with Athene in Attica. In the
                    very mixed Attic people, it is not surprising to find the worship of Hermes
                    widespread; it is sometimes said to have been introduced from Samothrace. In
                    Athens Hermes is the god of social life and intercourse in general, of streets
                    and doorways, and of the palaestra. He is worshipped as αγοραίος and <hi
                    rend="italic">πρoπνλαιoς</hi>; and Hermae, pillars supporting a bearded head and
                    furnished with a phallus, stood all over the city. In Boeotia also we find
                    Hermes, especially at Tanagra, where Hermes the champion, and Hermes <hi
                    rend="italic">κρωψόρος,</hi> the averter of diseases, were worshipped. The Doric
                    god Apollo, with the titles Agyieus and Paion, corresponds most closely to these
                    last aspects of Hermes. As god of social intercourse he easily grows into the
                    impersonation of cleverness, and at last into the patron of thieves. If we pass
                    from religion to mythology, where we find all the successive ways of expressing
                    views of nature preserved to us side by side, we find an immense variety of
                    traditions. The most common subject in these tales is the struggle between
                    darkness and light. When it is said that Hermes stole the oxen of Apollo, and
                    after killing two of them nailed their skins on a rock, we have one of a class
                    of myths described at length by Kuhn <hi rend="italic">(Entwickelungsstufen
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Mythologie).</hi> The slain animal is the sun, who is
                    killed every evening; and the hide, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the sky of
                    night, is either hung up on the tree of heaven (as is the Golden Fleece) or
                    fastened with the starheaded nails. Again, when Io, the moon, is watched by the
                    hundred-eyed Argus (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">rajas,</hi> “darkness”), the
                    star-studded sky, Hermes slays Argus with a stone, the same which Cadmus and
                    Jason use, viz., the rising sun. In both cases Hermes is the sun-god as hidden
                    during the night away among the souls of the dead; hence the Chthonian character
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n785/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0785-0750"/> so frequently attached to him. The rod with which
                    he lulls men to sleep is the same sceptre that the ruler of the dead, Yama or
                    Rhadamanthus, Minos or Hades, always bears (Kuhn in <hi rend="italic">Zft.,</hi>
                    iv. p. 123); he is also the sender of dreams; we find him worshipped among the
                    Chthonian deities at Cnidus, and on vases accompanied by the Chthonian dog. We
                    are now able to understand a fact which is perhaps the most interesting point
                    connected with Hermes. Kuhn first pointed out the identity of the Greek
                    'Ep/z·etas with the Sanskrit Sârameyas, and though the connexion has been
                    doubted by various writers, as Mannhardt <hi rend="italic">[Wald-und
                    Feld-Kulte,</hi> ii. pref.) and others, yet no valid objection has ever been
                    offered on etymological grounds (see Benfey in <hi rend="italic">Abhandl. Gott.
                    Ges.,</hi> 1877). Amid the difficulties which still envelop the translation and
                    the mythology of the Vedas, it is, however, even more difficult to discover the
                    original character of the two Sârameyau and their mother Saramâ, than it is to
                    determine the nature of Hermes. The two Sârameyau are mentioned twice in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rig Veda</hi> (vii. 55; x. 14); they are two dogs, are said both
                    to guard the way to the abode of the dead and refuse a passage to the impious,
                    and also to act as the messengers of Yama, carrying away the souls when the time
                    of death has arrived. Saramâ also seems to be regarded as the messenger or the
                    dog of Indra; and Hermes appears regularly as the companion and helper of all
                    the light-heroes on their adventures. One epithet of these dogs is Çarvara,
                    spotted, which in its Greek form Cerberus (Benfey, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vedica,</hi> p. 149) is the name of the dog that guards the gate of the lower
                    world. Now we find in Rome that two <hi rend="italic">lares</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">proestites,</hi> children of Mercury and Egeria, are said to guard
                    dwellings and streets in the form of dogs; and in the German legend the dog who
                    attends the wild huntsman Wuotan, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the sun hidden
                    during the seven winter months, is closely related to the dwarfs or spirits of
                    the dead, and is called by their name (Kuhn, <hi rend="italic">Westf.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sagen,</hi> i. p. 69c). So Hermes, whom we have seen as king of
                    the dead, is as <hi rend="italic">ψυχοπομπός</hi> also the conductor of souls to
                    their future home; we may therefore count the dog (or dogs) as ultimately
                    identical in character with the king of the dead. Sonne (on Charis in Kuhn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Zft.,</hi> x.)has pointed out how these primitive conceptions
                    commonly pass through the stage of animals before reaching that of gods; and in
                    mythology we have the two stages preserved side by side as distinct beings. The
                    Hindu Kubera, lord of the treasures of the lower world, who may be identified
                    with Pluto or with Hermes, is styled “Lord of the hosts of the Sârameyas.”</p>
                <p>In this account there has been no room left for the idea of Hermes as connected
                    with the wind. The sun, after he has set at night, is the same as the sun hidden
                    during the dreary months of winter, who then rides abroad in the tempest. The
                    wind is then easily conceived as his servant and messenger, and is often
                    considered to carry away the souls of the dead (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Harpies).</hi> From his connexion with the wind, Hermes is represented with
                    winged shoes. But with Roscher <hi rend="italic">(Hermes der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wind-Gott)</hi> to see in Hermes simply the wind is to take a
                    narrow view and to ignore the character of primitive Aryan thought.</p>
                <p>In art, besides the Hermae already described, Hermes is in the archaic time
                    represented as a man with pointed beard, wearing a chlamys and the broad hat
                    called petasus; his symbols are the staff <hi rend="italic">(κηρυκeιοv)</hi> and
                    the winged shoes (talaria). The ideal type of Hermes was probably modelled after
                    the statue by Praxiteles in the Heraion at Olympia. This statue, which was
                    recently discovered by the German expedition, represented the god leaning with
                    his left arm on a rock and supporting on it the infant Bacchus. The right arm,
                    which is lost, probably held the caduceus. The form shows a perfect combination
                    of agility and strength.</p>
