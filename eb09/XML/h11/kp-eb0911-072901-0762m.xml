                    are situated. Its greatest length from Ludford by Ludlow to the Doward Hills,
                    near Monmouth, is 38 miles; its greatest breadth from Cradley to Clifford, near
                    Hay, 35. Its area according to the census of 1871 is 532,898 statute acres, or
                    832 square miles. It is divided into 11 hundreds and 221 parishes, and is a
                    bishop’s see, of which the cathedral city is the centre of the county.</p>
                <p>Its chief rivers are the Wye and Lug. The former, rising near the source of the
                    Severn on the summit of Plinlimmon, forms the boundary between Brecon and Radnor
                    ere it enters Herefordshire near Clifford, and, flowing past Hereford, Ross, and
                    Monmouth, falls into the Severn near Chepstow. A striking feature of the Wye is
                    its sinuosity, especially between Hereford and Monmouth. Its never very
                    effectual navigation has been put an end to by railway enterprise, and its
                    salmon fisheries are now so protected by legal enactment that there is no longer
                    a danger of Hereford apprentices being fed on salmon “ad nauseam.” The Lug, a
                    first-rate trout stream, rising in Radnorshire, enters Herefordshire near
                    Presteign, and, passing by Aymestry, Kingsland, and Leominster, joins the Wye
                    below Mordiford Bridge, south-east of Hereford. The Arrow also rises in
                    Radnorshire, and flowing past Kington and Pembridge joins the Lug near Monkland,
                    and the Frome, having its source near Bromyard, joins the same river near
                    Mordiford, while the Ledden runs past Ledbury to join the Severn near
                    Gloucester. All these, as well as the Terne, a boundary line of the north-east
                    of the county, are more or less famous trout streams.</p>
                <p>The soil is generally marl and clay, but in various parts contains calcareous
                    earth in mixed proportions. Westward the soil is tenacious and retentive of
                    water; on the east it is a stiff and often reddish clay. In the south is found a
                    light sandy loam. The subsoil is mostly limestone, in some parts the Old Red
                    Sandstone, and a species of red and white veined marble. Where the soil does not
                    rest on limestone, it is sometimes a silicious gravel, or contains fuller’s
                    earth and yellow ochres. Limestone, quarried at Aymestry and Nash to the
                    north-west of the county, and at Ledbury, Woolhope, and elsewhere, is
                    successfully applied as a manure for arable land and pasture. For the physical
                    history of the county reference must be made to Murchison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siluria,</hi> or Symonds’s <hi rend="italic">Records of the Rocks,</hi> where
                    the upheaval and denudation in the Woolhope valley and over the central dome of
                    Haughwood and similar questions are discussed.</p>

                <p>The climate is variable, owing to the damp and fogs, which moisten the earth and
                    account for its great verdure, as well as to its large proportion of timber, not
                    only in parks and on landed estates, but almost on every hedgerow. In spite,
                    however, of the prevalence of rheumatism, Herefordshire is reckoned healthy,
                    ranks high in the statistics of longevity, and enjoys a comparative immunity
                    from diseases of the respiratory organs.</p>
                <p>The surface of the county is undulated in long ridges, as if by subterranean
                    ripples. Ash and oak coppices and larch plantations clothe its hill-sides and
                    crests. Its lowlands are studded with pear and apple orchards, of such
                    productiveness that Herefordshire sometimes, as well as Kent, is called the
                    garden of England. The apple crop, generally large, is enormous one year out of
                    four. Twenty hogsheads of cider, which is the county beverage, have been made
                    from an acre of orchard, twelve being the ordinary yield. Hops are another
                    staple of the county, the vines of which are planted in rows on ploughed land.
                    As early as Camden’s day a Herefordshire adage coupled Weobley ale with
                    Leominster bread, indicating the county’s capacity to produce fine wheat and
                    barley, as well as hops. On the Worcestershire border above 10,000 acres are
                    taken up in hop-plantations, and about Ledbury the clay lands are noted for
                    wheat and hops.</p>
                <p>Herefordshire is also famous as a breeding county for its cattle of bright red
                    hue, with mottled or white faces and sleek silky coats. The Herefords are
                    stalwart and healthy, and, though not good milkers, put on more meat and fat at
                    an early age, in proportion to food consumed, than almost any other variety.
                    They produce the finest beef, and are more cheaply fed than Devons or Durhams,
                    with which they are advantageously crossed. As a dairy county Hereford does not
                    rank high. Its small, whitefaced, hornless, symmetrical breed of sheep known as
                    ‘ ‘ the Ryelands,” from the district near Ross, where it was bred in most
                    perfection, made the county long famous both for the flavour of its meat and the
                    merino-like texture of its wool. Fuller says of this that it was best known as
                    “Lempster ore,” and the finest in all England. In its original form the breed is
                    extinct, crossing with the Leicester having improved size and stamina at the
                    cost of the fleece, and the chief breeds of sheep on Herefordshire farms at
                    present are Shropshire Downs, Cotswolds, and Radnors, with their crosses.
                    Agricultural horses of good quality are bred in the north, and saddle and coach
                    horses may be met with at the fairs, especially Orleton, Brampton Bryan, and
                    Huntington. Herefordshire has progressed greatly in farming within the last half
                    century. Turnip and green-crop husbandry, with improved rotation, is the general
                    rule, and an average yield of avheat is from 28 to 30 bushels an acre, while
                    about Ross and the “Old Red” districts a yield of 40 bushels is obtained.
                    Breeders’ names from the county are famous at the national cattle shows, and the
                    number, size, and quality of the stock are seen in their supply of the
                    metropolitan and other markets. Prize Herefords are constantly exported to the
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>The county has no manufactures to speak of. Woollen goods have never been a
                    successful staple of trade at Hereford; yams and coarse woollens are made,
                    however, in small quantities at Leominster and Kington. There are iron foundries
                    for agricultural implements at Kington and Ross.</p>

                <p>According to the parliamentary return of 1873 the county was divided among 13,731
                    proprietors, owning a total area of 506,559 acres, with a rental of £924,640. Of
                    the proprietors, 9085 (66 per cent.) held less than 1 acre, and 2478 (18 per
                    cent.) between 1 and 10 acres. The owners of the largest holdings are—J. H.
                    Arkwright, Hampton Court, Leominster, 10,559 acres; A. R. Boughton Knight,
                    Downton Castle, 10,081; R. D. Harley, Brampton Bryan, 9869; Sir George H.

                <p>In Herefordshire inland navigation was represented in the early part of the
                    century by the Gloucester and Newent and Ledbury canal; but this has been bought
                    up for railway purposes, and the canal from Leominster to Woofferton, and thence
                    eastward to Tenbury and Stourport, has also ceased to exist. Hereford is an
                    important railway centre: the Hereford, Ross, and Gloucester line is now
                    amalgamated with the Great Western; the Shrewsbury and Hereford railway
                    traverses the county southward from Wootferton, <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Leominster, to Hereford. The Worcester line from Hereford, <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Malvern, connects the county town with Oxford and London by an
                    alternative route of the Midland and Great Western; and the west of the county
                    is served by the Midland line from Hereford to Brecon, while the Hereford,
                    Abergavenny, and Newport line accommodates the south-west. Branch lines run from
                    Eardisley to Kington and Presteign, from Ross to Monmouth, from Worcester to
                    Bromyard, and from Leominster to Kington.</p>
                <p>The latest statistics of public elementary schools show about 135 Church of
                    England national or parochial schools, 6 board schools, 3 British and Foreign
                    and 3 Roman Catholic schools in the county. Its population, which was 115,489 in
                    1851, had increased in 1871 to 125,370. Herefordshire is represented in
                    parliament by 6 members—3 for the county, 2 for Hereford city, and 1 for the
                    burgh of Leominster. Its towns, besides Hereford, are Ross, Leominster, Ledbury,
                    Kington, and Bromyard; of these, Ross and Leominster are the most considerable,
                    though Kington, from its position on the Welsh border, drives a brisk trade. In
                    Kington, Bromyard, Ledbury, and Ross, and such larger villages as Weobley and
                    Orleton, survive many picturesque timber and plaster houses of the 15th and 16th
                    centuries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The earliest known inhabitants of the county
                    were the Silures, whose stout resistance to the Romans provoked the emperor
                    Claudius to the war of extermination in which Ostorius Scapula took Caractacus
                    prisoner. Coxwall Knoll, Caer Caradoc, and other heights contest the claim to
                    have been the final standpoint against the Romans. Traces of the Danes are found
                    at Wigmore; and in 912 they sailed up the Wye, and carried off from Archenfield
                    the bishop of St David’s, who had to be redeemed with a large ransom. By the
                    Normans the county was held on the tenure of repelling the Welsh, and for
                    centuries the Marches of Wales were a debatable ground for Welsh and English. In
                    the struggle between Maud and Stephen there was fighting in and around
                    Herefordshire. When the barons rose against Henry III. their hostilities
                    affected this county, and it was the success of a i∣lot of the earl of
                    Gloucester, Roger Mortimer, and others to effect ’rince Edward’s escape out of
                    De Montfort’s hands that led to his flight to Wigmore, and the subsequent defeat
                    of the barons at Evesham. In the Wars of the Roses a battle was fought on
                    February 2, 1461, at Mortimer’s Cross, near Kingsland, between Edward, earl of
                    March (afterwards Edward IV. ), and Jasper Tudor and James Butler, earls of
                    Pembroke and Wiltshire, in behalf of Queen Margaret, which resulted in the
                    victory of the Yorkists. The Marches were incorporated in the reign of Henry
                    VIII. In the war between Charles I. and his parliament Herefordshire suffered
                    severely for its loyalty, and Hereford, Goodrich, and Ledbury endured sieges,
                    all but the last ending in disaster to the king’s party.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> The only pre-historic memorial in the county
                    is the cromlech of Arthur’s Stone on the hill above Bredwardine. A line of
                    British entrenchments stretches from the Severn and from Malvern, where an
                    earthwork is still known as the “Herefordshire Beacon,” to Wapley, Croft Ambrey,
                    and Coxwall Knoll, in the north of the county. A branch of the Watling Street
                    road from Uriconium and South Shropshire crosses Herefordshire from Marlow to
                    Longtown. Another Roman road came direct from Gloucester (Glevum) to Ariconium
                    or Weston-under-Penyard, and thence by a short route under Caplar Hill to Magna
                    or Kenchester, but by a longer route to Monmouth, Usk, Abergavenny, and so
                    through Magna to Shrewsbury. Offa’s Dyke, the Saxon ruler’s line of defence
                    against the Welsh, is still traceable at Moorhampton, near Lyonshall, and beyond
                    Kington. Offa’s traditional palace, the scene of his murder of Ethelbert, was at
                    Sutton Walls, a little north of Hereford. The ruins of several Norman castles
                    still exist at Wigmore, Clifford, Goodrich, and Brampton Bryan. Among the most
                    interesting churches of that period are one or two remarkable structures of rare
                    Irish Norman architecture, viz., Kilpeck, Moccas, and the arches of old Shobdon
                    church; besides the Cistercian church of Abbey Dore, and the fine old churches
                    of Ledbury and Leominster <hi rend="smallcaps">Hereford,</hi> the capital city
                    of the above county, is situated on the left bank of the Wye, which is crossed
                    there by a bridge of six arches. The see of Hereford was detached from Lichfield
                    in 673, Putta being its first bishop. The removal of murdered Ethelbert’s body
                    from Marden <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0766-0731"/> to Hereford led to the foundation of a superior
                    church, reconstructed by Bishop Athelstan, and burnt by the Welsh in 1055.
                    Recommenced in 1079 by the first Norman bishop, Robert of Lorraine, it was
                    carried on by Bishop Reynelm, and completed in 1148 by Bishop R. de Betun. The
                    lady chapel, clerestory of the choir, and north transept date between 1226 and
                    1269, while successive additions and reconstructions have extended over 450
                    years. In 1786 the great western tower fell and carried with it the west front
                    and the first bay of the nave, since which date there have been two modern
                    restorations, in 1842 and 1863. The total length of the cathedral outside is 342
                    feet, inside 327 feet 5 inches, the nave being 158 feet 6 inches, the choir from
                    screen to reredos</p>
                <p>75 feet 6 inches, and the lady chapel 93 feet 5 inches. The breadth of the nave
                    (span of roof) is 31 feet 4 inches, the nave and aisles, internally, 73 feet 4
                    inches, and the central transept 146 feet 2 inches. The height of choir is 62
                    feet 6 inches, of nave 64 feet, of lantern 96 feet, of tower to top of the leads
                    140 feet 6 inches, and to the top of the pinnacles 165 feet. The pillars and
                    arches of the nave, the north and south arches of the choir, and the triforium
                    are Norman in their architecture, as is also the font; the lady chapel, the
                    clerestory, and stone vaulting, Early English. The north transept is of the date
                    of Bishop Aquablanca (1245-68), the south-east transept of Late Decorated. As
                    the late Sir Gilbert Scott pointed out at Hereford to the Archaeological
                    Institute, but for the fall of the western tower, the consequent curtailment of
                    the nave, and other solecisms, few cathedrals could offer so complete a field of
                    progressive architectural study from Early Norman to latest Perpendicular. The
                    cathedral can boast some fine monuments, notably St Thomas of Cantilupe’s shrine
                    in the north transept, and Bishop Aqua- 01anca ’ s tomb. The “Mappa Mundi,”
                    compiled in 1300 or thereabouts by a monk of Lincoln, one of the largest and
                    most curious of all the old maps, is preserved in the south choir aisle. The
                    bishop’s palace overlooks the Wye on the south of the cathedral, and to the left
                    of it lies the castle green, the site of the historic castle, which is utterly
                    effaced. One only of the six gates of the old walls is still to be seen, but
                    there are ruins of the Black Friars’ Monastery in Wide· marsh, and a mile out of
                    Hereford on the Brecon Road, the White Cross, erected in 1347 by Bishop
                    Charlton, and restored by Archdeacon Lord Saye and Sele, commemorates the
                    departure of the Black Plague. For its loyalty and sufferings in the civil war
                    Charles I. gave the city its motto “Invictae fidelitatis praemium.” It was
                    incorporated in 1189 by Richard I., and is governed by a municipal council,
                    consisting of a mayor, 6 aidermen, and 18 councillors. It has no manufactures.
                    Its population at the census of 1871 numbered 18,355, or an increase of more
                    than a third in twenty years; its area was 4969 acres. Its public buildings are
                    the shire hall in St Peter’s Street, in the Grecian Doric style, with a statue
                    of Sir George Cornewall Lewis in front of it; the corn-exchange (1858), the
                    Rankin free library and Woolhope Club museum in Broad Street, and the
                    Herefordshire middle-class college. The most noteworthy churches are All Saints
                    and St Peter’s.</p>
