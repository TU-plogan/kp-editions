                    of Baoni and Betwa river; on the W. by the Dhasân river; on the S. by Alipura,
                    Chhatarpur, and Charkhâri states; and on the E. by the Bânda district. It
                    encloses the native states of Sarila, Jigni, and Bihat, besides portions of
                    Charkhâri and Garrauli.</p>
                <p>Hamirpur forms part of the great plain of Bundelkhand, which stretches between
                    the banks of the Jumna and the central Vindhyân plateau. The district is in
                    shape an irregular parallelogram, with a general slope northward from the low
                    hills on the southern boundary. The scenery is rendered picturesque by the
                    artificial lakes of Mahoba. These magnificent reservoirs were constructed by the
                    Chandel râjâs about 800 years ago, for purposes of irrigation and as sheets of
                    ornamental water. Many of them enclose craggy islets or peninsulas, crowned by
                    the ruins of granite temples, exquisitely carved and decorated. From the base of
                    this hill and lake country the general plain of the district spreads northward
                    in an arid and treeless level towards the broken banks of the rivers. Of these
                    the principal are the Betwa and its tributary the Dhasân, both of which are
                    unnavigable. There is little waste land, except in the ravines by the river
                    sides. The deep black soil of Bundelkhand, known as <hi rend="italic">mär,</hi>
                    retains the moisture under a dried and rifted surface, and renders the district
                    fertile.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 gives a population of 529,137—276,196 males and 252,941
                    females. The Hindus numbered 493,877, and the Mahometans 33,658. The Chandels
                    and Bundelas, the old dominant classes, have now sunk to 548 and 612
                    respectively; most of these still cling to the neighbourhood of Mahoba, the seat
                    of their former supremacy. The district contains 6 towns with a population of
                    more than 5000 souls—namely, Rath, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Maudha, Sumerρur, and
                    Jaitpur. The staple produce of the district is grain of various sorts, the most
                    important being gram. Cotton is also a valuable crop, whose cultivation le on
                    the increase. Out of a total area of 1,464,641 acres, 762,212 are under
                    cultivation. Irrigation is practised on only 16,000 acres, chiefly in the south,
                    where water can be obtained from the artificial lakes. Agriculturists suffer
                    much from the spread of the <hi rend="italic">kdns</hi> grass, a noxious weed
                    which overruns the fields and is found to be almost ineradicable, wherever it
                    has once obtained a footing. The district is little subject to blight or flood;
                    but droughts and famine are unhappily common. The scarcity of 1837 and 1868-69
                    was severely felt in Hamirpur. Commerce is chiefly carried on by means of its
                    great river highway, the Jumna. Cotton and grain, the main exports, are carried
                    downwards; while rice, sugar, tobacco, and Manchester goods constitute the
                    principal imports upwards. The manufactures consist of coarse cotton cloth and
                    soapstone ornaments. There is only one metalled road, that between Hamirpur and
                    Naugaon, 70 miles in length. The gross revenue in 1870-71 was £184,646;
                    expenditure, £116,416. In 1871 the police force numbered 534 men, supplemented
                    by 1953 village watchmen <hi rend="italic">{chaukid&lt;irs),</hi> maintained at
                    a cost of £8058. The district contains only one jail: the average number of
                    prisoners in 1850 was 400; 1860, 72; and 1870, 129. In 1870 the number of
                    schools was 112, with 3066 pupils; the cost, £1354. The district is divided into
                    8 fiscal divisions <hi rend="italic">{pargands}.</hi> The climate is dry and
                    hot, owing to the absence of shade and the bareness of soil, except in the
                    neighbourhood of the Mahoba lakes, which cool and moisten the atmosphere. The
                    rainfall in 1869-70 was 37 ’ 1, and in 1870-71 38T inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> From the 9th to the 14th century this district
                    was the centre of the Chandel kingdom, with its capital at Mahoba. The raj as
                    adorned the town with many splendid edifices, remains of which still exist,
                    besides constructing the noble artificial lakes already described. At the end of
                    the 12th century Mahoba fell into the hands of the Mussulmans, who retained
                    possession of it for 500 years. In 1680 the district was conquered by Chhatar
                    Sal, the hero of the Bundelas, who assigned at his death one-third to his ally
                    the peshwa of the Mariettas. Until Bundelkhand was constituted a British
                    district in 1803, there was constant warfare between the Bundela princes and the
                    Marhatta chieftains. The land had been impoverished by the long war carried on
                    under Chhatar Sal, overrun and ravaged during the Marhatta aggression, and
                    devastated by robber chiefs, so that in 1842 it was reported to be utterly
                    valueless. On the outbreak of the mutiny, Hamirpur was the scene of a fierce
                    rebellion. All the principal towns were plundered by the surrounding native
                    chiefs. Since then the condition of . the district seems to have improved; but
                    it has not yet recovered from the long anarchy of Marhatta rule.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hamîrpur,</hi> the administrative headquarters of the above
                    district, in 25° 58' N. 1at. and 80° 11' 50" E. long., is situated on a tongue
                    of land at the confluence of the Betwa and the Jumna, on the right bank of the
                    latter river. It was founded, according to tradition, by Hamir Deo, a Karchuli
                    Râjput expelled from Ulwar (Alwar) by the Mahometans. The town possesses little
                    importance; there are no manufactures, and quite a limited trade in grain.
