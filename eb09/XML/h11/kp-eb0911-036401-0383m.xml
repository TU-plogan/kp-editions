                    the Solway and the Tyne, and commonly known as the Roman Wall. As will be
                    afterwards seen, those who have written on the subject are by no means agreed
                    that the name of Hadrian ought to be exclusively associated with this great
                    fortification. But before touching on the question, it is necessary to describe
                    the works themselves.</p>
                <p>Viewed as a whole the Roman Wall, when entire, consisted of three parts:—(1) a
                    stone wall, strengthened by a ditch or fosse, at a short distance from its
                    northern base; (2) three parallel earthen walls, with a ditch sloping down from
                    the northern side of the second of these lines; (3) stations, castles, and
                    turrets, placed at various intervals for the accommodation of troops, and
                    communicating with one another by a military way.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0384-0365"/>
                <p>The Murus or stone wall extended from Wallsend on the Tyne to Bowness on the
                    Solway Firth, a distance of fully 73 English miles. No portion of it now remains
                    as when finished, so that its original height cannot be accurately determined.
                    Bede gives 12 feet, an estimate that our chief modern authority on the Wall, Dr
                    J. Collingwood Bruce, deems too low, for some parts of its course at least. Its
                    thickness varies, being 6 feet in some places and 9∣ in others.</p>
                <p>The northern face of the Wall was continuous, but the southern had numerous
                    outsets and insets, as if portions of the work had been carried on at the same
                    time but without definite instructions as to a uniform breadth. In this way when
                    sections met differences in width often showed themselves, though the junction
                    was so managed that the irregularity was confined to one face. It is not
                    improbable that a similar discretion was allowed as regards height. Both sides
                    consisted of blocks of freestone 8 or 9 inches thick, 10 or 11 broad, and from
                    15 to 20 long. These had been sometimes quarried near the spot, sometimes
                    brought from considerable distances. The interior was filled with rubble firmly
                    cemented with mortar of a peculiar tenacity. In pursuing its course from sea to
                    sea, the Wall seldom deviated from the shortest and straightest course it could
                    follow, and then only with the evident design of seizing neighbouring elevations
                    that would otherwise have commanded its position. Along the whole length of its
                    northern ba3β, and adding greatly to its strength as a defensive work, was drawn
                    a ditch or fosse of varying breadth and depth, 36 and 15 feet respectively being
                    probably its average dimensions. In some places the difficulties to be overcome
                    by its excavators, owing to the rocky nature of the soil, must have been
                    enormous in an age when blasting with gunpowder was unknown. But none of them
                    have been shunned.</p>
                <p>South of the Murus ran the earth wall or Vallum, consisting, as has been already
                    stated, of three ramparts and a ditch. Of these mounds the most northerly was
                    raised at a distance from the base of the stone wall varying, according to the
                    nature of the country, from 30 yards to half a mile. Time and the spoiler have
                    dealt so hardly with it that its original dimensions cannot now be accurately
                    stated. It seems, however, to have been about 20 feet broad at the base and at
                    least 10 feet high. The materials of which it was made up consisted of earth
                    largely intermixed with fragments of stone of all sizes and shapes. 24 feet or
                    so further south was a ditch apparently somewhat inferior in breadth and depth
                    to the ditch of the Murus, though otherwise of the same character. On its
                    southern edge was a rampart much smaller in size than the one just noticed,
                    while the series was completed by a third mound, approaching in its dimensions
                    the larger of the other two, and raised at nearly the same distance as it from
                    the centre of the included ditch.</p>
                <p>Along the wall, at intervals averaging 4 miles, were stationary camps strongly
                    fortified. According to the <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Utrüisque</hi><hi rend="italic">Imperii,</hi> which contains a brief record of
                    the civil and military arrangement of the empires of the</p>
                <p>East and West, and is supposed to have been compiled in the beginning of the 5th
                    century of our era, there were 23 such stations. Thenames given areas
                    follows:—Segedunum (Wallsend), Pons Aelii (Newcastle), Condercum (Benwell Hill),
                    Vindobala (Rutchester), Hunnum (Halton Chester), Cilurnum (Chesters), Procolitia
                    (Carrawburgh), Borcovicus (Hυusesteads), Vindolana (Chesterholm), Aesica (Great
                    Chesters), Magna (Carvoran), Amboglanna (Birdoswald), Petriana, Aballaba,
                    Congavata, Axelodunum, Gabrosentum, Tunocelum, Glannibanta, Alionis,
                    Bremetenracum, Olen-acum, and Virosidum. It is somewhat strange that not a trace
                    of one of these names survives in the local vocabulary of the present day,
                    though the exact positions of a number of the stations have been identified
                    beyond all doubt by other means. The sites had been chosen with great care, and
                    much labour must have been expended in their construction. They were in fact
                    military cities, “suited,” to use the words of Dr Bruce, “to be the residence of
                    the chief who commanded the district, and providing secure lodgment for the
                    powerful body of soldiery he had under him.” It is not clear, however, that more
                    than 18 of the 23 were situated <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lineam valli,</hi> the others being probably supporting stations. The Wall was
                    further strengthened by quadrangular buildings called mile-castles as well as by
                    smaller watch-towers or sentry-boxes of stone; while connecting the whole was a
                    military way made in Roman fashion and protected by the other parts of the
                    fortification. By means of this road the garrisons of the different stations
                    could be quickly and safely concentrated on any point along the line that was
                    threatened by an enemy. “It is sometimes asked,” remarks the authority just
                    quoted, “How long would the Wall be in building <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>?
                    From calculations that have been made, founded upon the experience gained by the
                    construction of the vast works connected with modern railways, it is considered
                    that, in the existing circumstances of the country at the time, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vallum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Murus</hi> could not be
                    reared in a shorter period than 10 years. The cost of it in our present currency
                    would be about .£1,000,000. Above 10,000 men would be required to garrison its
                    stations” <hi rend="italic">(Wallet Book of the Boman Wall,</hi> p. 37).</p>
                <p>Several of the ancient writers allude to ramparts and lines of forts raised by
                    the Romans across the island during the time they had a footing in it. Of these
                    notices some refer to the barrier on the isthmus of the Forth and Clyde (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Antoninus, Wall of,</hi> vol. ii. p. 139); the others probably
                    apply to the more important works now described. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricola</hi> Tacitus states that the Roman general during his operations in
                    the north of England (79 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> compelled many states
                    hitherto hostile to lay down their arms and surrounded them with garrisons and
                    castles. A hundred years later two contemporary historians, Dion Cassius (as
                    abridged by Xiphiline) and HerodiaD, writing of events in Britain that occurred
                    in their own day, both notice—the former in two places—the existence of a wall
                    in Britain, separating the Roman territory from the uncon∙</p>

                <p>quered tribes that dwelt beyond; but neither of them mentions when or by whom it
                    was built. Another century onwards and Spartian, one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scriptores</hi><hi rend="italic">Historioe Augastoe,</hi> states that the
                    emperor Hadrian was the first to rear a wall across Britain <hi rend="italic"
                    >(circa</hi> 120 A.D.) as a defence against the northern barbarians. It was, he
                    adds, 80 miles in length. The same author in his life of Severus tells us that
                    emperor also raised a wall from sea to sea <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 208
                    A.D.). Aurelius Victor, who flourished about the year 360 A.D., ascribes to
                    Severus the building of a wall in Britain, employing almost the words of
                    Spartian; while his contemporary, Eutropius, makes a similar statement, adding,
                    however, that this rampart was 32 (according to another reading, 132) miles
                    long, and erected for the defence of certain portions of the country, which
                    Severus had reconquered for Rome. Another possible wall-builder is introduced to
                    us in the early years of the 5th century by the poet Claudian, who represents
                    Britain as indebted to Stilicho, the successful general of the emperors
                    Theodosius I. and Honorius, for some protection of this nature against the
                    attacks of the Scots, Picts, and Saxons. Lastly, Gildas, our earliest native
                    historian, asserts that the Britons themselves built a wall to aid them in
                    warding off the assaults of the Picts and Scots, and that another was
                    constructed by the Romans with native assistance, just before their final
                    abandonment of the island. Both statements are repeated by Bede, who identifies
                    the former of these structures with Antonine’s wall and the latter with the more
                    famous fortification near his own monastery of Jarrow</p>
                <p>Founding on such unsatisfactory if not conflicting data, modern writers have been
                    led to give various answers to the questions—When and by whom was the Roman Wall
                    built? The limits of the present article do not admit of any discussion of the
                    subject, and those who wish to see these questions fully examined, as well as to
                    read an account of the inscriptions and other antiquities discovered from time
                    to time along the line of the Wall, are referred to the list of works given
                    below, more especially to Dr J. C. Bruce’s exhaustive treatise. For others the
                    following summary may be sufficient.</p>
                <p>Gordon, to whom we owe one of the earliest surveys of the Wall, is of opinion
                    that the Vallum was the work of Hadrian, and the Murus of Severus. Horsley
                    believed that the stations and the northern rampart of the Vallum were raised by
                    Agricola, the ditch of the Vallum and its remaining mounds byHadrian, and the
                    stone wall with its castles, towers, and its great military way by Severus. Dean
                    Merivale, while admitting that camps and mounds may have been erected on the
                    isthmus by Hadrian and Severus, supposes that the stations were faced with
                    masonry and the work planned as well as partly executed by Theodosius, his
                    designs being afterwards fully carried out about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> by Stilicho, in orders issued from Gaul. But others, and foremost
                    among them Dr Bruce, see in the fortification a unity of design that points it
                    out as the work of one period and one mind, and have come to the conclusion that
                    Hadrian was the builder of the whole. This view, as it does not exclude the
                    probability that his engineers worked to some extent on lines already laid down
                    by Agricola, and that Severus, before entering on his unfortunate campaign
                    against the Caledonians, or after its close, repaired and strengthened the works
                    of his predecessors, seems most consistent with the statements of ancient
                    writers, with the testimony of inscriptions, and with the appearances presented
                    by the relative position of the component parts of the fortification itself.</p>
