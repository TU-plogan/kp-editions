                    Christ’s College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of M.A., his tutor being
                    Bishop Still, the famous author of <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurtoη</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s
                    Needle.</hi> He came up to London about 1583 and studied law, but Queen
                    Elizabeth seems to have removed him to a place at court. Tradition relates that
                    it was at her command that he undertook the translation of Ariosto’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso,</hi> a work that saw the
                    light in 1591 and was reprinted in 1607 and 1634. Soon after this first date
                    Harington retired to the family mansion at Kelston. In 1596 he published in
                    succession <hi rend="italic">The Metamorphosis of Ajax, An Apology,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ulysses upon Ajax,</hi> the three forming collectively a very
                    absurd and indecorous work of -a Pan-tagruelistic kind. In 1599 he served in
                    Ireland under Essex, and was knighted on the field, to the annoyance, it is
                    said, of Elizabeth. He married a lady of title, who bore him eight children, and
                    who survived until 1634. In 1608 he wrote a personal satire against the bishops,
                    which he read to James I., but which was first published, by a Presbyterian
                    printer, as late as 1653, under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Brief View of
                    the State of the Church.</hi> This is a somewhat scandalous production. In the
                    spring of 1612, Harington was suffering heavily from the dropsy, and in December
                    of that year he died. In 1613 his <hi rend="italic">Epigrams,</hi> which had
                    circulated widely in MS., were printed in a collection of the verse of various
                    writers entitled <hi rend="italic">Alcilia,</hi> and separately in 1615. They
                    became very popular, and were often reprinted. The miscellaneous writings of
                    Harington existing in MS. in his family were first collected by the Rev. Henry
                    Harington in 1779, in 2 volumes, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nugoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquae.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Nugoe</hi>
                    include some very elegant pieces of the poet’s father.</p>
                <p>The translation of the <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Furioso</hi> was a very important labour, and it was carried out with skill and
                    perseverance. Harington, however, was neither a very exact scholar nor a very
                    poetical translator, and he cannot be named in the same breath with Fairfax. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furiosο</hi> was a sumptuous book, illustrated in the
                    best taste of the day, and to it were appended a prose critique of the poem, and
                    a life of Ariosto compiled by Harington from various Italian sources.
                    Harington’s Rabelaisian pamphlets show that he was almost equally endowed with
                    wit and indelicacy, while of his epigrams little can be said but that,they are
                    sometimes smart and always easy.</p>
