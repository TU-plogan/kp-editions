                    1366. At the age of fifteen he married Mary Bohun, and in 1385 was made earl of
                    Derby. Two years later he was one of the five lords appellant who impeached the
                    earl of Suffolk and others, and took part in the proceedings of the Merciless
                    Parliament. He acquiesced, however, in Richard’s return to power, supported the
                    king in his <hi rend="italic">coup</hi><hi rend="italic">fêtât</hi> of 1397, and
                    became duke of Hereford. His quarrel with the duke of Norfolk led to his
                    banishment shortly afterwards, and on his father’s death Richard denied him the
                    succession to his title and inheritance (1398). Next year he took advantage of
                    Richard’s absence in Ireland to reassert his rights. He landed in Yorkshire,
                    took Bristol, and seized Richard (August 19) near Conway Castle. At a parliament
                    which met on September 30th, he claimed the throne on the ground of his descent
                    from Henry III., the right of conquest, and the necessity of reform. He was
                    accepted by the parliament; Richard was forced to abdicate; and Henry was
                    crowned (October 13, 1399). The last of his three claims gives the explanation
                    of his policy. He had won the favour of the church by pledges in favour of
                    orthodoxy; the circumstances of his accession and the difficulties of his
                    government forced him to make concessions to the House of Commons, which raised
                    that body to a position it did not again attain for more than two centuries. The
                    first part of his reign was occupied with the suppression of the revolts, not
                    only of the defeated party, but also of his own discontented adherents. These
                    troubles were complicated by hostile relations with <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0693-0660"/> France, Scotland, and Wales. Charles VI. was
                    inclined to take up the cause of his daughter Isabella, wife of Richard II., and
                    on the death of the latter (February 1400) demanded her and her dowry back. The
                    duke of Albany in Scotland was hostile to Henry, and Owen Glendower raised a n
                    rtional revolt in Wales. The first attempt at insurrection was made by the earls
                    of Richard’s party early in 1400, but their plans were discovered, and their
                    forces crushed piecemeal. Most of the leaders fell victims to popular vengeance.
                    A more serious rebellion was that of the Percies (1403), hitherto Henry’s
                    staunchest supporters. Hotspur and his father thought themselves ill requited
                    for their services, and made common cause with Glendower and other malcontents.
                    A junction of the northern army with the Welsh was prevented by the battle of
                    Shrewsbury (July 21, 1403), in which Hotspur was killed. Northumberland
                    submitted and was pardoned. But the danger was not over. The north was still in
                    a state of ferment, the war in Wales went on, and a French fleet ravaged the
                    southern coast with impunity. Henry’s vigilance and activity were, however,
                    equal to the task. A plot to carry off the young earl of March (January 1405)
                    was foiled, and a fresh outbreak in the north was crushed. Scrope, archbishop of
                    York, and Mowbray, earl marshal, who led the rebels, were taken and executed.
                    The king had already got into his power the son of the duke of Albany; he now
                    captured James, the heir-apparent to the Scotch crown, as he was on his way to
                    France; and the murder of the duke of Orleans removed his chief enemy in that
                    country. Thus secured from danger abroad, he put down a final rebellion in the
                    north, drove Glendower back into his mountains, and henceforward had no trouble
                    at home (1408). The late crisis had, however, compelled him to make important
                    concessions to the House of Commons. He promised (1407) to act solely by the
                    advice of a council nominated with their approval, and submitted to the
                    appropriation of his revenue and to other limitations. Throughout his reign he
                    was hampered by want of money, and the regular exercise by parliament of the
                    right to withhold supplies gave that body great control over his actions. He had
                    seized the crown as the champion of orthodoxy. He had therefore to pay for
                    ecclesiastical support by persecuting Lollards against his will, while he did
                    not dare to act upon the suggestion of the Commons that church property should
                    be converted to purposes of state. Thus limited, his foreign policy was not
                    energetic. He had enough to do at first to defend his coasts, and though he
                    afterwards seized the opportunity afforded by civil war to invade France (1411),
                    his efforts were in general confined to strengthening his dynasty by foreign
                    marriages. In his later years he was a confirmed invalid, and had to entrust
                    much power to his eldest son, with whom he was not always on the best of terms.
                    He died on March 20, 1113, and was buried at Canterbury. A cautious, crafty,
                    resolute man, naturally inclined to fair dealing and clemency, but on occasion
                    unscrupulous and cruel, he was successful in the great enterprise of his life,
                    and has the credit of seeing that the power he had usurped could only maintain
                    itself by resting on a constitutional basis.</p>
