                    (1582-1648). Edward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, soldier, diplomatist,
                    historian, and religious philosopher, was born at Eyton in Shropshire in 1582,
                    and was descended from an ancient line of illustrious soldiers, to which the
                    earls of Pembroke belonged. Sent to Oxford in his twelfth year, he married an
                    heiress, his kinswoman, in his fifteenth, and returned to the university to
                    prosecute his “beloved studies.” He was knighted soon after the accession of
                    James I., and for a year or two fulfilled the functions of sheriff of his
                    county. In 1608 he went abroad, at Paris gaining the esteem and love of the old
                    Constable de Montmorency, and beginning an acquaintance with scholars like
                    Casaubon, Gassendi, and Grotius. Next year he served as a volunteer in the Low
                    Countries under the prince of Orange, whose intimate friend he became, and also
                    took part in the campaigns of 1614 and 1615. Between the latter campaigns he
                    visited Italy, and on his return was arrested in France for recruiting Huguenots
                    for the service of the duke of Savoy. In 1618 he was sent as ambassador
                    extraordinary to the court of France; and, though recalled for a few months
                    through the hostility of the French king’s favourite, he soon returned to Paris
                    as ordinary ambassador. In 1625 he came back to England, where, with the
                    exception of one or more short visits to Paris, he spent the rest of his life.
                    Created Lord Herbert of Castle Island in 1625, he was raised by Charles I. to
                    the English peerage in 1631 as Baron Herbert of Cherbury. In the civil war he
                    sided at first with the court, and subsequently declared for the parliament, but
                    the part he played was not a prominent one. His castle of Montgomery was,
                    however, destroyed during the war, and he received an indemnity for his loss
                    from the parliament. He died 20 th August 1648.</p>
                <p>“It is impossible to draw his picture well who hath several countenances,”
                    Herbert says of Henry VIII.; Horace Walpole made a bold attempt to sketch
                    Herbert’s character by declaring that in his case “the history of Don Quixote
                    was the life of Plato.” To his contemporaries Herbert was mainly known as a
                    high-spirited man of the world, of great knightly and courtier-like
                    accomplishments, who, though stiff and stately, was on the smallest actual
                    provocation ready and able to defend his honour with his sword. He maintained
                    the character of ambassador with dignity, but his diplomacy was not attended by
                    much success. It is as author that Herbert is chiefly remembered. And though in
                    1633 the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritate</hi> received the
                    official imprimatur of the bishop of Londop’s chaplain, on the strength of the
                    same work the writer was soon after held up to abhorrence as an atheist. As a
                    resolute opponent of empiricism in philosophy, he is unquestionably entitled to
                    rank as one of the heralds of the philosophy of Reid and the Scottish
                    metaphysicians. In the theological sphere ht is justly claimed as the father of
                    English deism, and doubtless exercised a strong influence on the religious
                    thought of England. His views were not so novel as he thought them to be, but he
                    was an original and very independent thinker; and, as his chief work was
                    published but a few years after the <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Organum,</hi> and many years before any of the works of Descartes
                    or Hobbes, Herbert deserves a marked place in the van of modern speculation.</p>
                <p>Herbert’s first and most important work is the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Veritate prout distinguitur a Revelatione,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aVerisimili,</hi><hi rend="italic">a Possibili,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">a Falso</hi> (Paris, 1624; translated into French, but
                    never into English). It combines a theory of knowledge with a partial
                    psychology, a methodology for the investigation of truth, and a scheme of
                    natural religion. The author’s method is prolix and often far from clear; the
                    book is no compact system, but it contains the skeleton and much of the soul of
                    a complete philosophy. Giving up all past philosophizings as useless, Herbert
                    professedly endeavours to constitute a new and troe system. Truth, which he
                    defines as a just conformation of the faculties with one another and with their
                    objects, he distributed into four classes or stages :—(1) truth in the thing or
                    the truth of the object; (2)trath of the appearance; (3) troth of the
                    apprehension <hi rend="italic">(conceptus)</hi>; (4) troth of the intellect. The
                    faculties of the mind are as numerous as the differences of their objects, and
                    are accordingly innumerable; but they may be arranged in four groups. The first
                    and fundamental and most certain group is the <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    Instinct,</hi> to which belong the <hi rend="italic">κoιvdl ervoιaι,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Notitiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Communes,</hi> which are the
                    “received principles of demonstration,” existing in every sane and sound man,
                    against which it is <hi rend="italic">nefas</hi> to dispute. The second group,
                    the next in certainty, is the <hi rend="italic">Sensus Internus</hi> (under
                    which head Herbert discusses amongst others love, hate, fear, conscience with
                    its <hi rend="italic">communis</hi><hi rend="italic">notitia,</hi> and free
                    will); the third is the <hi rend="italic">Sensus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Extβrmιs</hi>; and the fourth is <hi rend="italic">Discursus,</hi> reasoning,
                    to which, as being the least certain, we have recourse when the other faculties
                    fail. The ratiocinative faculties proceed by division and analysis, by
                    questioning, and are slow and gradual in their movement; they take aid from the
                    other faculties, those of the <hi rend="italic">instinctus naturalis</hi> being
                    always the final test. Herbert’s categories or questions to be used in
                    investigation are ten in number,—whether (a thing is), what, of what sort, how
                    much, in what relation, how, when, where, whence, wherefore. No faculty, rightly
                    used, can err “even in dreams”; badly exercised, reasoning becomes the source of
                    almost all our errors. The discussion of the <hi rend="italic">notitiec
                    communes</hi> is the most characteristic part of the book. The exposition of
                    them, though highly dogmatic, is at times strikingly Kantian in substance. “So
                    far are these elements or sacred principles from being derived from experience
                    or observation that without some of them, or at least some one of them, we can
                    neither experience nor even observe.” Unless we felt driven by them to explore
                    the nature of things, “it would never occur to us to distinguish one thing from
                    another.” It cannot be said that Herbert proves the existence of the common
                    notions; he does not deduce them or even give any list of them. But each faculty
                    has its common notion; and they may be distinguished by six marks, their <hi
                    rend="italic">priority, independence, universality, certainty, necessity</hi>
                    (for the well-being of man), and <hi rend="italic">immediacy.</hi> Law is based
                    on certain <hi rend="italic">common notions;</hi> so is religion. Though Herbert
                    expressly defines the scope of his book as dealing with the intellect, not
                    faith, it is the common notions of religion he has illustrated most fully; and
                    it is plain that it is in this part of his system that he is chiefly interested.
                    The common notions of religion are the famous five articles, which became the
                    charter of the English deists :—(1) that , there is a supreme god; (2) that he
                    ought to be worshipped; (3) that virtue and piety form the chief part of that
                    worship; (4) that sins should be repented of; (5) that there are rewards · and
                    punishments in another life. To these doctrines, which constitute the faith of
                    the true catholic and orthodox church, it is not easy to add anything that can
                    make men more virtuous or godly. There is little polemic against the received
                    form of Christianity, but Herbert’s attitude towards the church’s doctrine is
                    distinctly negative, though he admits the possibility, under certain conditions,
                    of specific and supernatural revelation. In the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Religione Gentilium</hi> (Lond., 1645) he gives what may be
                    called, in Hume’s words, “a natural history of religion.” By examining the
                    heathen religions Herbert finds, to his great delight, that under all their
                    absurdities the five great articles were recognized. The heathen, yearning for
                    the supreme God, saw Him in His works and worshipped Him in the most glorious of
                    His creatures, the heavenly bodies. It was crafty priests who insisted on the
                    necessity of multifarious rites and ceremonies, and developed full-fledged
                    polytheism. The same vein is maintained in the tracts <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Causis Errorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Religione</hi><hi rend="italic">Laid.</hi> Herbert’s first
                    historical work is the <hi rend="italic">Expeditio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Buckinghami Duds</hi> (1656), an account <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">The, Life and Raigne of King Henry VIII.</hi> (1649), in pithy
                    English, is called by Walpole “a masterpiece of historic biography,” but is
                    ill-proportioned and is digested into annals. It abounds in picturesque but
                    prolix accounts of sieges and pageants at home and abroad; the sketch of the
                    Reformation history is so dispassionate as to suggest a lack of keen sympathy
                    with either party. Henry’s character is very leniently judged. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Life of Herbert by Himself</hi> (first published by Horace Walpole in 1764)
                    gives a vivacious and interesting account of his early life down to the return
                    from his embassy, dwelling mainly, with something of an old man’s garrulity and
                    a famous man’s vanity, on the romantic and chivalrous incidents in his career.
                    Herbert’s poems, Latin and English, are of small value.</p>
