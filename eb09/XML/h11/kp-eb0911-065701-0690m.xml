                <p><label type="entry">HENRY II</label>. (1133-1189), king of England, son of
                    Geoffrey, count of Anjou, and Matilda, daughter of Henry I., was born at Le
                    Mans, March 5, 1133. He was left in France during the first part of his mother’s
                    struggle with Stephen, but was sent over to England in 1141. There he remained
                    four years, in the charge of his uncle, Robert of Gloucester. In 1147 he took a
                    more active part in the war, but was not successful. He now sought the aid of
                    David, king of Scotland, and was knighted by him (1149), but nothing came of the
                    alliance with that prince. On his return to Normandy (1151), Louis VII.
                    conferred the duchy upon him, and later in the year he became, by his father’s
                    death, count of Anjou, In 1152 he married Eleanor of Aquitaine, and added Poitou
                    and Guienne to his dominions. He again went to England in 1153, and the great
                    position he hid won on the Continent turned the scale in his favour. After a
                    short struggle Stephen consented to negotiate. By the treaty of Winchester
                    (November 7, 1153) it was settled, among other things, that Stephen should reign
                    undisturbed during the rest of his life, and that Henry should succeed him. A
                    year later Stephen died, and Henry took quiet possession of the throne. He was
                    crowned on December 19, 1154, and at once issued a charter of liberties, in
                    which he confirmed the charter of Henry I.</p>
                <p>His reign falls into three main periods. During the first Henry was occupied in
                    restoring and maintaining order. The second is that of the quarrel with Becket.
                    The third is for the most part a period of rebellion and trouble, the
                    consequences of that quarrel. Henry’s first business was to fulfil the promises
                    made in the treaty of Winchester, and to undo the work of his predecessor.
                    Several of Stephen’s earldoms were abolished, new sheriffs were appointed, the
                    adulterine castles destroyed, the royal domains recovered. In this task the king
                    met with little serious opposition, and his presence generally sufficed to
                    ensure success. In 1156 Henry was able to go to France, where his brother
                    Geoffrey was causing trouble by his claims on Anjou. He had to subdue him by
                    force of arms, after which he allowed him to be chosen count of Nantes. He then
                    exacted homage irona his Continental vassals, and himself did homage to Louis
                    VII. At Easter 1157 he returned to England, to complete the restoration of order
                    there. Those of the great barons who had not yet given up their castles had now
                    to do so, and the king of Scotland surrendered the three northern counties. An
                    unsuccessful expedition to Wales followed. In 1158, on his brother Geoffrey’s
                    death, Henry secured his inheritance, At the same time he betrothed his second
                    son Henry (the eldest, William, being dead) to Margaret, daughter of Louis. Next
                    year he made an attack upon Toulouse, which he claimed in right of his wife, but
                    after some successes retired, owing to the opposition of the French king. In a
                    peace made soon after, he retained Cahors, but gave up his claim to the rest of
                    the county. Hostilities between him and Louis were, however, more or less
                    continuous during this time, in spite of the efforts of Alexander III. In
                    January 1163 Henry returned to England after five years’ absence, and his
                    quarrel with Becket immediately began.</p>
                <p>Becket had been consecrated archbishop of Canterbury in June 1162. He at once
                    resigned his temporal offices, and demanded the restitution of lands alienated
                    from his see. At a council at Woodstock he refused to pay the tax of two
                    shillings per hide demanded by the king. A little later the struggle was removed
                    to still more dangerous ground. Becket refused his consent to the king’s
                    proposal for settling the dispute between the temporal and spiritual courts.
                    Upon this Henry asked him and the bishops whether they would abide by the
                    ancient customs of the realm. So vague a question met with an evasive answer.
                    The bishops would only consent “saving their order.” However, at the council of
                    Clarendon (January 1164) the disputed customs were drawn up in the form of
                    sixteen constitutions, and after considerable hesitation accepted by Becket. He
                    nevertheless got absolution from the pope, who refused to confirm the
                    constitutions. Henry now attacked Becket with a series of charges connected with
                    his chancellorship, the result of which the latter evaded by leaving England.
                    Henry took possession of the see, and expelled Becket’s friends and relations.
                    The greater part of the next five years he spent abroad. During this time he was
                    occupied in maintaining order among his unruly vassals, checking the intrigues
                    of Louis, and negotiating with the pope. He also obtained possession of Brittany
                    for his son Geoffrey, and betrothed Richard to Alice, daughter of Louis. With
                    the object of securing the succession he had his son Henry crowned by the
                    archbishop of York at Westminster (June 1170). The young king’s wife was not
                    crowned with him. Louis, taking this as an insult, invaded Normandy, and only
                    made peace with Henry on condition that he would restore Becket to favour. A
                    meeting between the king and the archbishop ended in a compromise, and the
                    latter returned to England. His first step was to suspend the archbishop of York
                    and other bishops who had taken part in the coronation of the young king, and
                    Henry, on hearing of this, uttered the angry words that led to Becket’s murder.
                    The pope was, however, in too critical a position to quarrel seriously with
                    Henry. Negotiations between them ended in a meeting with the legates at
                    Avranches (1172), in which Henry received absolution, and promised to abolish
                    all the bad customs introduced during his reign. He had employed the interval in
                    making an expedition to Ireland, and appropriating the conquests made by
                    Strongbow a few years before.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical quarrel seemed to have died away, but its consequences were
                    felt in the great rebellion of 1173. A confederacy was organized by the French
                    king, the count of Flanders, the king of Scotland, and Henry’s sons, with the
                    object of placing the young Henry on his father’s throne. The first campaign was
                    indecisive, but on the whole favourable to the king. In view of a general attack
                    which was to be made next year, Henry crossed over to England and did penance at
                    Becket’s tomb. Fortunately his justiciar, De Lucy, captured the Scotch king at
                    Alnwick, and the rebellion in England was speedily put down. William the Lion
                    was forced to buy his release by doing homage to Henry; the other confederates
                    made peace; and Henry was left stronger than ever. He at once proceeded to
                    secure his position by further legislative enactments, and henceforward he had
                    no trouble in England. But he was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0691-0658"/> involved in constant difficulties with his sons
                    and with the French king, owing to the mutual jealousies of the former and the
                    intrigues of the latter, to which Henry’s partiality for his youngest son John
                    and his refusal to allow the marriage of Richard with Alice gave rise. A war
                    between the brothers in 1183 was brought to an end by the death of the young
                    Henry in the same year. The feud broke out again in 1184, and continued at
                    intervals, in spite of the death of Geoffrey in 1186, to the end of the reign.
                    At length Henry’s apparent intention to name John as his successor forced
                    Richard to ally himself with Philip II, and in the war that followed Henry was
                    beaten at all points. He was forced to make a disgraceful peace, the terms of
                    which, together with the discovery that John was among his enemies, broke his
                    heart. He died at Chinon, July 6, 1189, and was buried at Fontevraud.</p>
                <p>Henry’s legislative activity, which was great and constant, deserves special
                    notice. His aim was the consolidation of royal power by means of a centralized
                    system of justice and administration. The Constitutions of Clarendon were an
                    Θ3seutial part of this scheme, designed to bring the clergy, as well as other
                    classes of the nation, under the rule of law, and to prevent an ecclesiastical
                    “imperium in imperio.” Other enactments, as the Assize of Clarendon (1166), were
                    intended to perfect the judicial system and to supersede the baronial by the
                    royal courts. The system of recognition by jury took the place of trial by
                    battle. The grand jury was organized for the presentment of criminals for trial.
                    The jury system was further employed for the inquiry into the conduct of the
                    sheriffs (1170), and for the assessment of the Saladin tithe (1188). The
                    circuits of the justices itinerant were, after repeated experiments, brought to
                    something like perfection, and a high court of justice formed out of the Curia
                    Regis, which was the origin of the Court of King’s Bench. By the commutation of
                    feudal service for scutage, and by the Assize of Arms (1181), which revived the
                    national militia, Henry made himself independent of the baronage, and formed
                    that alliance between king and people which was the surest basis of his power.
                    Whatever may be said against his private character, the wisdom and steadiness
                    with which lie pursued these aims, and the permanence of the mark that he left
                    upon the constitution, secure him the title of a great king.</p>
