                    10 miles N.W. of London, derives the latter part of its name from its position
                    on a hill which rises from the surrounding plain to the height of about 200
                    feet. On the summit, and forming a conspicuous landmark, is the church of St
                    Mary, said to have been founded by Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, in the
                    reign of William I., but of the original building very little is now left.
                    Harrow is chiefly celebrated for its school, founded in 1571 by John Lyon, a
                    yeoman of the neighbouring village of Preston who had yearly during his life set
                    aside 20 marks for the education of poor children of Harrow. Though the charter
                    was granted by Queen Elizabeth in 1571, and the statutes drawn up by the founder
                    in 1590, two years before his death, it was not till 1611 that the first
                    building was opened for scholars. Lyon originally settled about two-thirds of
                    his property on the school, leaving the remainder for the maintenance of the
                    highway between London and Harrow, but in the course of time the values of the
                    respective endowments have changed, and while the road commissioners receive
                    about £3500, the school’s share is only about £1600. In 1660 the headmaster,
                    taking advantage of a concession in Lyon’s statutes, began to receive
                    “foreigners,” t.e., boys from other parishes, who were to pay for their
                    education. From this time the prosperity of the school may be dated. In 1809 the
                    parishioners of Harrow appealed to the Court of Chancery against the manner in
                    which the school was conducted, but the decision, while it recognized their
                    privileges, confirmed the right of admission to foreigners. At present
                    foundationers receive their education at a slightly <pb break="no"

                    are taught gratis. The government of the school was originally vested in six
                    persons of standing in the parish, who had the power of filling vacancies in
                    their number by election among themselves; but under the Public Schools Act of
                    1868 the governing body now consists of the surviving members of the old board,
                    besides six new members who are elected respectively by the Lord Chancellor, the
                    universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London, the Royal Society, and the
                    assistant masters of the school. There is a considerable number of scholarships
                    in connexion with the school to both the great English universities, some to
                    special colleges, othere to colleges in the choice of the holders. The general
                    mode of instruction and discipline is modelled on that of Eton, where most of
                    the former headmasters of Harrow were educated. Originally an exclusively
                    classical school, mathematics became in 1837 a compulsory study at Harrow;
                    modern languages, compulsory on the upper f0rm3 only since 1851, were extended
                    to the whole school in 1855; while English history and literature began to be
                    more especially studied about 1869. Science, music, and drawing are now also
                    taught. Among the famous men who have been educated here may be mentioned Bruce,
                    the Abyssinian traveller, Sir William Jones, the Orientalist, Dr Parr, who was
                    born at Harrow, Admiral Rodney, Sheridan, Byron, Peel, Theodore Hook, Lord
                    Palmerston, Lord Herbert of Lea, the earl of Shaftesbury, and Archbishop Trench.
                    Comparatively little change was made in the school buildings till 1819, when the
                    new portion was begun; but since that time improvements and additions have
                    steadily increased. In 1839 a school-chapel was consecrated; but this has been
                    gradually replaced by a handsomer edifice completed in 1857. The Vaughan library
                    was built in 1861-63, and a hospital for the boys in 1865. A new speech room, a
                    gymnasium, and laboratories have been erected out of the Lyon Tercentenary Fund,
                    subscribed since 1871. The population of the parish in 1871 was 8537, and of the
                    local board district 4997.</p>
