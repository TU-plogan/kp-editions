                <p><label type="entry">HERACLITUS</label> of Ephesus, one of the most subtle and
                    profound of the metaphysicians of ancient Greece, has only of late years had his
                    true position assigned to him in the history of philosophy. To this the obscure
                    and epigrammatic character of his style and the fragmentary condition of his
                    works have in the main contributed, together with the fact that not only his
                    immediate disciples but also his critics, including even Plato, have
                    systematically laid stress upon those features of his doctrines which are least
                    indicative of his real point of view. The true position of Heraclitus is that of
                    the founder of an independent metaphysical system, which sought to get rid of
                    the difficulty, so prominent in the Eleatic philosophy, of overcoming the
                    contradiction between the one and the phenomenal many, by enunciating, as the
                    principle of the universe, “Becoming,” implying, as it does, that everything is
                    and at the same time, and in the same relation, is not.</p>

                <p>The descendant of a family of leading importance in Ephesus, Heraclitus was born
                    about 535 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His cast of mind was so intensely
                    aristocratic that, filled with contempt for the councils and capacities of his
                    fellow-citizens, he made over the hereditary office of ∕3ασιλeι⅛, which had
                    fallen to him in right of his birth, in favour of his younger brother, and
                    betook himself to a life of solitary meditation. The date of his death was
                    probably about 475 B.c.</p>
                <p>To appreciate the significance of the doctrines of Heraclitus, it must be borιιe
                    in mind that to Greek philosophy the sharp distinction between subject and
                    object which pervades modern thought was foreign, a consideration which suggests
                    the conclusion that, while it is a great mistake to reckon Heraclitus with the
                    materialistic cosmologists of the Ionic schools, it is, on the other hand, going
                    too far to treat his theory, with Hegel and Lassalle, as one of pure Panlogism.
                    Accordingly, when he denies the reality of Being, and declares Becoming, or
                    eternal flux and change, to be the sole actuality, Heraclitus must be understood
                    .to enunciate not only the unreality of the abstract notion of being, except as
                    the correlative of that of not-being, but also the physical doctrine that all
                    phenomena are in a state of continuous transition from non-existence to
                    existence, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> without either distinguishing
                    these propositions or qualifying them by any reference to the relation of
                    thought to experience. “Everything is and is not;” all things are, and nothing
                    remains. With Heraclitus the principle of continuity is opposed to the principle
                    of discretion taught by the Eleatics, and consequently for him “Being and
                    Nothing,” as well as “Union and Separation,” are logically and physically
                    incapable of distinction. This being so,he naturally enough selects Fire,
                    according to him the most complete embodiment of the process of Becoming, as the
                    principle of empirical existence, out of which all things, including even the
                    soul, grow by way of a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> condensation, and into which
                    all things must in course of time be again resolved. But this primordial fire is
                    in itself that divine rational process, the harmony of which constitutes the law
                    of the universe. Real knowledge consists in comprehending this all-pervading
                    harmony as embodied in the manifold of perception, and the senses are “bad
                    witnesses,” because they apprehend phenomena, not as its manifestation, but as
                    “stiff and dead.” In like manner real virtue consists in the subordination of
                    the individual to the laws of this harmony as the universal reason λvherein
                    alone true freedom is to be found. ‘ ‘ The law of things is a law of Reason
                    Universal, but most men live as though they had a wisdom of their own.” Ethics
                    here stands to sociology in a close relation, similar, in many respects, to that
                    which we find in Hegel and in Comte. For Heraclitus the soul approaches most
                    nearly to perfection when it is most akin to the fiery vapour out of which it
                    was originally created, and as this is most so in death, “while we live our
                    souls are dead in us, but when we die our souls are restored to life.” The
                    doctrine of immortality comes prominently forward in his ethics, but whether
                    this must not be reckoned with the figurative accommodation to the popular
                    theology of Greece which pervades his ethical teaching, is very doubtful.</p>
                <p>The only extant work, purporting to have been written by Heraclitus, which can be
                    regarded as genuine, is the treatise ∏∈p't <hi rend="italic">φvσeωs,</hi> which
                    has come down in a fragmentary condition. It has been edited by Bywater <hi
                    rend="italic">(Heracliti Ephesii</hi><hi rend="italic">Reliquiae,</hi> Clarendon
                    Press, 1877). The Epistles are in all probability spurious.</p>
                <p>The school of disciples founded by Heraclitus flourished for long after his
                    death, the chief exponent of his teaching being Cratylus. A good deal of thö
                    information in regard to his doctrines has been gathered from the later Greek
                    philosophy, which was deeply influenced by it.</p>
                <p>By far the most complete exposition of his system is that of Lassalle <hi

                    although his interpretation is decidedly too strongly dominated by modern
                    Hegelian conceptions. See also Hegel, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Phil.·,</hi>
