                    estimation, both on account of their durable timber, and from the excellent nuts
                    which some of the species produce. The timber is both strong and heavy, and
                    remarkable for its extreme elasticity, but it is not much used either for
                    shipbuilding or for architectural purposes, as it decays rapidly when exposed to
                    heat and moisture, and is peculiarly subject to the attacks of worms. It is very
                    extensively employed in manufacturing musket stocks, axle-trees, screws, rake
                    teeth, the bows of yokes, the wooden rings used on the rigging of vessels, chair
                    backs, axehandles, whip-handles, and other purposes requiring great strength and
                    elasticity. Its principal use in America is for hoop-making; and when it is
                    remembered how large a proportion of the productions of the United States is
                    packed in barrels, some estimate may be formed of the consumption of hoops and
                    of the consequent demand for hickory wood, which is the only American wood found
                    perfectly fit for that purpose.</p>
                <p>The wood of the hickory is of great value as fuel, on account of the brilliancy
                    with which it burns and the ardent heat which it gives out, the charcoal being
                    heavy, compact, and long-lived. The species which furnish the best wood are <hi
                    rend="italic">Carya alba</hi> (shell-bark hickory), <hi rend="italic">C.
                    tomentosa</hi> (mockernut), <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >olivaeformis</hi> (pecan or pacane nut), and <hi rend="italic">C. pοrcina</hi>
                    (pig-nut), that of the last-named, on account of its extreme tenacity, being
                    preferred for axle-trees and axe-handles. The wood of <hi rend="italic">C.
                    alba</hi> splits very easily and is very elastic, so that it is much used for
                    making whip-handles and baskets; the whip-handles are greatly esteemed for their
                    suppleness, and considerable numbers of them are annually imported into England.
                    The wood of this species is also used in the neighbourhood of New York and
                    Philadelphia for making the back bows of Windsor chairs. The timber of <hi
                    rend="italic">C. amara</hi> anl <hi rend="italic">C. aquatica</hi> is considered
                    to be of inferior quality.</p>
                <p>Most of the hickories form fine-looking noble trees of from 60 to 90 feèt in
                    height, with straight, symmetrical trunks, well-balanced ample heads, and bold,
                    handsome, pinnated foliage. When confined in the forest they shoot up 50 or 60
                    feet without branches, but when standing alone they expand into a fine head, and
                    produce a lofty round headed pyramid of foliage. They have, observes Downing,
                    all the qualities which are necessary to constitute fine graceful park trees,
                    and are justly entitled to a place in every considerable plantation. The most
                    ornamental of the shell-bark hickory because of the roughness of its bark, which
                    becomes loosened from the trunk in long scales bending outwards at the
                    extremities and adhering only by the middle. The nuts are much esteemed in all
                    parts of the States, and are exported in considerable quantities tσ Europe. The
                    pecan-nuts, which come from the Western States, are from an inch to an inch and
                    a half long, smooth, cylindrical, pointed at the ends, and thin-shelled, with
                    the kernels full, not like those of most of the hickories divided by partitions,
                    and of delicate and agreeable flavour. The thick-shelled fruits of the pig-nut
                    are generally left on the ground for swine, squirrels, &amp;c., to devour. In
                    <hi rend="italic">C. amara</hi> the kernel is so bitter that even the squirrels
                    refuse to eat it.</p>
