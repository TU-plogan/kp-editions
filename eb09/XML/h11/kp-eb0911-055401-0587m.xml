                    to us by one of six very distinct senses.</p>
                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="italic">Sense of Heat—</hi> The sense of touch, as commonly meant,
                    has two distinct objects—force and heat. If a person stretches out his hand till
                    it meets anything solid, or holds it out while something solid is placed upon
                    it, he experiences a sensation of force. He perceives resistance to the previous
                    motion of his hand in one case, in the other case the necessity of resisting to
                    prevent his hand from being forced downwards; the immediate object of this
                    perception in each case is force.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The sense of smoothness and roughness to which physiologists
                    have sometimes given the special name “tactile sense” is as clearly a sense of
                    force as is what they call the muscular sense. The sense of roughness is a sense
                    of force at places of application distributed over the skin of the finger, while
                    in the muscular sense of force the place of application on a larger scale is
                    distinguished by the position of the hand perceiving the force. The internal
                    mechanism of tissue and nerves in one case and that of muscles in the other,
                    through which the perception of places of application of force is obtained, are
                    no doubt different, but the thing perceived is essentially the same—force—the
                    complete discrimination of which involves magnitude of the force, its place of
                    application, and its direction.</p></note> But there is another very distinct
                    sensation, that of heat or cold, which he may or may not perceive in either of
                    those cases, and which he may also perceive, still by what is commonly called
                    the sense of touch, in other cases even when no sense of force is also
                    experienced. Thus, in the first case, if the solid be a fixed can of warm water,
                    or of iced water, the person perceives a sense of heat or of cold; and,
                    supposing him to have performed the operation with his eyes shut, his mind is
                    informed by the double sense of touch that his hand has met with a hot fixed
                    body or a cold fixed body: in the other case he may perceive that a hot heavy
                    solid, or a cold heavy solid, has been laid upon his hand. But if he dips his
                    hand gently into a can of water, or if he holds it towards a fire, or if he
                    exposes it to a gentle current of air, or waves it about through the air, he
                    perceives heat or cold without any accompanying sense of force.</p>
                <p>The earliest scientific thoughts respecting these sensations of heat and cold
                    must have led to the true conclusion that there is some property of external
                    matter on which the sensations depend, and a little advance into the natural
                    philosophy of the subject has suggested and proved that this property is also
                    possessed by the living body, and that the sensatiou of heat or cold in the
                    hand, in the instances <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n588/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0588-0555"/> referred to above, depends on the change produced
                    in the hand in respect to this property by a change of circumstances which
                    preceded the sensation. We now call heat the property of matter concerned in
                    these sensations, and temperature a certain variable quality of matter varying
                    according to its temporary condition in respect to heat.</p>
                <p>In the strictest modern scientific language (compare § 3 below) the word heat is
                    used to denote something communicable from one body or piece of matter to
                    another, and temperature a definite variable quality of matter, varying
                    generally in any particular piece of matter when heat is communicated to it or
                    taken from it, varying also as we shall see (§§ 8 and 9 below; also <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thermodynamics)</hi> in consequence of operations which can
                    take place within the body itself, or which may be performed upon it from
                    without, but which cannot be described as communication of heat to it or drawing
                    off of heat from it.</p>
                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Latent Heat.—</hi> There are exceptional cases in which
                    temperature does not vary in a mass of matter when heat is communicated to it
                    from, or taken from it to, external matter. For instance, when the body is ice
                    at the melting point, heat communicated to it does not raise its temperature; or
                    if the body be water at the freezing point with ever so small a piece of ice in
                    it (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Matter, Properties of),</hi> heat taken from it
                    does not cause its temperature to fall; or if the whole mass considered be ice
                    and water well mixed, heat may be either communicated to it or taken from it
                    without altering its temperature; or if the body be water at the boiling point
                    in the open air, heat very slowly communicated to it in however great quantities
                    does not raise its temperature sensibly, but causes it to disappear by
                    evaporation from its surface; or if the body be steam in a cylinder with a
                    little water in the bottom and with a frictionless piston above it for roof
                    (fig. 1), under atmospheric pressure, heat taken from it very slowly does not
                    cool it until the whole steam has become condensed into water, and heat
                    communicated to it very slowly does not warm it until the whole water has become
                    evaporated into steam; or if the body be ice (or frozen water), in place of the
                    liquid water of the last case, and if the pressure on the upper side of the
                    piston, instead of atmospheric pressure of about 1033 grammes per square
                    centimetre (14 ’ 7 lb per square inch), be anything less than ∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of a gramme per
                    square centimetre, the same statement will still apply with “ice” substituted
                    for water. Black’s celebrated doctrine of latent heat is merely the declaration
                    of a class of phenomena of which the preceding illustrations sufficiently
                    indicate the character. Modern mysticism has been much exercised in respect to
                    the terms sensible heat and latent heat, whether in decrying them, or in
                    continuing to use them, but with aggravating haziness, instead of the clear
                    wrongness of the old doctrine. It has become of late years somewhat the fashion
                    to decry the designation of latent heat, because it had been very often stated
                    in language involving the assumption of the materiality of heat.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A hundred years ago those
                    deeper philosophers who in their judgment anticipated, or tended to anticipate,
                    what we now know to be the true theory of the nature of heat, had indeed good
                    grounds to be jealous of even the phrase <hi rend="italic">latent heat.</hi>
                    Maxwell says—“It is worthy of remark that Cavendish, though one of the greatest
                    chemical discoverers of his time, would not accept the phrase <hi rend="italic"
                    >latent heat.</hi> He prefers to speak of the generation of heat when steam is
                    condensed, a phrase inconsistent with the notion that heat is matter, and
                    objects to Black s term as relating ‘to an hypothesis depending on the
                    supposition that the heat of bodies is owing to their containing more or lessof
                    a substance called the matter of heat; and, as I think Sir Isaac Newton’s
                    opinion that heat consists in the internal motion of the particles of bodies
                    much the most probable, I chose to use the expression <hi rend="italic">heat is
                    generated ’ {Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1783, quoted by Forbes). We shall not now be in
                    danger of any error if we use latent heat as an expression meaning neither more
                    nor less than this :—</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Definition.—</hi><hi

                    Heat,</hi> pp. 72, 73.</p></note> Now that we know heat to be a mode of motion,
                    and not a material substance, the old “impressive, clear, and wrong” statements
                    regarding latent heat, evolution and absorption of heat by compression, specific
                    heats of bodies and quantities of heat possessed by them, are summarily
                    discarded. But they have not yet been generally enough followed by equally clear
                    and concise statements of what we now know to be the truth. A combination of
                    impressions surviving from the old erroneous notions regarding the nature of
                    heat with imperfectly developed apprehension of the new theory has somewhat
                    liberally perplexed the modern student of thermodynamics with questions
                    unanswerable by theory or experiment, and propositions which escape the merit of
                    being false by having no assignable meaning. There is no occasion to give up
                    either “sensible heat” or “latent heat”; and there is a positive need to retain
                    the term latent heat, because if it were given up a term would be needed to
                    replace it, and it seems impossible to invent a better. Heat given to a
                    substance and warming it is said to be sensible in the substance. Heat given to
                    a substance and not warming it is said to become latent. These designations
                    express with perfect clearness the relation of certain material phenomena to our
                    sensory perception of them. Thus when heat given to a quantity of water warms
                    it, the heat becomes sensible to a hand held in the water. When a basin of warm
                    water and a basin of water and ice are placed side by side, a hand dipped first
                    in one and then in the other perceives the heat. If now the warm water be poured
                    into the basin of ice and water, and stirred for a few seconds of time (unless
                    there is enough of warm water to melt all the ice), the hand perceives no
                    warmth; on the contrary, it perceives that the temperature is the same as it was
                    in the basin of ice and water at the beginning. Thus the heat which was sensible
                    in the basin of warm water has ceased to be sensible in the water that was in
                    that basin, and has not become sensible in the other. It is therefore well said
                    to have become latent.</p>

                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">Calorimetry by Latent Heat.—</hi> The doctrine of latent
                    heat leads us very smoothly to a most important measurement in thermal science,
                    the measurement of quantities of this wonderful property of matter which we call
                    heat; and this without our knowing anything of what the nature of heat is,
                    —whether it be a subtle elastic fluid, or a state of motion, or possibly some
                    modification of matter related to action of force. Without, in the first place,
                    admitting into our minds any definite idea as to the nature of heat, we may
                    agree to measure quantities of heat by quantities of ice melted into water
                    without change of temperature. Thus if a kilogramme of ice is melted by a large
                    quantity of water at a lukewarm temperature, or by a comparatively small
                    quantity of very hot water, the same quantity of heat has certainly gone from
                    the warm water to the ice in each case, supposing that the result in each case
                    is the ice and warm water left all in a state of ice-cold water. The measurement
                    of quantities of heat, whether thus by the melting of ice, or by any other
                    means, received the name of “Calorimetry,” when the essence of heat was supposed
                    to be a fluid, and this fluid called caloric. The name calorimetry is still by
                    general consent retained to designate measurement of quantities of heat, as
                    distinguished from thermometry, or <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0589-0556"/> the measurement of temperature ( § 10-67). As
                    long as the truth or falsity of the materialistic hypothesis seemed an open
                    question, the word caloric was held to imply the materiality of heat. Thus Davy,
                    after discussing some of the fundamental dogmas of the “Calorists,” as he called
                    them, and describing his own experiments, which proved beyond all doubt the
                    falsity of their fundamental hypothesis that heat is matter, varied the
                    statement of his conclusion by saying, “or caloric does not exist.” While
                    accepting Davy’s conclusion, however, we need not accept this way of stating it;
                    and as most of our best modern writers still use the word calorimetry, and as
                    French writers have, in comparatively recent times, introduced the word
                    “calorie” to designate a unit quantity of heat, it is decidedly convenient still
                    to retain the name caloric to denote definitely the measurable essence of heat.
                    This is convenient scientifically as tending to give precision to language and
                    ideas respecting the two classes of measurement, calorimetry and thermometry;
                    and it has the advantage of leaving the more popular word heat available for
                    that somewhat lax general usage, from which we cannot altogether displace it, in
                    which it may sometimes mean high temperature, as when we speak of great heat, or
                    summer heat, or blood heat, sometimes a measurable quantity of heat, as in the
                    term latent heat, and sometimes a branch of study or science dealing with the
                    transference of heat by conduction and radiation, as in the title of Fourier’s
                    great work <hi rend="italic">Théorie analytique de la Chaleur,</hi> or the whole
                    province of science concerned with heat, including calorimetry and thermometry,
                    and conduction and radiation of heat, and generation of heat, and dynamical
                    relations of heat, as in English titles of separate books such as Dixon’s,
                    Balfour Stewart’s, and Maxwell’s, or of chapters or divisions of larger
                    treatises, such as even the present article.</p>
                <p>f 4. <hi rend="italic">Calorimetry by Meltiny of Ice.—</hi> Calorimetry was first
                    practised by means of the melting of ice as explained above, and the first
                    thermal unit, or unit quantity of heat, or “calorie,” although not then called
                    calorie, was the quantity of heat required to melt unit weight of ice. This, for
                    example, is the unit on which Fourier founds his reckoning illustratively when
                    he explains the fundamental principles of his theory of the conduction of heat.
                    Ice seems to have been first used for calorimetry by Wilcke, a Swede. For the
                    systematic application of this method for the measurement of quantities of heat
                    in various physical inquiries Laplace and Lavoisier constructed an instrument,
                    the first to which the name of calorimeter was applied, and described it in the
                    memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences for 1780. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> Though in the hands of Laplace and Lavoisier it gave good results, it had
                    a great inconvenience, which with less careful and less scientific experimenters
                    might lead to great inaccuracies, on account of the water adhering by capillary
                    attraction to the broken ice, instead of draining away from it completely and
                    showing exactly how much ice had been melted. To avoid this evil Sir John
                    Herschel suggested that, instead of draining away the water from the ice, the
                    water and ice should all be kept together, and the whole bulk measured. The
                    diminution of bulk of the whole thus gives an accurate measurement of the
                    quantity of ice melted, because ice melting into water comes to occupy just
                    91'675 per cent, of its original volume. This suggestion is admirably carried
                    out by Bunsen <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> in his ice-calorimeter, an
                    instrument possessing also other novel features of remarkable beauty and
                    scientific interest. It is particularly valuable for the measurement of small
                    quantities of heat. Its inventor, for example, by means of it succeeded in
                    making satisfactory determinations of the specific heats of some of those rarer
                    metals, such as indium, of which only a few grammee have been obtained.</p>
                <p>§ 5. <hi rend="italic">Calorimetry by the Evaporation of Water.—</hi> By another
                    application of Black’s doctrine of latent heat, the evaporation of water may be
                    used for calorimetry with great advantage in many scientific investigations. It
                    is used generally in engineering practice, particularly for testing the heating
                    power of different qualities of coal and the economy of various forms of
                    furnaces. The thermal unit, which presents itself naturally in this system, is
                    the quantity of heat required to evaporate unit weight of water when the
                    pressure of the atmosphere as measured by the barometer is of some conventional

                    calorimetry in scientific investigation has been hitherto, however, neither that
                    by the melting of ice, nor that by evaporation of water, nor indeed anything
                    founded on the doctrine of latent heat at all. It has been founded on the
                    elevation of temperature produced in water by the communication to it of the
                    heat to be measured; and, for the sake of distinction from calorimetry by latent
                    heat or otherwise, it maybe called thermometric calorimetry. We can only
                    consider it now in anticipation, as we have not yet reached the foundation of
                    any thermometric scale; but even now we can see that, if in any way we fix upon
                    any two particular determinate temperatures, the quantity of water warmed from
                    the lower to the higher of them by the heat to be measured is a perfectly
                    definite measure for the quantity of this heat. The two temperatures chosen for
                    thermometric calorimetry are those marked 0° and 1° on the centigrade scale. The
                    first of these we can understand at present, being the temperature at which ice
                    melts under ordinary atmospheric pressure. The second is fully defined in §§ 35,
                    37, 51, 67. The quantity of heat required to raise unit mass of water (1
                    kilogramme, or 1 gramme, or 1 milligramme, or 1 lb, as the case may be) from
                    zero to 1° C. is called the thermal unit centigrade, and sometimes, especially
                    by French writers, the “calorie.”</p>

                    Black’s original determination, which made it 142 thermal units Fahr.,— this
                    being equal to 78’9 thermal units centigrade. Thus if one kilogramme of ice be
                    put into 79-∣ kilogrammes of water at 1° C., and left till the whole is melted
                    (the process may be accelerated by not too violent stirring, § 9), the result

                    Calarimetry.—</hi> From the dawn of science till the close of last century two
                    rival hypotheses had been entertained regarding the nature of heat, each with
                    more or less of plausibility, but neither on any sure experimental basis: — one
                    that heat consisted of a subtle elastic fluid permeating through the pores or
                    interstices among the particles of matter, like water in a sponge; the other
                    that it was an intestine commotion among the particles or molecules of matter.
                    In the year 1799 Davy, in his first published work entitled <hi rend="italic">An

                    gave good reason for accepting as true the latter, by his celebrated experiment
                    of converting ice into water by rubbing two pieces of ice together, without
                    communicating any heat from surrounding matter. A few years earlier Rumford had
                    been led to the same conclusion, and had given very convincing evidence of it in
                    his observation of the great amount of heat produced in the process of boring
                    cannon in the military arsenal at Munich, and the experimental investigation on

                    however, given a perfect logical demonstration of his conclusion, nor even quite
                    a complete experimental basis on which it could be established with absolute
                    certainty. According to the materialistic doctrine it would have been held that
                    the heat excited by the friction was not <hi rend="italic">generated,</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare quotation from

                    honey from a broken honeycomb, from those parts of the solid which were cut or
                    broken into small fragments, or rubbed to powder in the frictional process. If
                    this were true, the very small fragments or powder would contain much less heat
                    in them than an equal mass of continuous solid of the same substance as theirs.
                    But unhappily the caloristic doctrine, besides its fundamental hypothesis, which
                    we now know to be wrong, had given an absurd and illogical test for quantity of
                    heat in a body, of which a not altogether innocuous influence still survives in
                    our modern name “specific heat and Rumford actually, in trying to disprove the
                    materialistic doctrine, was baffled by this sophism. That is to say, he measured
                    the specific heat or “capacity for heat” of the powder, and he found that the
                    powder took as much heat to warm it to a certain degree as did an equal mass of
                    the continuous solid, and from this he concluded that the powder did not contain
                    less heat than the continuous solid at the same temperature. This conclusion is
                    so obviously unwarranted by the premises that it is difficult to imagine how
                    Rumford could have for a moment put forward the “capacity for heat” experiment
                    as proving it, or could have rested in the conclusion without a real proof, or
                    at least the suggestion of a real proof. All that Rumford’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >argument</hi> proved was that the fundamental hypothesis of the “calorists” and
                    their other altogether gratuitous doctrine of equality of “specific heat” as a
                    test for equality of whole quantities of heat in matter could not be both true;
                    and any one not inclined to give up the materialistic hypothesis might have
                    cheerfully abandoned the minor doctrine, and remained unmoved by Rumford’s
                    argument. If Rumford had but melted a quantity of the powder (or dissolved it in
                    an acid), and compared the heat which it took with that taken by an equal weight
                    of the continuous solid, he would have had no difficulty in proving that the
                    enormous quantity of heat which he had found to be excited by the friction had
                    not been squeezed, or rubbed, or pounded, out of the solid matter, but was
                    really brought into existence, and therefore could not be a material substance.
                    He might even, without experiment, have pointed out that, if the materialistic
                    doctrine were true, it would follow that sufficiently long-continued pounding of
                    any solid substance by pestle and mortar, whether by hand or by aid of
                    machinery, would convert it into a marvellous powder possessing one or other of
                    two properties about equally marvellous. Either the smallest quantity of it
                    thrown into an acid would constitute a freezing mixture of unlimited
                    intensity,—the longer it had been pounded, the more intense would be its
                    frigorifie effect on being dissolved, —or the powder would be incapable of being
                    warmed by friction, because it had already parted with all the heat which
                    friction could rub out of it. The real effect of Rumford’s argument seems to
                    have been to salve the intellectual consciences of those who were not inclined
                    to give up the materialistic doctrine, and to save them from the trouble of
                    reading through Rumford’s paper and thinking for themselves, by which they would
                    have seen that his philosophy was better than his logic, and would inevitably
                    have been forced to agree with him in his conclusion. It is remarkable that
                    Davy’s logic, too, .was at fault, and on just the same point as Rumford’s, but
                    with even more transparently logical fallaciousness, because his argument is put
                    in a more definitely logical form.</p>

                    took place only at the plane of contact of the two pieces of ice, and no bodies
                    were in friction but ice. From this experiment it is evident that ice by
                    friction is converted into water, and, according to the supposition, its

                    science in the thermodynamics of electricity, and magnetism, and
                    electro-chemistry, recalled attention to Davy and Rumford’s doctrine regarding
                    the nature of heat, and supplied several fresh proofs, each like Davy’s
                    absolutely in itself complete and cogent, that heat is not a material substance,
                    and each advancing with exact dynamical measurement on the way pointed out by
                    Rumford in his measurement of the quantity of heat generated in a certain time
                    by the action of two horses not urged to overwork themselves. The full
                    conversion of the scientific world to the kinetic theory of heat took place
                    about the middle of this century, and was no doubt an immediate consequence of
                    Joule’s work, although Rumford and Davy’s demonstrative experiments, and the
                    ingenious and penetrating speculations of Mohr, and Séguin, and Mayer, and the
                    experimental thermodynamic measurements of Colding, all no doubt contributed to
                    the result. Each of the several subjects of thermodynamic measurement undertaken
                    by Joule gave him a means of estimating the quantity of work required to
                    generate a certain quantity of heat; but after several years of trials be was
                    led to prefer to all others the direct method of simply stirring a quantity of
                    water by a paddle, and measuring the quantity of heat produced by a measured
                    quantity of work; and this method he has accordingly used in all his experiments
                    for the purpose of determining the “dynamical equivalent of heat” from the year
                    1845 to the present time. By this he found his final result of 1849,<note

                    transmission of electrical currents through resistances measured by the unit
                    they had issued, I undertook experiments with that view, resulting in a larger

                    capacity of water at different temperatures from 0’ to 230° C., it must be about
                    Ό8 per cent, greater at 60° Fahr, than at 32°. According to this, Joule’s
                    thermodynamic result would be 771'81 Manchester foot-pounds, for the work
                    required to warm a pound of water from 32° to 33° Fahr., or 1389 ’ 26 to warm a
                    pound of water from 0° to 1° C. Reducing 1389 ’ 26 feet to metres, we have 423
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 437 metres. At Paris the force of gravity is
                    about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛θ per cent, less than in Manchester. Hence
                    for about the middle of France and the southern latitudes of Germany, Joule’s
                    result, according to the ordinary reckoning of French and German engineers, may
                    be stated as 423 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 kilogramme-metres for the

                    Multiplying 423 ’ 437 by this, we find accordingly 41,553,000 centimetre-dynes,
                    or “ergs,” for the amount of work in C.G.S. measure required to warm 1 gramme of

                <p>§ 10. <hi rend="italic">Preliminary for Thermometry.—Sense of Heat (resumed
                    from</hi> § 1).—The sense of heat and cold is not simply dependent on the
                    temperature of the body touched. If a person takes a piece of iron, or a stone,
                    or a piece of wood, or a ball of worsted, or a quantity of finely carded
                    cotton-wool, or of eider down, in his hand, or touches an iron column, or a
                    stone wall, or a wooden beam, or a mass of wool or of down, he will perceive the
                    iron cold, the stone cold, but less cold than the iron, the wood but slightly
                    cold—much less cold than the stone, the wool or down decidedly warm.</p>
                <p>We now know that if all the bodies before being touched were near one another in
                    similar exposure, they must have been at the same temperature, and from the iron
                    and stone being felt oold we know that this mean temperature is lower than the
                    temperature of the hand. Each of the bodies touched must at the first instant
                    have taken some heat from the hand, and therefore, if the perception were quick
                    enough, all at the very instant of being touched would have seemed cold to the
                    sense. The iron by its high thermal conductivity (§§ 76, 78, 80) keeps drawing
                    off heat from the hand and lowering its temperature, till after many seconds of
                    time an approximately permanent temperature is reached, which may be
                    considerably lower than the temperature of the hand before·; contact, but
                    somewhat higher than the previous tem-' perature of the iron, because of the
                    internal furnace (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermodynamics)</hi> generating heat
                    in the hand. A similar result, but in less time and with less ultimate lowering
                    of temperature of the hand, takes place when stone is touched. When wood is
                    touched its comparatively small conductivity (§ 76) allows its surface to be
                    warmed again after the first few seconds, sometimes to a higher temperature<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n592/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0592-0559"/> than that of the hand before contact; and thus,
                    if the sensation could be perfectly remembered, it would be perceived that the
                    wood was first felt to be cold, and afterwards to be warm. This latter warmth is
                    rendered very perceptible by first holding the hand in contact with a piece of
                    wood, as for instance a mahogany table, for a considerable time, half a minute
                    or more, and then suddenly removing it; a sense of cold is immediately perceived
                    in consequence of the exposure of the hand to the air. The foot is similarly
                    sensitive. If, after holding a bare foot for some time in the air, it be placed
                    on a varnished wooden floor, the floor is perceived to be cold, and if, after
                    standing some time with it pressed to the floor, the foot be suddenly lifted,
                    the air now seems cold by contrast. If a person walks with bare feet on a wooden
                    floor, a continued sense of cold is experienced; and if, immediately after doing
                    so, he sits down, and holds his feet in the air, the air seems to be warm by
                    contrast. The same sensations are perceived even on a carpeted floor, but much
                    less markedly than on a plain wooden floor, and much less markedly on a plain
                    wooden floor than on a varnished wooden floor, and much less markedly on a
                    varnished wooden floor than on a stone floor. In the case of touching soft wool,
                    or finely carded cotton-wool, or eider down, the first instantaneous sensation
                    of cold is scarcely if at all perceived, and that which first provokes
                    consciousness is the subsequent heating; and it is very startling to find a body
                    which we know to be ice-cold on a frosty day feeling positively warm to the
                    first consciously perceptible sensation after it is touched. In this case the
                    small thermal conductivity c? great thermal resistance of the substance is such
                    that heat is carried off by it from the hand slower than it was carried off by
                    radiation and aerial convection (§§ 70, 71) before contact; and thus, after the
                    first momentary cooling of the hand by the initial cataract of heat from it to
                    the cold body touched, in a small fraction of a second of time a higher
                    temperature is attained by the hand than it had before contact.</p>
                <p>§ 11. <hi rend="italic">Sense of Temperature.—</hi> The sense of heat is in
                    reality a somewhat delicate thermal test when properly used. Even an unskilled
                    hand alternately dipped into two basins of water will, as we have found by
                    experiment, detect a difference of temperature of less than a quarter of a
                    degree centigrade; and there can be no doubt that bath and hospital attendants,
                    and persons occupied with hot liquors in various manufactures, such as dyeing,
                    can detect much smaller differences of temperature than that, and, what is still
                    more remarkable, can remember permanently sensations of absolute temperature
                    sufficiently to tell within less than a degree centigrade that the temperature
                    of a bath, or a poultice, or dyeing liquor is “blood heat,” or “fever heat,” or
                    some other definite temperature to which they have been accustomed.</p>
                <p>§ 12. <hi rend="italic">Thermometry by Sense of Heat—with arbitrary Centigrade
                    Scale deduced from Mixtures of Hot and Cold Water.—</hi> Without knowing
                    anything of the nature of heat we might found a complete system of thermometry
                    on the mixing of hot and cold water with no other thermoscope (§ 13) than our
                    sense of heat, if we had but two definite constant temperatures of reference.
                    These in practical thermometry are supplied by the melting-point of ice and the
                    temperature of steam from water boiling in air at a definite pressure (the
                    “atmo” or standard atmosphere, § 5). Thus, suppose perfectly abundant supplies
                    of iced water and of water at the boiling temperature to be available, and
                    suppose it to be desired to measure the temperature of a river, or lake, or sea.
                    Take measured quantities of the boiling and of the ice-cold water, and mix them
                    by trial until, tested by the hand, the mixture is found to have the same
                    temperature as that of the mass of water of which the temperature is to be
                    determined. Suppose, for example, the mixture giving the required temperature to
                    consist of 86 ’ 6 parts by weight of ice-cold water, and 13 ’ 4 parts by weight
                    of boiling water; the required temperature is 13 ’ 4 on a perfectly definite
                    scale of thermometry in which the temperature of ice-cold water is called zero,
                    that of boiling water 100, and other temperatures are reckoned according to the
                    law of proportion of mixtures of water in the manner indicated by the example,
                    and defined generally in § 31 below. For temperatures within the range of
                    sensibility of the hand this method would give more accurate results than many
                    common thermometers sold by instrument makers for ordinary popular purposes. It
                    may be relied upon for absolute accuracy within ⅛ths of a degree centigrade,
                    provided the mixing of hot and cold water is performed with sufficiently large
                    quantities of water, and with all proper precautions to obtain in that part of
                    the process all the accuracy obtainable by the living thermoscope.</p>
                <p>We shall see (§ 25) that with the most accurate mercury or air thermometers, made
                    for scientific investigation and carefully tested, absolute determinations can
                    scarcely be depended upon within <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛th of a degree
                    centigrade. The method of mixtures with only the sensory thermoscope is not
                    limited to the range of temperature directly perceptible with unimpaired
                    sensibility; but when the temperature tc be tested is beyond this range an
                    indirect method must be followed, as thus :—</p>
                <p>A large quantity of water too warm for the hand is to be tested. Mix it with say
                    twice its weight of ice-cold water, this giving a convenient temperature for the
                    hand; then find by trial what proportions of ice-cold and boiling water give a
                    mixture of the same temperature as tested by the hand; suppose these proportions
                    to be 26 ’ 2 of boiling water and 73 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 of
                    ice-cold water. The temperature of the mixture is by definition 26 ’ 2, and on
                    the same principle the required temperature is three times this, or 78 ’ 6.</p>
                <p>This system of thermometry is, however, strictly limited to the range between
                    the. freezing and boiling pointsol water, for we do not at present consider the
                    possibilities (see articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam; Matter, Properties of;
                    Thermody namics)</hi> of obtaining and using thermometrically quantities of
                    water below the freezing point and above the boiling point. It is described
                    here, not only because it is very instructive in respect to the principles of
                    thermometry, but because it is in point of fact the thermometric method used
                    through a large range of processes not only in the arts but in scientific
                    investigation. In many cases the hand is a more convenient and easy test than a
                    common mercury thermo meter, and it has just about the same sensibility, the
                    commonest thermometers in popular use being in fact scarcely to be read to a
                    quarter of a degree centigrade. Ir respect to accuracy a common cheap
                    thermometer, though perhaps a degree or two wrong in its absolute indications,
                    may still be used as an accurate indicator of equality of temperatures just as
                    is the hand in the method of mixtures.</p>
                <p>In many cases the hand is more convenient than the thermometer, in other cases
                    the thermometer is more convenient than the hand, but in many cases the
                    thermometer is applicable when the hand is not. When the quantities of water
                    tested are abundant, the hand is always the quicker test, but there must be
                    abundance of water to allow it to be satisfactorily and accurately
                    applicable.</p>

                <p>§ 14. <hi rend="italic">Intrinsic Thermoscopes.—</hi> An intrinsic thermoscope is
                    an instrument capable of indicating one definite temperature or several definite
                    temperatures, or all temperatures within the range of the instrument, whatever
                    it may be—the temperature or temperatures indicated being intrinsically
                    determined by the constitution of the instrument and indicated by some
                    recognizable feature of the instrument which changes discontinuously or
                    continuously, as the case may be, and which is always the same when the
                    instrument is brought back again and again to the same temperature, whatever
                    changes it may have experienced in the intervals. Discontinuous intrinsic
                    thermoscopes show only a limited number of temperatures. A continuous intrinsic
                    thermoscope shows any temperature whatever throughout the range of efficiency of
                    the instrument, ideally any temperature whatever, though in practice every
                    thermoscope is limited, some with both inferior and superior limit, as the
                    mercury thermometer by the freezing of mercury at about - 39° C., and the
                    bursting pressure of mercury-steam a little above + 360° C.; others with only a
                    superior limit, as metallic thermoscopes, whether thermo-elastic, or
                    thermo-electric, or electric-resistance, or thermo-magnetic, by the melting of
                    their substances at very high temperatures, or, in the case of the
                    thermo-magnetic instrument, by the total or partial loss of its magnetism at
                    some temperature much below the melting point of its substance. A continuous
                    intrinsic thermoscope, when applied to a body whose temperature is changing,
                    shows continuously every variation of temperature within its range of
                    efficiency.</p>
                <p>§ 15. <hi rend="italic">Discontinuous Intrinsic Thermoscopes.—</hi> A single
                    intrinsic thermoscope is a thermoscope which shows whether the temperature of
                    the body to which it is applied is higher or lower than some one definito
                    temperature depending on the intrinsic quality of the instrument.</p>
                <p>Examples:—(1) a piece of ice, or of wax, or of fusible metal; (2) an apparatus
                    for boiling water or other liquid under a perfectly constant pressure; (3) an
                    apparatus for boiling water under the natural atmospheric pressure, and a
                    barometer to measure exactly what the pressure is at the time.</p>
                <p>A multiple intrinsic thermoscope might be made by preparing a graduated series of
                    metallic alloys, numbering them in order of their melting points, and arranging
                    them together conveniently for use. The temperature might be reckoned
                    numerically, according to the number of the alloys that melt, when the whole
                    series is exposed to the temperature to be tested. This discontinuous numerical
                    reckoning of temperature is perfectly analogous to the Birmingham reckoning of
                    wires and sheet metals by numbered gauges. Ideally it may be made infinitely
                    nearly continuous by making a series of alloys with fine enough gradation of
                    composition, but the method is in its essence discontinuous. It is useful for
                    many special applications in science and in the arts, as for instance in that
                    very fundamental one (§ 12) of giving one of the fixed points in the ordinary
                    thermometric scale, the “freezing point also in a form of safety valve for
                    boilers or hot-water pipes, in which a plug fixed by solder is released by the
                    melting of the solder when the temperature reaches a certain limit; also an
                    exceedingly useful guard against overheating in the flue of a stove, by which a
                    stopper is allowed to fall by the melting of a leaden support, and stop the
                    draught, before the temperature reaches the highest limit judged
                    permissible.</p>
                <p>§ 16. <hi rend="italic">Continuous Intrinsic Thermoscop)es.—</hi> Continuity of
                    indication requires, as said above (§ 13), choice of some property or properties
                    of matter varying continuously with temperature, such as those enumerated in §
                    13. A continuous intrinsic thermoscope must have a feature, depending on the
                    chosen property of matter, which shall vary with perfect continuity when the
                    temperature is gradually changed, and shall always be the same when the
                    instrument is brought to the same temperature again and again, whatever
                    variation of temperature it may have experienced in the intervals. The accuracy
                    of an intrinsic thermometer, whether discontinuous or continuous, depends upon
                    permanence of quality of the material and of the mechanical constitution of the
                    instrument, according to which the recognized feature shall always be very
                    accurately the same for the same temperature. The sensibility or delicacy of a
                    continuous intrinsic thermometer depends upon the recognizability of change in
                    its indicating feature with very small change of temperature.</p>
                <p>§ 17. The property of matter chosen as the foundation of almost all ordinary
                    continuous intrinsic thermoscopes in common use is interdependence of the
                    density, the temperature, and the pressure of a fluid. The only other
                    thermc-scopes which can be said to be in common use at all are “metallic
                    thermometers” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermometer; Matter, Properties
                    of);</hi> these depend upon the change of shape of a rigid elastic solid under a
                    stated stress, or on the change of shape of a compound solid, composed of two
                    elastic solids of different substances melted or soldered together. For the
                    present we confine our attention to the former and much larger class of
                    instruments. The general type of all those instruments, except the
                    steam-pressure thermometer (§§ 39-46 below), is a glass measure, measuring the
                    bulk of a fluid. To give the requisite practical sensibility to the measurement,
                    the glass, except for the case of the constant-pressure gas thermometer (§§
                    64-67 below) and of the steam-pressure thermometer, is made of a shape which may
                    be generally described as a bottle with a long narrow neck. The body of the
                    bottle, which may either be spherical or of an elongated form, is called the
                    bulb, and the neck is called the tube or stem (stem we shall most frequently
                    call it, to obviate ambiguities without circumlocutions). The thermometric fluid
                    may be all liquid, as mercury, or oil, or alcohol, or ether, or glycerine and
                    water; or it may be all gas, as common air, or hydrogen, or carbonic acid; or it
                    may be partly liquid and partly steam (steam being a name which we shall
                    invariably use to designate the less dense portion of a fluid substance at one
                    temperature and pressure throughout, and in equilibrium, with two parts of
                    different densities). This last case is different from the two preceding, in
                    respect to the character of the thermometric indication: the whole volume of the
                    thermometric substance may be changed from that of all liquid to that of all
                    steam without changing the temperature or the pressure, and the pressure cannot
                    be changed without changing the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n594/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0594-0561"/> temperature, provided the substance is kept in
                    the double condition of part liquid and part steam; in other words, in this case
                    the pressure depends upon the temperature alone and is independent of the
                    volume. In the steam-pressure thermometer, therefore, there is no delicate
                    measuring of volume of the thermometric substance, and the vessel containing it
                    is not in the shape of bulb and stem; but the instrument consists essentially of
                    a means of measuring the pressure of the thermometric substance, with a test
                    that it is really in the twofold condition of part liquid and part steam,
                    whether by seeing it through a glass containing-vessel, or by a proper hydraulic
                    appliance for ascertaining that the pressure is not altered by rarefaction or
                    condensation when the temperature is kept constant. Realized thermometers of
                    this species, quite convenient for many practical purposes, with steam of
                    sulphurous acid, of water, and of mercury, to serve for different ranges of
                    temperature, from below - 30° C. to above + 520° C., are described in §§ 39-44
                    below.</p>
                <p>§ 18. In respect to general convenience for large varieties of uses, whether for
                    scientific investigation, or for the arts, or for ordinary life, liquid
                    thermometers are generally and with good reason preferred; but the general
                    preference of either mercury or spirits of wine for the liquid, which is so much
                    the rule, is not (§20 below) so clearly reasonable. For ordinary uses in which
                    the thermometer has to be moved about and placed in various positions, gas
                    thermometers are much less convenient, because they require essentially an
                    accurate measurement of pressqre, and generally for this purpose a column of
                    liquid. But when the thermometer is to be kept always in one position, as for
                    instance when it is devoted to testing the temperature of the air indoors or out
                    of doors, Amonton’s air or gas thermometer is really as convenient and as easily
                    read as any liquid thermometer can be: but even it, simple as it is, involves a
                    triple division of the hermetically sealed space, with three different
                    conditions of occupation, —one part occupied by the thermometric substance,
                    another by the pressure-measuring vapourless liquid,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An instrument closely resembling that shown
                    in the drawing (fig.</p><p>2), but with common air instead of hydrogen, was made
                    for the writer of this article, by Casella, about fifteen years ago, and has
                    been used for illustrations in the natural philosophy class in Glasgow
                    university ever since. It is probably an exceedingly accurate air thermometer.
                    When it λvas set up in the new lecture-room after the migration to its present
                    locality in 1870, the tube above the manometric liquid column was cleared of
                    air. To do this the instrument must be held in such a sloping position, with the
                    closed end of the tube down, as to allow the bubble of air always found in it to
                    rise and burst in the bulb. If now the instrument is placed in its upright
                    position, the liquid refuses to leave the top of the tube, and it would remain
                    filling the tube (probably, for ever ?) if left in that position. No violence of
                    knocking which has been ventured to try to bring it down has succeeded. To bring
                    it down a bubble of air must be introduced. The bubble must be very small, so
                    that the pressure of the air which fills it may become insensible when this air
                    expands into the space of the tube left above the manometric column after it
                    descends to its proper theπnoscopic position. Special experiments made for this
                    article in September 1879 showed that in the nine years during which the
                    instrument had remained undisturbed in the lecture-room a very sensible quantity
                    of air (enough to render the temperature indication about 35° C. too low) had
                    leaked from the bulb through the sulphuric acid into the tube above the liquid
                    column. This air was eliminated, and the instrument reset up for use, an
                    operation completed in a minute at any time if need be. Some careful experiments
                    were then made by Mr Macfarlane to ascertain if the pressure of vapour or gas
                    from the sulphuric acid, in the tube, was sensible, with a happily decisive
                    result in the negative. The bulb was kept at a very constant temperature by cold
                    water; the uppermost few centimetres of the liquid column, and the whole of the
                    tube above it, were heated to about 100° C. by steam blown through a glass
                    jacket-tube, fitted round it for the purpose. The height of the manometric
                    column remained sensibly unchanged! Further experiments must be made to
                    ascertain whether or not there is enough of variation of absorption of the air
                    by the sulphuric acid with variation of temperature, and enough of the
                    consequent variation of pressure in the bulb, to vitiate sensibly the
                    thermometric use of the instrument. If, as seems improbable, the answer to this
                    question be unhappily affirmative, a satisfactory negative might be found by
                    substituting hydrogen for common air.</p></note> and the third vacuous: and it
                    is by so much the less simple than the liquid thermometer that in the liquid
                    thermometer the enclosed space is divided into only two parts, one occupied by
                    the thermometric liquid, and the other by its steam, with or without some
                    admixture of common air. For accuracy the air or gas thermometer is superior, we
                    might almost say incomparably superior, to the mercury thermometer, and, though
                    in a much less degree, still decidedly superior to even the most accurate liquid
                    thermometer, on account of the imperfect constancy of the glass
                    containing-vessel.</p>
                <p>§ 19. If we were quite sure of the bulk measurement given by the glass bulb and
                    tube, liquid thermometers would be quite as accurate as gas thermometers. For
                    there is no difficulty in giving any required degree of sensibility to the
                    instrument by making the bulb large enough; and the quality of the liquid
                    itself, hermetically sealed in glass, may be regarded as being as constant as
                    anything we know of in the material world. But, alas for thermometry, the glass
                    measure is not constant! In fact, glass is a substance of very imperfect
                    elasticity <hi rend="smallcaps">(Elasticity,</hi> § 4, vol. vii. p. 797); and it
                    is found that the bulb of a thermometer is not always of the same volume at the
                    same temperature, but that, on the contrary, it experiences uncertain changes
                    exceedingly embarrassing in thermometry. In the course of a few months after a
                    thermometer is filled and sealed, the bulb generally shrinks by some uncertain
                    amount of from t° <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi rend="italic

                    few years this progressive shrinkage ceases to be sensible; but if the
                    thermometer at any time is exposed to the temperature of boiling water or any
                    higher temperature, an abrupt sub-permanent enlargement of the bulb is produced,
                    and the freezing point, if tested for by placing the thermometer in ice and
                    water, is found to be lowered; then again for weeks or months or years there is
                    a gradual shrinkage, as shown by a gradual rising of the freezing point when the
                    thermometer is tested again and again by placing it in ice and water. A very
                    delicate mercury thermometer, which has been kept for years at ordinary
                    atmospheric pressures when out of use, and never when in experimental use
                    exposed to any temperature higher than about 30° C., or much lower than the
                    freezing point, becomes very constant, and probably may never show any change of

                    such range as from - 20° or — 10° C. to + 30° or + 40° C. But the abrupt and
                    irregular changes, produced by exposing the thermometer to temperatures much
                    above or much below some such limited range as that, constitute a very serious
                    difficulty in the way of accurate thermometry by the mercury-in-glass

                <p>Although the greatest care has been bestowed by Régnault, Joule, and all other
                    accurate thermometric-experimenters to avoid error from this cause, we have
                    still but little definite information as to its natural history in thermometers
                    of different qualities of glass, different shapes of bulb, and constructed
                    differently in respect to processes of glass-blowing, boiling the mercury, and
                    sealing the stem. We do not even know whether the excess of the atmospheric
                    pressure outside the bulb over the pressure due to mercury and Torricellian
                    vacuum inside is influential sensibly, or to any considerable degree, in
                    producing the gradual initial shrinkage. If it were so we might expect that the
                    effect of heating the thermometer up to 100° or more at any time would be rather
                    to produce an accelerated shrinkage for the time than what it is found to be,
                    which is a return towards the original larger volume, followed by gradual
                    shrinkage from day to day and week to week afterwards, A careful comparison
                    between two thermometers constructed similarly in all respects, except sealing
                    one of them with Torricellian vacuum and the other with air above the mercury,
                    would be an important contribution to knowledge of this subject, interesting,
                    not only in respect to thermometry, but also to that very fundamental question
                    of physical science, the imperfect elasticity· of solids (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Elasticity,</hi> § 4).</p>
                <p>§ 20. The error of a thermometer due to irregular shrinkages and enlargements of
                    the bulb is clearly the less the greater is the expansion of the thermometric
                    fluid with the given change of temperature. By the investigation of § 30 we can
                    calculate exactly how much the error is for any stated amount of abnormal change
                    of bulk in the bulb. But it is enough at present to remark that for different
                    liquids in the same or in similar bulbs the errors are very nearly in the
                    inverse proportions of the expansions of the liquids. Now (Table III. below) in
                    being warmed from 0° to 1° C. alcohol expands 6 times as much as mercury, methyl
                    butyrate 7 times, and sulphuric ether 8⅜ times. Hence if irregular changes of
                    bulk of the bulb leave, as they probably do in practice, an uncertainty of ⅛ths
                    of a degree in respect to absolute temperature by the best possible
                    mercury-in-glass thermometers used freely at all temperatures from the lowest up
                    to 100° C., the uncertainty from this cause will be reduced to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τi</hi> ⅛th of a degree by using alcohol, or -⅛th by using
                    methyl butyrate instead of mercury; it may therefore, in a glass thermometer of
                    alcohol or of the butyrate, be considered as practically annulled (§ 19) after a
                    few weeks or months have passed, and the first main shrinkage is over.</p>
                <p>§ 21. An alcohol-in-glass thermometer is easily made strong enough to bear a
                    temperature of 100° C., as this gives by the pressure of the vapour an internal
                    bursting pressure of not quite an atmosphere and a quarter in excess of the
                    atmospheric pressure outside. The boiling point of methyl butyrate (Table III.
                    below) is 102° C.; a thermometer of it may therefore be used for temperatures
                    considerably above 100° C., but how much above we cannot tell, as we have not
                    experiments as yet on the pressure of its vapour at temperatures above its
                    boiling point. The pressure of vapour of sulphuric ether (Table VI. below) is
                    too great to allow a thermometer of this liquid sealed in glas3 to be used much
                    above <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 60° or 70° C., but for low temperatures it
                    makes a very valuable thermometer. It was used in 1850 by W. Thomson in finding
                    by experiment the lowering of the freezing point of water, predicted
                    theoretically (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermodynamics)</hi> by J. Thomson in
                    1849 (7Vαns. <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">S. Ef,</hi> and gave a
                    sensibility of 128 divisions to 1° C. Glass thermometers with ether, or
                    chloroform (whose expansion is about 4 per cent, greater than that of ether),
                    were used by Joule and W. Thomson in experiments<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">PhU. Trans,</hi> for 1860,

                    through air, in one of which the sensibility was as great as 330 scale divisions
                    to the 1° C. All these liquids and many others in the modern chemist’s repertory
                    of oils and ethers and alcohols, besides the superior sensibility which they
                    give by their greater expansions, have a great advantage over mercury for some
                    thermometric purposes in their smaller specific gravity. This allows the bulb to
                    be larger, with less liability to break or to give disturbed readings through
                    distortion by the weight of the contained liquid.</p>
                <p>§ 22. Liquids which wet the glass have another great advantage over mercury in
                    their smaller capillary attraction (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Capillary
                    Action,</hi> vol. v. p. 56; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Matter, Properties of)</hi>
                    and in the constancy of their 180° angle of contact with the glass, instead of
                    the much greater absolute intensity of capillary attraction in the mercury, and
                    its very variable angle of contact, averaging about 45° when the mercury is
                    rising, and about as much as 90° when it is falling. On account of these
                    variations the bulb of the mercury thermometer is subjected to abrupt variations
                    of pressure when the mercury is rising or falling. The greatest and least
                    pressures due to this cause are experienced when the angle of contact is
                    respectively least and greatest, and differ by the pressure due to a vertical
                    column of mercury equal in height to the difference of depressions of mercury in
                    a capillary tube of the same bore as the thermometer stem when the angle of
                    contact is changing from one to the other of the supposed extreme values. Hence
                    the mercury in a thermometer rises and falls by jerks very noticeable in a
                    delicate thermometer when looked at with a lens of moderate magnifying power, or
                    even with the naked eye. Dr Joule informs us that this defect is much greater in
                    some thermometers than in others, and that he believes it is greatly owing to
                    the tube being left unsealed for too long a time after the introduction of the
                    mercury (by which it is to be presumed something of a film of oxide of mercury
                    is left on the glass to reappear on the surface of the mercury when it sinks as
                    it cools after the sealing of the end). In Joule’s own thermometers not the
                    smallest indication has ever been detected of what he calls “this untoward
                    phenomenon, which is calculated to drive an observer mad, if he discovers it
                    towards the close of a series of careful experiments.” Their admirable quality
                    in this respect is no doubt due to the great care taken by the maker, Mr Dancer,
                    under Joule’s own instructions, to have the mercury and the interior of the bulb
                    and tube thoroughly clean, and to guard it from exposure to any “matter in its
                    wrong place” until completion of the sealing. But no amount of care could
                    possibly produce a mercury thermometer of moderate dimensions moving otherwise
                    than by jerks of ever so many divisions, if its stem were of fine enough bore to
                    give anything approaching to two or three hundred divisions to the centigrade
                    degree.</p>
                <p>§ 23. One chief objection to the use of alcohol or other volatile liquid for the
                    thermometric substance in ordinary glass thermometers is the liability to
                    distillation of some of the liquid into the stem and head reservoir, unless the
                    glass above the level of the liquid be kept at least as warm as the liquid. On
                    this account a spirit thermometer is not suitable for being plunged into a space
                    w armer than the surrounding atmosphere with the stem simply left to take the
                    temperature to which it comes in the circumstances. But whether for elaborate
                    experimental use, or for the most ordinary thermometric purposes, there is
                    little difficulty in arranging to keep the part of the stem which is above the
                    liquid surface somewhat warmer than at the liquid surface, and this suffices
                    absolutely to prevent the evil of distillation. The only other objection of any
                    grave validity<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is
                    one other objection which, though often stated as very grave against the
                    thermometric use of any other liquid than mercury, we do not admit to be so. It
                    is that when the temperature is rapidly sink <pb corresp="kp-eb0911-0596-0563"

                    behind the descending free surface, detained on the glass, and, trickling slowly
                    down to rejoin the main column, must be waited for before the stationary
                    temperature can be correctly read. We believe that if a fairly inviscid (or
                    mobile) liquid such as alcohol or ether or butyrate of oxide of methyl be used,
                    there will be practically <hi rend="italic">no time lost</hi> from this cause,
                    and certainly no accuracy lost when proper care is taken by the observer. The
                    observer must be on his guard against a possiblyfalse steadiness, through the
                    falling of temperature being <hi rend="italic">momentarily</hi> balanced in its
                    effect on the free surface by the trickling down of liquid from the glass above,
                    when the free surface is still above, or, it may be, has gone down to a little
                    below, the true position for the final temperature.</p></note></p>

                <p>against the use of highly expansive liquids instead of mercury is the difficulty
                    of allowing for the expansion of the liquid in the stem, if it is not at the
                    same temperature as the bulb. With the same difference of temperatures in
                    different parts of the instrument, the error on this account is clearly in
                    simple proportion to the expansibility of the liquid; and therefore, the
                    residual error due to want of perfect accuracy in the data for the allowance
                    will, generally speaking, be greater with the more expansive than with the less
                    expansive liquid. But in every case in which the bulb and stem can all
                    conveniently be kept at one temperature, a thermometer having for its
                    thermometric substance some highly expansive oil or alcohol or ether, or other
                    so-called organic liquid of perfectly permanent chemical constitution, cannot
                    but be much more accurate and sensitive than the mercury thermometer, which has
                    hitherto been used almost exclusively in thermometric work of the highest rank.
                    We shall see (§§ 62 and 64-68) that the ultimate standard for thermometry,
                    according to the absolute thermodynamic scale (§ 34) <hi rend="subscript">
                    r</hi> is practically attained by the use of hydrogen or nitrogen gas as the
                    thermometric substance, but that for ordinary use a gas thermometer can scarcely
                    be made as convenient as one in which the thermometric substance is a liquid.
                    For practical thermometry of the most accurate kind it seems that the best plan
                    will be to use as ordinary working standard thermometers highly sensitive
                    thermometers constructed of some chosen “organic” liquid, and graduated
                    according to the absolute thermodynamic scale, by aid of the thermodynamically
                    corrected air thermometer (§ 62) used as ultimate standard of reference. The
                    great convenience of the mercury thermometer in respect to freedom from
                    liability to distillation and smallness of error on account of difference of
                    temperature between the bulb and stem renders it the most convenient for a large
                    variety of scientific and practical purposes in which the most minute accuracy
                    or the most extreme sensibility is not required.</p>
                <p>§ 24. Without any <hi rend="italic">thermodynamic</hi> reason for preferring air
                    to mercury as thermometric fluid, Regnault preferred it for two very good
                    reasons. (1) Its expansion is 20 times that of mercury and 160 times the cubical
                    expansion of glass, and therefore with air the error due to irregularity in the
                    expansion of the glass is 20 times smaller than with mercury, and small enough
                    to produce no practical defalcation from absolute accuracy in thermometry, as he
                    found by elaborate and varied trials. So far as this is concerned, some highly
                    expansive organic liquids would answer nearly as well as air for thermometric
                    fluid, and would have the advantage of giving a thermometer much more easily
                    used. (2) For an ultimate standard of reference air has the advantage over
                    organic liquids generally, that different samples of it taken at different
                    times, or in different parts of the world, and purified of water and carbonic
                    acid<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Henceforth, to

                    and quicklime, or chloride of calcium, or sulphuric acid, or phosphoric acid,
                    for removing the water.</p></note> by well-known and easily practised processes,
                    are sufficiently uniform to give thermometric results between which the
                    accordance is practically perfect, provided the thermometric plan according to
                    which the different samples are used is the same, or as approximately the same
                    as is easily secured in practice. Two plans for the thermometric use of air
                    naturally present themselves :—(I.) augmentation of volume of air kept in
                    constant pressure; and (II.) augmentation of pressure of air kept in constant
                    volume. Regnault tried both plans, but found that he could only arrange his
                    apparatus to give good results by the second, and on it therefore he founded
                    what he called his “normal air thermometer.” For the sake of perfect
                    definiteness he chose, as the densityof the air in his normal thermometer, the
                    densitywhich air has when at the temperature of melting ice and under the
                    pressure of one atmo. He adopted the centigrade scale in respect to the marking
                    of the freezing and boiling points by 0° and 100°; and the principle which he
                    assumed for the reckoning of other temperatures was to call equal those
                    differences of temperature for which differences of pressure of the air in his
                    normal thermometer are equal. Thus he was led to a definition of temperature
                    expressed by the following formula :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">t=</hi> ιoo <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi> ~ <hi

                    the latter being the temperature of steam issuing from water boiling under the
                    pressure of one atmo. By the most accurate observations which he could make
                    Regnault found for his “normal air” <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> p <hi

                <p>§ 25. Regnault compared with his normal air thermometer thermometers on the same
                    plan of constant volume, but with air at other than the normal density of 1
                    atmo, and with other gases than air; also air and gas thermometers on the plan
                    of constant <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> volume as measured in a glass bulb
                    and stem; also a thermometer founded simply on the dilatation of mercury; also
                    thermometers of mercury in different kinds of glass, each graduated on the glass
                    stem with divisions corresponding to exactly equal volumes of the bore; also <hi

                    measured was weighed, instead of being volumetrically measured by divisions of a
                    long stem as in the ordinary thermometer.</p>
                <p>The whole of this thermometric investigation is full of scientific interest, and
                    abounds with results of great practical value in respect even of the minutest

                <p>(1) The air thermometers with pressure at 0° of from 44 to 149 centimetres of
                    mercury agreed perfectly with the normal air thermometer calculated according to
                    the same formula (2), and nearly the same numerical coefficient 272 <hi

                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 98 (or ’ 0036632~ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>)
                    gave the best agreement for the 44 c.m. pressure, and the somewhat smaller value
                    272,*7 (or O03667 <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi>) for the pressure 149 c.m.</p>
                <p>(2) The hydrogen gas thermometer, with pressure one atmo at 0°, and with its
                    indications calculated according tc <pb break="no"

                    coefficient,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Instead of
                    the <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 003665 of his normal air thermometer,
                    Regnault states that for his hydrogen thermometer he used ‘003652 (which would
                    make the coefficient in formula (2) be 273 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 82
                    instead of 272 ’ 85). But this must surely be a mistake, as he found Ό036678 for
                    the “coefficient of dilatation” of hydrogen calculated from its increase of
                    pressure in constant volume, and ’ 0036613for the coefficient of dilatation
                    observed directly for hydrogen under constant pressures of from 1 to 4 atmos
                    (pp. 78, 80, 91, 115, 116), and he nowhere speaks of having found any smaller
                    value than ’ 003661 for hydrogen.</p></note> agreed perfectly with the normal
                    air thermometer from 0° to 325°.</p>
                <p>(3) The carbonic acid gas thermometer with pressure 46 c.m. at 0°, and its
                    indications calculated with the coefficient 27l ’ 59 (O03682~ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>), agreed perfectly with the normal air thermometer
                    from 0° to 308°.</p>
                <p>(4) The carbonic acid gas thermometer with pressure, at 0°, 74 centimetres (or
                    nearly 1 atmo), calculated with the coefficient 270'64 (O03695~ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) to make it agree with the normal air thermometer at
                    100°, gave numbers somewhat too large for all temperatures from 200° to 323°.
                    The difference seemed to rise to a maximum at about 180°, when it was about ⅜°,
                    and to diminish so as to be only about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛° at the
                    highest temperatures of the comparison. Two sulphurous acid gas thermometers,
                    with pressures 59 c.m. and 75 c.m. at 0°, calculated with coefficients 263 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 6 (<hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 003794 <hi

                    respectively to make them agree at 100° with the normal air thermometer, each
                    gave numbers too small for the higher temperatures by differences increasing
                    gradually from ∣° at 140° to 3° at 320°.</p>
                <p>(5) Air and gas thermometers calculated according to differences of pressure of
                    the gas kept at the same apparent volume (that is to say, with the bounding
                    mercury column at a constant mark on the glass stem of the thermometer) give
                    numbers too small at the higher temperatures by differences gradually increasing
                    up to 2∣° at 350° in the case of <hi rend="italic">Choisi le Roi</hi> crystal, a
                    hard glass without lead, and to as much as 3∣° in the case of ordinary
                    glass.</p>
                <p>In connexion with these observations Regnault remarks that the greatest cause of
                    uncertainty in his air thermometry is the allowance for expansion of the glass.
                    It was only by most carefully made special experiments<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These experiments were made by finding the
                    weight of mercury contained in each bulb and tube at several different
                    temperatures throughout the range through which it was to be used, and thence
                    calculating the bulks according to the density of mercury for the different
                    temperatures found by his independent investigation of the absolute dilatation
                    of mercury by the hydrostatic method, this method being independent of the
                    expansion of the containing glass or other solid.</p></note> on each particular
                    bulb and tube, to determine its expansion throughout the range for which it was
                    to be used, that he succeeded in obtaining the great accuracy which we find in
                    his results, according to which the probable error, whether by his normal air
                    thermometer, or by other air or gas thermometers of those stated above to agree
                    with it perfectly, was not more than from ’ 1 to ’ 15 of a degree for any
                    temperature up to 350°.</p>
                <p>(6) The mercury-in-glass thermometers which Regnault generally used for
                    comparison with his normal air thermometer were overflowing thermometers,
                    because he found that with such he could more easily obtain the very minute
                    accuracy at which he aimed than with the ordinary volumetric thermometers; but
                    the formula by which he calculated temperature from the overflowing thermometer
                    was adapted to give exactly the same result as would have been obtained by the
                    ordinary thermometer with divisions on the stem corresponding to equal volumes
                    of the bore. It must be remembered, however, that this perfect agreement between
                    the volumetric and overflowing thermometers would not be found unless the
                    expansion of the bulb and tube were uniform and isotropic throughout.</p>
                <p>(7) The general results of Regnault’s comparisons of mercury thermometers with
                    his normal air thermometer were given by himself in a diagram of curves from
                    which the accompanying is copied on a reduced scale (fig. 3). It shows that at a
                    temperature of 320° the independent mercury thermometer stands at 329 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8°, the thermometer of mercury in Choisi le Roi
                    crystal at 327 ’ 25°, and the thermometer of mercury in ordinary glass at
                    321’8°; and that the independent mercury thermometer and the mercury in Choisi
                    le Roi crystal stand 10° higher than the normal air thermometer at the
                    temperatures by it of 323° and 345° respectively.</p>
                <p>§ 26. The curve for the independent mercury thermometer is merely Regnault’s
                    graphic representation of his experiments on the absolute expansion of mercury
                    <hi rend="italic">(Relation des Experiences,</hi> vol. i. p. 328). It shows that
                    the addition of bulk given to the same mass of mercury under constant pressure
                    by elevation of temperature iβ for the same difference of temperatures as
                    indicated by his normal air thermometer regularly greater and greater the higher
                    the temperature.</p>
                <p>§ 27. It is interesting to see by the diagram that at the high temperatures all
                    the mercury thermometers keep nearer to the air thermometer than does the
                    independent mercury thermometer, and that tha mercury in ordinary soft glass
                    keeps much nearer to the air thermometer than does the mercury in the hard
                    Choisi le Roi glass. We infer that, still reckoning temperature by the air
                    thermometer, we have regular augmentation of expansion at the high temperatures
                    in all the different glasses, each greater than the augmentation of expansion of
                    mercury, and that this augmentation is greater in the soft ordinary glass than
                    in the hard Choisi le Roi glass, being in the ordinary glass great enough to
                    overcompensate in the resulting thermometric indication the augmenting expansion
                    of the mercury from 100° to 245°; while above 245° in the ordinary glass
                    thermometer, and at all temperatures above 100° in the Choisi le Roi
                    thermometer, the compensation is only partial. Between 0° and 100° the
                    independent mercury thermometer stands regularly lower than the air thermometer
                    by as great a difference as ’ 35° at 50°, where it is a maximum. The curves for
                    the mercury-in-glass thermometers are not shown between 0° and 100°, but it is
                    clear from the diagram that the Choisi le Roi thermometer must, like the
                    independent mercury thermometer, stand lower than the air thermometer, but by a
                    smaller difference, probably only about ’ 2° at 50°; and the ordinary glass
                    thermometer higher than the air thermometer from 0° to 100° by a difference
                    which may be ’ 2° or ∙3° at 50°. This last inference from the diagram is
                    confirmed by Regnault’s table of results facing page 227 of his first
                    volume.</p>
                <p>§ 28. In the best modern thermometers the graduations are actually engraved on
                    the glass; but in most popular thermometers, and in many for scientific
                    investigation, they are on an attached scale of wood, or ivory, or brass, or
                    paper. Some of the best popular thermometers are the German bath thermometers,
                    in which the graduation is on a paper scale guarded by being enclosed in a wide
                    glass tube hermetically sealed round the stem and over the bulb of the glass
                    which contains the mercury, in the manner sho.wn in fig. 4.</p>

                <p>The graduation is clearer and more easily read in this kind of thermometer than
                    in any other. The complete protection of the paper scale against damp and damage
                    afforded by its hermetically sealed glass envelope gives a perennially enduring
                    quality to this form of thermometer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    graduation extending to such temperatures for kitchen use. The result is that it
                    gets injured to the extent of partially browning the hermetically sealed paper,

                    thoroughly trustworthy, when once.well done by the maker of the instrument. For
                    scientific purposes the paper scale was too cheap, and common, and good, to
                    satisfy the ideas of those instrument makers who in Germany and France
                    substituted the heavy graduated slab of opal glass for the paper, while still
                    adhering to the bath thermometer pattern in hermetically enclosing this scale in
                    an outer containing glass tube,—very unnecessarily, as the glass scale, unlike
                    the paper scale, does not require any such protection.</p>
                <p>This is now, however, a thing of the past. At the present time all high-class
                    scientific thermometers are graduated on the glass of the stem without any
                    attached scale of other material. Except in respect to ease of reading the
                    indications this simplest form is, both for popular and for scientific purposes,
                    superior even to the German bath thermometer with hermetically sealed paper
                    scale; and this will be the form intended when we speak of a mercury
                    thermometer, or a spirit thermometer, or a liquid thermometer, without any
                    special qualification.</p>

                    Thermometers.—</hi> The indications of the liquid thermometer depend not only
                    upon the expansion of the liquid with heat; they are seriously modified by the
                    expansion experienced also by the containing solid. The instrument in fact
                    consists of a glass measure measuring the bulk of a liquid. If the bulk of the
                    hollow space in the glass and the bulk of the liquid expand by the same amount,
                    the apparent bulk of the liquid as thus measured will remain unchanged. Now,

                    Theory), and the bulb to be free from internal strain, the glass will, when
                    warmed uniformly, expand equally in all directions, and the volume of the hollow
                    space will be altered in the same ratio as the volume of the glass itself. Hence
                    the indications of the thermometer depend on a difference between the expansion
                    of the glas3 anl the expansion of the liquid.</p>
                <p>§ 30. To define exactly the indications of a thermometer founded on the expansion
                    of a fluid, let the volume of the bore of the stem between two consecutive
                    divisions be called for brevity a <hi rend="italic">degree measure.</hi> The
                    degree measure is habitually made as nearly as possible equal throughout the
                    scale in the best mercury-in-glass thermometers; and, as we shall see (§ 62), it
                    ought to be so in an air thermometer to give indications agreeing with the
                    absolute thermodynamic scale nearly enough for the most accurate practical
                    thermometry. But in practical spirit-thermometers the divisions are made to
                    correspond as nearly as may be to degrees of a standard mercury or air
                    thermometer, and the degree measures are therefore (Table II. below) larger and
                    larger from the lower to the upper end of the scale. For the purpose, however,
                    of comparing the thermometric performances of different liquids, we shall
                    suppose the degree measure to be of equal volume throughout the scale in each
                    case.</p>
                <p>Let N be the number of degree measures contained in the volume of the bulb and
                    stem up to the point marked zero on the scale; and let Dt denote the volume, at
                    any temperature <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> of the degree measure reckoned in
                    absolute units of volume. The volume of the bulb and stem up to zero will be ND
                    <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>. On the supposition of perfect isotropy and freedom
                    from strain in the glass, N will be independent of the temperature and D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> ∕D <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> will be the ratio of
                    the volume of any portion of the glass at temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    to its volume at the temperature called zero, if D <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>
                    denote the volume of the degree measure when the glass is at this zero
                    temperature. Let now L <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> and L <hi rend="subscript">
                    o</hi> denote the volumes of the whole liquid in a thermometer at the two
                    temperatures <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and 0; we have L <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> = ND <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. And if <hi rend="italic">s</hi> be the
                    number of scale divisions marking the place of the liquid surface in the
                    thermometer tube, we have L <hi rend="subscript"> {</hi> ·=(N + s)D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> (</hi>. Hence L <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ∕L <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. Hence s=N (jξyχy - 1) . Hence, if Ei denote
                    augmentation of bulk of the liquid, and E <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    augmentation of bulk of each degree-division of the stem, when temperature is

                    zero temperature, we have <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> =n(L±⅞-1V</p>

                <p>This is the formula for the ordinary liquid thermometer. It is also applicable to
                    the constant pressure air thermometer, in which, with proper instrumental means
                    to keep the pressure constant, air is allowed to expand or contract with
                    elevation or depression of temperature, and its volume is measured in a properly
                    shaped glass measuring vessel. We may arbitrarily determine to take s as the
                    numeric for the temperature which is indicated by any one particular thermometer
                    of this kind, for instance, a methyl butyrate thermometer, or an alcohol
                    thermometer, or a mercury or an air thermometer. But if s = i for any one
                    individual thermometer, it cannot be <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> so for any
                    other. In the first advances towards accurate thermometry it was taken so for
                    <hi rend="italic">the</hi> mercury-in-glass thermometer, and by general consent
                    it was continued so until it was found (§ 25) that different mercury-in-glass
                    thermometers, each made with absolute accuracy, differ largely in their
                    reckonings of temperature.</p>
                <p>§31. <hi rend="italic">Numerical Thermometry.—</hi> In § 12 above, a perfectly
                    definite and very simple basis for numerical thermometry was described, not as
                    having been adopted in practice, but as an illustration of a very general
                    principle upon which reckoning of temperature may be done in numbers. The
                    principle is this. Two definite temperatures depending on properties of some
                    particular substance or substances are first fixed upon and marked by two
                    arbitrary numbers,— as, for instance, the temperature of melting ice marked
                    zero, and the temperature of steam issuing from boiling water under atmospheric
                    pressure of exactly one atmo, marked 100. Then any intermediate temperature <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is obtained by taking <hi rend="italic">t</hi> parts of
                    water at 100° and (100 - <hi rend="italic">t)</hi> parts at 0° and mixing them
                    together. As said in § 12 this method is limited to temperatures at which liquid
                    water can be obtained, and therefore practically it is only applicable between
                    the melting point of ice and the boiling point of wateι <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi>, under ordinary atmospheric pressure.</p>
                <p>§ 32. Any other liquid of permanent chemical constitution might be used instead
                    of water as the thermometric substance in thermometry founded on mixtures; so
                    even might a powdered solid. Oil if used instead of water would have the
                    advantage of being available for higher temperatures; but want of perfect
                    definiteness and constancy of chemical constitution is a fatal disqualification
                    for it as the fundamental thermometric substance for thermometry<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0599-0566"/> by mixtures. Liquid mercury might be used with
                    the advantage of being available for both higher and lower temperatures than
                    water, through a much wider whole range indeed than either water or oil. For use
                    as thermometric substance for the method of mixtures both water and mercury, in
                    the conditions of approximate purity in which they are easily obtained in
                    abundance, have a paramount advantage over all other liquids, in near enough
                    approximation to perfect definiteness and constancy of constitution to give
                    practically perfect thermometric results.</p>
                <p>§ 33. In §§ 12, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32, several distinct definitions of numerical
                    reckoning of temperature have been given. In each of these the differences of
                    temperature which are to be called equal are defined specially, and this is the
                    essence of the thermometric scale in each case (the marking of 0° and 100° for
                    the “freezing” and “boiling” points being common to all as a matter of practical
                    usage and not an essential of the thermometric principle in any case). Thus in
                    §§ 12, 31, and 32 differences of temperature are called equal which are produced
                    by the communication of equal quantities of heat to a given quantity of the
                    particular thermometric substance chosen—water, for example, or mercury; in
                    other words (§ 68 below), this thermometric system is chosen so as to make the
                    specific heat of a particular thermometric substance the same for all
                    temperatures. Again in § 24 differences of temperature are called equal for
                    which the differences of pressure are equal in air of the particular density
                    which air has if its pressure is one atmo when its temperature is “freezing.”
                    This is Regnault’s “normal thermometry.” In § 25 (1), (2), (3), (4), other
                    reckonings of temperature differing essentially from this, though, as Regnault’s
                    experiments proved, by but very small differences, are given simply by the
                    substitution of air of other than Regnault’s normal density, and of other gases
                    than air, for the air of Regnault’s normal thermometer. In § 25 (5) a
                    thermometry founded on a complex coefficiency of change of pressure and volume
                    of a gas and change of volume of some one particular glass vessel is defined and
                    compared with Regnault’s normal thermometry; and in § 25 (6) and (7) the same is
                    done for the ordinary mercury-in-glass thermometer, which depends on a
                    coefficiency of glass and mercury leading to the reckoning of temperature
                    defined in § 30. Again in § 26 and § 24 (I.) is indicated a system of
                    thermometry founded on the absolute dilatation of some fluid, such as mercury or
                    alcohol or butyrate of oxide of methyl or other permanent liquid or air, at some
                    constant .pressure, such as one atmo, with equal differences of temperature
                    defined as those which give equal dilatations of the particular substance chosen
                    as the thermometric fluid. .</p>
                <p>§ 34. Each of all these different definitions of temperature is founded on some
                    particular property of a particular substance. A thermometer graduated to fulfil
                    one of the definitions for one particular substance would not agree with another
                    thermometer graduated according to the same definition for another substance, or
                    according to some of the other definitions. A much more satisfactory foundation
                    for thermometry is afforded by thermodynamic science, which (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thermodynamics)'</hi> gives us a definition of temperature
                    depending on certain thermodynamic properties of matter in such a manner that if
                    a thermometer is graduated according to it from observation of one class of
                    thermal effects in one particular substance, it will agree with a thermometer
                    graduated according to the same thermodynamic law from the same class of effects
                    in any other substance, or from the same or from some other class of effects in
                    another substance. Thus we have what is called the absolute thermodynamic scale.
                    This scale is now in modern thermal science, the ultimate scale of reference for
                    all thermometers of whatever kind (§ 67). It is defined in §§ 35 and 37 after
                    the following preliminary. A piece of matter which we shall call the
                    “thermometric body” or “thermometric substance” must be given, and at each
                    instant it must be throughout at one temperature, whatever operations we perform
                    upon it. For simplicity we shall suppose it to be of one substance throughout.
                    It may be all solid, or it may be partly solid and the remainder gaseous (as the
                    contents of a wholly frozen cryophorus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    one particular temperature in the course of its use be partly solid and partly
                    liquid and partly gaseous (as the contents of a partially frozen cryophorus); or
                    it may be partially liquid and partially gaseous (⅛s the contents of an unfrozen
                    cryophorus or of a “philosopher’s hammer”);<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> or it may be all

                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> If it be all solid

                    Mathematical Theory, part i., chap, i.); but in any case we suppose for
                    simplicity the stress to be homogeneous throughout, and therefore if the
                    thermometric body be partly solid and partly fluid, the stress in the solid as
                    well as in the fluid must be <hi rend="italic">uniform pressure in all
                    directions.</hi> To avoid excluding the case of all solid from our statements,
                    we shall use generally the word <hi rend="italic">stress,</hi> which will mean
                    normal pressure reckoned in number of units of force per unit of area in every
                    case in which the whole or any part of the thermometric body is fluid, and will
                    denote this or any other possible stress when the thermometric body is all
                    solid.</p>
                <p>§ 35. (1) Alter the bulk or shape of the thermometric substance till it becomes
                    warmer to any desired degree.</p>
                <p>(2) Keeping it now at this higher temperature, alter bulk or shape farther, and
                    generate the heat which the substance takes to keep its temperature constant, by
                    stirring water, or a portion of the substance itself, if it is partly fluid, and
                    measure the quantity of work spent in this stirring.</p>
                <p>(3) Bring it back towards its original bulk and shape till it becomes cooled to
                    its original temperature. (4) Keeping it at this temperature, reduce it to its
                    original bulk and shape, carrying off, by a large quantity of water, the heat
                    which it must part with to prevent it from becoming warmed. Find by a special
                    experiment how much work must be done to give an equal amount of heat to an
                    equal amount of water by stirring. Then the ratio of the first measured quantity
                    of work to the second is the ratio of the higher temperature to the lower on the
                    absolute thermodynamic scale.</p>
                <p>§ 36. The following is equivalent to § 35, and is more convenient for analytical
                    use. It is derived from § 35 by supposing the first and third operations to be
                    so small that the ratio defined as the ratio of the two temperatures is
                    infinitely nearly unity, and conversely § 35—our first form of definition of
                    absolute temperature—may be derived from the second, which is to be now given,
                    by passing through a finite range of temperature by successive infinitesimal
                    steps, and applying the second definition to each step.</p>
                <p>§ 37. Let the thermometric body be infinitesimally warmed by stirring a portion
                    or the whole of itself if it be partially or wholly fluid, or by stirring a
                    quantity of fluid in space around it if it be all solid; and during the process
                    let the stress upon the body be kept unchanged. The body expanding or
                    contracting or changing its shape with the heat, as the case may be, does work
                    upon the surrounding material by which its stress is maintained.</p>

                <p>§ 39. Fig. 6 represents a thermometer constructed to show absolute temperature on
                    the plan of example 1, § 38, realized for the case of water and vapour of water
                    as thermometric substance. The containing vessel consists of a tube with
                    cylindric bulb like an ordinary thermometer; but, unlike an ordinary
                    thermometer, the tube is bent in the manner shown in the drawing. The tube may
                    be of from 1 to 2 or 3 millims. bore, and the cylindrical part of the bulb of
                    about ten times as much. The length of the cylindrical part of the bulb may be
                    rather more than <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜θ∙ of the length of the straight
                    part of the tube. The contents, water and vapour of water, are to be put in and
                    the glass hermetically sealed to enclose them, with the utmost precautions to
                    obtain pure water as thoroughly freed from air as possible, after better than
                    the best manner of instrument makers in making cryophoruses and water hammers.
                    The quantity of water left in at the sealing must be enough to fill the
                    cylindrical part of the bulb and the horizontal branch of the tube. When in use
                    the straight part of the tube must be vertical with its closed end up, and the
                    part of it occupied by the manometric water-column must be kept at a nearly
                    enough definite temperature by a sur rounding glass jacket-tube of iced water.
                    This glass jacket-tube is wide enough to allow little lumps of ice to be dropped
                    into it from its upper end, which is open. By aid of an india-rubber tube
                    connected with its lower end, and a little movable cistern, as shown in the
                    drawing, the level of the water in the jacket is kept from a few inches above to
                    a quarter of an inch below that of the interior manometric column. Thus, by
                    dropping in lumps of ice so as always to keep some unmelted ice floating in the
                    water of the jacket, it is easy to keep the temperature of the top of the
                    manometric watercolumn exactly at the freezing temperature. As we shall see
                    presently, the manometric water below its free surface may be at any temperature
                    from freezing to 10° C. above freezing without more than <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θ per cent, of hydrostatic error. The
                    temperature in the vapour-space above the liquid column may be either freezing
                    or anything higher. It ought not to be lower than freezing, because, if it were
                    so, vapour would condense as hoar frost on the glass, and evaporation from the
                    top of the liquid column would either cryophoruswise (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Liquid</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermodynamics)</hi> freeze the liquid
                    there, or would cool it below the freezing point.</p>
                <p>§ 40. The chief object of keeping the top of the manometric column exactly at the
                    freezing point is to render perfectly definite and constant the steam pressure
                    in the space above it.</p>
                <p>A second object of considerable importance when the bore of the tube is so small
                    as one millimetre is to give constancy to the capillary tension of the surface
                    of the water. The elevation by capillary attraction of ice-cold water in a tube
                    of oue millimetre bore is about 7 millims. The constancy of temperature provided
                    by the surrounding iced water will be more than sufficient to prevent any
                    perceptible error due to inequality of this effect. To avoid error from
                    capillary attraction the bore of the tube ought to be very uniform, if it is so
                    small as one millimetre. If it be three millimetres or more, a very rough
                    approach to uniformity would suffice.</p>
                <p>A third object of the iced-water jacket, and one of much more importance than the
                    second, is to give accuracy to the hydrostatic measurement by keeping the
                    density of the water throughout the long vertical branch definite and constant.
                    But the density of water at the freezing point is only <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> ⅛ per cent, less than the maximum density, and is the same as the density
                    at 8° <hi rend="italic">C.;</hi> and therefore when <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> per cent, is an
                    admissible error on our thermometric pressure, the density will be nearly enough
                    constant with any temperature from 0° to 10° C. throughout the column. But on
                    account of the first object mentioned above the very top of the water column
                    must be kept with exceeding exactness at the freezing temperature.</p>
                <p>§ 41. In this instrument the “thermometric substance” (§ 34) is the water and
                    vapour of water in the bulb, or more properly speaking the portions of water and
                    vapour <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n601/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0601-0568"/> of water infinitely near their separating
                    interface. The rest of the water is merely a means of measuring hydrostatically
                    the fluid pressure at the interface. When the temperature is so high as to make
                    the pressure too great to be conveniently measured by a water column, the
                    hydrostatic measurement may be done, as shown in the annexed drawing (fig. 7),
                    by a mercury column in a glas3 tube, surrounded by a glass water jacket not
                    shown in the drawing, to keep it very accurately at some definite temperature so
                    that the density of the mercury may be accurately known.</p>
                <p>The simple form of steam thermometer represented with figured dimensions in fig.
                    6 will be very convenient for practical use for temperatures from freezing to
                    60°. Through this range the pressure of water-steam, reckoned in terms of the
                    balancing column of water of maximum density, increases (Table V.) from 6∣ to
                    202 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 centimetres; and for this therefore a tube
                    of a little more than 2 metres will suffice. From 60° to 140° the pressure of
                    steam now reckoned in terms of the length of a balancing column of mercury at 0°
                    increases from 14 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 88 to 271 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 centimetres; and for this a tube of 280 centimetres
                    may be provided. For higher temperatures a longer column, or several columns, as
                    in the multiple manometer, or an accurate air pressure-gauge, or some other
                    means, such as a very accurate instrument constructed on the principle of
                    Bourdon’s metallic pressure-gauge, may be employed, so as to allow us still to
                    use water and vapour of water as thermometric substance.</p>
                <p>§ 42. At 230° C., the superior limit of Regnault’s high-pressure steam
                    experiments, the pressure is 27 53 atmos, but there is no need for limiting our
                    steam thermometer to this temperature and pressure. Suitable means can easily be
                    found for measuring with all needful accuracy much higher pressures than 27
                    atmos. But at so high a temperature as 140°, vapour of mercury measured by a
                    water column, as shown in the diagram (fig. 8), becomes available for purposes
                    for which one millimetre to the degree is a sufficient sensibility. The
                    mercury-steampressure thermometer, with pressure measured by watercolumn, of
                    dimensions shown in the drawing, serves from 140’ to 280° C., and will have very
                    ample sensibility through the upper half of its scale. At 280° its sensibility
                    will be about 4∣ centimetres to the degree! For temperatures above 280°
                    sufficient sensibility for most purposes is obtained by substituting mercury for
                    water in that simplest form of steam thermometer shown in fig. 6, in which the
                    pressure of the steam is measured by a column of the liquid itself kept at a
                    definite temperature. When the liquid is mercury there is no virtue in the
                    particular temperature <hi rend="smallcaps">0</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> j</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">C.,</hi> and a stream of water as nearly
                    as may be of atmospheric temperature will be the easiest as well as the most
                    accurate way of keeping the mercury at a definite temperature. As the pressure
                    of mercury steam is at all ordinary atmospheric temperatures quite imperceptible
                    to the hydrostatic test when mercury itself is the balancing liquid, that which
                    was the chief reason for fixing the temperature at the interface between liquid
                    and vapour at the top of the pressure-measuring column when the balancing liquid
                    was water (§ 40) has no weight in the present case; but, on the other hand, a
                    much more precise definiteness than the ten degrees latitude allowed in the
                    former case for the temperature of the main length of the manometric column is
                    now necessary. In fact, a change of temperature of 2 ’ 2° in mercury at any
                    atmospheric temperature produces about the same proportionate change of density
                    as is produced in water by a change of temperature from 0° to 10°, that is to
                    say, about 2⅛∙ per cent.; but there is no difficulty in keeping, by means of a
                    water jacket, the mercury column constant to some definite temperature within a
                    vastly smaller margin <hi rend="subscript"> %</hi> of error than 2 ’ 2°,
                    especially if we choose for the definite temperature something near the
                    atmospheric temperature at the time, or the temperature of whatever abundant
                    water supply may be available. If the vertical tube for the pressure-measuring
                    mercury column be 830 centimetres long, the simple mercury-steam thermometer may
                    be used up to 520° C., the highest temperature reached by Regnault in his
                    experiments (Table V. below) on mercury-steam. By using an iron bulb and tube
                    for the part of the thermometer exposed to the high temperature, and for the
                    lower part of the measuring column to within a few metres of its top, with glass
                    for the upper part to allow the mercury to be seen, a mercury-steam-pressure
                    thermometer can with great ease be made which shall be applicable for
                    temperatures giving pressures up to as many atmospheres as can be measured by
                    the vertical height available. The apparatus may of course be simplified by
                    dispensing with the Torricellian vacuum at the upper end of the tube, and
                    opening the tube to the atmosphere, when the steam-pressure to be measured is so
                    great that a rough and easy barometer observation gives with sufficient accuracy
                    the air-pressure at the top of the measuring column. The easiest, and not
                    necessarily in practice the least accurate, way of measuring very high pressures
                    of mercury-steam will be by enclosing some air above the cool pressure-measuring
                    column of mercury, and so making it into a compressed-air pressuregauge, it
                    being understood that the law of compression of the air under the pressures for
                    which it is to be used <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n602/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0602-0569"/> in the gauge is known by accurate independent
                    experiments such as those of Regnault on the compressibility of air and other
                    gases.</p>
                <p>§ 43. The water-steam thermometer may be used, but somewhat precariously, for
                    temperatures below the freezing point, because water, especially when enclosed
                    and protected as the portion of it in the bulb of our thermometer is, may be
                    cooled many degrees below its freezing point without becoming frozen: but, not
                    to speak of the uncertainty or instability of this peculiar condition of water,
                    the instrument would be unsatisfactory on account of insufficient thermometric
                    sensibility for temperatures more than two or three degrees below the freezing
                    point. Hence, to make a steam thermometer for such temperatures some other
                    substance than water should be taken, and none seems better adapted for the
                    purpose than sulphurous acid, which, in the apparatus represented with figured
                    dimensions in the accompanying diagram (fig. 9), makes an admirably convenient
                    and sensitive thermometer for temperatures from + 20° to something far below —
                    30°, as we see from the results of Regnault’s measurements (Table VI.
                    below).</p>
                <p>§ 44. To sum up, we have in §§ 39 . . 43 a complete series of steam-pressure
                    thermometers, of sulphurous acid, of water, and of mercury, adapted to give
                    absolutely definite and highly sensitive thermometric indications throughout the
                    wide range from something much below - 30’ to considerably above 520° of the
                    centigrade scale. The graduation of the scales of these thermometers to show
                    absolute temperature is to be made by calculation from formula (3) of § 38, when
                    the requisite experimental data, that is to say, the values of σ and <hi
                    rend="italic">pκ</hi> for different values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    throughout the range for which each substance is to be used as thermometric
                    fluid are available. Hitherto these requisites have not been given by direct
                    experiment for any one of the three substances with sufficient accuracy for our
                    thermometric purpose through any range whatever. Water, naturally, is the one
                    for which the nearest approach to the requisite information has been obtained.
                    Fur it Regnault’s experiments have given, no doubt with great accuracy, the
                    values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (the steam pressure) and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ</hi> (the latent heat of steam per unit mass) for all temperatures reckoned
                    by his normal air thermometer, which we now regard merely as an arbitrary scale
                    of temperature, through the range from -30° to +239°. If he, or any other
                    experimenter, had given us with similar accuracy through the same range the
                    values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (the density of steam) and &lt;τ (the ratio
                    of the density of steam to the density of water in contact with it), for
                    temperatures reckoned on the same arbitrary scale, we should have all the data
                    from experiment required for the graduation of our water-steam thermometer to
                    absolute thermodynamic scale. For it is to be remarked that all reckoning of
                    temperature is eliminated from the second member of formula (3), and that in our
                    use of it Regnault’s normal thermometer has merely been referred to for the
                    values of <hi rend="italic">pκ</hi> and of 1 — σ, which correspond to stated
                    values of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> The arbitrary constant of integration, <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi>
                    is truly arbitrary. It will be convenient to give it such a value that the
                    difference of values of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> between the freezing point of
                    water and the temperature for which <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is equal to one
                    atmo shall be 100, as this makes it agree with the centigrade scale in respect
                    to the difference between the numbers measuring the temperatures which on the
                    centigrade scale are marked 0° and 100°. We shall see (§ 56 below) that
                    indirectly by means of experiments on hydrogen gas this assignation of the
                    arbitrary constant of integration would give 273 for the absolute temperature 0°
                    C., and 373 for that of 100° C. Meantime, as said above, w e have not the
                    complete data from direct experiments even on water-steam for graduating the
                    water-steam thermometer; but on the other hand we have, from experiments on air
                    and on hydrogen and other gases, data which allow us to graduate indirectly any
                    continuous intrinsic thermoscope (§19 above) according to the absolute scale;
                    and we shall see that by thus indirectly graduating the water-steam thermometer,
                    we learn the density of steam at different temperatures more accurately than it
                    has hitherto been made known by any direct experiments on water-steam
                    itself.</p>
                <p>§ 45. Merely viewed as a continuous intrinsic thermoscope, the steam thermometer,
                    in one or other of the forms described above to suit different parts of the
                    entire range from the lowest temperatures to temperatures somewhat above 520°,
                    is no doubt superior in the conditions for accuracy specified in § 16 to every
                    other thermoscope of any of the different kinds hitherto in use; and it may be
                    trusted more surely for accuracy than any other as a thermometric standard when
                    once it has been graduated according to the absolute scale, whether by practical
                    experiments on steam, or indirectly by experiments on air or other gases. In
                    fact, the use of steam-pressure measured in definite units of pressure, as a
                    thermoscopic effect, in the steam thermometer is simply a continuous extension
                    to every temperature of the principle already practically adopted for fixing the
                    temperature which is called 100° on the centigrade scale; and it stands on
                    precisely the same theoretical footing as an air thermometer, or a
                    mercury-in-glass thermometer, or an alcohol thermometer, or a methyl butyrate
                    thermometer, in respect to the graduation of its scale according to absolute
                    temperature. Any one intrinsic thermoscope may be so graduated ideally by
                    thermodynamic experiments on the substance itself without the aid of any other
                    thermometer or any other thermometric substance; but the steam-pressure
                    thermometer has the great practical advantage over all others, except the air
                    thermometer, that these experiments are easily realizable with great accuracy
                    instead of being, though ideally possible, hardly to be considered possible as a
                    practical means of attaining to thermodynamic thermometry. In fact, for
                    water-steam it is only the most easily obtained of experimental data, the
                    measurement of the density of the steam at different pressures, that has not
                    already been actually obtained by direct experiment. Whether or not, when this
                    lacuna has been filled up by direct experiments, the data from water-steam alone
                    may yield more accurate thermodynamic thermometry than we have at present from
                    the hydrogen or nitrogen gas thermometer (§§ 64 . . 69 below), we are unable at
                    present to judge. But when once we have the means, directly from itself, or
                    indirectly from comparison with hydrogen or nitrogen or air thermometers, of
                    graduating once for all a sulphurous acid steam thermometer, water-steam
                    thermometer, or mercury-steam thermometer, that is to say, when once we have a
                    table of the absolute thermodynamic temperatures corresponding to the different
                    steam pressures of the substances sulphurous acid, water, and mercury, we have a
                    much more accurate and more easily reproducible standard than either the air or
                    gas thermometer of any form, or the mercury thermometer, or any liquid
                    thermometer can give.</p>

                    than the inevitable errors in the reproduction and use of the air thermometer,
                    or of mercury or other liquid thermometers. In temperatures above the highest

                <p>§ 46. We have given the steam thermometer as our first example of thermodynamic
                    thermometry because intelligence in thermodynamics has been hitherto much
                    retarded, and the student unnecessarily perplexed, and a mere quicksand has been
                    given as a foundation for thermometry, by building from the beginning on an
                    ideal substance called perfect gas, with none of its properties realized
                    rigorously by any real substance, and with some of them (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Matter, Liquid, Steam)</hi> unknown, and utterly unassignable,
                    even by guess. But after having been moved by this reason to give the
                    steam-pressure thermometer as our first theoretical example, we have been led
                    into the preceding carefully detailed examination of its practical qualities,
                    and we have thus become convinced that though ldtherto usedin scientific
                    investigations only for fixing the “boiling point,” and (through an inevitable
                    natural selection) by practical engineers for knowing the temperatures of their
                    boilers by the pressures indicated by the Bourdon gauge, it is destined to be of
                    great service both in the strictest scientific thermometry and as a practical
                    thermometer for a great variety of useful applications.</p>

                    aid of any thermαscope, and without any consideration whatever relating to
                    temperature. We shall see in fact that accurate practical solutions of it for

                    of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> for any values whatever of <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 49. The solution for <hi rend="italic">i</hi> thus obtained involves the
                    arbitrary assumption of a particular value of ≠ for each one of the series of
                    curves which we have determinately traced. Hence, to render <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> wholly determinate, something more must be given than <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> as a function of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Now the only thing that can be given respecting temperature for any particular
                    substance before we have a thermometric scale is the relation subsisting between
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> when the temperature is
                    constant. This relation can, with merely a single-tern perature-thermoscope (§
                    15 above), in addition to dynamical instruments, be determined for some one
                    particular temperature; and this, if <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be known for every
                    value of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> is the only
                    additional knowledge required for the determination of <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    for every value of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> For
                    let <hi rend="italic">p ≈f(v)</hi> be the relation between <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">υ</hi> for some one particular temperature, <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
                    If by this we eliminate p from (12) we find</p>
                <p>S=⅛∣&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> s] '&lt;*&gt;≈</p>
                <p>where — , when <hi rend="italic">p=f(v),</hi> becomes a known function of <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> alone. <hi rend="italic">clv</hi></p>
                <p>Hence by integration we find <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> +</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">c]</hi> (15), where F denotes a known function and C an
                    arbitrary constant. Now trace the curve <hi rend="italic">p=f(v) cm</hi> our
                    diagram. It must generally cut every one of the previously drawn determinate
                    series of curves. Hence equation (15), with two arbitrarily assigned constants
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> 0</hi>
                    and C, gives determinately the value of &lt;j&gt; for every one of the diagram
                    of curves, and thus <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is determined for every value of
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ν.</hi> Either of equations (12)
                    then gives <hi rend="italic">t</hi> determinately as a function of <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">υ,</hi> with only the value <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> arbitrary. The
                    information from experiment, regarding the properties of the thermometric
                    substance, on which this determination is founded, consists of a knowledge of
                    the relation between <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">υ ior</hi>
                    any one temperature, and of the value of <hi rend="italic">e - e</hi><hi

                    attainable by purely dynamical operations and measurements, with no other
                    thermal guidance or test than that afforded by a
                    single-temperature-intrinsic-thermoscope (§15), the whole of it has not in fact
                    been explicitly obtained for any one substance. But less than the whole of it
                    suffices to make a perfect absolute thermometer of any given substance.</p>
                <p>§ 50. For this purpose it is not necessary to find <hi rend="italic">t</hi> for
                    all values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">υ:</hi> it is
                    enough to know it for all values mutually related in any manner convenient for
                    thermometric practice. For example, if we could find <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    for every value of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> with <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    constant at some one particular chosen value,—this would give a “constant
                    pressure” absolute thermometer. Or again, if we find <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    for every value of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> with <hi rend="italic">v</hi> kept
                    constant,—this would give us a “constant volume” absolute thermometer. Let us
                    now examine into the restricted dynamic and thermoscopic investigations upon any
                    particular substance, which will suffice to allow us to make of it a standard
                    absolute thermometer of one or other of these species.</p>
                <p>§ 51. <hi rend="italic">Dynamical and thermoscopic investigation required to
                    graduate, according to the absolute scale, a constant-pressure thermometer of

                    proper mechanical means be taken to cause it to flow slowly and uniformly
                    through a pipe, in one short length of which there is a fixed porous plug. If,
                    as is the case with coιρmon air, nitrogen, oxygen, carbonic acid, and no doubt
                    many other gases, the fluid leaves the plug cooler than it enters it, let there
                    be a paddle in the stream flowing from the plug, and let this paddle be turned
                    so as to stir the fluid and cause the temperature, when the rapids are fairly
                    past and the eddies due to the stirring subsided, to be the same as in the
                    stream flowing towards the plug. When, as in the case of hydrogen and of all
                    ordinary liquids, the fluid flows away from the plug warmer than it entered it,
                    let a uniform stream of water be kept flowing in a separate canal outside the
                    tube round a portion of it in which the internal flow is from the plug, and by
                    this means let the temperature of the internal fluid be brought to equality with
                    that which it had on entering the plug. By a separate thermodynamic experiment
                    find how much work would have to be spent in stirring the external stream of
                    water by a paddle to warm it as much as it is warmed by conduction from the
                    internal fluid across the separating tube. Returning now to the internal fluid
                    flowing towards and from the plug, let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> + δp be the
                    pressure in the steady stream approaching the disturbed region, and ∕&gt; the
                    pressure in the steady stream flowing from the disturbed region; and let <hi
                    rend="italic">δw</hi> be the quantity of work done by the paddle per unit of
                    mass of the fluid passing by, reckoned positive in the first case, that namely
                    in which the paddle compensates a cooling effect experienced in passing through
                    the porous plug. In the second case - <hi rend="italic">8w</hi> (in this case a
                    positive quantity) must denote the work done by the paddle upon the supposed
                    external stream of water in the separate thermodynamic experiment. It is to be
                    reckoned per unit mass of the internal fluid, irrespectively of the rate of flow
                    of the external water. Let <hi rend="italic">t</hi> denote the temperature of
                    the fluid according to the thermodynamic scale, and let <hi rend="italic"
                    >8t</hi> denote the infinitely small change of temperature which it must

                    the energy of the fluid per unit mass, in the tranquil stream before and after
                    passing the disturbed region. The work done by an ideal piston pressing the
                    fluid in towards the disturbed regionis (p + δy&gt;)(r + <hi rend="italic"
                    >δv),</hi> and the work done by the emergent stream upon an ideal piston moving
                    before it is <hi rend="italic">pv,</hi> each reckoned per unit of mass, of the
                    fluid. The whole work done on the fluid per unit mass by these ideal pistons is
                    <hi rend="italic">pδv</hi> + vδ^; add to this δw done by the paddle, and we find
                    that, on the whole, an amount of work equal to <hi rend="italic">pδv + vδp +

                <p>Now the paddle and plug together act so as to render the temperatures equal in
                    the tranquil streams at pressures <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and∕&gt; + δy&gt;.
                    But if there were change of temperature its analytical expressior would be <hi

                    1862.</p></note> showed that for pressures of from one to five or six atmos
                    hydrogen gas, common air, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid, all somewhat
                    approximately fulfil the condition of passing through the porous plug without
                    change of temperature,—hydrogen much more approximately, carbonic acid much less
                    approximately, than any of the others. Hence we infer that absolute temperature
                    is somewhat approximately proportional to the volume of the fluid, if any one of
                    these gases be used as the thermometric fluid in a constant-pressure
                    thermometer. We shall presently see that the requisite correction of this
                    statement for the case of hydrogen is so small as to be almost within the limits
                    of accuracy of the most accurate thermometric usage.</p>
                <p>§ 55. In the case of common air, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid, the
                    experiments showed a slight cooling effect upon the fluid in passing through the
                    porous plug; in the case of hydrogen, a much smaller heating effect. According
                    to the rigorous dynamical form of our statement of § 51, we have no right to
                    measure these heating and cooling effects on any scale of temperature, as we
                    have not yet formed a thermometric scale. And it is interesting to remark that
                    in point of fact the thermodynamic experiment described in that section involves
                    the use of a differential thermoscope (§ 13) and not of any intrinsic
                    thermoscope at all; and in respect to this requisite it maybe contrasted with
                    the thermodynamic investigation of § 49 previously, which involved the use, not
                    of any continuous thermoscope, but only of a single-temperature intrinsic
                    thermoscope (§ 14). Now, instead of reckoning on any thermometric scale the
                    cooling effect or the heating effect of passage through the plug, we have to
                    measure the quantity of work (δw) required to annul it, in the case of the
                    majority of gases; and in the case of hydrogen, instead of reckoning on any
                    thermometric scale the heating effect, we have to measure <hi rend="italic">-
                    8w</hi> as explained in § 51. The experiments as actually made by Joule and
                    Thomson simply gave the cooling effects and heating effects shown by mercury
                    thermometers in the tranquil stream towards and from the plug; but the very
                    thermometers that were used had been used by Joule in his original experiments
                    determining the dynamical equivalent of heat, and again in his later experiments
                    by which for the first time the specific heat of air at constant pressure was
                    measured with sufficient accuracy for our present purpose. Hence by putting
                    together different experiments which had actually been made with those

                    case of air, was virtually completed. Thus according to our present view the

                    know the quantity of work required to raise unit mass of any of the fluids
                    concerned through the particular differences of temperature actually shown by
                    the thermometers in the Joule and Thomson experiment. The best way of doing this
                    of course is to take advantage of the best measurements, that is to say
                    Regnault’s, of the thermal capacity of air at constant pressure, and then to
                    calculate according to Joule’s own measurement the dynamical equivalent of the
                    heat required to warm water through one degree of his own thermometers.</p>

                    centigrade at temperatures of from 89° to 93° centigrade. The investigation was
                    not carried out in sufficient detail to give any law of variation of this effect

                    0° to 100° C. under a constant pressure of one atmo, and from the small heating
                    effect discovered in Joule and Thomson’s experiments on the forcing of hydrogen
                    through a porous plug, that the absolute temperature of melting ice is 273'00°,
                    if the unit or degree of absolute temperature is so chosen as to make the
                    difference one hundred between the temperatures of melting ice and of water with
                    steam at one atmo of pressure.</p>
                <p>§ 58. An almost identical number for that most important physical constant, the
                    absolute temperature of melting ice, is obtained from observations on common
                    air, and a not very different number from observations on carbonic acid, the
                    only two gases besides hydrogen for which Régnault <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Expériences,</hi> vol. i. p. 90) measured the expansion under
                    constant pressure, and for which Joule and Thomson made their experiment on the
                    thermal effect of passage through a porous plug. For each of these two gases the
                    thermal effect observed was a lowering of temperature, and was found to vary at
                    different temperatures very nearly in the inverse proportion of the square of
                    the temperature C., by mercury thermometer, with 273 added. Hence nearly enough

                    carbonic acid,</p>

                    melting ice. The values of A found for common air and carbonic acid are ’ 275
                    and 1 ’ 388. Régnault <hi rend="italic">{Experiences,</hi> vol. ii. p. 126)
                    finds JK∕ΠV <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> greater for carbonic acid than for
                    common air in the ratio of 1 ’ 39 to 1 on the average of temperatures from 0° to
                    210°. But he found also that the specific heat of carbonic acid varies greatly
                    with the temperature; and, taking the mean of the values which he finds for it
                    at 0° and 100°, p. 130, as the proper mean for our present purpose, we find for
                    JK∕ΠV <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, a value D29 times its value for common air.
                    From these experimental results we find by the mathematical process below (§ 61)
                    still the same approximate formula (33), but with c== + ’ 0026 for common air
                    and c = +Ό163 for carbonic acid. At constant pressure of one atmo Regnault’s
                    measurements gaveE = ∙36706 for common air, and E = *3710 for carbonic acid; and
                    dividing 100 by these decimals we find respectively 272'44 and 269 ’ 5. The
                    corrections on these numbers by formula (33) to give the absolute temperature of
                    freezing are accordingly + ’ 70 and +4 ’ 4, and the corresponding estimates for
                    the required absolute temperature are 273 14 and 273 ’ 9. Bringing together the

                <p>The close agreement of the results from hydrogen and common air is very
                    satisfactory, and it is interesting to see it brought about with so large a
                    correction calculated from the Joule and Thomson effect. It is also interesting
                    to see the sevenfold larger correction of nearly 5° bringing so nearly the same
                    result from the 1 per cent, larger expansion of carbonic acid. The ⅜ per cent,
                    discrepance which remains between the results from carbonic acid and from
                    hydrogen is not satisfactory, and requires explanation, particularly when we
                    remark that, of five measurements by Régnault <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Experiences,</hi> vol. i. p. 84) of the expansion of carbonic acid under
                    constant pressure of one atmo, all lie within -L per cent, of the mean number ’
                    3710 which 57 <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> he has given, and we have taken, as
                    his result.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding that the Joule and Thomson correction is so much greater for
                    common air than for hydrogen, the result from common air is probably the most
                    trustworthy of the three, because both Regnault’s experiments and Joule and
                    Thomson’s were probably more accurate for air than for either of the other two
                    gases. The true result to one place of decimals may therefore be considered as
                    most probably being 273'1°, but the probability that it is nearer 273 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 1° than 273 0° is scarcely enough to make it worth
                    while to use in any ordinary thermodynamic calculations any other number than

                <p>These formulae must be exceedingly near the truth for all pressures from 0 to 6
                    atmos, because within this range the thermal effects in the Joule and Thomson
                    experiment were very approximately in simple proportion to the differences of
                    pressure on the two sides of the plug. The following table of results calculated
                    from (43) for several pressures of from 0 to 6 atmos is interesting as showing
                    such different expansions for the different cases, determined by thermodynamic
                    theory from Regnault’s measurements of specific heats and Joule and Thomson’s of
                    their particular thermal effect, with absolutely no direct measurement of

                    Regnault. More of direct measurement, to allow a more extensive comparison, is

                <p>§ 64. We are now quite prepared to make a practical working thermometer directly
                    adapted to show temperature on the absolute thermodynamic scale through the
                    whole range of temperature, from the lowest attainable by any means to the
                    highest for which glass remains solid. It is to be remarked that our
                    investigation of § 51, and all the deduced formulae and relative calculations,
                    are absolutely independent of the approximate fulfilment of Boyle’s law by the
                    gases to which we have applied them, and are equally applicable without any
                    approach to fulfilment of Boyle’s law; also that the only experimental data on
                    which are founded our special numerical conclusions of §§ 59 to 63 are
                    Regnault’s measurements of specific heats under constant pressures, and Joule
                    and Thomson’s measurements of the thermal effect of forcing through a porous
                    plug. From these experimental data alone we see by formula (38) of § 61 how to
                    graduate a constant-pressure gas thermometer so that it shall show temperature
                    on the absolute thermodynamic scale. Hence, notwithstanding the difficulty (§ 24
                    above) which Regnault found in the thermometric use of air or other gases on the
                    system of constant pressure, and his practical preference for the
                    constant-volume <pb break="no"

                    importance to construct a practical constant-pressure gas thermometer. This we
                    believe may be done by avoiding the objectionable expedient adopted by Pouillet
                    and Régnault of allowing a portion (when high temperatures are to be measured
                    the greater portion) of the whole gas to be pressed into a cool volumetric
                    chamber out of the thermometric chamber proper by the expansion of the portion
                    which remains in; and instead fulfilling the condition, stated, but pronounced
                    practically impossible, by Régnault <hi rend="italic">(Experiences,</hi> vol. i.
                    pp. 168, 169), that the thermometric gas “shall, like the mercury of a mercury
                    thermometer, be allowed to expand freely at constant pressure in a calibrated

                    designed a constant-pressure gas thermometer to fulfil this condition. It is
                    represented in the accompanying drawing (fig. 10), and described in the
                    following section.</p>

                    temperatures its oxygen attacks mercury. The film of oxide thus formed would be
                    very inconvenient at the surface of the mercury caulking, round the base of the
                    piston, and on the inner surface of the glass tube, to which it would adhere.
                    Besides sooner or later the whole quantity of oxygen in the air must be
                    diminished to a sensible degree by the loss of the part of it which combines
                    with the mercury. So far as we know, Regnault did not complain of this evil in
                    his use of common air in his normal air thermometer (see §§ 24, 25 above), nor
                    in his experiments on the expansion of air <hi rend="italic"

                    some sensible degree. But he found it to produce such great irregularities when,
                    instead of common air, he experimented on pure oxygen that from the results he
                    could draw no conclusion as to the expansion of this gas <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Expériences,</hi> vol. i. p. 77). Another reason for the avoidance of air or
                    other gas containing free oxygen is to save the oil or other liquid which is

                    and tube placed vertically with bulb up and mouth down; but there is to be a
                    secondary tube of much finer bore opening into the, bulb or into the main tube
                    near its top, as may be found most convenient in any particular case. The main
                    tube which, to distinguish it from the secondary tube, will be called the
                    volumetric tube, is to be of large bore, not less than 2 or 3 centimetres, and
                    is to be ground internally to a truly cylindric form. To allow this to be done
                    it must be made of thick, well-annealed glass like that of the French
                    glass-barrelled air-pumps. The secondary tube, which will be called the
                    manometric capillary, is to be of round bore, not very fine, say from half a
                    millimetre to a millimetre diameter. Its lower end is to be connected with a
                    mercury manometer to show if the pressure of the thermometric air is either
                    greater or less than the definite pressure to which it is to be brought every
                    time a thermometric measurement is made by the instrument. The change of volume
                    required to do this for every change of temperature is made and measured by
                    means of a micrometer screw<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This screw is to be so well fitted in the iron sole-plate as to be
                    sufficiently mercury-tight without the aid of any soft material, under such
                    moderate pressure as the greatest it will experience when the pressure chosen
                    for the thermometric gas is not more than a few centimetres above the external
                    atmospheric pressure. When the same plan of apparatus is used for investigation
                    of the expansion of gases under high pressures, a greased leather washer may be
                    used on the upper side of the sole in the screw-hole plate, to prevent mercury
                    from escaping round the screw. It is to be remarked that in no case will a
                    little oozing out of the mercury round the screw while it is being turned
                    introduce any error at all into the thermometric result; because the correctness
                    of the measurement of the volume of the gas depends simply on the mercury being
                    brought up into contact with the bottom of the piston, and not more than just
                    perceptibly up between the piston and volumetric tube surrounding it.</p></note>
                    lifting or lowering along solid glass piston, fitting easily in the glass tube,
                    and caulked air-tight by mercury between its lower end and an iron sole-plate by
                    which the mouth of the volumetric tube is closed. To perform this mercury
                    caulking, when the piston is raised and lowered, mercury is allowed to flow in
                    and out through a hole in the iron sole-plate by an iron pipe, connected with
                    two mercury cisterns at two different levels by branches each provided with a
                    stopcock. When the piston is being raised the stopcock of the branch leading to
                    the lower cistern is closed, and the other is opened enough to allow the mercury
                    to flow up after the piston and press gently on its lower side, without entering
                    more than infinitesimally into the space between it and the surrounding glass
                    tube (the condition of the upper bounding surface of the mercury in this respect
                    being easily seen by the observer looking at it through the glass tube). When
                    the piston is being lowered the stopcock in the branch leading from the upper
                    cistern is closed, and the one in the branch leading to the lower cistern is
                    opened enough to let. the mercury go down before the piston, instead of being
                    forced to any sensible distance into the space between it and the surrounding
                    tube, but not enough to allow it to part company with the lower surface of the
                    piston. The manometer is simply a mercury barometer of the form commonly called
                    a siphon barometer, with its lower end not open to the air but connected to the
                    lower end of the manometric capillary. This connexion is made below the level of
                    the mercury in the following manner. The lower end of the capillary widens into
                    a small glass bell or stout tube of glass of about 2 centimetres bore and 2
                    centimetres depth, with its lip ground flat like the receiver of an air-pump.
                    The lip or upper edge of the open cistern of the barometer (that is to say, the
                    cistern which would be open to the atmosphere were it used as an ordinary
                    barometer) is also ground flat, and the two lips are pressed together with a
                    greased leather washer between them to obviate risk of breaking the glass, and
                    to facilitate the making of the joint mercury tight. To keep this joint
                    perennially good, and to make quite sure that no air shall ever leak in, in case
                    of the interior pressure being at any time less than the external barometric
                    pressure or being arranged to be so always, it is preserved and caulked by an
                    external mercury-jacket not shown in the drawing. The mercury in the thus
                    constituted lower reservoir of the manometer is above the level of the leather
                    joint, and the space in the upper part of the reservoir over the surface of the
                    mercury, up to a little distance into the capillary above, is occupied by a
                    fixed oil or some other practically vapourless liquid. This oil or other liquid
                    is introduced for the purpose of guarding against error in the reckoning of the
                    whole bulk of the thermometric gas, on account of slight irregular changes in
                    the capillary depression of the border of the mercury surface in the
                    reservoir.</p>
                <p>§ 66. In the most accurate use of the instrument, the glass and mercury and oil
                    of the manometer are all kept at one definite temperature according to some
                    convenient and <pb break="no"

                    and 16 above), by means of thermal appliances not represented in the drawing but
                    easily imagined. This condition being fulfilled, the one desired pressure of the
                    thermometric gas is attained with exceedingly minute accuracy by working the
                    micrometer screw up or down until the oil is brought precisely to a mark upon
                    the manometric capillary.</p>
                <p>In fact, if the glass and mercury and oil are all kept rigorously at one constant
                    temperature, the only access for error is through irregular variations in the
                    capillary depressions in the borders of the mercury surfaces. With so large a
                    diameter as the 2 centimetres chosen in the figured dimensions of the drawing,
                    the error from this cause can hardly amount to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>-J-
                    <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> ∙ per cent, of the whole pressure, supposing this
                    to be one atmo or thereabouts.</p>
                <p>For ordinary uses of our constant-pressure gas thermometer, where the most minute
                    accuracy is not needed, the rule will still be to bring the oil to a fixed mark
                    on the manometric capillary; and no precaution in respect to temperature will be
                    necessary except to secure that it is approximately uniform throughout the
                    mercury and containing glass, from lower to higher level of the mercury. The
                    quantity of oil is so small that, whatever its temperature may be, the bringing
                    of its free surface to a fixed mark on the capillary secures that the mercury
                    surface below the oil in the lower reservoir is very nearly at one constant
                    point relatively to the glass, much more nearly so than it could be made by
                    direct observation of the mercury surface, at all events without optical
                    magnifying power. Now if the mercury surface be at a constant point of the
                    glass, it is easily proved that the difference of pressures between the two
                    mercury surfaces will be constant, notwithstanding considerable variations of
                    the common temperature of the mercury and glass, provided a certain easy
                    condition is fulfilled, through which the effect of the expansion of the glass
                    is compensated by the expansion of the mercury. This condition is that the whole
                    volume of the mercury shall beιr to the volume in the cylindric vertical tube
                    from the upper surface to the level of the lower surface the ratio (λ - ⅜σ)∕(λ -
                    σ), where λ denotes the cubic expansion of the mercury, and σ the cubic
                    expansion of the solid for the same elevation of temperature, it being supposed
                    for simplicity of statement that the tube is truly cylindric from the upper
                    surface to the level of the lower surface, and that the sectional area of the
                    tube is the same at the two mercury surfaces. The cubic expansion of mercury is
                    approximately seven times the cubic expansion of glass. Hence</p>
                <p>(λ- ⅛&lt;r)∕(λ- &lt;r) = (7- ⅛)∕6 = 1'111. ,</p>
                <p>Hence the whole volume of the mercury is to be about 1Ί11 time3 the volume from
                    its upper surface to the level of the lower surface; that is to say, the volume
                    from the lower surface in the bend to the same level in the vertical branch is
                    to be of the volume in the vertical tube above this surface. A special
                    experiment on each tube is easily made to find the quantity of mercury that must
                    be put in to cause the pressure to be absolutely constant when the surface in
                    the lower reservoir is kept at a fixed point relatively to the glass, and when
                    the temperature is varied through such moderate differences of temperature as
                    are to be found in the use of the instrument at different times and seasons.</p>
                <p>A sheet-iron can containing water or oil or fusible metal, with external thermal
                    appliances of gas or charcoal furnace, or low-pressure or high-pressure steam

                    and manometric tube to produce uniformly throughout the mass of the thermometric
                    gas the temperature to be measured. This part of the apparatus, which will be
                    called for brevity the heater, must not extend so far down the manometric tube
                    that when raised to its highest temperature it can warm the caulking mercury to
                    as high a temperature as 40° C., because at somewhat higher temperatures than
                    this the pressure of vapour of mercury begins to be perceptible (see Table V.
                    below), and would vitiate the thermometric use of the pure hydrogen or nitrogen
                    of our thermometer. To secure sufficient coolness of the mercury it will
                    probably be advisable to have an open glass jacket of cold water (not shown in
                    the drawing) round the volumetric tube, 2 or 3 centimetres below the bottom of
                    the heater, and reaching to about half a centimetre above the highest position
                    of the bottom of the piston.</p>
                <p>§ 67. It seems probable that the constant-pressure hydrogen or nitrogen gas
                    thermometer which we have now described may give even more accurate thermometry
                    than Regnault’s constant-volume air thermometers (§ 24 above), and it seems
                    certain that it will be much more easily used in practice.</p>
                <p>We have only to remark here further that, if Boyle’s law were rigorously
                    fulfilled, thermometry by the two methods would be identical, provided the scale
                    in each case be graduated or calculated so as to make the numerical reckoning of
                    the temperature agree at two points,—for example, 0° C. and 100° C. The very
                    close agreement which Régnault found among his different gas thermometers and
                    his air thermometers with air of different densities (§ 25 above), and the close
                    approach to rigorous fulfilment of Boyle’s law which he and other experimenters
                    have ascertained to be presented by air and other gases used in his
                    thermometers, through the ranges of density, pressure, and temperature at which
                    they were used in these thermometers, renders it certain that in reality the
                    difference between Regnault’s normal air thermometry and thermometry by our
                    hydrogen gas constant-pressure thermometer must be exceedingly small. It is
                    therefore satisfactory to know that for all practical purposes absolute
                    temperature is to be obtained with very great accuracy from Regnault’s
                    thermometric system by simply adding 273 to his numbers for temperature on the
                    centigrade scale. It is probable that at the temperatures of 250° or 300° C. (or
                    523 or 573 absolute) the greatest deviation of temperature thus reckoned from
                    correct absolute temperature is not more than half a degree.</p>
                <p>§ 68. The thermometric scale being now thoroughly established in theory and
                    practice (§§ 33-69 and §§ 18-30), we are prepared to define, without any
                    ambiguity, the expressions thermal capacity and specific heat with reference to
                    matter at any temperature and in any physical condition.</p>

                    seven and a half times the specific heat at - 50° (a curious practical
                    commentary, we may remark in passing, on the doctrine of the calorists on
                    specific heat referred to in § 8 above). The specific heats of carbon in its
                    other forms of graphite and charcoal through wide ranges of temperature
                    according to the same observer, F. Weber, are particularly interesting and
                    significant. The approximate equality of the product of specific heat into the

                    the utter want of constancy and uniformity in the corresponding product for
                    other substances, whether simple or compound. If we were to define a metal as a

                <p>S 70. When two contiguous portions of'matter are at different temperatures, heat
                    is transferred from the warmer to the colder. This process is called conduction
                    of heat.</p>
                <p>When two bodies at different temperatures are separated by a transparent medium,
                    such as air, or water, or glass, or ice, heat passes from the warmer to the
                    colder irrespectively of the temperature of the intervening medium, except in so
                    far as its transparency may in some slight degree be affected by the
                    temperature. Thus the colder of the two bodies becomes actually heated above the
                    temperature of theinterven-ing medium if the warmer be kept above this
                    temperature, and if heat is not otherwise drawn off from the colder body in
                    greater quantity than the heat entering it from the warmer. This process of
                    transference from one body to another body at a distance through an intervening
                    medium is called radiation of heat. The condition of the intervening matter in
                    virtue of which heat is thus transferred is called light; and radiant heat is
                    light if we could but see it with the eye, and not merely discern with the mind,
                    as we do, that it is perfectly continuous in quality with the species of radiant
                    heat which we see with the material eye through its affecting the retina with
                    the sense of light. Thus a white hot poker in a room perfectly darkened from all
                    other lights is seen as a brilliant white light gradually becoming reddish and
                    less bright, until it absolutely fades from vision in a dull red glow. Long
                    after it has ceased to be visible to the eye, the fact that heat is being
                    transferred from it to colder bodies all round it, or above it or below it, is
                    proved by our sense of heat in a hand or face held near it on any side or above
                    it or below it. By considering the whole phenomenon of the white hot mass,
                    without much of experimental investigation, we judge that there is perfect
                    continuity through the whole process, in the first part of which the radiant
                    heat is visible and in the second part invisible to the human eye: and thorough
                    experimental investigation confirms this conclusion. Thus radiant heat is
                    brought under the undulatory theory of light, which in its turn becomes annexed
                    to heat as a magnificent outlying province of the kinetic theory of heat.</p>
                <p>§ 71. In this article we confine ourselves to a practical evaluation of rate of
                    gain or loss of heat across the surface of an isolated solid placed in a medium
                    such as air, and enclosed in a solid surface all at one temperature, as is
                    approximately the case with the air and the floor, walls, and ceiling of an
                    ordinary room. A rough approximation to the law of this action, founded on
                    supposing the rate of motion to be in simple proportion to the excess of the
                    temperature of the isolated solid above the temperature of the surrounding
                    medium and enclosure was used by Fourier in those of his solutions in which
                    surface emissivity or, as he called it, “Conductibilité extérieure,” is
                    concerned. Without adopting any hypothesis, we define thermal emissivity as the
                    quantity of heat per unit of time, per unit of surface, per degree of excess of
                    temperature, which the isolated body loses in virtue of the combined effect of
                    radiation and convection by currents of air. This definition does not involve
                    the hypothesis of simple proportionality; and the surface emissivity is simply
                    to be determined by experiment for any given temperature of the enclosure, and
                    any given temperature of the isolated body. Dulong and Petit made elaborate
                    experiments on this subject, but did not give any results in absolute
                    measure.</p>
                <p>So far as we know the first thoroughly trustworthy experiments giving
                    emissivities in absolute measure were made in the laboratory of the natural
                    philosophy class in the university of Glasgow by Mr D. Macfarlane, in a series
                    of experiments on the cooling of a copper ball. The results are given in Table
                    VII. The ball experimented on was 4 centimetres in diameter, and was suspended
                    in the interior of a double-walled tin-plate vessel. The space between the
                    double walls of this vessel was filled with water at the temperature of the air,
                    and the interior surface was coated with lampblack. Two thermo-electric
                    junctions, one at the centre of the ball the other in contact with the exterior
                    surface of the enclosure, in circuit with a sensitive mirror galvanometer,
                    served to measure the difference of temperatures between the centre of the ball
                    and the exterior surface of the enclosure. By this arrangement the exterior
                    junction was kept very uniformly at a temperature<pb break="no"

                    temperature of the centre of the ball. Two sets of experiments were made. In one
                    the ball had a bright surface, in the other it was coated with soot from the
                    flame of a lamp, and in both the air was kept moist by a saucer of water placed
                    in the interior of the tinplate enclosure. The results are given in terms of the
                    number of units of heat lost per second, per square centimetre of surface of the
                    copper, per degree of difference between the temperatures of the two
                    junctions.</p>
                <p>§ 72. Returning to the conduction of heat, we have first to say that the theory
                    of it was discovered by Fourier and given to the world through the French
                    Academy in his <hi rend="italic">Theorie</hi><hi rend="italic">Analytique de la

                    naturally arising from it, of which it is difficult to say whether their
                    uniquely original quality, or their transcendently intense mathematical
                    interest, or their perennially important instructiveness for physical science,
                    is most to be praised. Here we can but give the very slightest sketch of the
                    elementary law of conduction in an isotropic substance, the mathematical
                    expression for it in terms of orthogonal plane or curved coordinates, and a few
                    of the elementary solutions in Fourier’s theory.</p>
                <p>§ 73. Consider a slab of homogeneous solid bounded by two parallel planes. Let
                    the substance be kept at two different temperatures over these parallel planes
                    by suitable sources of heat and cold. For example, let one side be kept cold by
                    a stream of cold water, or by a large quantity of ice and water in contact with
                    it, and the other kept warm by a large quantity of warm water or by steam blown
                    against it. Whatever particular plans of heater and refrigerator be adopted,
                    care must be taken that the temperature be kept uniform over the whole, or over
                    a sufficiently large area of each side of the slab, to render the isothermal
                    surfaces sensibly parallel planes through the whole of the slab intercepted
                    between the two calorimetric areas, and that the temperature at each side is
                    prevented from varying with time. It will be found that heat must continually be
                    applied at one side and removed from the other, to keep the circumstances in the
                    constant condition thus defined. When this constant condition of surface
                    temperature is maintained long enough, the temperature at every point of the
                    slab settles towards a constant limiting value; and when this limiting value has
                    been sensibly reached by every point of the slab, the temperature throughout
                    remains sensibly constant so long as the surface temperatures are kept constant.
                    In this condition of affairs the temperature varies continuously from one side
                    of the slab to the other; and it is constant throughout each interior plane
                    parallel to the sides; in other words, the isothermal surfaces are parallel
                    planes. Let V and V' be the temperatures in two of these isothermals and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> the distance between them. The quotient —-— is the average
                    rate of variation of temperature per unit of length between these two
                    isothermals. Let Q be the quantity of heat taken in per unit of time at a
                    certain area A on one side, and emitted at the corresponding area of the other
                    side of the slab, measured by proper calorimetrical appliances to these areas,
                    which we shall call the calorimetric areas of the apparatus. It will generally
                    be found that the value of the quotient (V - V')∕α is not the same for
                    consecutive isothermal surfaces. For metals it is ascertained by experiment that
                    it increases continuously from the cold side to the hot side of the slab. In
                    other words, as we shall see presently, the thermal conductivity of the
                    substance is not generally the same at different temperatures, and for metals it
                    is smaller the higher the temperature.</p>

                <p>A(ι&gt;-√) <hi rend="superscript"> k</hi> '</p>
                <p>It must be remembered that the temperatures <hi rend="italic">v, v'</hi> used in
                    this definition are temperatures of the substance itself. Some experimenters
                    have given largely erroneous results through assuming that the temperatures of
                    the two sides of the slab were equal to those of the calorimetric fluids, such
                    aS warm water or steam on one side, and iced water or cold water, with its
                    temperature measured by a thermometer, on the other side. To obtain correct
                    results, the actual temperatures at two points in the conducting body itself
                    must be ascertained by aid of suitable thermometers, or thermometers and
                    differential thermoscopes, applied in such a way as not sensibly to disturb the
                    isothermal surfaces. This, so far as we know, has not been done by any
                    experimenter hitherto in attempting to measure thermal conductivity directly by
                    the method indicated in the definition; and therefore if any results obtained by
                    this method hitherto are trustworthy, it is only in a few cases,—caseβ in which,
                    unless the substance experimented upon has been of such small conducting power,
                    and the stirring of the calorimetric fluids on its two sides so energetic, that
                    we can feel sure that the observed or assumed temperatures of these fluids, or
                    of the portions of them of which the temperatures have been measured by
                    thermometers, have not differed sensibly from the temperatures of the slab at
                    its surfaces in contact with them.</p>
                <p>§ 75. What utter confusion has permeated scientific literature, from experiments
                    on thermal conductivity vitiated through non-fulfilment of this condition, is
                    illustrated by results quoted in Everett’s <hi rend="italic">Units and Physical

                <p>But Angström did not notice that Péclet had stated the thickness of the plate
                    experimented on by Clément to be between 2 and 3 millimetres. Péclet himself in
                    his next sentence seems to have forgotten this when he compares the figure <hi

                <p>§ 76. The comparison of these results is highly instructive. Clement’s result is
                    two hundred times too small, and Péclet’s five. times too small. Clément
                    experimented by exposing one side of a plate of copper of a square metre surface
                    and about two and a half millimetres thick to steam at 100° C., and the other
                    side to water at 28° C. It was assumed that the difference of temperatures
                    between the two sides was 72°. The difference really was about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3G of a degree, as we know from the quantity of heat
                    actually conducted through it in Clément’s experiment, indicated by the amount
                    of steam which he found to be condensed into water. In fact, the amount of steam
                    condensed did not differ sensibly from what it would have been if the copper
                    plate had been infinitely thin, or its substance of infinite thermal
                    conductivity. It is important in engineering, and in many of the arts and
                    manufactures involving thermal processes, and particularly in that one of them
                    of greater everyday value to the human race than all the others put together,
                    cookery, to know that for copper or iron boilers, or steampipes, or pots or
                    frying-pans, the transmission of heat from radiant burning coal or charcoal, or
                    red or white hot fireclay or other solids, and from hot air in contact with
                    them, on one side, to hot water or steam or oil or melted fat on the other side,
                    or hot liquid or steam on one side and cool air on the other side, is for
                    practical purposes sensibly the same as if the thermal conductivity of the metal
                    were infinite, or its resistance to the transmission of heat nothing. The
                    explanation is obvious to us now with the definite and sure knowledge regarding
                    thermal conductivities of different substances and of matter in different
                    conditions, solid, liquid, and gaseous, gained within the last twenty years.
                    Angström, Forbes, F. Neumann, and Tait have given, each one of them with
                    thoroughly sufficient experimental evidence to leave no room to doubt the
                    substantial accuracy of his results, absolute values for the thermal
                    conductivities of copper and iron. Clausius and Maxwell have given us thermal
                    conductivities of air and other gases, from their splendid development of the
                    kinetic theory, which are undoubtedly trustworthy as somewhat close
                    approximations to the true values, and which it is quite possible are more
                    accurate than we can hope to see obtained from direct measurements of the
                    conduction of heat through gases. J. T. Bottomley has given a trustworthy and
                    somewhat closely accurate direct measurement of the . thermal conductivity of
                    water. From the results of these experimenters’ work, reduced to uniform C. G.
                    S. reckoning in our table of thermal conductivities (Table VIII.), we see that
                    the thermal conductivity of iron is 80 times, and that of copper 500 times that
                    of water. The thermal conductivity of iron is 3500 times, and that of copper is
                    20,000 times that of air. Hence, although the water or air at the very interface
                    of its contact with the metal is essentially at the same temperature as the
                    metal, there must be great differences of temperature in very thin layers of the
                    fluid close to the interface when there is large flux of heat through the metal,
                    and the temperature of the fluid as measured by any practicable thermometer, or
                    inferred from knowledge of the average temperature of the whole fluid, or from
                    the temperatures of entering and leaving currents of fluid, may differ by scores
                    of degrees from the actual temperature of the solid at the interface. It is
                    remarkable that Péclet, while perceiving that Clément’s result was largely
                    erroneous on this account, and improving the mode of experimenting by
                    introducing a rotating mechanical stirrer to change very rapidly the fluid in
                    contact with the solid, only multiplied Clément’s conductivity by 30 instead of
                    by 200, which would have been necessary to annul the error. Notwithstanding his
                    failure to obtain accurate results for metals, we have ventured to include his
                    results for wood, and solids of lower conductivity than wood, in our table,
                    because we perceive that he was alive to the necessity for very energetic
                    stirring of the liquid, and the mechanical means which he adopted for it, though
                    utterly insufficient for the case of even the least conductive of the metals,
                    were probably not so for wood and solids of lower conductivity than wood; and
                    because it is not probable that the complication of heat generated by the
                    stirring (which Angström suggests as an objection to Péclet’s method) was in any
                    case sufficient to produce a sensible influence upon the experimental
                    results.</p>
                <p>§ 77. The first correct determinations of thermal conductivities were given by
                    Forbes in his paper on the temperature of the earth, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</hi> for 1846, as calculated
                    from his observations of underground temperature at three localities in the
                    neighbourhood of Edinburgh—the trap rock of Calton Hill, the sand of the
                    Experimental Garden, and the sandstone of Craigleith Quarry—by an imperfect
                    approximate method indicated by Poisson. A more complete analytical treatment of
                    the observational results, analysed harmonically and interpreted by application
                    of Fourier’s formula (equation (19) of Math. App.) to each term separately by W.
                    Thomson, gave results (quoted in Table VIII. below) for the conductivities,
                    which differed but little from Forbes’s approximate determinations.</p>
                <p>§78. It has always seemed to us that the best mode of experimenting on the
                    conductivity of metals must, without doubt, be by an artificial imitation in a
                    metallic bar, of the natural periodic variations of underground temperature,
                    produced by periodically varied thermal appliances at one end of the bar. The
                    effect of loss or gain of heat through the sides (or lateral surface) of the bar
                    (ideally annullable by a coating of ideal varnish impermeable to heat) may be
                    practically annulled by making the period of the variation small enough.</p>

                    which we see that the propagation of the variation of temperature is but little
                    affected by the lateral surface emissivity. Little as this effect is, it is very
                    perfectly eliminated by the relation</p>

                    the rate of retardation of the epoch (reckoned in radians) per centimetre of the
                    bar. Were there no lateral emissivity these would be equal, and the diffusivity
                    might be calculated from each separately. This was done by William Thomson in
                    his analysis of the Edinburgh underground temperature observations. But in the
                    propagation of periodic variation of temperature along a ⅛χr (as of electric
                    potential along the conductor of a submarine cable) lateral emissivity (or
                    imperfect insulation) augments the rate of diminution of the logarithm of the
                    amplitude, and diminishes the rate of retardation of the phase, leaving the
                    product of the two rates unaffected, and. allowing the diffusivity to be
                    calculated from it by (6). This was carried out for copper and iron by Ängström
                    in Sweden, and the results communicated to the Royal Swedish Academy in January
                    1861. German and English editions of his paper have been published in

                    sufficiently described in this paper, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and in a

                    allow us to feel perfect confidence in the very approximate accuracy of the
                    results. Hence we have included them in our Table.</p>
                <p>§ 79. The question, Does thermal conductivity vary with temperature! was
                    experimentally investigated by Forbes about thirty years ago; and in a first
                    provisional statement of results communicated to the British Association at
                    Belfast in 1852 it was stated that the thermal conductivity of iron is less at
                    high temperatures than at low. Forbes’s investigation was conducted by an
                    elaborate method of experimenting, in which the static temperature of a long bar
                    of metal is observed after the example of the earlier experiments of Despretz,
                    with a most important additional experiment and measurement by means of which
                    the static result is reduced to give conductivity in absolute measure, and not
                    merely as in Despretz’s experiments to give comparisons between the
                    conductivities of different metals. In 1861 and 1865 Forbes published results
                    calculated from his experiments, including the first determination of thermal
                    conductivity of a metal (iron) in absolute measure, and a confirmation of his
                    old result that the conductivity of iron diminishes with rise of temperature.
                    Forbes’s bars have been inherited and further utilized, and bars of copper,
                    lead, and other metals have been made and experimented upon according to'the
                    same method, by his successor in the university of Edinburgh, Professor Tait.
                    The investigation was conducted partly with a view to test whether the electric
                    conductivities and the thermal conductivities of different metals, more or less
                    approximately pure, and of metallic alloys, are in the same order, and, further,
                    if their thermal conductivities are approximately in the same proportion as
                    their electric conductivities. The following results quoted from his paper on
                    “Thermal and Electric Conductivity” <hi rend="italic">(Transactions R.S.H.,</hi>
                    1878) are valuable as an important instalment, but expressly only an instalment,
                    towards the answering of this interesting question:—</p>

                    the temperature, while we have seen that as regards thermal conductivity there
                    is but slight change with either copper or lead, though there is a large change
                    with iron. This accords with some results of my own on the electric conductivity

                    conductivity with temperature there is a discrepance between the results of
                    Angstrom’s and Tait’s experiments. Tait finds but little difference in the
                    conductivity of copper through the wide range of temperatures from 0° to 300°
                    C., and that difference an augmentation instead of a diminution at the high
                    temperatures as shown in the following results (where <hi rend="italic">t</hi>

                <p>From the admirable method of experimenting, and the care with which experiments
                    were carried out by himself and Thalen, it is impossible for us to doubt the
                    validity and somewhat closely approximate numerical truth of the result. On
                    account of the discrepance from Tait’s results it is desirable that Angstrom’s
                    method should be carried out for copper through a much wider range of
                    temperatures. This can be done with great ease from the lowest temperature
                    obtainable by freezing mixtures to temperatures up to the melting point of
                    copper, so excellently plastic is Angstrom’s method. Our proposed extension of
                    it is to be carried out by proper thermal appliances to the end of the bar which
                    Angstrom left to itself,—appliances by which in one series of experiments it may
                    be kept constant at - 50° or - 60° C., in others left to itself to take nearly
                    the atmospheric temperature, in others kept at high temperatures limited only by
                    the melting temperature of copper, if the experimenter desires to go so far. We
                    would also suggest that the thermo-electric method first introduced by Wiedemann
                    and Franz in their experiments on the static temperature of bars or wires heated
                    at one end and allowed to lose heat by convection and radiation from their
                    sides, (which was rejected, not, we think, judiciously, by Angström), might be
                    used with advantage instead of the mercury thermometers inserted in holes in the
                    bar in Angstrom’s apparatus; or that, if thermometers are to be used, air
                    thermometers in which the bulb of the thermometer is itself a very small hole in
                    the bar experimented on, and the tube a fine-bore glass tube fitted to this
                    hole, would be much preferable to the mercury thermometers hitherto employed in,
                    we believe, all experiments except those of Wiedemann and Franz, on the
                    conduction of heat along metallic bars.</p>
                <p>§ 81. Fourier’s ninth chapter is entitled “De la Diffusion de la Chaleur.” The
                    idea embodied in this title is the spreading of heat in a solid tending to
                    ultimate equalization of temperature throughout it, instead of the transference
                    of heat from one body to another by conduction through the solid considered.
                    Though Fourier makes the special subject of his chapter on “Diffusion” the
                    conduction of heat through an infinite solid, we may conveniently regard as
                    coming under the several designations “Diffusion of Heat” every case of thermal
                    conduction in which the heat conducted across any part of the solid has the
                    effect of warming contiguous parts on one side of it, or of leaving contiguous
                    parts on the other side cooler,—in other words, every case in which the
                    temperature of the body through which the conduction of heat takes place is
                    varying with time, as distinguished from what Fourier calls “Uniform Motion of
                    Heat,” or the class of cases in which the temperature at every point of the body
                    is constant. The experiments of Γ0clet, Despretz, Forbes and Tait, Wiedemann and
                    Franz, were founded on the uniform conduction of heat across slabs or along
                    bores, and their determinations of relative and absolute conductivities were
                    made by comparing or by measuring absolutely quantities of heat that were <hi
                    rend="italic">conducted out of the body tested.</hi> On the other hand, it is
                    the diffusion of heat that is used in the determinations of thermal conductivity
                    in absolute measure by Forbes and William Thomson from the periodic variations
                    of underground temperature; in those of Angström, from his experiments on the
                    spreading of periodic variations of temperature through bars of iron and copper,
                    and a series of valuable experiments a year or two later by F. Neumann, applying
                    the same general method to bars of brass, zinc, German silver, and iron; in
                    experiments by F. Neumann on substances of lower conductivity (coal, cast
                    sulphur, ice, snow, frozen earth, gritstone) formed into cubes or globes of 5 or
                    6 inches diameter, and heated uniformly, and then left to cool in an atmosphere
                    of lower temperature, and from time to time during the cooling explored by
                    thermo-electric junctions imbedded in them to show their internal distribution;
                    in similar experiments on the cooling of globes of 14 cm. diameter of
                    porphyritic trachyte by Ayrton and Perry in Japan; and in Kirchhoff and
                    Hansemann’s recent experiments,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    by the not well-chosen method of suddenly cooling one side of a cube of iron of
                    14 cm., and observing the temperatures by aid of thermo-electric junctions in
                    several points of the line perpendicular to this side through its middle.</p>
                <p>§ 82. When the effect of heat conducted across any part of a body in heating the
                    substance on one side or leaving the substance on the other side cooler is to be
                    reckoned, it is convenient to measure the thermal conductivity in terms, not of
                    the ordinary general gramme water-unit of heat, but of a special unit, the
                    quantity required to raise unit bulk of the substance in 1°. In other words, if
                    <hi rend="italic">k</hi> be the conductivity in terms of any thermal unit, and
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the thermal capacity of unit bulk of the substance, it

                    as defined in § 73, without restriction as to the thermal unit employed. It is
                    interesting and important to remark that “diffusivity” is essentially to be
                    reckoned in units of area per unit of time, that its “dimensions” are L <hi

                    plane rectangular coordinates by a laborious transformation. Equation (2) was
                    first given, proved as above, as the direct expression of Fourier’s fundamental

                    any direction. The boundary condition, if the solid is bounded, is essentially

                <p>This solution is in its generality applicable to an infinite solid occupying all
                    space except a hollow round the origin. The solid may of course be bounded
                    externally also by a finite closed surface. If there be no hollow, A/B must
                    fulfil the condition that [A&lt;∕&gt;i(r) + Bψ,∙(r)]∕r is finite when r=0. If
                    there are two boundaries, concentric spherical surfaces, with their common
                    centre at the origin of coordinates, the boundary condition obviously requires
                    uniform emissivity over each, but not necessarily equal for the two. If the two
                    emissivities be denoted by <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >h',</hi> and the radii of the surfaces by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (outer) and
                    α ’ (inner), the boundary conditions are <hi rend="italic">~ = - hv,</hi> when

                <p>and —=⅛⅛, when <hi rend="italic">r = a'</hi> J</p>
                <p>From these we may find <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h',</hi> so
                    as to let the harmonic character of the solution be fulfilled in the subsidence.
                    Or if <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and 7√ be given, we have in (41) two equations
                    which determine the two unknown quantities A/B and <hi rend="italic">p.</hi>
                    Eliminating A/B, we thus find a single transcendental equation for <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ,</hi> which is proved to have no imaginary or negative roots,
                    and an infinite number of real positive roots, each <hi rend="italic">&gt;-κi(i

                <p>For this case the transcendental equation for determining values for <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ</hi> is very simple, and its roots are calculated numerically
                    with great ease. With the further restriction of no central hollow, w e must
                    have A≈=0, so that <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> may be finite when r=0. This case was fully investigated by
                    Fourier, and very beautifully worked out in his fifth chapter. The more general
                    problem of a solid sphere, with any given initial distribution of temperature,
                    without the restriction of temperature independent of 0 and <hi rend="italic"
                    >&lt;ρ,</hi> was solved first we believe by Poisson in the 11th chapter of his

                    function) for the full solution of the thermal problem is most interesting, and
                    very instructive and suggestive in respect to pure analysis. It was splendidly
                    worked out for the case of <hi rend="italic">m∙=0</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> =0 by Fourier in his 6th chapter, “The Motion of Heat in a Solid
                    Cylinder,” truly a masterpiece of art. When it was printed in 1821, and
                    published after having with the rest of Fourier’s work been buried alive for
                    fourteen years in the archives of the French Academy, and when Bessel found in
                    it so thorough an investigation and so strikingly beautiful an application of
                    the “Besselsche Function,” we can imagine the ordinary feeling towards those
                    “qui ante nos nostra dixerunt” reversed into the pleasure of genuine
                    admiration.</p>
