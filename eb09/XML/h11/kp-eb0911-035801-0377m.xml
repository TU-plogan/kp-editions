                    of one of the superior courts, commanding the body of a prisoner to be brought
                    before the court. There are various forms of this writ, according to the
                    purposes for which it is intended. Thus <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus ad
                    respondendum</hi> is to bring up a prisoner confined by the process of an
                    inferior court in order to charge him with a fresh action in the court above.
                    Other forms are <hi rend="italic">ad satisfaciendum</hi> (when judgment has been
                    had against a prisoner in the court below), <hi rend="italic">ad
                    faciendum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">recipiendum,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">cum causa</hi> (to remove the proceedings into the superior
                    court, the defendant being under arrest), <hi rend="italic">ad
                    testificandum</hi> (when the prisoner is wanted as a witness), &amp;c. These
                    forms are now of little or no importance. The most famous form of the writ is
                    the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus ad subjiciendum,—</hi> the well-known remedy
                    for the violation of personal liberty. It is addressed to the person in whose
                    custody another is detained, and commands him to bring his prisoner before the
                    court, with a statement of the day and cause of his capture and detention,—“<hi
                    rend="italic">ad faciendum, subjiciendum,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">recipiendum,</hi> to do, submit to, and receive whatsoever the
                    judge or courts awarding the writ may consider on that behalf.” It is described
                    as a high prerogative writ, ⅛.e., it is one of a number of extraordinary
                    remedies, such as <hi rend="italic">mandamus,</hi> prohibition, and the like,
                    which the courts may grant on proper cause being shown. The writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> issues only after motion before the court or
                    application to a judge, made on a sworn statement of facts setting up at least a
                    probable case of illegal confinement. It is a common-law writ. “From the
                    earliest records of the English law,” says Hallam, “no freeman could be detained
                    in prison except upon a criminal charge or conviction, or for a civil debt. In
                    the former it was always in his power to demand of the Court of King’s Bench a
                    writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus ad sιιbjiciendum,</hi> directed to the
                    person detaining him in custody, by which he was enjoined to bring up the body
                    of the prisoner with the warrant of commitment that the court might judge of its
                    sufficiency and remand the party, admit him to bail, or discharge him, according
                    to the nature of the charge. The writ issued of right, and could not be refused
                    by the court.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    rend="italic">Habeas corpus</hi> is, in fact, the appropriate instrument for
                    enforcing the law of personal liberty, as declared in the Great Charter,—that no
                    “freeman may be taken or imprisoned but by the lawful judgment of his peers or
                    by the law of the land.”</p>
                <p>In Darnel’s case (3 Car. I., 1627) the judges held that the command of the king
                    was a sufficient answer to a writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> The
                    House of Commons thereupon passed resolutions to the contrary, and after a
                    conference with the House of Lords the measure known as the Petition of Right
                    was passed, which, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> recited that, contrary to
                    the Great Charter and other statutes, divers of the king’s subjects had been
                    imprisoned without any cause shown, and when they were brought up on <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> and no cause was shown other than the special
                    command of the king signified by the privy council, were nevertheless remanded
                    to prison, concluded “that no freeman in any such manner as is before mentioned
                    be imprisoned or detained.” In Jenkes’s case, 1676, the lord chancellor (Lord
                    Nottingham) refused to issue a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> in the
                    vacation. Shortly afterwards was passed the famous Habeas Corpus Act (31 Car.
                    II. c. 2), which is sometimes described as a consequence of the harsh if not
                    illegal refusal of the writ in Jenkes’s case, but which, as Hallam shows, was
                    really due to the arbitrary proceedings of Lord Clarendon. The Act itself passed
                    the Lords after many similar measures sent up by the Commons had been
                    rejected.</p>
                <p>The Habeas Corpus Act recites that great delays have been used by sheriffs and
                    jailers in making returns ol writs of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>
                    directed to them; and for the prevention thereof, and the more speedy relief of
                    all persons im prisoned for criminal or supposed criminal matters, it enacts in
                    substance as follows. (1) When a writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> is
                    directed to a sheriff or other person in charge of a prisoner, he must within 3,
                    10, or 20 days, according to the distance of the place of commitment, bring the
                    body of his prisoner to the court, with the true cause of his detainer or
                    imprisonment—unless the commitment was for treason or felony plainly expressed
                    in the warrant of commitment. (2) If any person be committed for any
                    crime—unless for treason or felony plainly expressed in the warrant—it shall be
                    lawful for such person or persons (other than persons convicted or in execution
                    by legal process) <hi rend="italic">in time of vacation,</hi> to appeal to the
                    lord chancellor as a judge, who shall issue a <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus</hi> returnable immediately, and on the return thereof shall discharge
                    the prisoner on giving security for his appearance before the proper
                    court—unless the party so committed is detained upon a legal process or under a
                    justice’s warrant for a non-bailable offence. Persons neglecting for two terms
                    to pray for a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> shall have none in vacation.
                    (3) Persons set at large on <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> shall not be
                    recommitted for the same offence unless by the legal order and process of the
                    court having cognizance of the case. (4) A person committed to prison for
                    treason or felony shall, if he requires it, in the first week of the next term
                    or the first day of the next session of oyer and terminer, be indicted in that
                    term or session or else admitted to bail, unless it appears on affidavit that
                    the witnesses for the crown are not ready; and if he is not indicted and tried
                    in the second term or session after commitment, or if after trial he is
                    acquitted, he shall be discharged from imprisonment. (5) No inhabitant of
                    England (except persons contracting, or, after conviction for felony, electing
                    to be transported) shall be sent prisoner to Scotland, Ireland, Jersey, &amp;c.,
                    or any place <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n378/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0378-0359"/>beyond the seas. Stringent penalties are provided
                    for offences against the Act. A judge delaying <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus</hi> forfeits £500 to the party aggrieved. Illegal imprisonment beyond
                    seas renders the offender liable in action by the injured party with treble
                    costs and damages to the extent of not less than £500, besides subjecting him to
                    the penalties of <hi rend="italic">praemunire</hi> and to other disabilities.
                    “The great rank of those who were likely to offend against this part of the
                    statute was,” says Hallam, “the cause of this unusual severity.”</p>
                <p>The Habeas Corpus Act, it will be seen, applies only to the case of persons
                    imprisoned on <hi rend="italic">criminal</hi> charges. In 1758 the question
                    arose whether, in the case of an impressment for military service, a <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> could be applied for under the Act, and other
                    questions of some difficulty were raised as to its effect in particular cases.
                    The judges who were consulted by the House of Lords differed in their opinions,
                    and ultimately the Act 56 Geo. III. c. 100 was passed, “for more effectually
                    securing the liberty of the subject.” It enacts (1) that a writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas cotpus</hi> shall be issued in vacation time in favour of a
                    person restrained of his liberty (except persons imprisoned for debt or by civil
                    process)—a privilege granted by the Act of Charles II. only in the case of
                    commitments for criminal offences; (2) that though the return to the writ be
                    good and sufficient in law, the judge shall examine into the truth of the facts
                    set forth in such return, and if they appear doubtful the prisoner shall be
                    bailed; (3) that the writ shall run to any harbour or road on the coast of
                    England, although not within the body of any county. The last clause was
                    intended to meet doubts on the applicability of <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus</hi> in cases of illegal detention on board ship.</p>
                <p>In Anderson’s case, in 1861, the Court of Queen’s Bench decided somewhat
                    reluctantly that the writ runs to all the foreign dominions of the crown even
                    when there are independent local judicatures. In consequence of this decision
                    the Act 25 and 26 Vict. c. 20 was passed, enacting that “no writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> shall issue out of England, by authority of any
                    judge or court of justice therein, into any colony or foreign dominion of the
                    crown where her Majesty has a lawfully established court or courts of justice,
                    having authority to grant and issue the said writ, and to ensure the due
                    execution thereof throughout such colony or dominion.”</p>
                <p>In times of public danger it has been found necessary to suspend the Habeas
                    Corpus Act by a special statute. This was done in 1817 by the Act empowering the
                    king to secure and detain such persons as his Majesty shall suspect are
                    conspiring against his person and government. More recently this extreme measure
                    has been judged necessary in the case of Ireland (see 29 Vict. c. 1, continued
                    for a short period by annual acts).</p>
                <p>In the United States of America the law of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>
                    has been inherited from England, and has been generally made to apply to
                    commitments and detentions of all kinds. Difficult questions, unknown to English
                    law, have arisen from the peculiar features of the American State-system. Thus
                    the constitution provides that “the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >habeas corpus</hi> shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or
                    invasions, the public safety may require it and it has been the subject of much
                    dispute whether the power of suspension under this provision is vested in the
                    president or the congress. The weight of opinion seems to lean to the latter
                    alternative. Again, conflicts have arisen between the courts of individual
                    States and the courts of the Union. It seems that a State court has no right to
                    issue a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> for the discharge of a person held
                    under the authority of the Federal Government. On the other hand, the courts of
                    the Union issue the writ only in those cases in which the power is expressly
                    conferred on them by the constitution.</p>
