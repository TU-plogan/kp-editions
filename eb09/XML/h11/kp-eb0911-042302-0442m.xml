                    to some interpreters an historical or quasi-historical personage, but according
                    to others his story is a mere development or “precipitation” of the great
                    Scandinavian system of mythology. The decision of this point is rendered all the
                    more difficult as the only original authority for the facts (historical or
                    mythological) is the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus (d. 1204). Though Dr
                    Vigfusson (prolegomena to the <hi rend="italic">Sturlunga Saga,</hi> Oxford,
                    1878) concludes that the Hamlet legend was contained in the Skjöldunga Saga now
                    lost, it is of course matter of question whether Saxo based this portion of his
                    narrative on previous writings or collected his material from oral
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>According to Saxo, whose account is excerpted in Simrock’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quellen</hi><hi rend="italic">des Shakspeare</hi> (Bonn, 1870), and summarized
                    in Latham’s <hi rend="italic">Dissertations on Hamlet</hi> (Lond., 1872,
                    reprinted from <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Roy. Soc. oj
                    Literature,</hi> vol. x., new series), Hamlet’s history is briefly as follows.
                    In the days of Rörik, king of Denmark, Gervendill was governor of Jutland, and
                    in this office he was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Fengo. The former,
                    returning with glory from a'viking expedition in which he had defeated Koller,
                    king of Norway, obtained the hand of Gerutha, Rörik’s daughter, who in due
                    course bore him a son Amleth. But Fengo, out of jealousy, murdered Horvendill
                    with his own hand, and then persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea
                    that he had committed the crime for no other reason than to avenge her of a
                    husband by whom she had been hated. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father’s fate,
                    pretends to be imbecile, but the suspicion of Fengo puts him to various tests,
                    which are related with all the inconsequent simplicity of the ordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">Märchen.</hi> Despatched to England in company with two
                    attendants, who bear a letter instructing the king of that country to put him to
                    death, he surmises the purport of their instructions, and secretly modifies the
                    inscription on their “tablets” so that the king is requested to put them to
                    death and to treat him with honour. By his wisdom he makes a deep impression on
                    the king, and obtains the hand of the royal princess; but instead of settling in
                    England he returns at the end of a year to Denmark, where he Î3 supposed to be
                    dead, just as the people are celebrating his obsequies. During the feast that
                    follows he makes the courtiers all drink freely, and then, when they are heavy
                    with wine and sleep, he pulls down over them the hangings of the hall, fixes
                    these with pegs which he had sharpened and prepared in the early stage of his
                    folly, and then setting fire to the building leaves the revellers to their fate.
                    He next proceeds to the royal chamber to take vengeance on Fengo himself, who
                    falls beneath the stroke of his own sword, for which Hamlet had substituted his
                    own scabbard-fastened weapon. Returning to England for his wife, the hero finds
                    that his father-in-law and Fengo had been under pledge to each other that the
                    survivor should avenge the other’s death if it resulted from violence; and his
                    father-in-law, unwilling to make a direct attack on his life, sends <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0443-0424"/> him to Scotland as proxy-suitor for the hand of a
                    terrible queen Hermuthruda, who has put all previous wo0er3 to death. But
                    Hermuthruda happens to fall in love with Hamlet, and he returns to England to
                    upbraid his father-in-law with his treachery. As king of Jutland he has to
                    endure the grievous hostility of Vikletus, Rörik’s successor, but at la3t
                    determines, though well aware that he is doomed to death in the attempt, to
                    engage with him in a decisive battle. He perishe3, and his widow marries
                    Vikletus.</p>
                <p>According to Latham, who may be taken as the representative of the historical
                    theory, there are really two Hamlets,—the Hamlet of Saxo’s third book and the
                    Hamlet of his fourth book, who have been confounded together. The former, who 13
                    the Shakespearean hero, he would identify with Olaf Kyrre, the Anlaf Cwiran of
                    the Saxon Chronicle and the Amlaf Cuaran of the Irish Annals, whose name, having
                    passed through England and Ireland, he supposes to have returned to Denmark in a
                    form which is Latinized by Saxo a3 Amlethus; the latter he considers as the
                    Hygelac of Beowulf, the Chochilaicus of Gregory of Tours, the Huhleike of the
                    Heimskringla, and even the Havelok of English legend. “By a confusion between
                    them aβ man and man, the bearers,” he says, “of names as different as Olaf and
                    Higelac take a form out of which Amlethus is a probable educt.” But this theory,
                    which is expounded with more learning than lucidity, is hardly so much in favour
                    as that of the mythological schooL</p>
                <p>That, in spite of the links by which Saxo has sought to connect its different
                    portions with the authentic history of Denmark, the whole story was destitute of
                    historical basis was maintained by P. E. Müller <hi rend="italic">(Critisk
                    Undersogelse</hi> q∕ <hi rend="italic">Danmarks og Narges</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Kilder,</hi> Copenhagen, 1823), and his conclusions in regard to the matter have
                    been very generally accepted. Though Hamlet or Amleth himself is not mentioned
                    in the earlier documents of the Scandinavian mythology—the only allusion to his
                    existence being the phrase <hi rend="italic">Amlotha qvem,</hi> or Hamleth’s
                    mill, applied to the sea in the Skaldskaparmal —his father, Horvendill or
                    Orvandil (from <hi rend="italic">or,</hi> the spear, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >υandel,</hi> skilful), appears in the great Scandinavian mythus in connexion
                    with Thor’s contest with Hrungnir, and is farther to be identified with the
                    Orendel of German legend, whose memorial coat was afterwards christened the
                    seamless coat of our Saviour at Treves, and whose name, which occurs also as
                    Ernthelle, may possibly be the source of the more famous name of Tell. Hamleth’s
                    own name finds its explanation in the Norse <hi rend="italic">amr</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">arnl,</hi> toil (still used colloquially in Icelandic, <hi
                    rend="italic">amla,</hi> to toil), and <hi rend="italic">lothi,</hi> devoted to,
                    and probably has reference to his mythic impersonation of the endless toil and
                    travail of the sea. The various details of the story—not only improbable and
                    impossible, but essentially stupid and trivial— lend themselves with remarkable
                    readiness to the theory which explains them as versions of the tale, a thousand
                    times retold, of the contests between summer and winter, sea and land, light and
                    darkness. An elaborate exposition of the whole will be found in Zinzow’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Hamletsage an</hi><hi rend="italic">und mit verwandten Sagen
                    erläutert,</hi> Halle, 1877. It has been already stated that Saxo’s is the only
                    original authority; but proof of the popularity of the legend is found in the
                    presence in Jutland of such names as Amelhede <hi rend="italic">{i.e,</hi>
                    Hamlet’s Heath), near Binders, Fegges Sund, that is, Fengo’s Sound, and
                    Feggesklint, that is, Fengo’s Cliff, and in the fact that in modern Icelandic
                    the word <hi rend="italic">amlothi</hi> is a regular equivalent for an idiotic
                    or stupid man. Nor are literary rifacimentos of the story wanting. The
                    Icelanders have their Amlotha Saga, which is a free translation of Saxo, and
                    their Ambales Saga, in which the matter is treated in a more romantic style. The
                    story of Brian, given in Jon Arnason’s <hi rend="italic">Isleηzkur
                    pjodsogur</hi> (Leipsic. 1864, ii.), has the same main features; and Dr
                    Vigfusson, by whom it was discovered, is disposed to surmise that the legend may
                    actually be of Celtic origin,—a supposition quite in keeping with other
                    well-known facts in Icelandic history. It was taken down from the lips of Lady
                    Hildur Arngrims-dotter, whose father was born in 1568. As Niels of Sorö in the
                    15th century made Hamlet more familiar to the Danes by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Danske</hi><hi rend="italic">2iimkronike,</hi> so the French story-teller
                    Belleforest introduced him to a wider company in his <hi rend="italic"

                    1589 he had been represented on the English stage is shown by the well-known
                    passage from Nash’s preface to Greene’s <hi rend="italic">Menaphan,</hi> “He
                    will afford you whole <hi rend="italic">Hamlets,</hi> I should say, handfulls of
