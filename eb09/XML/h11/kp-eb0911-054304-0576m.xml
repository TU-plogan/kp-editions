                    the largest, excepting Cuba, of the West India Islands, is situated between 17°
                    37' and 20° 0' N. lat. and 68° 20' and 74° 28' W. long. Its greatest length,
                    from Cape Engano on the east to Cape Tiburon on the west, is 407 miles; its
                    greatest breadth, from Cape Beata in the south to the farthest point on the
                    north coast, is 160 miles; and its area is 28,000 square miles, or about the
                    same as that of Ireland. From Cuba on the W.N.W. and from Jamaica on the W.S.W.
                    it is separated by the Windward Passage,— being distant from the former about 70
                    miles and from the latter about 130 miles,—and from Puerto Rico, which lies
                    about 60 miles to the east, by the Mona Passage. In general form Hayti somewhat
                    resembles a turtle, its eastern projection forming the head and the two western
                    peninsulas the hinder limbs of the animal. The coast-line, which is estimated at
                    about 1250 miles in length, has numerous projections and indentations. Of the
                    peninsulas, the largest, on the south-west, of which Cape Tiburon forms the
                    extremity, is 150 miles long by 20 to 40 wide; and the next largest, on the
                    north-west, is 50 miles long with an average breadth of about 40 miles. Between
                    these lies the Gulf of Gonaive, a triangular bay, at the apex of which is the
                    city of Port au Prince. The island of Gonaive, about 27 miles from the city, is
                    36 miles long by 8J miles broad. It divides the entrance to Port au Prince into
                    two channels, both good, and forms within a safe anchorage of about 200 square
                    miles in extent; but coral reefs near the coast oblige vessels of large draught
                    to lie out about 1∣ miles. Other ports in the Gulf of Gonaive, north of Port au
                    Prince, are St Marks, frequented for trade in coffee, and Gonaïves, a large bay
                    4 miles deep, divided by a small island. At the extremity of the north-west
                    peninsula is St Nicolas Mole, with an outer and an inner harbour, the latter
                    landlocked and with good anchorage. Beyond, on the north coast·, are Port de
                    Paix, Acul Bay, Cape Haïti or Guarico, the Bay of Caracol or Port Royal, and
                    Fort Liberté or Port Dauphin. From Fort Liberté to Samana there is no good
                    harbour on the north coast, Port Isabella being little more than an indentation
                    in the coast, and the harbour of Puerto Plata being very shallow and beset with
                    coral reefs. The Bay of Samana is formed by the peninsula of Samana, a mountain
                    ridge projecting into the sea at the north-east extremity of the island. It is
                    about 35 miles in length and from 6 to 10 miles in breadth. The bay is 30 miles
                    long east and west, 10 miles broad north and south, and has an area of about 300
                    square miles. From the south coast a chain of coral reefs stretches across its
                    mouth to within 1∣ miles of the north shore; and the entrance is still further
                    narrowed to about ⅜ of a mile by islets at the north extremity of the reef.
                    There is, however, a good passage for ships of the deepest draught, and the bay
                    inside is safe in all weathers. Beyond Samana, on the east and south coasts,
                    there is no port until Santo Domingo is reached, which has about 12 feet of
                    water. West of Santo Domingo are the adjoining bays of Ocoa and Neiba, the
                    former with an inlet called Calderas Bay, which would be a good harbour if the
                    coral reefs were removed; Jacmel, a nearly round bay, open to the southeast; the
                    Bay of Baienet, the ports of Aquin and St Louis, and the roadstead of Aux Cayes.
                    Between Aux Cayes and Port au Prince are Jérémie and the Bay of Baradères, the
                    latter a good harbour. Besides Gonaive, the principal islands off the coast are
                    La Tortue or Tortuga, to the north, 22 miles long and 5 broad, once the
                    stronghold of the buccaneers; La Saône or Adamanay, off the south-east end of
                    the island, 15 miles long by 3⅜ broad; île de Vache, off Aux Cayes, 9 miles long
                    by 2 broad; Great Cayemite, in the Bay of Baradères, 5 miles long by 3 broad;
                    and La Beata, off the cape of the same name, 5 miles long by 2 broad. There are
                    also many islets. Navasa, in the Windward Passage, is claimed by Hayti, but the
                    title to it is not settled. It has been occupied since 1855 by a guano company
                    from the United States.</p>
                <p>Hayti is essentially a mountainous country, but there are many large and fertile
                    plains between the several ranges. There are three distinct mountain
                    formations,—the northern, the central, and the southern,—all of which have a
                    general east and west direction. The northern chain, commonly called the Sierra
                    de Monte Cristi, extends from Cane <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n577/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0577-0544"/> Samana on the east to the Sella de Caballo (3900
                    feet high) on the west, near Point Fragata. The highest peak in this chain is
                    Mount Diego Campo, near the middle part, which has an elevation of about 4000
                    feet. The central range begins near Point Macao on the east, extends west to
                    about 70° 20' long., with an average height of about 1000 feet, and theu divides
                    into two distinot chains, the northernmost of which pursues a north-westerly
                    course to Cape St Nicolas, while the other turns south-west to Mount Ocoa, and
                    then curves westward to the sea, which it reaches near St Marc, Near the west
                    end of the island these two chains are connected by a secondary S-shaped ridge.
                    The northern limb of this central chain is called the Sierra del Cibao, and is
                    the backbone of the island. The name Cibao is properly limited to the middle
                    part, where, though there are occasional peaks more than 1000 feet higher, the
                    average height is 7000 feet. At the east end are still higher elevations, Loma
                    Tina and Pico del Yaqui being each more than 9000 feet high. These are the two
                    highest poiuts on the island. The third or southernmost range of mountains
                    begins near the Bay of Neiba, and runs due west to Cape Tiburon, forming the
                    backbone of the south-west peninsula. This range has no general name, but is
                    called Baburuco at the east end, La Sella in the middle, from the peak of that
                    name (nearly 9000 feet high), and La Hotte towards the west end. The largest and
                    finest of the great plains is La Vega Real (Royal Plain), as it was named by
                    Columbus, which lies between the middle part of the Cibao and the Monte Cristi
                    ranges. It stretches from Samana Bay to Manzanillo Bay, and is about 140 miles
                    long, with an average breadth of 14 miles. This valley is now commonly called
                    the valley of Cibao, the name La Vega being confined to the eastern half, while
                    the western is distinguished as the valley of Santiago. It is watered by the
                    North or Gran Yaqui river and the Yuna river and their affluents. The plain of
                    Seybo stretches eastward from the river Ozama about 95 miles, with an average
                    breadth of 16 miles, and is abundantly watered by the Ozama, Soco, Macoris,
                    Quiabon, and Yuna rivers. Most of the large valleys and plains are in a state of
                    nature, part savanna and part wooded, and well adapted for cattle raising. Of
                    the rivers, the Gran Yaqui rises in the Pico del Yaqui, and after a tortuous
                    course in a generally north-westerly direction falls into the Bay of Manzanillo.
                    Its mouth is obstructed by shallows, and it is navigated only by canoes. The
                    South Yaqui, called also the Neiba or Neiva, rises in the Pico del Yaqui and the
                    Entre del Rios, and flows south into the bay of Neiba. The Yuna rises on Loma
                    Tina, and flows east into Samana bay; it is navigable by vessels of light
                    draught as far as its junction with the Camu, and above that as far as
                    Concepcion de la Vega by loaded canoes. The Ozama also is navigable for small
                    vessels for 3 or 4 miles above its mouth. The largest lake is that of Enriquillo
                    or Xaragua, which is 27 miles long by 8 broad. Though about 25 miles from the
                    sea, its water is salt, as indicated in its French name Étang Salé, and has the
                    same specific gravity as the ocean. It swarms with fish and with caymans. Other
                    lakes are Lago de Fondo or Etang Saumâtre, 16 miles long by 4 broad, which has
                    brackish water; Icotea de Limon, 5 miles long by 2 broad, which has fresh water
                    and no visible outlet; and the smaller Rincon and Miragoane.</p>
                <p>The coast-line of Hayti forms a portion of a considerable area of elevation.
                    There are no active volcanoes in the island, but earthquakes are not infrequent.
                    Rocks of earlier than Secondary date have not yet been discovered; the most
                    ancient, consisting of slates, conglomerates, and limestones, and forming as it
                    were the core of the island, have been disturbed and intersected by intrusive
                    masses of a syenitic character. Flanking the slates and other rocks of the
                    Sierra there is in the northern and in part of the southern side of Hayti a
                    broad development of Tertiary deposits, which are skirted by more recent
                    limestones and gravels. The Sierra, forming the central mountain mass that runs
                    the length of the eastern republic, and constituting in the main the peninsula
                    of Samana, and also a small outlier near Porto Plata, is throughout composed of
                    much-uptilted and usually strongly-folded metamorphic rocks, which appear to
                    have originally been clay-shales, sandstones, sandstone-conglomerate, and
                    limestone. These are most disturbed in the western two-thirds of the island,
                    where they are broken in places by dykes. The quartz veins occurring in the
                    slates near eruptive masses are auriferous, as also are the sands of streams
                    running through the metamorphic rocks, if in the neighbourhood of syenite. Thus
                    the waters of the Nigua, Jaina, Nizao, Ocoa, and most of the tributaries of the
                    Yaqui that descend from the northern flank of Cibao carry gold, though rarely in
                    any notable quantity. The lignite found in the Upper Miocene beds is exceedingly
                    impure, and nowhere more than 3 or 4 inches in thickness. The mineral products
                    include gold, platinum, silver, mercury, copper, iron, tin, manganese, antimony,
                    sulphur, marble, opal, calcedony, lazulite, rock-salt, and bitumen; and mineral
                    springs—ferruginous, sulphurous, and of other kinds—abound. The fossil forms of
                    the Miocene strata are allied to those of the west coast of South America, and
                    forcibly suggest the conclusion that during some portion of the Miocene period
                    the Pacific and Atlantic freely intercommunicated. For details concerning the
                    geology of Hayti see Professor Gabb, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Amer.
                    Phil.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> XV. 49, and, on the Miocene fossils,

                    516.</p>
                <p>The fauna of Hayti is not extensive. The agouti is the largest wild mammal. Birds
                    are few, excepting water-fowl and pigeons. Snakes abound, though few are
                    venomous. Lizards are numerous, and insects swarm in the low parts, with
                    tarantulas, scorpions, and centipedes. Caymans are found in the lakes and
                    rivers, and the waters teem with fish and other sea food. Wild cattle, hogs, and
                    dogs, descendants of those brought from Europe, roam at large on the plains and
                    in the forests. The wild hogs furnish much sport to the natives, who hunt them
                    with dogs trained for the purpose.</p>
                <p>In richness and variety of vegetable products Hayti is not excelled by any other
                    country in the world. All tropical plants and trees grow there in perfection,
                    and nearly all the vegetables and fruits of temperate climates may be
                    successfully cultivated in its highlands. Among its indigenous productions are
                    cotton, rice, maize, tobacco, cocoa, ginger, native indigo <hi rend="italic"
                    >{indigo marron</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sauvage),</hi> arrowroot, manioc or
                    cassava, pimento, banana, plantain, pine-apple, artichoke, yam, and sweet
                    potato. Among its important plants and fruits are sugar-cane, coffee, indigo
                    (called <hi rend="italic">indigo franc,</hi> to distinguish it from the native),
                    melons, the legumes,cabbage, lucerne, guinea grass, bamboo, and the breadfruit,
                    mango, caimite, orange, almond, apple, grape, mulberry, and fig. Most of the
                    imported fruits have degenerated from want of care, and the bamboo has been
                    attacked by an insect which prevents its wide diffusion; but the mango, now
                    spread over nearly the whole island, has become almost a necessary article of
                    food; the breadfruit has likewise become common, but is not so much esteemed.
                    Hayti is also rich in woods, especially in cabinet and dye woods; among the
                    former are mahogany, manchineel, satinwood, rosewood, cinnamon wood, yellow
                    acoma, and gri-gri; and among the latter are Brazil wood, logwood, fustic, and
                    sassafras. On the mountains are extensive forests of pine and a species of oak;
                    and in various parts occur the locust, ironwood, cypress or Bermuda cedar,
                    palmetto, and many kinds of palms.</p>

                <p>Hayti possesses a great diversity of climate. In the plains, where it is
                    generally hot and moist, the thermometer often rises to 96° and sometimes to
                    100°; but in the highlands the readings are seldom above 76° or below 60°. In
                    the most elevated parts a fire is sometimes agreeable. The seasons are divided
                    into the wet and dry. Rains are heaviest and most frequent in May and June, when
                    the rivers, some of which have but a scanty supply of water in the dry season,
                    flood portions of the plains. Hurricanes are not so frequent as in the Windward
                    Islands, but violent gales often occur. The prevailing winds are from the
                    east.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is very backward, and the implements used are rude. The staple
                    productions for which the island was once famous are now imperfectly cultivated
                    or neglected altogether. Mining, once profitably carried on, is generally
                    abandoned from lack of capital, though some gold-washing still continues in the
                    northern streams. Some mahogany and dyewoods are cut in the interior, and hides,
                    wax, and honey are collected for export, but on a comparatively small scale. The
                    business of the country is chiefly in the hands of foreigners, settled in the
                    cities and larger towns.</p>
                <p>The population of the island is about 700,000, of which 550,000 are subjects of
                    the Hay tian republic in the west, and 150,000 of the Dominican republic in the
                    east. Of the Haytian population nearly 500,000 are of African descent, of the
                    Dominican about 25,000. Of the mixed races about 125,000 are of Spanish, and
                    50,000 of French descent. There are also a few Germans, Italians, and natives of
                    the United States, settled chiefly in the coast towns. The language of the
                    eastern end of the island is Spanish, that of the western an impure French
                    patois.</p>
                <p>The history of Hayti begins with its discovery by Columbus, who landed at St
                    Nicolas Mole, Dec. 6, 1492, having left Cuba the day before. The island was then
                    occupied by about 2,000,000 people of a low type of humanity, who are described
                    by the Spanish historians as feeble in intellect, and morally and physically
                    defective. The natives called the island Haiti (mountainous country) and
                    Quisquica (vast country). Columbus named it Espagnola (Little Spain), which was
                    Latinized into Hispaniola. Adventurers from Europe, attracted chiefly by the
                    exaggerated stories of gold, flocked thither, and the natives were reduced to
                    slavery, although many made a gallant resistance. After about 30 years of
                    grinding servitude, nearly all the aborigines had disappeared. A few negroes
                    were brought into the colony as early as 1505, and in 1517 a royal edict
                    authorized the importation from Africa of 4000 negroes a year. The blacks,
                    stronger and better able to bear the labour which had been death to their
                    predecessors, multiplied to such a degree that the island has finally passed
                    into the hands of their descendants. About 1630 a mixed colony of French and
                    English, who had been driven out of St Christophers by the Spaniards,
                    established themselves in the island of Tortuga, where they soon grew formidable
                    under the name of buccaneers. They at last obtained a footing on the mainland of
                    Hayti, into which they had previously made only predatory excursions; and by the
                    treaty of Ryswick (1697) the part of the island which they held . was ceded to
                    France. The colony, called Saint Domingue, languished for a while under the
                    restrictions imposed on its trade by the mother country, but after 1722, when
                    these were removed, it attained a high degree of prosperity, and it was in a
                    flourishing state when the French Revolution broke out in 1789. The population
                    was then composed of three classes,—whites, free people of colour (mostly
                    mulattos), and slaves. The free people of colour, some of whom were wealthy
                    proprietors, demanded that the principles of the Revolution should be extended
                    to them; this was opposed by the whites, who had previously engrossed all the
                    public honours, and the two classes were already violently inflamed against each
                    other when the national convention (1791) passed a decree giving to the mulattos
                    all the rights of French citizens. The whites adopted at once the most violent
                    measures, and appealed to the mother country for a reversal of the decree. But
                    when the mulattos took up arms for their defence at the time of the insurrection
                    of the plantation slaves (August 23, 1791), the whites endeavoured to conciliate
                    them. In the meantime the home Government reversed the decree granting them
                    political rights. The mulattos now took part with the blacks, and a most
                    destructive war raged for several years, during which each party seemed to study
                    to outdo the other in acts of cruelty. Commissioners were sent out from France,
                    with full power to settle the quarrel, but could effect nothing. In 1793 the
                    abolition of slavery in the colony was proclaimed. In September of the same year
                    a British force invaded the island; but, though some partial advantages were
                    gained, the climate made sad havoc among the troops, and prevented any solid
                    success. Toussaint ΓOuverture, the leader of the blacks, came to the aid of the
                    French, the home Government having in the meantime ratified the act of the
                    commissioners in freeing the slaves. He was made commander-in-chief of the
                    French army, and in 1798 forced the British to evacuate the island. By the
                    treaty with Spain, made at Basel in 1795, France had acquired the title to the
                    entire island, which now received the name of Saint Domingue.</p>
                <p>In 1801 Toussaint, then master of the whole country, adopted a constitutional
                    form of government, in which he was to be president for life. Bonaparte, then
                    first consul of France, determined to reduce the colony and restore slavery,
                    sent to Hayti 25,000 troops under General Leclerc. The blacks were compelled to
                    retire to the mountains, but kept up a desultory war under Toussaint’s able
                    leadership. Leclerc, wearied of the war, cajoled the negro chiefs into a
                    suspension of arms, and having invited Toussaint to an interview, seized him and
                    sent him to France, where he died in prison in 1803. The blacks, infuriated by
                    this act of treachery, renewed the struggle under Dessalines with a barbarity
                    unequalled in the previous com tests. The French, further embarrassed by the
                    appearance of a British fleet off the coast, now gradually lost ground, and in
                    1803 agreed to evacuate the island. On the 30th of November of that year, 8000
                    French troops surrendered to the British squadron. In 1804 independence was
                    declared, and the aboriginal name of Hayti was revived. Dessalines was made
                    governor for life, but in October of the same year he proclaimed himself
                    emperor, and was crowned with great pomp. He soon began to display the cruelty
                    of a tyrant, and in 1806 he was assassinated. His position was now contended for
                    by several chiefs, one of whom, Christophe, established himself in the north,
                    while Potion took possession of the southern part. The Spaniards re-established
                    themselves in the eastern part of the island&lt;, retaining the French name,
                    modified to Santo Domingo. Civil war now raged between the adherents of
                    Christophe and Pétion, but in 1810 hostilities were suspended. Christophe
                    declared himself king of Hayti under the title of Henry I.; but his cruelty
                    caused an insurrection, and in 1820 he committed suicide. Pétion had died in
                    1818, arid was succeeded by Gen. Boyer, who, after Christophe’s death, made
                    himself master of all the French part of the island. In 1821 the eastern end of
                    the island proclaimed its independence of Spain, and Boyer, taking advantage of
                    dissensions there, invaded it, and in 1822 the dominion of the whole island fell
                    into his hands. Boyer held the presidency of the new government, which was
                    called the republic of Hayti, until 1843, when he was driven from the island by
                    a revolution. In 1844 the people of the eastern end of the island again asserted
                    their independence, and estab∙</p>

                <p>lished the Dominican Republic, and from that date to the present time the two
                    political divisions have been maintained; the Spanish made an effort to
                    re-establish their authority in Santo Domingo by landing troops there in 1861,
                    but withdrew in 1863. In Hayti several presidents rapidly succeeded each other,
                    but in 1846 Soulouque, a black who had been a slave, was elected to the chief
                    magistracy. He attempted to reconquer the eastern part of the island, but was
                    defeated. In 1849 he assumed the title of Faustin I., emperor of Hayti, and in
                    the following year was crowned. He was deposed in 1858, and a republic was
                    proclaimed under the presidency of Fabre Geffrard, His administration was
                    unpopular, and in 1867 he was obliged by an insurrection to abdicate and flee to
                    Jamaica. He was succeeded in the presidency by Sylvestre Salnave. An
                    insurrection broke out against him in 1868, and after a struggle of two years he
                    was captured and shot. On May 29, 1870, Nissage-Saget was elected president, and
                    Gen. Boisrond-Canal on July 17, 1876.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Haytian Republic.—</hi> The republic of Hayti occupies the
                    western end of the island, and is separated from the Dominican republic by a
                    line drawn from the river Pedernales on the south to the mouth of the river
                    Massacre on the north. Its area is estimated at about 10,000 square miles. It is
                    governed under a constitution adopted June 14, 1867. The national assembly is
                    composed of two chambers, a senate and a house of commons. The president is
                    elected for four years. The revenue is estimated at about £900,000, and the
                    expenditure at £1,400,000; but the frequent civil disorders prevent any just
                    estimates. There is a large floating debt, arising chiefly from paper money
                    issued by the different Governments. The foreign debt, made up of a loan
                    contracted in Paris in 1825 and other liabilities to the French Government,
                    amounts to £1,281,994. No interest has been paid for years. The army consists
                    nominally of 6828 men, mostly infantry. The commerce of Hayti is chiefly with
                    Great Britain and the United States. The principal exports are coffee, mahogany,
                    and logwood; the principal imports, cotton and linen goods. The value of the
                    exports from 1875 to 1877 averaged yearly about £1,300,000; the value of the
                    imports during the same period about £1,180,000. In 1877 British cottons were
                    imported of the value of £252,326; linens, £54,098. The weights and measures in
                    use, and the gold and silver coins in circulation, are French. The piastre or
                    dollar of the republic is now worth about 4s.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dominican Republic.—</hi> The republic of Santo Domingo or San
                    Domingo (in French Saint Domingue, and officially Republica Dominica) has an
                    area variously estimated at from 18,000 to 20,590 English square miles, and is
                    divided into the five provinces or states of Santo Domingo, Santa Cruz del
                    Seibo, Concepcion de la Vega, Santiago de los Caballeros, and Azua de
                    Compostela, and the two maritime districts of Porto Plata and Samana. According
                    to the constitution of 1844, reinforced and at the same time modified in 1865,
                    the executive power in the republic is in the hands of a president elected for
                    six years, and assisted by a ministry of his own appointment; and the
                    legislature in the hands of a senate of nine members. Each state has also a
                    legislature of its own. The budget of 1876 was estimated at £170,651. In regard
                    to the home debt no precise information is obtainable. The loan of £757,700
                    contracted in London in 1869, of which it has been proved that the Government
                    received only from £38,000 to £50,000, was repudiated in 1872. The republic has
                    no fleet; and a battalion or two in the capital is the whole of its standing
                    army. Industry and commerce, hitherto kept in abeyance by the political
                    restlessness of the country, are beginning to develop. In 1875 the imports of
                    the two harbours of Santo Domingo and Porto Plata were £34,930, and the exports
                    £309,361. The chief articles of export were tobacco (11,613,2301b), sugar
                    (7,152,015 1b), coffee (264,179R&gt;), honey (115,680 1b), wax (289,062 lb), and
                    mahogany (1,375,790 feet); and other articles are lignum vitae, logwood, fustic,
                    cocoa, and turtle-shell. Santo Domingo, the capital of the republic, situated at
                    the mouth of the 0zama river, has a population of about 20,000.</p>
