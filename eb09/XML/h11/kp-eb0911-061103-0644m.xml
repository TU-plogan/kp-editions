                    painter at Haarlem. Recalled after a time to the paternal homestead and put to
                    the plough or the milking of cows, young Heemskerk took the first opportunity
                    that offered to run away, and demonstrated his wish to leave home for ever by
                    walking in a single day the 50 miles which separate his native hamlet from the
                    town of Delft. There he studied under a local master whom he soon deserted for
                    John Schoreel of Haarlem. At Haarlem he formed what is known as his first
                    manner, which is but a quaint and <hi rend="italic">gauche</hi> imitation of the
                    florid style brought from Italy by Mabuse and others. He then started on a
                    wandering tour, during which he visited the whole of northern and central Italy,
                    stopping at Rome, where he had letters for a cardinal. It is evidence of the
                    facility with which he acquired the rapid execution of a scene-painter that he
                    was selected to co-operate with Antonio da San Gallo, Battista Franco, and
                    Francesco Salviati to decorate the triumphal arches erected at Rome in April
                    1536 in honour of Charles V. Vasari, who saw the battle-pieces which Heemskerk
                    then produced, says they were well composed and boldly executed. On his return
                    to the Netherlands he settled at Haarlem, where he soon (1540) became president
                    of his guild, married twice, and secured a large and lucrative practice. In 1572
                    he left Haarlem for Amsterdam, to avoid the siege which the Spaniards laid to
                    the place, and there he made a will which has been preserved, and shows that he
                    had lived long enough and prosperously enough to make a fortune. At his death,
                    which took place on the 1st of October 1574, he left money and land in trust to
                    the orphanage of Haarlem, with interest to be paid yearly to any couple which
                    should be willing to perform the marriage ceremony on the slab of <pb break="no"

                    superstition which still exists in Catholic Holland that a marriage so
                    celebrated would secure the peace of the dead within the tomb.</p>
                <p>The works of Heemskerk are still very numerous, but by no means in the same
                    demand as they were in the master’s own time. Adam and Eve, and St Luke painting
                    the Likeness of the Virgin and Child, in presence of a poet crowned with ivy
                    leaves, and a parrot in a cage—an altar-piece in the gallery of Haarlem, and the
                    Ecce Homo in the museum of Ghent, are characteristic works of the period
                    preceding Heemskerk’s visit to Italy. An altar-piece executed for St Laurence of
                    Alkmaar in 1538-41, and composed of at least a dozen large panels, would, if
                    preserved, have given us a clue to his style after his return from the south. In
                    its absence we have a Crucifixion executed for the Riches Claires at Ghent (now
                    in the Ghent Museum) in 1543, and the altar-piece of the Drapers’ Company at
                    l·Iaarlem, now in the gallery of the Hague, and finished in 1546. In these we
                    observe that Heemskerk studied and repeated the forms which he had seen at Rome
                    in the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, and in Lombardy in the frescos of
                    Mantegna and Giulio Romano. But he never forgot the while his Dutch origin or
                    the models first presented to him by Schoreel and Mabuse. As late as 1551 his
                    memory still served him to produce a copy from Raphael’s Madonna di Loretto
                    (gallery of Haarlem). A Judgment of Momus, dated 1561, in the Berlin Museum,
                    proves him to have been well acquainted with anatomy, but incapable of selection
                    and insensible of grace, bold of hand and prone to daring though tawdry
                    contrasts of colour, and fond of florid architecture. Two altar-pieces which he
                    finished for churches at Delft in 1551 and 1559, one complete, the other a
                    fragment, in the museum of Haarlem, a third of 1551 in the Brussels Museum,
                    representing Golgotha, the Crucifixion, the Flight into Egypt, Christ on the
                    Mount, and scenes from the lives of St Bernard and St Benedict, are all fairly
                    representative of his style. Besides these we have the Crucifixion in the
                    Hermitage of St Petersburg, and two Triumphs of Silenus in the gallery of
                    Vienna, in which the same relation to Giulio Romano may be noted as we mark in
                    the canvases of Rinaldo of Mantua. Other pieces of varying importance are in the
                    galleries of Rotterdam, Munich, Cassel, Brunswick, Carlsruhe, Mainz, and
                    Copenhagen. In England the master is best known by his drawings. A comparatively
                    feeble picture by him is the Last Judgment in the palace of Hampton Court.</p>
