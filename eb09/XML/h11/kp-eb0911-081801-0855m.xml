                    the preacher, was born December 3, 1795, at Kidderminster, to which town his
                    father had lately removed from Birmingham. For some years of his childhood his
                    health was very feeble, and as, on account of an affection of the spine, he had
                    to maintain a recumbent position, his principal method of relieving the
                    irksomeness of his situation was by repeating figures aloud consecutively until
                    he had reached very high totals. A similar bent of mind was manifested when he
                    entered school in 1802, his aptitude for arithmetic and mathematics being quite
                    exceptional. But if he owed his subsequent eminence to a peculiar natural talent
                    for figures, he was indebted for the direction of his abilities in no small
                    degree to the guidance of his father, a man of great force of character and of
                    advanced political and social views, which were qualified and balanced by the
                    strong practical tendency of his mind. At the age of twelve Rowland began to
                    assist in teaching arithmetic and mathematics in his father’s school at Hilltop,
                    Birmingham, and latterly he had the chief management of the school. On his
                    suggestion the establishment was removed in 1819 to Hazel wood, a more
                    commodious building in the Hagley Road, in order to have the advantages of a
                    large body of boys, for the purpose of properly carrying out an improved system
                    of education. That system, which was devised principally by Rowland, was
                    expounded in a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Plans for the Government and
                    Education of Boys in large numbers,</hi> the first edition of which appeared in
                    1822, and a second with additions in 1827. The principal feature of the system
                    was “to leave as much as possible all power in the hands of the boys
                    themselves;” and it was so successful that, in a circular issued six years after
                    the experiment had been in operation, it was announced that “the head master had
                    never once exercised his right of veto on their proceedings.” This doubtless was
                    in no small degree due to the powerful personality of Rowland Hill, which made
                    itself felt whether he was present or not. The system, it must be admitted, had
                    several features of too utopian a character for the present constitution of
                    society; but on the whole Rowland Hill, as an educationist, is entitled to a
                    place side by side with Arnold of Rugby, and was equally successful with him in
                    making moral influence of the highest kind the predominant power in school
                    discipline. After his marriage in 1827 Hill removed to a new school at Bruce
                    Castle, Tottenham, which he conducted until failing health compelled him to
                    retire in 1833. About this time he became secretary of Gibbon Wakefield’s scheme
                    for colonizing South Australia, the objects of which he explained in 1832 in a
                    pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Home Colonies,</hi> afterwards partly reprinted
                    during the Irish famine under the title <hi rend="italic">Home Colonies for
                    Ireland.</hi> It was in 1835 that his zeal as an administrative reformer was
                    first directed to the postal system. The discovery which resulted from these
                    investigations is when stated so easy of comprehension that there is great
                    danger of its originality and thoroughness, and its greatness as an element in
                    human progress, being lost sight of. A fact which also enhances its merit was
                    that he was not a post-office official, and possessed no practical experience of
                    the details of the old system. After a laborious collection of statistics he
                    succeeded in satisfying himself and in demonstrating to the world that the
                    principal expense of letter carriage was in receiving and distributing, and that
                    the cost of conveyance differed so little with the distance that a uniform rate
                    of postage was in reality the fairest to all parties that could be adopted.
                    Trusting also that the deficiency in the postal rate would be made up by the
                    immense increase of correspondence, and by the saving which would be obtained
                    from prepayment, from improved methods of keeping accounts, and from lessening
                    the expense of distribution, he in his famous pamphlet published in 1837
                    recommended that within the United Kingdom the rate for letters not exceeding
                    half an ounce in weight should be only one penny. The employment of postage
                    stamps is mentioned only as a suggestion, and in the following words :—“Perhaps
                    the difficulties might be obviated by using a bit of paper just large enough to
                    bear the stamp, and covered at the back with a glutinous wash which by applying
                    a little moisture might be attached to the back of the letter.” Proposals so
                    striking and novel in regard to a subject in which every one had a special
                    personal interest could not fail to command general attention, and perhaps no
                    pamphlet that ever issued from the press has caused so much and such widespread
                    discussion, or been so speedily effective in promoting reforms in any degree so
                    beneficial to the human race. So great became the pressure of public opinion
                    against the opposition offered to the measure by official prepossessions and
                    prejudices that in 1838 the House of Commons appointed a committee to examine
                    the subject. The committee having reported favourably, a bill to carry out
                    Hill’s recommendations was brought in by the Government. The Act received the
                    royal assent in 1839, and after an intermediate rate of fourpence had been in
                    operation from December 5th of that year, the penny rate commenced January 10,
                    1840. Hill received an appointment in the Treasury in order to superintend the
                    introduction of his reforms, but he was compelled to retire when the Liberal
                    Government resigned office in 1841. In consideration of the loss he thus
                    sustained, and to mark the public appreciation of his services, he was in 1846
                    presented with the sum of &lt;£13,360. On the Liberals returning to office in
                    the same year he was appointed secretary to the postmaster-general, and in 1854
                    he was made chief secretary. In these positions, his ability as a practical
                    administrator made itself felt in every department of the postal system, and
                    enabled him to supplement his original discovery by practical expedients
                    realizing its benefits in a degree commensurate with continually improving
                    facilities of communication, and in a manner best combining cheapness with
                    efficiency. In 1860 his services were rewarded with the honour of knighthood;

                    his office in 1864, he received from parliament a grant of £20,000, and was also
                    allowed to retain his full salary of £2000 a year as retiring pension. In 1864
                    the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of D.C.L., and on the 6th
                    June 1879 he was presented with the freedom of the city of London. The
                    presentation, on account of his infirm health, took place at his residence at
                    Hampstead, and he survived the ceremony only a few weeks, dying on the 27th
                    August following. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
