                <p><label type="entry">HANNAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1827-1873),
                    critic, novelist, and publicist, was born at Dumfries in 1827, and came of the
                    II ιnnays of Sorbie, an ancient Galloway family. He entered the navy in 1840 and
                    served till 1845, when he adopted literature as his profession. In 1857 Hannay
                    contested the Dumfries burghs in the Conservative interest, but without success.
                    He edited the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>
                    from 1860 till 1864, when he removed to London. In July 1868 he was appointed
                    British consul at Barcelona, a post which he occupied till his death on the 8th
                    of January 1873. While at Barcelona he contributed to English periodicals; and
                    his letters to the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> “From an Englishman
                    in Spain” were highly appreciated. Hannay’s best books are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Singleton Fontenoy, Satire and Satirists, Eustace Conyers,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays from the Quarterly Lieview. Satire</hi> not only shows
                    loving appreciation of the great satirists of the past, but is itself instinct
                    with wit and fine satiric power. The book sparkles with epigrams and apposite
                    classical allusions, and contains admirable critical estimates of Horace
                    (Hannay’s favourite author), Juvenal, Erasmus, Sir David Lindeay, George
                    Buchanan, Boileau, Butler, Dryden, Swift, Pope, Churchill, Burns, Byron, and
                    Moore. The <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> are full of learning and historical
                    knowledge, and are lit up with sunny humour and brilliant flashes of wit and
                    poetry. Hannay passionately admired three things—learning, literary genius, and
                    good blood. He showed great interest in the history and fortunes of aristocratic
                    families; and his wonderful skill in matters of heraldry and genealogy is
                    recognized by highly competent authorities (see Masson’s <hi rend="italic">Life
                    of Milton,</hi> vol. i. p. 8). He was a ripe Latin scholar; and his style is
                    marked by grace, vivacity, and poetical feeling. He was intimate with his
                    leading literary contemporaries, and wrote the valuable notée to Thackeray’s <hi

                <p>In addition to contributions to <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> and the leading
                    reviews, Hannay issued the following works <hi rend="italic">Biscuits and Grog,

                <p>. HANNIBAL. Hannibal was a very common Carthaginian name. . Its final syllable
                    <hi rend="italic">bal</hi> occurs repeatedly, as a suffix, in Punic names, and
                    is in fact taken from the chief Phoenician deity, Baal. The entire name denotes,
                    according to a probable interpretation, « the favour of Baal.”</p>
                <p>The famous Hannibal, the hero of the Second Punic War, was the son of Hamilcar
                    Barca, and was born in 247 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He and his two
                    brothers, Hasdrubal and Mago, were called by the father “the lion’s brood.” At
                    the age of nine he begged his father, who was leaving Carthage for Spain, to
                    take him with him. The request was granted, but not before he had sworn at that
                    father’s bidding on the altar of sacrifice eternal enmity to Rome. That vow
                    determined his life’s future. In Spain he was bred up in camps under his
                    father’s eye. He was present at the battle in which his father fell in 228 B.c.,
                    being then in his nineteenth year. Hamilcar’sson-in-law, Hasdrubal, succeeded to
                    the command. Eightyears afterwards, in 221 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> he
                    was struck down by an Iberian assassin. Meantime the young Hannibal had proved
                    himself thoroughly able both “to obey and to command.” It was a matter of course
                    that the soldiers with one voice at once hailed him as their general.</p>
                <p>His first object was to complete the work of his father and his father’s
                    successor. Spain, he felt, must be more thoroughly overawed, if it was to be a
                    base of operations against Rome. He pushed into the heart of the country,
                    crossed the Tagus, and crushed the resistance of the tribes of the interior. Two
                    campaigns sufficed for the conquest of all Spain to the south of the Ebro,
                    except Saguntum, a town considerably south of the Ebro and some way to the north
                    of the modern Valencia. It was a Greek colony from Zacynthus (Zante), and had
                    grown into a rich and prosperous place, but, what was now far more important, it
                    was in friendly relations with Rome. To attack it therefore would be like
                    throwing down the gauntlet to the Roman senate and people. But Hannibal was able
                    to tell the home Government at Carthage that the Saguntines were molesting
                    Carthaginian subjects in the neighbourhood. Without awaiting an answer, he began
                    the siege. Roman ambassadors at the solicitation of envoys from Saguntum landed
                    on the coast, but were told by Hannibal that he could not see them. They went on
                    to Carthage, but their remonstrances, though the subject of along debate, were
                    in vain. Eight months passed away, and Saguntum, after a gallant defence, was
                    forced to surrender. Hannibal got a rich booty for his army, and went into
                    winter quarters at New Carthage (Cartagena). Again a Roman embassy went to
                    Carthage and insisted on his being given up. The demand was refused. By the
                    close of the year 219 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Second Punic War was in
                    fact begun.</p>
                <p>Hannibal’s resolution was now taken. He prepared at once to invade Italy. He had
                    a numerous and efficient army and a well-filled exchequer. All who shrank from
                    the expedition he dismissed to their homes. In the spring of 218 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he began his great march from New Carthage with an
                    army of 90,000 foot, 12,000 horse,and 37 elephants. The Ebro was easily crossed.
                    In the country beyond he had some fighting with the native tribes, and there he
                    left Hanno, with a force of 10,000 foot and 1000 horse to secure the passes
                    between Spain and Gaul. Again he sent back all in whom he saw signs of
                    hesitation. With a considerably diminished army he passed the Pyrenees at
                    Bellegarde and encamped at Iliberris (Elne). Some Gallic tribes, alarmed at his
                    advance, had assembled in the neighbourhood, but he soon conciliated their
                    chiefs and persuaded them that he meant them no mischief. So he continued his
                    march without molestation to the Rhone.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Romans had done little or nothing to check their enemy. At last the
                    consul, Publius Cornelius Scipio, arrived at Massilia (Marseilles), and was
                    surprised to find that Hannibal was about to cross the Rhone. But he was too
                    late to oppose the passage, and Hannibal crossed the river probably at some
                    point near the village of Roquemaure. He then followed its course, marching up
                    its left bank to its junction with the Isère at Valence, and entered what was
                    known as the “Island of the Allobroges.” It was from thence that he began his
                    famous passage of the Alps.</p>
                <p>The narrative of Polybius, though it raises some difficult <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0463-0442"/> questions, has conveyed to most modern students
                    and scholars the impression that Hannibal crossed by the pass of the Little St
                    Bernard. If so, he must have entered Italy by the valley of Aosta. The subject
                    has had a literature of its own devoted to it. The result is that the Little St
                    Bernard Pass may be almost said to have made good its claims to the honour of
                    Hannibal’s memorable march. It was familiar to the ancients, and more than once
                    Gauls had passed through it into the plains of Italy. Such high authorities as
                    Arnold, Niebuhr, and Mommsen regard the question as settled in its favour.</p>
                <p>Fifteen days in all were occupied in the passage. If the view above indicated is
                    correct, Hannibal at first made his way over Mont du Chat through the Chevelu
                    Pass, then continued his march up the valley of the Isère, and mounted the St
                    Bernard. He must have descended the mountain by the valley of the Doria. Part of
                    his route, that by which he climbed to the summit, was a narrow defile, and
                    there he was threatened by the mountain tribes which appeared on the heights. At
                    the “white rock,” <hi rend="italic">la roche</hi><hi rend="italic">blanche,</hi>
                    as it is still called, he halted his infantry, while the cavalry and beasts of
                    burden were making tneir way during the night to the top of the pass. Next day,
                    the ninth day, he stood with his whole army on the highest point and spoke, it
                    is said, some cheering words to his half-frozen Africans and Spaniards. The
                    descent proved trying and dangerous. From the mountain tribes he had little to
                    fear; it was the mountain slope, covered with recent snow, which caused delay
                    and anxiety. The Italian side of the Alps is considerably steeper than the
                    French side, and a road had to be constructed for the passage of the elephants
                    and horses. This was a work of three days. In three more days they arrived in
                    the valley of Aosta, and were welcomed by the Salassi, a friendly tribe of the
                    Insubrian Gauls. The October of the year 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> saw
                    the passage of the Alps accomplished and Hannibal with his army encamped in
                    northern Italy.</p>
                <p>Thus far he had been successful, but at a tremendous cost. His army was shrunk to
                    a force of 20,000 infantry and 6000 cavalry,—the former being composed of
                    Libyans and Spaniards in about the proportion of three to two, and the latter
                    being chiefly Numidians, and admirably efficient.</p>
                <p>It wa3 now five months since he had set out from New Carthage. His men of course
                    sorely needed rest, and this they had for a brief space amid the friendly tribes
                    of Cisalpine Gaul. One tribe indeed, the Taurini, was hostile, but he soon
                    captured their chief city, thus overawing the remaining tribes in the upper
                    valley of the Po. It was now high time for the Romans to exert themselves.
                    Scipio after quitting Marseilles, whence he had sent on his army into Spain, had
                    hurried back to Italy, and on reaching Placentia took command of the Roman army
                    quartered there. He was indeed numerically weaker than Hannibal, and was
                    deficient in cavalry. Still he advanced up the Po to meet him, and on the
                    Ticino, somewhere, it would seem, near Vercelli, was fought the first engagement
                    of the Second Punic War. It was a cavalry action, and the inferiority of the
                    Romans in this arm was decisively proved. They were driven back with heavy loss,
                    and Scipio himself was severely wounded, being rescued, it is said, by his son,
                    a lad of seventeen, who subsequently became as famous as Hannibal himself, and
                    had the good fortune to be his conqueror. He has gone down to posterity as
                    Scipio Africanus. The defeated general fell back to the walls of Placentia. The
                    Trebia, a southern tributary of the Po, was between hitn and the enemy, and he
                    was soon joined by the other consul, Semproniu3∙ Their united armies numbered
                    not less than 40,000 men. Sempronius was for instantly giving battle; Scipio was
                    still disabled by his wound.</p>
                <p>Sempronius had his way, and on a bitterly cold December day the Romans plunged
                    into the swollen waters of the Trebia in the face of a sleet storm and a cutting
                    wind. They fought well, but when taken in flank by Hannibal’s brother Mago, who
                    was lying in ambush amid brambles and bushes in a watercourse, they broke and
                    fled in utter rout.</p>
                <p>This decisive victory gave nearly all northern Italy to Hannibal, He let his
                    troops rest during the winter, and added to them a number of Gauls. Early in the
                    spring of 217 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he decided to cross the Apennines
                    and to penetrate into the heart of Italy. The route which he took brought him
                    into the marshy lowlands of the Arno near Lucca and Pisa, and here he and his
                    men had to wade through water for four days. Many of them perished miserably,
                    and Hannibal himself lost an eye from ophthalmia. At last he encamped at Fiesole
                    on high ground. The two consuls Flaminius and Servilius were, with their armies,
                    respectively at Arezzo and Rimini. Flaminius was an impetuous man, and eager to
                    win the glory of settling the war once for all. Hannibal, quitting the valley of
                    the upper Arno, marched past him towards Perugia, ravaging the country and so
                    provoking the Roman general to pursue him. The road from Cortona to Perugia
                    skirts the northern shore of Lake Trasimene, and into this road, which is in
                    fact a mountain defile, the Roman column unwarily entered. They were caught in a
                    trap. Hannibal had posted his light troops on the hills on either side, while he
                    himself blocked the outlet near Passignano with the best of his infantry. As
                    soon as the Romans were in the pass they were assailed on all sides, and the
                    battle soon became a mere massacre. The Roman army was in fact destroyed, and
                    Flaminius was among the slain. We might suppose that Hannibal would have now
                    done well to have marched straight on Rome, and this the Romans expected. But he
                    may well have thought that it would be better to wait the chance of insurrection
                    among the Italian communities. So he marched through Umbria, and again crossed
                    the Apennines into Picenum. He then marched southwards along the coast into
                    Apulia and encamped at Arpi. Meanwhile the Romans had made the famous Fabius
                    Maximus their dictator. After levying an army of four legions, Fabius marched in
                    pursuit of the enemy having first effected a junction with the army under
                    Servilius at Rimini.</p>
                <p>From the first Fabius had decided on the policy which earned for him the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cunctator,</hi> the Delayer. He dogged his enemy’s steps,
                    but would never risk an engagement. The richest districts of southern Italy were
                    laid waste under his very eyes. But he could not be provoked into any rash
                    movement. Once indeed it seemed as. if Hannibal was himself entrapped. He had
                    been ravaging Campania, and was on the point of retreating into Samnium, when
                    Fabius posted a force at the head of the pass which afforded the only available
                    means for his retreat. Hannibal is said to have driven a multitude of oxen with
                    lighted faggots on their horns up the hills overhanging the road, so as to give
                    the impression that he and his army were retreating over the heights. Fabius’s
                    detachment quitted its position to check the supposed movement, and thus gave
                    Hannibal an opportunity of escaping through the pass. The tactics of Fabius
                    disgusted his men, and when he had to leave them for a time, he found on his
                    return that his master of the horse, Minucius, on the strength of a small
                    success won in his absence, was eager to bring on a general engagement. Fabius
                    gave him a part of the army, with which Minucius ventured on an attack. He was
                    on the brink of destruction when he was rescued by the dictator’s timely
                    interposition. After this Hannibal went into winter quarters at Geronium in the
                    north of Apulia.</p>

                <p>In the spring of the next year, 216 B.C., he moved south and pounced on Cannae,
                    where Roman supplies were stored up in great abundance. The town is about 6
                    miles from the mouth of the Aufidus and about 8 from Canosa. The Romans were now
                    again eager to strike a decisive blow. So a vast army was raised by the consuls
                    of the year, Aemilius Paulus and Terentius Varro, numbering 80,000 infantry and
                    6000 cavalry. Hannibal’s army was probably far inferior numerically. The consuls
                    on arriving in Apulia made Canusium (Canosa) their headquarters. For some few
                    drys the armies faced each other on the banks of the Aufidus. There were some
                    preliminary manoeuvres and skirmishes, till at last Varro, when it came to his
                    turn to command, determined to fight. Both armies crossed the river, and
                    Hannibal’s men were drawn up within a loop which it forms near Cannae. On either
                    flank he stationed a strong body of his veteran infantry. His other infantry,
                    ranged in the centre in a crescent form, was soon driven in by the Roman
                    legions, which had advanced to the attack in very deep formation. But meanwhile
                    Hannibal’s cavalry had put the Roman horse to rout, and had fallen on their
                    rear. The Roman columns were now attacked also on either flank by the
                    Carthaginian infantry. Pressed into a dense mass they were cut down without the
                    possibility of resistance. The carnage is said to have been prolonged for eight
                    hours. The Roman army was all but utterly destroyed. The consul Aemilius Paulus,
                    nearly all the officers, and eighty senators, perished in the slaughter. Varro
                    indeed escaped with a few horsemen to Venusia. The remainder were slain or made
                    prisoners. It was at a comparatively small cost to himself that Hannibal won
                    this great victory.</p>
                <p>It might well be thought that such a victory would prove decisive, and that it
                    must have been had Hannibal instantly pushed on to Rome. But he had probably
                    good reasons for not doing so. He was, it must be remembered, as much as 200
                    miles from Rome; he would have had to march through still hostile populations,
                    and by the time he would have arrived, he must have known that the first panic
                    would have abated, and that the notion of carrying the city by a <hi
                    rend="italic">coup de main</hi> was simply preposterous. What he counted on was
                    the dissolution of the Italian confederacy, and a widespread revolt throughout
                    Italy. Nor was he altogether deceived. The disaster of Cannae shook the loyalty
                    of the Italian peoples. Rome was deserted by most of Apulia and Samnium, and
                    almost wholly by the Lucanians and Bruttians. She retained indeed some strong
                    fortresses, as Cales, Fregellae, Casinum, Beneventum, Venusia, and these enabled
                    her armies to maintain their ground. B ut Capua, in Campania, the richest and
                    most powerful city in Italy after Rome itself, was lost to her. Thither Hιnnibal
                    made his way from Cannae, and there he went into winter quarters, which were
                    perhaps too comfortable and luxurious. But the story that his men became utterly
                    demoralized is absurd. They proved in the subsequent years of the war that they
                    could move rapidly and fight bravely. We may indeed well suppose that by this
                    time many of his veteran Spaniards and Africans had been replaced by native
                    Italian soldiers. It is, however, clear that he still had a fine army. It is
                    true indeed that after Cannae his star seems rather to decline, but the
                    explanation of this is that the Romans again reverted to the steady cautious
                    tactics which they had learnt under Fabius. They too. were for the most part
                    well officered. The ablest of their generals was Marcellus. Yet even he never
                    beat his antagonist in anything like a pitched battle. The Romans after Cannae
                    made prodigious efforts. They sent three armies into the field, to watch and to
                    check the enemy’s mavemeuts. They kept themselves in strongly entrenched camps
                    near fortresses which Hannibal had not the means of taking. Some indeed he did
                    capture, as Nuceria, Acerrae, and Casilinum in Campania. At Cumae, Neapolis, and
                    Nola he was foiled. The two years after Cannae, 215 and 214 B,c., passed without
                    much being achieved on either side. Hannibal was vaguely hoping for
                    reinforcements from Carthage, and for the aid of Philip, king of Macedon.</p>
                <p>Next year, 213 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> he gained a considerable success.
                    Tarentum surrendered, and so did Metapontum and Thurii. At Tarentum indeed the
                    Roman garrison still clung to the citadel, and Hannibal could not dislodge it.
                    From Carthage he had received a reinforcement of some elephants and of 4000
                    Numidian cavalry, but this did not enable him to resume the offensive with much
                    effect. Meanwhile Capua, besieged by two consular armies, seemed doomed to fall
                    again into Roman hands. One of Hannibal’s subalterns, Hanno, was defeated in the
                    attempt to revictual the place. Hannibal himself hurried to its aid, but he
                    could not bring the Romans to a battle, though he did temporarily raise the
                    siege. The year 212 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was one of mingled success
                    and disaster for Rome. Syracuse that year had to surrender to Marcellus, and
                    Carthage seemed to have quite lost Sicily. Here was an important gain for Rome.
                    But in Spain the two brother Scipios had been cut off by Hasdrubal, who could
                    now cross into Gaul and advance on Italy. And in Italy there had been some
                    serious reverses. It would appear that there were actually six Roman armies in
                    the field against Hannibal. One of these under Fulvius he destroyed in Apulia;
                    another, made up of enfranchised slaves under Gracchus—a proof this of the
                    extremity to which Rome was reduced—he put to rout, Gracchus himself perishing
                    in an ambuscade.</p>
                <p>By the spring of 211 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Romans were besieging
                    Capua with three armies. It was clear that the city must fall, unless Hannibal
                    could come to its rescue. He made the attempt indeed, but he could not break the
                    hostile lines, so strongly were they entrenched. Then he conceived the idea of
                    drawing them off by menacing Rome itself. Now for the first time he marched
                    through Latium and made it taste all the horrors of war. At last he encamped 3
                    miles from Rome on the Anio. But the Romans did not lose their presence of mind,
                    or even relinquish the siege of Capua; they simply recalled Fulvius with one of
                    the armies. There were two legions within the city, and Hannibal probably never
                    meditated a serious assault. He ravaged the country up to the walls, but he did
                    nothing more. Through Samnium he again marched into Apulia and thence into
                    Bruttium, where he unsuccessfully attacked Rhegium and the citadel of Tarentum.
                    Capua meanwhile was forced to surrender. This greatly discouraged Hannibal’s
                    Italian allies. Marcellus too had come back from Sicily after his capture of
                    Syracuse. Altogether the year 211 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was a very
                    unpromising one for Hannibal. Next year, 210 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    however, he partly recovered lost ground by completely defeating the Roman
                    praetor Cneius Fulvius at Herdonea, the modern Ordona, in Apulia. But he could
                    not follow up this success, and his evideut weakness led to the speedy return of
                    Samnium and Lucania to the Roman confederacy. The following year saw Tarentum
                    slip from his grasp. But he soon had his revenge. Next year the two consuls,
                    Crispinus and Marcellus, were both cut off and slain by the Numidian cavalry in
                    the neighbourhood of Venusia. Another disaster soon followed. A Roman army was
                    besieging Locri in the extreme south. It was routed and indeed destroyed by
                    Hannibal. Thus at the close of the year <hi rend="smallcaps">2OSb.c.</hi> the
                    struggle was clearly by no means decided.</p>
                <p>Rome had been making immense efforts. We hear of her having twenty-three legions
                    under arms, and possibly the total number of her armies may have reached 200,000
                    men. The patriotic spirit of her citizens was still at the highest. But her
                    finances were in a deplorable plight, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n465/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0465-0444"/> corn had risen to an almost famine price. The
                    country round must have been woefully wasted, and multitudes reduced to beggary.
                    One thing indeed the Romans had had to console them during these trying years.
                    The Latin communities in Etruria and Latium had stood by them with wonderful
                    fidelity. This had been their salvation. But now in the years 209 aud 208 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> came signs of discontent and wavering. Of the Latin
                    colonies several declared that they could no longer furnish contingents or
                    contributions. There were rumours too of a disloyal movement in Etruria. But,
                    worst of all, there came news in the autumn of 208 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> that Hasdrubal had crossed the Pyrenees. By next summer he would have
                    passed the Alps. Should the two brothers unite their forcβ3, Rome’s fate, it
                    could hardly be doubted, would be sealed. She was now in far greater jeopardy
                    than s⅛e was even after the disastrous day of Cannae.</p>
                <p>The year 207 was thus a very anxious one. Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius were
                    the consuls. The first was to watch Hannibal in Apulia, the other was to
                    encounter Hasdrubal in Cisalpine Gaul. Livius retreated before the new invader,
                    and let him reach Sena in Umbria, to the south of the river Metaurus, without
                    opposition. Thence Hasdrubal sent despatches to his brother, who was at C
                    ιnusium in Apulia. The plan was that they should join their armies at Narnia on
                    the Flaminian road, between 50 and 60 miles from Rome. Unluckily for the two
                    brothers the despatches fell into the hands of Nero. His resolution was formed
                    in a moment. Leaving the bulk of his army in its camp, he hurried northwards
                    with 7000 of his best troops, and after a rapid march of 200 miles he joined
                    Livius. The two generals forced Hasdrubal to a battle. The Carthaginian was
                    utterly defeated, and he was himself slain. Nero returned with all speed to his
                    army, and informed Hannibal of the defeat and death of his brother by having the
                    head of Hasdrubal flung into his camp. With that sight all hope must have died
                    in Hannibal’s heart. The battle of the Metaurus was indeed one of the decisive
                    battles of the world. It decided the Second Punic War. From that time, for four
                    more years, Hannibal could but stand on the defensive in the southernmost corner
                    of the Italian peninsula. But even to the last no Roman general dared to close
                    with him. Never in a single battle, as Polybius says, was he beaten while in
                    Italy. Before quitting the country, he left a memorial of his wonderful
                    achievements. In the temple of Juno on the Lacinian promontory, near Crotona, he
                    inscribed on brazen tablets in Punic and in Greek an account of his expedition
                    and his campaigns. Polybius saw the inscription and doubtless availed himself of
                    it for his history. For fifteen years Hannibal had maintained himself in Italy,
                    ravaging it from end to end, and inflicting on the Romans according to their own
                    calculation a total loss of 300,000 men. Now all was clearly over. After Nero’s
                    victory the Romans could afford to wait the course of events. Scipio had been
                    victorious in Spain, and early in 204 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he was
                    allowed to cross into Africa. Soon it was clear that he would threaten Carthage
                    more effectively than Hannibal had ever threatened Rome. He received the order
                    of recall at Crotona, and thence embarked for Africa. He landed at the smaller
                    Leptis, on the coaβt of Tunis, late in the year 203 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and lingered during the winter at Hadrumetum, the modern Susa. His
                    brothers Hasdrubal and Mago had both fallen, and he was now the last of the
                    “lion’s brood.” Fugitive as he was, his presence roused the Carthaginian spirit.
                    The people would not hear of peace. Hannibal indeed attempted to negotiate, and
                    had an interview with Scipio, but in vain. When he saw that he must fight, he
                    could not have felt any of his old confidence. He had some good troops, but he
                    was numerically inferior to the enemy. Of his veterans but few could have
                    remained. The armies at last met at Zama, somewhere near the modern Keff. The
                    battle was obstinately contested, and Hannibal’s old soldiers died fighting in
                    their ranks. But he never really had a chance of victory. Many of his men were
                    raw mercenaries, and some of them deserted to the enemy. His army was utterly
                    discomfited, and indeed annihilated. The defeat was .not discreditable to him,
                    but it was decisive. With a handful of men he escaped to Hadrumetum, and in the
                    year 202 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Second Punic or, more properly, the
                    Hannibalian War was at an end.</p>
                <p>He was still only in his forty-sixth year. He soon showed that he could be a
                    statesman as well as a soldier. Peace having been concluded, he was appointed
                    chief magistrate of the state. The office had become rather insignificant, but
                    Hannibal restored its power and authority. The oligarchy, always jealous of him,
                    had even charged him with having betrayed the interests of his country while in
                    Italy, and neglected to take Rome when he might have done so. The dishonesty and
                    incompetence of these men had brought the finances of Carthage into grievous
                    disorder. So effectively did Hannibal reform abuses that the heavy tribute
                    imposed by Rome could be paid by instalments without additional and
                    extraordinary taxation. Carthage grew prosperous, and again the Romans trembled.
                    Seven years after the victory of Zama they demanded Hannibal’s surrender. They
                    were still in mortal dread of their old enemy. Hannibal did not wish his
                    countrymen to disgrace themselves, and he therefore at once became an exile.
                    First he went to Tyre, the mother-city of Carthage, and thence bo Ephesus, where
                    he was honourably received by Antiochus, king of Syria, who was then preparing
                    for war with Rome. Hannibal soon saw that the king’s army was no match for the
                    Romans. He advised him to equip a fleet and throw a body of troops on the south
                    of Italy, adding that he would himself take the command. But he could not make
                    much impression on Antiochus, who was a conceited man, quite ignorant of the
                    strength of Rome. The story was told that, pointing to the great army he had
                    assembled at Ephesus, he asked Hannibal if he did not think that these were
                    enough for the Romans. Hannibal’s reply was, “Yes, enough for the Romans,
                    however greedy they may be.” The great army in which Antiochus had trusted was
                    in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> routed by Scipio at Magnesia near Smyrna.
                    Again Rome demanded the surrender of Hannibal.</p>
                <p>The end was now at hand. From the court of Antiochus Hannibal fled to Crete, but
                    he soon went back to Asia, and sought refuge with Prusias, king of Bithynia.
                    Once more the Romans were determined to hunt out the old man, and they sent
                    Flamininus to insist on his surrender. Prusias was but a poor paltry princeling,
                    and he promptly complied. Hannibal did not choose to fall into his enemies’
                    hands. At Libyssa, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Marmora, he took poison,
                    which, it was said, he had long carried about with him in a ring. The precise
                    year of his death was a matter of controversy. If, as Livy seems to imply, it
                    was 183 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> he died in the same year as his great
                    and victorious antagonist, Scipio Africanus.</p>
                <p>As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions.
                    The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against
                    several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a
                    commander and a tactician of supreme capacity. Wonderful as his achievements
                    were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he
                    received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh
                    levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it

                    have been an extraordinary man. Again, all we know of him comes for the most
                    part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they
                    could not do him justice. Long after the peril had passed away, we may well
                    believe that Horace accurately reflected their sentiment in describing him, as
                    he does more than once, as the <hi rend="italic">dirus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hannibal.</hi> Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices
                    were equally great, among which he singles out his “more than Punic perfidy” and
                    “an inhuman cruelty.” For the first there would seem to be no further
                    justification than that he was consummately skilful in the use of ambuscades.
                    For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises
                    he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most
                    favourably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated
                    by Claudius Nero on the vanquished Hasdrubal. Polybius merely says that he was
                    accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had
                    indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny.
                    For steadfastness of purpose, for organizing capacity and a mastery of military
                    science, he has perhaps never had an equal.</p>
                <p>Considering his fame, we should have expected to find a number of anecdotes about
                    him. There are, however, only a few. One is given by Cicero <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Oratore,</hi> ii. 18); and may fairly find a place
                    here. When he was an exile at Ephesus, he was invited to hear a lecture from one
                    Phormio, a philosopher. The lecturer discoursed on things in general and on the
                    duties of a commander-in-chief in particular, and wa3 warmly applauded by his
                    audience. Some of the hearers turned to Hannibal and asked him what he thought
                    of it. “I have seen,” said he, “plenty of old fools in my time, but this man
                    beats them all.”</p>
                <p>Our chief sources for the life of Hannibal are Polybius and Livy. With Polybius
                    we are generally on safe ground, but unfortunately we have not his guidance
                    throughout. Livy’s narrative is too much devoted to his country to be impartial;
                    but he is minute, and his entire history of the Second Punic War has come down
                    to us. There are besides the meagre epitomes of Floras and Orosius, aud the
                    remains of the abridgment of Dion Cassius by Zonaras. We have also Plutarch’s
                    lives of Fabius Maximus and Marcellus, in which of course Hannibal figures
                    conspicuously, and a life by Cornelius Nepos. To these must be added Appian,
                    whose book on the <hi rend="italic">Wars of Hannibal</hi> is not without some
                    value. (W. J. B. )</p>
