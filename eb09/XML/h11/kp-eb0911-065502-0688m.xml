                    England, born November 25, 1609, was the daughter of Henry IV. of France. When
                    the first overtures for her hand were made on behalf of Charles, prince of
                    Wales, in the spring of 1624, she was little more than fourteen years of age.
                    Her brother, Louis X1II., only consented to the marriage on the condition that
                    the English Roman Catholics were relieved from the operation of the penal laws.
                    When therefore she set out for her new home in June 1625, she had already
                    pledged the husband to whom she had been married by proxy on May 1 to a course
                    of action which was certain to bring unpopularity on him as well as upon
                    herself.</p>
                <p>That husband was now king of England. The early years of the married life of
                    Charles I. were most unhappy. He soon found an excuse for breaking his promise
                    to relieve the English Catholics. His young wife was deeply offended by
                    treatment which she naturally regarded as unhandsome. The favourite Buckingham
                    stirred the flames of his master’s discontent. Charles in vain strove to reduce
                    her to tame submission. After the assassination of Buckingham in 1628 the
                    barrier between the married pair was broken down, and the bond of affection
                    which from that moment united them was never loosened.</p>
                <p>For some years Henrietta Maria’s chief interests lay in her young family, and in
                    the amusements of a gay and brilliant court. She loved to be present at dramatic
                    entertainments, and her participation in the private rehearsals of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shepherd's Pastoral,</hi> written by her favourite Walter
                    Montague, probably drew down upon her the savage attack of Prynne. With
                    political matters she hardly meddled as yet. Even her co-religionists found
                    little aid from her till the summer of 1637. She had then recently opened a
                    diplomatic communication with the see of Rome. She appointed an agent to reside
                    at Rome, and a papal agent, a Scotchman named Con, accredited to her, was soon
                    engaged in effecting conversions amongst the English gentry and nobility.
                    Henrietta Maria was well pleased to become a patroness of so holy a work,
                    especially as she was not asked to take any personal trouble in the matter.
                    Protestant England took alarm at the proceedings of a queen who associated
                    herself so closely with the doings of “the grim wolf with privy paw.”</p>
                <p>When the Scottish troubles broke out, she raised money from her fellow Catholics
                    to support the king’s army on the borders in 1639. During the session of the
                    Short Parliament in the spring of 1640, the queen urged the king to oppose
                    himself to the House of Commons in defence of the Catholics. When the Long
                    Parliament met, the Catholics were believed· to be the authors and agents of
                    every arbitrary scheme which was supposed to have entered into the plans of
                    Strafford or Laud. Before the Long Parliament had sat for two months, the queen
                    was urging upon the pope the duty of lending money to enable her to restore her
                    husband’s authority. She threw herself heart and soul into the schemes for
                    rescuing Strafford and coercing the parliament. The army plot, the scheme for
                    using Scotland against England, and the attempt upon the five members were the
                    fruits of her political activity.</p>
                <p>In the next year the queen effected her passage to the Continent. In February
                    1643 she landed at Burlington Quay, placed herself at the head of a force of
                    loyalists, and marched through England to join the king near Oxford. After
                    little more than a year’s residence there, on April 3, 1644, she left her
                    husband to see his face no more. At Exeter she gave birth to her youngest child,
                    who was one day to be duchess of Orleans, and to negotiate the treaty of Dover.
                    Henrietta Maria found a refuge in France. Richelieu was dead, and Anne of
                    Austria was compassionate. As long as her husband was alive the queen never
                    ceased to encourage him to resistance.</p>
                <p>During her exile in France she had much to suffer. Her husband’s execution in
                    1649 was a terrible blow. She brought up her youngest child Henrietta in her own
                    faith, but her efforts to induce her youngest son, the duke of Gloucester, to
                    take the same course only produced discomfort in the exiled family. The story of
                    her marriage with her attached servant Lord Jermyn needs more confirmation than
                    it has yet received to be accepted, but all the information which has reached us
                    of her relations with her children points to the estrangement which had grown up
                    between them. When after the Restoration she returned to England, she found that
                    she had no place in the new world. She received from parliament a grant of
                    £30,000 a year in compensation for the loss of her dower-lands, and the king
                    added a similar sum as a pension for himself. In January 1661 she returned to
                    France to be present at the marriage of her daughter Henrietta to the duke of
                    Orleans. In July 1662 she set out again for England, and took up her residence
                    once more at Somerset House. Her health failed her, and on June 24, 1665, she
                    departed in search of the clearer air of her native country. She died on August
                    31, 1666, at Colombe, nut far from Paris.</p>
