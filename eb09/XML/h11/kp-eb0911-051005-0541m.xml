                    orchestra Handel had played the second violin some years before. Hasse’s success
                    led to an engagement at the court theatre of Brunswick, and it was there that,
                    in 1723, he made his début as a composer with the opera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antigonus.</hi> The success of this first work induced the duke to send Hasse
                    to Italy for the completion of his studies, and in 1724 he went to Naples and
                    placed himself under the tuition of the celebrated Porpora, with whom, however,
                    he seems to have disagreed both as a man and as an artist. On the other hand he
                    gained the friendship of Alessandro Scarlatti, to whom he owed his first
                    commission for a serenade for two voices, sung at a family celebration of a
                    wealthy merchant by two of the greatest singers of Italy, Farinelli and Signora
                    Tesi. This event established Hasse’s fame; he soon became very popular by the
                    name of “il caro Sassone,” and his opera <hi rend="italic">Sesostrato,</hi>
                    written for and produced at the Royal Opera at Naples in 1726, made his name
                    known all over Italy. At Venice, where he went in 1727, he and his works were
                    received with equal favour. It was there that he became acquainted with the
                    celebrated singer Faustina Bordoni, better known as Faustina Hasse, for she
                    became the composer’s wife in 1730. The artistcouple soon afterwards went to
                    Dresden, in compliance with a brilliant offer made to them by the
                    splendour-loving elector of Saxony, Augustus II. There Hasse remained for two
                    years, after which he again journeyed to Italy, and also in 1733 to London, in
                    which latter city he was tempted by the aristocratic clique inimical to Handel
                    to become the rival and antagonist of that great master. But this he modestly
                    and wisely declined, remaining in London only long enough to superintend the
                    rehearsals for his opera <hi rend="italic">Artaserse.</hi> All this while
                    Faustina had remained at Dresden, the declared favourite of the public and
                    unfortunately also of the elector, her husband, who remained attached to her,
                    being allowed to see her only at long intervals. In 1739, after the death of
                    Augustus II., Hasse settled permanently at Dresden till 1763, when he and his
                    wife retired from court service with considerable pensions. But Hasse was still
                    too young to rest on his laurels. He went with his family to Vienna, and added
                    several operas to the great number of his works already in existence. His last
                    work for the stage was the opera <hi rend="italic">Ruggiero,</hi> written for
                    the wedding of Archduke Ferdinand at Milan. On the same occasion a dramatic
                    cantata by Mozart, then (1771) fourteen years old, was performed, and Hasse is
                    said to have prophesied Mozart’s future greatness much in the same manner as
                    Mozart himself predicted that of Beethoven. By desire of his wife Hasse settled
                    at her birthplace Venice, and there he died December 23, 1783. His compositions
                    were innumerable, including as many as 120 operas, besides oratorios, cantatas,
                    masses, and almost every variety of instrumental music. It would be needless to
                    criticize or give the titles of these compositions, for most of them are, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0542-0511"/> as was said before, totally and not unjustly
                    forgotten. Moreover, comparatively few of them have escaped destruction. During
                    the siege of Dresden by the Prussians in 1760, most of his manuscripts,
                    collected for a complete edition to be brought out at the expense of the
                    elector, were burnt. Some of his works, amongst them an opera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcide</hi><hi rend="italic">al</hi><hi rend="italic">Bivio,</hi> have been
                    published, and the libraries of Vienna and Dresden possess the autographs of
                    others. Hasse’s instrumentation is certainly not above the low level attained by
                    the average musicians of his time, and his <hi rend="italic">ensembles</hi> do
                    not present any features of interest. In dramatic fire also he was wanting, but
                    he had a fund of gentle and genuine melody, and by this fact his enormous
                    popularity during his life must be accounted for. The two airs which Farinelli
                    had to repeat every day for ten years to the melancholy king of Spain, Philip
                    V., were both from Hasse’s works. Of Faustina Hasse, almost as celebrated as her
                    husband, most that is necessary has been said above. It will be sufficient to
                    add that she was born at Venice in 1700, sang at Vienna, London (under Handel,
                    1726), and Dresden, and was, according to the unanimous verdict of the critics
                    (including Dr Burney), one of the greatest singer3 of a time rich in vocal
                    artists. The year of her death is not exactly known. Most probably it shortly
                    preceded that of her husband.</p>
