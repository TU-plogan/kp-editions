                    (1745-1820), the friend and biographer of Cowper, and grandson of William
                    Hayley, dean of Chichester, was born in that city on the 9th November 1745. On
                    account of mismanagement during a fever which he had while in a boarding school
                    at Kingston, he was reduced to such prostration that the preservation of his
                    life appeared to present only the promise of hopeless lameness and idiocy, but
                    by careful nursing his health was gradually completely restored, and after some
                    years’ private tuition he pursued his studies at Eton and at Trinity College,
                    Cambridge. In 1766 he procured a certificate of admission to the Middle Temple,
                    London, but a short trial of legal studies was sufficient to dissipate the
                    unexperienced preference which he had cherished for the profession of law. After
                    his marriage in 1769 he stayed for some years chiefly in London, but in 1774 he
                    retired to his patrimonial estate of Eartham in Sussex, resolved to spend the
                    remainder of his days in rural quiet, with only such an amount of literary
                    activity as might defy ennui and give a zest to life. Hayley made more than one
                    attempt to succeed as a dramatic author, but first won fame by his poetical <hi
                        rend="italic">Essays on Painting, History, and Epic Poetry,</hi> and by his
                    poem the <hi rend="italic">Triumph of Temper.</hi> The success of these poems
                    was partly attributable to the general dearth of poetic talent at the time, but
                    they had also certain external qualities fitted to secure for them at least a
                    temporary popularity; and his notes to his poetical essays also displayed very
                    extensive reading, and exerted considerable influence in directing attention in
                    England to the literature of Italy and Spain. On the death of Warton, Fayley was
                    offered the laureateship, but declined it. In 1792 he made the acquaintance of
                    the poet Cowper; and this acquaintance ripened into a friendship which remained
                    unbroken until Cowper’s death in 1800. This bereavement was separated by only a
                    week from that caused by the death of Hayley’s natural son Thomas Alphonso, who
                    had given great promise of excellence as a sculptor; and, shrinking from the
                    associations now connected with Eartham, Hayley retired to what he called a
                    “marine hermitage,” which he had built at Feltham, and there resided till his
                    death, November 20, 1820. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Life of</hi><hi

                    number of works in prose, which were not, however, so successful as his early
                    poetical productions. Indeed the estimation in which he was held even during his
                    lifetime depended perhaps more on his acquirements and widely-cultivated tastes
                    and his position <pb break="no"
