                <p><label type="entry">HAWK</label> (Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic">Hafoc),</hi> a
                    word of somewhat indefinite meaning, being often used to signify all diurnal
                    Birds-of-prey which are neither Vultures nor Eagles, and again more exclusively
                    for those of the remainder which are not Buzzards, Falcons, Harriers, or Kites.
                    Even with this restriction it is comprehensive enough, and will include more
                    than a hundred species, which have been arrayed in genera varying in number from
                    a dozen to above a score, according to the fancy of the systematizer. Speaking
                    generally, Hawks may be characterized by possessing comparatively short wings
                    and long legs, a bill which begins to decurve directly from the cere (or soft
                    bare skin that covers its base), and has the cutting edges of its maxilla (or
                    upper mandible) sinuated<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In one form, <hi rend="italic">Nisοides,</hi> which on that account has been
                    generically separated, they are said to be perfectly straight.</p></note> but
                    never notched. To these may be added as characters, structurally perhaps of less
                    value, but in other respects quite as important, that the sexes differ very
                    greatly in size, that in most species the irides are yellow, deepening with age
                    into orange or even red, and that the immature plumage is almost invariably more
                    or less striped or mottled with heart-shaped spots beneath, while that of the
                    adults is generally much barred, though the old males have in many instances the
                    breast and belly quite free from markings. Nearly all are of small or moderate
                    size—the largest among them being the Gos- <hi rend="smallcaps">Hawk</hi> (vol.
                    X. p. 788) and its immediate allies, and the male of the smallest, <hi
                    rend="italic">Accipiter</hi><hi rend="italic">times,</hi> is not bigger than a
                    Song-Thrush. They are all birds of great boldness in attacking a quarry, but if
                    foiled in the first attempt they are apt to leave the pursuit. Thoroughly
                    arboreal in their habits, they seek their prey, chiefly consisting of birds
                    (though reptiles and small mammals are also taken), among trees or bushes,
                    patiently waiting for a victim to shew itself, anl gliding upon it when it
                    appears to be unwary with a rapid swoop, clutching it in their talons, and
                    bearing it away to eat it in some convenient spot.</p>
                <p>It is of course impossible here to enter into details of the numerous forms
                    which, notwithstanding the limitation above adopted, are to be called Hawks, or
                    to describe the distinguishing characters, so far as any have been given, of the
                    different groups or sections into which it has pleased systematic ornithologists
                    to break them up, since hardly any two are agreed in the latter respect. There
                    is at the outset a difference of opinion as to the scientific name which the
                    largest and best known of these sections should bear—some authors terming it <hi
                    rend="italic">Nisus,</hi> and others, who seem to have the most justice on their
                    side, <hi rend="italic">Accipiter.</hi> In Europe there are two species—first,
                    <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">nisus,</hi> the common Sparrow-Hawk,
                    which has a wide distribution from Ireland to Japan, extending also to northern
                    India, Egypt, and Algeria, and secondly, <hi rend="italic">A. δreviyes</hi> (by
                    some placed in the group <hi rend="italic">Micro-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nisus</hi> and by others called an <hi rend="italic">Astur),</hi> which only
                    appears in the south-east, and the adjoining parts of Asia Minor and Persia. In
                    North America the place of the former is taken by two very distinct species, a
                    small one, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">fuscus,</hi> usually known
                    in Canada and the United States as the Sharp-shinned Hawk, and Stanley’s or
                    Cooper’s Hawk, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">cooperi</hi> (by some
                    placed in another genus, <hi rend="italic">Cooperastur),</hi> which is larger
                    and has not so northerly a range. In South America there are four or five more,
                    including <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">tinus,</hi> before
                    mentioned as the smallest of all, while a species not much larger, <hi
                    rend="italic">A. miηullus,</hi> together with several others of greater size,
                    inhabits South Africa. Madagascar and its neighbouring islands have three or
                    four species sufficiently distinct, and India has <hi rend="italic">A.
                    badius.</hi> A good many more forms are found in South-eastern Asia, in the
                    Indo-Malay Archipelago, and in Australia three or four species, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">A. cirrhocephalus</hi> most nearly represents the Sparrow-Hawk of
                    Europe and Northern Asia, while <hi rend="italic">A. radiatus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">approximans</hi> shew some affinity to
                    the Cos-Hawks <hi rend="italic">(Astur)</hi> with which they are often classed.
                    The differences between all the forms above named and the much larger number
                    here unnamed are such as can be only appreciated by the specialist, and could
                    not possibly be pointed out within the limits of this article. It may be
                    observed in conclusion that the so-called “Sparrow-Hawk” of New Zealand <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hieracidea)</hi> does not belong to this group of birds at all,
                    and by many authors has been deemed akin to the Falcons. For Hawking, see <hi
