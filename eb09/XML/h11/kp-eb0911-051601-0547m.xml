                    Marquis of</hi></label> (1754-1826), ranks among those governorsgeneral of India
                    who, completing the work of Clive and Warren Hastings, achieved the creation of
                    the Indian empire of England. The services of Lord Hastings in this respect were
                    special and important. He was both governorgeneral and commander-in-chief in
                    India from 1813 till the end of 1822; during that period he carried two
                    important wars, the Nepaulese and the Mahratta, to a successful issue; while
                    adding to the territories of the East India Company, he in several respects
                    altered and improved their policy; and by the sagacity and at the same time the
                    generosity of his own administration (in which he exhibited the true qualities
                    of a Christian proconsul) he won reverence from the natives and left a great
                    name in India.</p>
                <p>Lord Hastings was in no way connected with Warren Hastings; his family name was
                    Rawdon. His father, Sir John Rawdon of Moira in the county of Down, fourth
                    baronet, was created Baron Rawdon of Moira, and afterwards Earl of Moira, in the
                    Irish peerage. His mother was the Lady Elizabeth Hastings, daughter of the ninth
                    earl of Huntingdon. Both his father and mother appear to have been persons of
                    considerable ability and high cultivation. Lord Rawdon, as he was then called,
                    having gone at an early age to the university of Oxford, joined the army in his
                    seventeenth year as ensign in the 15th foot His life henceforth was entirely
                    spent in the service of his country, and may naturally be divided into four
                    periods :— from 1773 to 1782 he was engaged with much distinction in the
                    American war; from 1783 to 1813 he held various high appointments at home, and
                    took an active part in the business of the House of Lords; from 1813 to 1823 was
                    the period of his labours in India; after retiring from which, in the last years
                    of his life (1824-1826), he was governor of Malta.</p>
                <p>In America Lord Rawdon served at the battles of Bunker’s Hill, Brooklyn, White
                    Plains, Monmouth, and Camden, at the attacks on Forts Washington and Clinton,
                    and at the siege of Charleston. In fact he was engaged in all the chief
                    operations of the war. Perhaps his most noted achievements were the raising of a
                    corps at Philadelphia, called the Irish Volunteers, who under him became famous
                    for their fighting qualities, and the victory of Hob-kirk<pb break="no"

                    force, he gained by superior military skill and determination against an
                    American <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi rend="italic">T armée.</hi> In 1782 he
                    was invalided. The vessel in which he returned to England wa3 captured and
                    carried into Brest. This occasioned the loss of his papers and personal records
                    of the war which would doubtless have been interesting. He was speedily
                    released, and on his arrival in England was much honoured by George III., who
                    created him an English peer (Baron Rawdon) in March 1783.</p>
                <p>In 1793 Lord Rawdon succeeded his father as earl of Moira. In 1794 he was sent
                    with 10,000 men from Southampton to Ostend to reinforce the duke of York and the
                    allies in Flanders. The march by which he effected a junction was considered
                    extraordinary. In 1803 he was appointed commander-in-chief in Scotland, and in
                    1804 he married Flora Muir Campbell, countess of Loudon in her own right. He and
                    Lady Loudon lived at Duddingston House near Edinburgh, where they were very
                    popular. The opposition coming into power in 1806, Lord Moira, who had always
                    voted with them, received the place of master general of the ordnance. He was
                    now enabled to carry a philanthropic measure, of which from his first entry into
                    the House of Lords he had been a great promoter, namely, the Debtor and Creditor
                    Bill for relief of poor debtors. Ireland was another subject to which he had
                    given particular attention: in 1797 there was published a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speech by Lord Moira on the Dreadful and Alarming State of Ireland.</hi> Lord
                    Moira’s sound judgment on public affairs, combined with his military reputation
                    and the honourable uprightness of his character, won for him a high position
                    among the statesmen of the day, and he gained an additional <hi rend="italic"
                    >prestige</hi> from his intimate relations with the prince of Wales. On two
                    occasions, in 1809 and again in 1812 after the assassination of Percival, there
                    were negotiations for placing him at the head of affairs. As a further mark of
                    the regent’s regard Lord Moira received the order of the Garter, and in the same
                    year was appointed governor-general and commander-in-chief of India. He landed
                    at Calcutta, and assumed office in succession to Lord Minto in October 1813. He
                    was now fifty-nine years of age. One of the chief questions which awaited him
                    was that of relations with the Goorkha state of Nepaul. The Goorkhas, a brave
                    and warlike little nation, failing to extend their conquests in the direction of
                    China, had begun to encroach on territories held or protected by the East India
                    Company; especially they had seized the districts of Bootwul and Seoraj, in the
                    northern part of Oudh, and when called upon to relinquish these, they
                    deliberately elected (April 1814) to go to war rather than do so. Lord Moira,
                    having travelled through the northern provinces and fully studied the question,
                    declared war against Nepaul (November 1814). The enemy’s frontier was 600 miles
                    long, and Lord Moira, who directed the plan of the campaign, resolved to act
                    offensively along the whole line. It was an anxious undertaking, because the
                    native states of India were all watching the issue and waiting for any serious
                    reverse to the English to join against them. At first all seemed to go badly, as
                    the British officers too much despised the enemy, and the Sepoys were
                    unaccustomed to mountain warfare, and thus alternate extremes of rashness and
                    despondency were exhibited. But this rectified itself in time, especially
                    through the achievements of General (afterwards Sir David) Ochterlony, who
                    before the end of 1815 had taken all the Goorkha posts to the west, and early in
                    1816 was advancing victoriously within 50 miles of Katmandoo, the capital. The
                    Goorkhas now made peace; they abandoned the disputed districts, ceded some
                    territory to the English, and agreed to receive a British resident. Ever since
                    they have faithfully kept these terms; the northern frontier of India has been
                    securely fixed, and the Goorkhas have entirely kept aloof from the machinations
                    of disaffected native states. For his masterly conduct of these affairs Lord
                    Moira was created Marquis of Hastings in 1816.</p>
                <p>He had now to deal with internal dangers. A treacherous combination of Mahratta
                    powers was constantly threatening the continuance of British rule, under the
                    guise of plausible assurances severally given by the peshwah, Sindia, Holkar,
                    and other princes. At the same time the existence of the Pindhâree state was not
                    only dangerous to the English, a3 being a warlike power always ready to turn
                    against them, but it was a scourge to India itself. In 1816, however, the
                    Pindhârees entered British territory in the Northern Circars, where they
                    destroyed 339 villages. On this, permission was obtained to act for their
                    suppression. Before the end of 1817 the preparations of Lord Hastings were
                    completed, when the peshwah suddenly broke into war, and the British were
                    opposed at once to the Mahratta and Pindhâree powers, estimated at 200,000 men
                    and 500 guns. “The whole was utterly shattered in a brief campaign<note

                    of this campaign, as well as of the war in Nepaul, see Prinsep’s <hi

                    months (1817- 1818). The peshwah’s dominion had been annexed, and those of
                    Sindia, Holkar, and the rajah of Berar lay at the mercy of the governor-general,
                    and were saved only by his exceeding and honourable moderation. There was at
                    last, after sixty years from the battle of Plassy, no question of the supremacy
                    of British power in India, now more perfectly established and more effectively
                    dominant than that of Aurungzebe.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>“It is a proud phrase to use,” said Lord Hastings,<note anchored="true"

                    a true one, that we have bestowed blessings upon millions. Nothing can be more
                    delightful than the reports I receive of the sensibility manifested by the
                    inhabitants to this change in their circumstances. The smallest detachment of
                    our troops cannot pass through that district without meeting everywhere eager
                    and exulting gratulations, the tone of which proves them to come from glowing
                    hearts. Multitudes of people have, even in this short interval, come from the
                    hills and fastnesses in which they had sought refuge for years, and have
                    reoccupied their ancient deserted villages. The ploughshare is again in every
                    quarter turning up a soil which had for many seasons never been stirred, except
                    by the hoofs of predatory cavalry.”</p>
                <p>While the natives of India appreciated the resulta of Lord Hastings’s
                    achievements, the court of directors grumbled at his having extended the British
                    territory. They also disliked and opposed his measures for introducing education
                    among the natives and his encouraging the freedom of the press. Posterity has,
                    however, vindicated the policy of Lord Hastings in all respects. In 1819 he
                    obtained the cession by purchase of the island of Singapore. In finance his
                    administration was very successful, as notwithstanding the expenses of his wars
                    he showed an annual surplus of two millions sterling. He laboured much at law
                    reform, and he succeeded in greatly raising t <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> e
                    status and character of the civil service of India. Lord and Lady Hastings by
                    their stately and yet genial manners, and by their warm encouragement of
                    literature and science, gave a high tone to the society of Calcutta. And he was
                    the first governor-general to exhibit a personal interest in the exertions of
                    the missionaries. Brilliant and beneficent as his career had been, Lord Hastings
                    did not escape, any more than Clive, Warren Hastings, or Lord Wellesley, the
                    assaults of unjust detraction. His last years of office were embittered by the
                    discussions on a matter very notorious <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0549-0518"/> at the time, namely, the affairs of the
                    banking-house of W. Palmer and Company. The whole affair was mixed up with
                    insinuations against Lord Hastings, especially charging him with having been
                    actuated by favouritism towards one of the partners in the firm. From
                    imputations which were inconsistent with his whole character he has subsequently
                    been exonerated. But while smarting under them he tendered his resignation in
                    1821, though he did not leave India till January 1823. He was much exhausted by
                    the arduous and almost incredible labours which for more than nine years he had
                    sustained. Among his characteristics it is mentioned that “his ample fortune
                    absolutely sank under the benevolence of his nature;” and, so far from having
                    enriched himself in the appointment of governorgeneral, he returned to England
                    in circumstances which obliged him still to seek public employment. In 1824 he
                    received the comparatively small post of governor of Malta, in which island he
                    introduced many reforms and endeared himself to the inhabitants. He died in
                    1826, leaving a request that his right hand should be cut off and preserved till
                    the death of the marchioness of Hastings, and then interred in her coffin.</p>
                <p>No “Life” of the marquis of Hastings has appeared, hut a diary of his first tours
                    in India, written for his children, has been published, and affords interesting
                    indications of his character. For further particulars of his career see the <hi
