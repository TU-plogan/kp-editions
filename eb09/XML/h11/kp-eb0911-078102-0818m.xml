                <p><label type="entry">HESSIAN FLY</label>, a name originally given in the United
                    States in 1776 during the War of Independence to a small fly very destructive to
                    wheat, supposed to have been brought over in straw by the Hessian troops
                    employed on the British side. It is a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cecidomyia,</hi> described under the name <hi rend="italic">C. destructor</hi>
                    by the American entomologist Say, and belonging to the Dipterous family <hi
                    rend="italic">Cecidomyiida&gt;,</hi> the numerous members of which produce
                    galls, distortions, and other injuries in the plants they attack. It was often
                    thought that this insect occurred in England; but the indigenous English
                    wheat-midge, also very destructive, is an allied species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diplosis</hi><hi rend="italic">tritici.</hi> A species found in Hungary and
                    Germany, where it has committed great damage, has been supposed to be the true
                    Hessian fly, which has also been recorded from Minorca and Naples; Cohn notices
                    its ravages in Silesia, and Künstler in Austria; and Kaltenbach (who identifies
                    <hi rend="italic">C. secalina,</hi> Loew, with it) says it is more or less
                    common in Germany, and that it originally came from Europe. Nevertheless, many
                    good authorities have considered that the destructive European fly is not
                    identical with the North American insect, though closely allied to it, and of
                    similar habits. In the United States this minute midge has been a dreadful
                    scourge at times, even to the extent of causing local famine. The female lays 20
                    or 30 eggs in a crease of the leaf of the young plant, and the larvae when
                    hatched work their way between the leaf and the stalk, till they come to a
                    joint, a little below the surface, where they remain, head down, sucking the
                    sap, and turn to pupae enclosed in a covering; this is known as the “flax-seed”
                    condition. The injury occasioned is not detected until the plant grows higher.
                    There are two broods every year, one reaching the fly state in May, the other in
                    August or early in September; as the fly only lives a few weeks, wheat that is
                    sown so late as nut to come up until the second brood has disappeared escapes
                    harm. The usual result of the attack is that small aborted ears only are formed,
                    the few grains of which shrivel and will scarcely ripen, the straw also being of
                    inferior quality. The perfect insect is smaller than the common gnat, which it
                    somewhat resembles, and from which its size and more simple antennae distinguish
                    it. The larvae are spindle-shaped and reddish-white, with the intestinal canal
                    showing through the skin when full grown; they are about one-seventh of an inch
                    long, and are provided with small hooks near the head; at this stage they group
                    themselves in regular rings round the stem attacked. A very minute natural
                    parasite, <hi rend="italic">Semiotellus destructor,</hi> belonging to the
                    division <hi rend="italic">Pteromalides</hi> of the Hymenopterous family <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalci-</hi><hi rend="italic">didoe</hi> is, luckily for
                    agriculturists, usually so plentiful as to be able to keep down the fly, on the
                    larvae and pupae of which its own larvae feed.</p>
                <p>Besides the original account by Say (in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the
                    Academy of Natural Science,</hi> Philadelphia, 1817), his countryman, Dr Asa
                    Fitch, has published a history of this insect in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the New York State Agricτcltural Society,</hi> 1846; and in
                    England the celebrated entomologist Kirby gave an account of it in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Magazine of Natural History,</hi> 1829. It is figured in the <hi
                    rend="italic">American Naturalist,</hi> vol. ii. p. 163. A map showing its
                    distribution will be found in Hayden’s Report of the United States Geological
                    and Geographical Survey for 1875.</p>
