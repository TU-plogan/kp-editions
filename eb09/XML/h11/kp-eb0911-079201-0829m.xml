                    >Corp. Inscr. Gr.,</hi> No. 1570), but most commonly used in ecclesiastical

                    the Christian Church,—the patriarchate, episcopate, or entire threefold order of
                    the clergy. The word, which does not occur in any classical Greek writer, owes
                    its present extensive currency to the celebrated writings of Dionysius
                    Pseudo-Areopagita, which, originating probably in the age of Justinian, exerted
                    during the 9th and following centuries so remarkable an influence on the current
                    of theological speculation, both in the Eastern and in the Western Church. Of
                    these the most important are the two which treat of the celestial and of the
                    ecclesiastical hierarchy respectively. Defining hierarchy as the “function which
                    comprises all sacred things,” or, more fully, as “a sacred order and science and
                    activity, assimilated as far as possible to the godlike, and elevated to the
                    imitation of God proportionately to the Divine illuminations conceded to it,”
                    the author proceeds to enumerate the nine orders of the heavenly host, which are
                    subdivided again into hierarchies or triads, in descending order, thus
                    :—Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones; Dominations, Virtues, Powers; Principalities,
                    Archangels, Angels. These all exist for the common object of raising men through
                    ascending stages of purification and illumination to perfection. The
                    ecclesiastical or earthly hierarchy is the counterpart of the other. In it the
                    first or highest triad is formed by baptism, communion, and chrism. The second
                    triad consists of the three orders of the ministry, bishop or hierarch, priest,
                    and minister or deacon <hi rend="italic">(ιεράρχης,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ιεpευς,</hi><hi rend="italic">λειτουργός)</hi>; this is the earliest known
                    instance in which the title hierarch is applied to a bishop. The third or lowest
                    triad is made up of monks, “initiated,” and catechumens. To Dionysius may be
                    traced, through Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic writers of the intervening
                    period, the definition of the term usually given by Roman Catholic
                    writers—“ccetus seu ordo praesidum et sacrorum ministrorum ad regendam ecclesiam
                    gignendamque in hominibus sanctitatem divinitus institutus”<note anchored="true"

                    —although it immediately rests upon the authority of the sixth canon of the
                    twenty-third session of the council of Trent, in which anathema is pronounced
                    upon all who deny the existence within the Catholic Church of a hierarchy
                    instituted by divine appointment, and consisting of bishops, priests, and
                    ministers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Si quis
                    dixerit in ecclesia catholica non esse hierarchiam divina ordinatione
                    institutam, quae constat ex episcopis, presbyteris, et ministris: anathema
                    sit.</p></note> This definition, however, relates only to what is called the
                    “hierarchy of orders,” to which hierarchy, it must further be borne in mind,
                    belong the lesser orders of sub-deacon, acolyth, exorcist, lector, and
                    doorkeeper (to which that of singer is sometimes added); though these are to be
                    regarded as institutions of ecclesiastical authority only, while the other three
                    are of divine right, and therefore preeminently “holy.” The “hierarchy of
                    jurisdiction,” as distinguished from that of “orders,” is represented by the
                    Roman pontiff alone, who enjoys supreme authority over all bishops, even when
                    these are assembled iu general council. This supreme authority he holds by
                    divine right as the successor of Peter, who received immediately from Christ the
                    primacy of honour and of jurisdiction over the universal church.<note

                    archbishops and the patriarchs; but these intermediate grades are not regarded
                    as essential, and, for the present at least, the rank of patriarch may almost be
                    said to be, in the Roman communion, purely titular. The Greek Church, like the
                    Roman, recognizes a threefold clerical order, distinct <hi rend="italic">jure
                    divinο</hi> from other Christians, of bishops, priests, and deacons. The five
                    patriarchs, of equal dignity, hold the highest rank in the episcopate; and the
                    episcopal body united in a general council represents the church, and infallibly
                    decides, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, all matters of faith and
                    ecclesiastical life. The Anglican Church acknowledges the superior aud divinely
                    conferred authority of the episcopal order, but, seeking its hierarchical
                    doctrine in the records of a comparatively early period of church history, holds
                    the substantial equality of all bishops, and, while acknowledging the validity,
                    does not maintain the necessary infallibility, of their decisions when met in
                    general council. Thus in form of government the Roman Church may be said to be a
                    hierarchical monarchy, the Greek in some sense a patriarchal oligarchy, and the
                    Anglican an episcopal aristocracy. For historical and other details relating to
                    the growth and development of the hierarchical system the reader is referred to
                    the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Apostle, Archbishop, Bishop, Cardinal, Church,

                <p>Some kind of hierarchy, both of orders and of jurisdiction, may, from the nature
                    of the case, be looked for in every religious system that has attained any
                    considerable degree of visibility and external organization. The ancient Jewish
                    and Egyptian hierarchies, for example, find parallels in Parsism and
                    Mahometanism; while in some regions Buddhism has attained a degree of complexity
                    in its ecclesiastical government strikingly suggestive of many features of the
                    present Roman hierarchy.</p>
