                    (1786-1846), historical painter and writer, was born at Plymouth, January 26,
                    1786. His mother was the daughter of the Rev. Benjamin Cobley, rector of
                    Dodbrook, Devon, whose son, General Sir Thomas Cobley, signalized himself in the
                    Russian service at the siege of Ismail. His father, a prosperous printer,
                    stationer, and publisher, was a man of literary taste, and was well known and
                    esteemed amongst all classes in Plymouth. Haydon, an only son, at an early date
                    gave evidence of his taste for study, which was carefully fostered and promoted
                    by his mother. At the age of six he was placed in Plymouth grammar school, and
                    at twelve in Plympton St Mary school. He completed his education in this
                    institution, where Sir Joshua Reynolds also had acquired all the scholastic
                    training he ever received. On the ceiling of the school-room was a sketch by
                    Reynolds in burnt cork, which it used to be Haydon’s delight to sit and
                    contemplate. Whilst at school lie had some thought of adopting the medical
                    profession, but he was so shocked at the sight of an operation that he gave up
                    the idea. A perusal of Albinus, however, inspired him with a love for anatomy;
                    and Reynolds’s discourses aroused within him a smouldering taste for painting,
                    which from childhood had been the absorbing idea of his mind. Sanguine of
                    success, full of energy and vigour, he started from the parental roof, May 14,
                    1804, for London, and entered his name as a student of the Royal Academy. He
                    began and prosecuted his studies with such unwearied ardour that Fuseli wondered
                    when he ever found time to eat. At the age of twenty-one (1807) II.·ydon
                    exhibited, for the first time, at the Royal Academy, The Repose in Egypt, which
                    was bought by Mr Thomas Hope the year after. This was a good start for the young
                    artist, who shortly received a commission from Lord Mulgrave and an introduction
                    to Sir George Beaumont. In 1809 he finished his well-known picture of Dentatus,
                    which, though it brought him a great increase of fame, involved him in a
                    life-long quarrel with the Royal Academy, whose committee had hung the picture
                    in a small side-room instead of the great hall. In 1810 his difficulties began
                    through the stoppage of an allowance of £200 a year he had received from his
                    father. His disappointment was embittered by the controversies in w hich he now
                    became involved with Sir George Beaumont, for whom he had painted his famous
                    picture of Macbeth, and Mr Payne Knight,^ who had denied the beauties as well as
                    the value of the Elgin Marbles. The Judgment of Solomon, his next production,
                    gained him £700, besides £100 voted to him by the directors of the British
                    Institution, and the freedom of the borough of Plymouth. To recruit his health
                    and escape for a time from the cares of London life, Haydon joined his intimate
                    friend Wilkie in a trip to Paris; he studied at the Louvre; and on his return to
                    England produced his Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem, which afterwards formed the
                    nucleus for the American Gallery of Painting, which was erected by his cousin
                    John Havilland of Philadelphia. Whilst painting Lazarus his pecuniary
                    difficulties increased, and for the first time he was arrested but not
                    imprisoned, the sheriff-officer taking his word for his appearance. Amidst all
                    these harassing cares he married in October 1821 a beautiful young widow, Mrs
                    Hyman, to whom he was devotedly attached. In 1823 Haydon was lodged in the
                    King’s Bench, where lie' received consoling letters from the first men of the
                    day. Whilst a prisoner he drew up a petition to parliament in favour of the
                    appointment of “a committee to inquire into the state of encouragement of
                    historical painting,” which was presented by Mr Brougham. He also, during a
                    second imprisonment in 1827, produced the picture of the Mock Election, the idea
                    of which had been suggested by an incident that happened in the prison. The king
                    (George IV.) gave him £500 for this work. Among Haydon’s other pictures
                    were—1829, Eudes, and Punch; 1831, Napoleon at St Helena, for Sir Robert Peel;
                    Xenophon, on his Retreat with the “Ten Thousand,” first seeing the Sea; and
                    Waiting for the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> purchased by the marquis of
                    Stafford; 1832, Falstaff, and Achilles playing the Lyre. In 1834 he completed
                    the Reform Banquet, for Lord Grey— this painting contained 197 portraits; in
                    1843, Curtius Leaping into the Gulf, and Uriel and Satan. When the competition
                    took place at Westminster Hall, Haydon sent two cartoons, The Curse of Adam, and
                    Edward the Black Prince, but had not the good fortune to gain a prize for
                    either. He then painted The Banishment of Aristides, which was exhibited with
                    other productions under the same roof where Tom Thumb was then making his début
                    in London. The exhibition was unsuccessful; and the artist’s difficulties
                    increased to such an extent that, whilst employed on his last grand effort,
                    Alfred and the Trial by Jury, overcome by debt, disappointment, and ingratitude,
                    be wrote “Stretch me no longer on this rough world,” and put an end to his
                    existence with a pistol-shot, June 22, 1846, in the sixty-first year of his age.
                    He left a widow and three children (various others had died), who, by the
                    generosity of their father’s friends, were rescued from their pecuniary
                    difficulties and comfortably provided for; amongst the foremost of these friends
                    were Sir Robert Peel, Count D’Orsay, Mr Justice Talfourd, and Lord Carlisle.</p>
                <p>Haydon began his first lecture on painting and design in 1835, and afterwards
                    visited all the principal towns in England and Scotland. His delivery was
                    energetic and imposing, his language powerful, flowing, and apt, and replete
                    with wit and humour; and to look at the lecturer, excited by his subject, one
                    could scarcely fancy him a man overwhelmed with difficulties and anxieties. The
                    height of Haydon’s ambition was to behold the first buildings of his country
                    adorned with historical representations of her glory. He lived to see the
                    acknowledgment of his principles by Government in the establishment of schools
                    of design, and the embellishment of the new houses of parliament; but in the
                    competition of artists for the carryingout of this object, the commissioners
                    (amongst whom was one of his former pupils) considered, or affected to consider,
                    that he had failed. Haydon was well versed in all points of his profession; and
                    his <hi rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> which were published shortly after their
                    delivery, showed that he was as bold a writer as painter. It may be mentioned in
                    this <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n575/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0575-0542"/> connexion that he wa≡ the author of the long and
                    elaborate article, “Painting,” in the 7th edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopcedia Britannica.</hi></p>
                <p>To form a correct estimate of Haydon it is necessary to read his autobiography.
                    This is one of the most natural books ever written, full of various and abundant
                    power, and fascinating to the reader. The author seems to have daguerreotyped
                    his feelings and sentiments without restraint as they rose in his mind, and his
                    portrait stands in these volumes limned to the life by his own hand. His love
                    for his art was both a passion and a principle. He found patrons difficult to
                    manage; and, not having the tact to lead them gently, he tried to drive them
                    fiercely. He failed, abused patrons and patronage, and intermingled talk of the
                    noblest independence with acts not always dignified. He was self-willed to
                    perversity, but his perseverance was such as is seldom associated with so much
                    vehemence and passion. With a large fund of genuine self-reliance he combined a
                    considerable measure of vanity. To the last he believed in his own powers and in
                    the ultimate triumph of art. In taste he wa3 deficient, at least as concerned
                    himself. Hence the tone of self-assertion which he assumed in his
                    advertisements, catalogues, and other appeals to the public. He proclaimed
                    himself the apostle and martyr of high art, and believed himself to have on that
                    account a claim on the sympathy and support of the nation. It must be confessed
                    that he often tested severely those whom he called his friends. Every reader of
                    his autobiography will be struck at the frequency and fervour of the short
                    prayers interspersed throughout the work. Haydon had an overwhelming sense of a
                    personal, overruling, and merciful providence, which influenced his relations
                    with his family, and to some extent with the world. His conduct as a husband and
                    father entitles him to the utmost sympathy. In art his powers and attainments
                    were undoubtedly very great, although his actual performances mostly fall short
                    of the faculty which was manifestly within him; his general range and force of
                    mind were also most remarkable, and would have qualified him to shine in almost
                    any path of intellectual exertion or of practical work. His eager and combative
                    character was partly his enemy; but he had other enemies actuated by motives as
                    unworthy as his own were always high-pitchel and on abstract grounds laudable.
                    Of his three great works—the Solomon, the Entry into Jerusalem, and the
                    Lazarus—the second has generally been regarded as the finest. The Solomon is
                    also a very admirable production, showing his executive power at its loftiest,
                    and of itself enough to place Haydon at the head of British historical painting
                    in his own time. The Lazarus, now in the National Gallery, is a more unequal
                    performance, and in various respects open to criticism and censure; yet the head
                    of Lazarus is so majestic and impressive that, if its author had done nothing
                    else, we must still pronounce him a potent pictorial genius.</p>
