                    Athens, probably also in Thrace, Thessaly, Delos, and his native island. He died
                    at Larissa in Thessaly, his age being variously stated as 85, 90, 104, and 109.
                    The incidents of his life are shrouded by uncertain traditions, which naturally
                    sprang up in the absence of any authentic record; the earliest biography was by
                    one of the Sorani, probably Soranus the younger of Ephesus, in the <pb

                    him in the 11th, and Tzetzes in the 12th century. In all these biographies there
                    is internal evidence of confusion; many of the incidents related are elsewhere
                    told of other persons, and certain of them are quite irreconcilable with his
                    character, so far as it can be judged of from his writings and from the opinions
                    expressed of him by his contemporaries; we may safely reject, for instance, the
                    legends that he set fire to the library of the temple of health at Cnidos, in
                    order to destroy the evidence of plagiarism, and that he refused to visit Persia
                    at the request of Artaxerxes Longimanus, during a pestilential epidemic, on the
                    ground that he would in so doing be assisting an enemy. He is referred to by
                    Plato <hi rend="italic">(fProtag.,</hi> p. 283; <hi rend="italic">Phcedr.,</hi>
                    p. 211) as an eminent medical authority, and his opinion is also quoted by
                    Aristotle. The veneration in which he was held by the Athenians serves to
                    dissipate the calumnies which, have been thrown on his character by Andreas, and
                    the whole tone of his writings bespeaks a man of the highest integrity and
                    purest morality.</p>
                <p>Bom of a family of priest-physicians, and inheriting all its traditions and
                    prejudices, Hippocrates was the first to cast superstition aside, and to base
                    the practice of medicine on the principles of inductive philosophy. It is
                    impossible to trace directly the influence exercised upon him by the great men
                    of his time, but one cannot fail to connect his emancipation of medicine from
                    superstition with the widespread power exercised over Greek life and thought by
                    the living work of Socrates, Plato, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus,
                    and Thucydides. It was a period of great intellectual development, and it only
                    needed a powerful mind such as his to bring to bear upon medicine the same
                    influences which were at work in other sciences. It must be remembered that his
                    training was not altogether bad, although superstition entered so largely into
                    it. He had a great master in Democritus, the originator of the doctrine of
                    atoms, and there is every reason to believe that the various “asclepia” were
                    very carefully conducted hospitals for the sick, possessing a curious system of
                    case-books, in the form of votive tablets, left by the patients, on which were
                    recorded the symptoms, treatment, and result of each case. He had these records
                    at his command; and he had the opportunity of observing the system of training
                    and the treatment of injuries in the gymnasia. One of his great merits is that
                    he was the first to dissociate medicine from priestcraft, and to direct
                    exclusive attention to the natural history of disease. How strongly his mind
                    revolted against the use of charms, amulets, incantations, and such devices
                    appears from his writings; and he has expressly recorded, as underlying all his
                    practice, the conviction that, however diseases may be regarded from the
                    religious point of view, they must all be scientifically treated as subject to
                    natural laws <hi rend="italic">(De Acre,</hi> 29). Nor was he anxious to
                    maintain the connexion between philosophy and medicine which had for long
                    existed in a confused and confusing fashion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    ab studio sapientiae disciplinam hanc separavit, vir et arte et facundia

                    of anatomy, physiology, and pathology was necessarily defective, the respect in
                    which the dead body was held by the Greeks precluding him from practising
                    dissection; thus we find him writing of the tissues without distinguishing
                    between the various textures of the body, confusing arteries, veins, and nerves,
                    and speaking vaguely of the muscles as “flesh.” But when we come to study his
                    observations on the natural history of disease as presented in the living
                    subject, we recognize at once the presence of a great clinical physician.
                    Hippocrates based his principles and practice on the theory of the existence of
                    a spiritual restoring essence or principle, φυ&lt;πj, the <hi rend="italic">vis
                    mcdicαtrix naturae,</hi> in the management of which the art of the physician
                    consisted. This art could, he held, be only obtained by the application of
                    experience, not only to disease at large, but to disease in the individual. He
                    strongly deprecated blind empiricism; the aphorism “ή <hi rend="italic">πe7pa
                    σφaKepη, η κpiσιs</hi><hi rend="italic">χαλιπη”</hi> (whether it be his or not),
                    tersely illustrates his position. Holding firmly to the principle, <hi
                    rend="italic">νοΰσων</hi><hi rend="italic">ψυσιes iητpο'ι,</hi> he did not allow
                    himself to remain inactive in the presence of disease; he was not a merely
                    “expectant” physician; as Sydenham puts it, his practice was “the support of
                    enfeebled and the coercion of outrageous nature.” He largely employed powerful
                    medicines and blood-letting both ordinary and by cupping. He advises, however,
                    great caution in their application. He placed great dependence on diet and
                    regimen, and here, quaint as many of his directions may now sound, not only in
                    themselves, but in the reasons given, there is much which is still adhered to at
                    the present day. His treatise ∏epl <hi rend="italic">cdpων, υSiτων, κal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τόπων</hi><hi rend="italic">(Airs,</hi><hi rend="italic">Waters,
                    and Places)</hi> contains the first enunciation of the principles of public
                    health. Although the treatises ∏∈pl <hi rend="italic">κρίσιμων</hi> cannot be
                    accepted as authentic, we find in the <hi rend="italic">Προγνωστικόν</hi>
                    evidence of the acuteness of observation in the manner in which the occurrence
                    of critical days in disease is enunciated. His method of reporting cases is most
                    interesting and instructive; in them we can read how thoroughly he had separated
                    himself from the priest-physician. Laennec, to whom we are indebted for the
                    practice of auscultation, freely admits that the idea was suggested to him by
                    study of Hippocrates, who, treating of the presence of morbid fluids in the
                    thorax, gives very particular directions, by means of succussion, for arriving
                    at an opinion regarding their nature. Laennec says, “Hippocrate avait tenté
                    Γauscultation immediate.” Although the treatise ∏epl <hi rend="italic"
                    >νοΰσων</hi> is doubtfully from the pen of Hippocrates, it contains strong
                    evidence of having been the work of his grandson, representing the views of the
                    Father of Medicine. Although not accurate in the conclusions reached at the
                    time, the value of the method of diagnosis is shown by the retention in modern
                    medicine of the name and the practice of “Hippocratic succussion.” The power of
                    graphic description of phenomena in the Hippocratic writings is illustrated by
                    the retention of the term “facies Hippocratica,” applied to the appearance of a
                    moribund person, pictured in the <hi rend="italic">Prognostics.</hi> In surgery
                    his writings are important and interesting, but they do not bear the same
                    character of caution as the treatises on medicine; for instance, in the essay
                    <hi rend="italic">On Injuries of the Head,</hi> he advocates the operation “of
                    trephining” more strongly and in wider classes of cases than would be warranted
                    by the experience of later times.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hippocratic Collection</hi> consists of eighty-seven
                    treatises, of which a part only can be accepted as genuine. The collection has
                    been submitted to the closest criticism in ancient and modern times by a large
                    number of commentators. (For full list of the early commentators, see Adams’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Genuine Works of</hi><hi rend="italic">Hippocrates,</hi>
                    Sydenham Society, vol. i. pp. 27, 28.) The treatises have been classified
                    according to (1) the direct evidence of ancient writers, (2) peculiarities of
                    style and method, and (3) the presence of anachronisms and of opinions opposed
                    to the general Hippocratic teaching,—greatest weight being attached to the
                    opinions of Erotian and Galen. The general estimate of commentators is thus
                    stated by Adams:— “The peculiar style and method of Hippocrates are held to be
                    conciseness of expression, great condensation of matter, and disposition to
                    regard all professional subjects in a practical point of view, to eschew subtle
                    hypotheses and modes of treatment based on vague abstractions.” The treatises
                    have been grouped in the four following sections :—(1) genuine; (2) those
                    consisting of notes taken by students and collected after the death of
                    Hippocrates; (3) essays by disciples; (4) those utterly spurious. Littré accepts
                    the following thirteen as absolutely genuine:—(1) <hi rend="italic">On Ancient

                    rend="italic">Oath</hi> may be accepted as genuine; its comparative antiquity is
                    not denied. The <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms</hi> are certainly later and
                    inferior. In the other noir-Hippocratic writings Er∙ merins thinks he can
                    distinguish the hands of no fewer than nineteen different authors, most of them
                    anonymous, and some of them very late.</p>
                <p>The earliest Greek edition of the Hippocratic writings is that which was
                    published by Aldus and Asulanus at Venice in 1526 (folio); it was speedily
                    followed by that of Frobenius, which is much more accurate and complete (fol.,
                    Basel, 1538). Of the numerous subsequent editions, probably the best was thatof
                    Foesius (Frankfort, 1595, 1621,Geneva, 1657), until the publication of the great
