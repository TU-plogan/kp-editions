                    (1583-1646), a celebrated Scottish ecclesiastic, was born in 1583. He was
                    educated at the university of St Andrews, where he -was appointed professor of
                    rhetoric and philosophy and questor of the faculty of arts in 1610. A year or
                    two after this he was presented to the living of Leuchars by Archbishop
                    Glad-stanes. As Henderson was forced upon his parish by an archbishop, and as he
                    was known to sympathize with Episcopacy, his settlement was at first extremely
                    unpopular; but he subsequently changed his views, and became a Presbyterian in
                    doctrine and church government, and one of the most esteemed ministers in
                    Scotland. He early made his mark as a church leader, and took an active part in
                    petitioning against Episcopal innovations. On the 1st of March 1638 the public
                    signing of the “National Covenant” began in Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh.
                    Henderson is mainly responsible for this document; and he seems always to have
                    been applied to when any manifesto of unusual ability was required. In July of
                    the same year he proceeded to the north, to debate on the “Covenant” with the
                    famous Aberdeen doctors; but he was not well received by them. “The voyd church
                    was made fast, and the keys keeped by the magistrate,” says Baillie. Henderson’s
                    next public appearance was in the famous Assembly which met in Glasgow on the
                    21st of November 1638. He was chosen moderator by acclamation, being, as Baillie
                    says, “incomparablie the ablest man of us all for all things.” The marquis of
                    Hamilton was the king’s commissioner; and, when the Assembly insisted on
                    proceeding with the trial of the bishops, he formally dissolved the meeting
                    under pain of treason. Nothing daunted, however, they sat till the 20th of
                    December, deposed all the Scottish bishops, excommunicated a number of them,
                    repealed all acts favouring Episcopacy, and reconstituted the Scottish Kirk on
                    thorough Presbyterian principles. During the sitting of this Assembly it was
                    carried by a majority of seventy-five votes that Henderson should be transferred
                    to Edinburgh. He had been at Leuchars for about twenty-three years, and was
                    extremely reluctant to leave it. λVhile Scotland and England were preparing for
                    the “First Bishops’ War,” Henderson drew up two papers, entitled respectively—
                    <hi rend="italic">The Remonstrance of the Nobility,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Instructions for Defensive Arms.</hi> The first of these documents he published
                    himself; the second was published against his wish by Corbet, a deposed
                    minister. The “First Bishops’ War” did not last long. At the Pacification of
                    Birks the king had virtually to grant all the demands of the Scots. In the
                    negotiations for peace Henderson was one of the Scottish commissioners, and made
                    a very favourable impression on the king. In 1640 Henderson was elected by the
                    town council rector of Edinburgh university—an office to which he was annually
                    re-elected till his death. The Pacification of Birks had been wrung from the
                    king; and the Scots, seeing that he was preparing for the “Second Bishops’ War,”
                    took the initiative, and pressed into England so vigorously that Charles had
                    again to yield everything. The maturing of the treaty of peace took a
                    considerable time; and Henderson was again active in the negotiations, first at
                    Ripon, and afterwards at London. While he was in London he had a personal
                    interview with the king, with the view of obtaining assistance for Edinburgh
                    university from the money formerly applied to the support of the bishops. On
                    Henderson’s return to Edinburgh in July 1641, the Assembly was sitting at St
                    Andrews. To suit the convenience of the parliament, however, it removed to
                    Edinburgh; and Henderson was elected moderator of the Edinburgh meeting. In this
                    Assembly he proposed that “a confession of faith, a catechism, a directory for
                    all the parts of the public worship, and a platform of government, wherein
                    possibly England and we might agree,” should be drawn up. This was unanimously
                    approved of, and the laborious undertaking was left in Henderson’s hands; but
                    the “notable motion” did not lead to any immediate results. During Charles’s
                    second state-visit to Scotland, in the autumn of 1641, Henderson acted as his
                    chaplain, and managed to get the funds, formerly belonging to the bishopric of
                    Edinburgh, applied to the metropolitan university. In 1642 Henderson was engaged
                    in corresponding with England on ecclesiastical topics; and, shortly afterwards,
                    he went to Oxford to mediate between the king and his parliament; but his
                    mission proved a failure. A memorable meeting of the General Assembly was held
                    in August 1643. Henderson was elected moderator for the third time. He presented
                    a draft of the famous “Solemn League and Covenant,” which was received with
                    great enthusiasm. Unlike the “National Covenant” of 1638, which applied to
                    Scotland only, this document was common to the two kingdoms. Henderson, Baillie,
                    Rutherford, and others were sent up to London to represent Scotland in the
                    Assembly at Westminster. The “Solemn League and Covenant,” after undergoing some
                    slight alterations, passed the two Houses of Parliament and the Westminster
                    Assembly, and thus became law for the two kingdoms. By means of it Henderson has
                    had an extraordinary influence on the history of Great Britain. As Scottish
                    commissioner to the Westminster Assembly, he was in England from August 1643
                    till August 1646; and the action of the Scottish commissioners gave a fresh
                    impulse to English Presbyterianism. Early in 1645 Henderson was sent to Uxbridge
                    to aid the commissioners of the two parliaments in negotiating with the king;
                    but nothing came of the conference. In 1646 the king joined the Scottish army;
                    and, after retiring with them to Newcastle<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n685/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0685-0652"/>, he sent for Henderson, and discussed with him
                    the two systems of church government in a number of papers. Meanwhile Henderson
                    was failing in health. He sailed to Scotland, and eight days after his arrival
                    died on the 19th of August 1646. He was buried in Greyfriars Churchyard,
                    Edinburgh; and his death was the occasion of national mourning in Scotland. An
                    absurd story was at once invented to the effect that, after recanting to the
                    king’s views, he had died of remorse. A document was forged, purporting to be a
                    “Declaration of Mr Alexander Henderson;” and, although this paper was disowned,
                    denounced, and shown to be false in the General Assembly of August 1648, the
                    fiction was used by Clarendon, and still finds a place in professedly historical
                    compilations.</p>
                <p>Henderson is one of the greatest men in the history of Scotland, and, next to
                    Knox, is certainly the most famous of Scottish ecclesiastics. He had great
                    political genius; and his statesmanship was so influential that “he was,” as
                    Professor Masson well observes, “a cabinet minister without office.” He has made
                    a deep mark on the history, not only of Scotland, but of England; and the
                    existing Presbyterian Churches in Scotland are largely indebted to him for the
                    forms of their dogmas and their ecclesiastical organization. He is thus justly
                    considered the second founder of the Reformed Church in Scotland.</p>
