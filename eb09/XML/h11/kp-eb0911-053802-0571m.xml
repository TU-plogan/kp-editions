                    not long before his death, received a picture of Haydn’s birthplace, he
                    exclaimed— “How wonderful that so great a man should have been born in a
                    peasant’s cottage.” This cottage, which is still standing, had been built by
                    Haydn’s father, a worthy wheelwright, of whose twelve children the composer was
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n572/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0572-0539"/> the second. At an early age the child evinced so
                    decided a talent for music that one Johann Mathias Frankh, a distant relation of
                    the family, proposed to undertake Ids musical and general education, and for
                    that purpose invited him to Hainburg, a neighbouring town where Frankh kept a
                    school. To Hainburg accordingly young Haydn went in 1738, and there he received
                    instruction in the elementary knowledge of his art, including a practical
                    acquaintance with most instruments, at the hands of the musical schoolmaster.
                    Having developed an agreeable soprano voice, young Haydn was by the intercession
                    of the dean of Hainburg promoted to a post amongst the choir boys of St
                    Stephen’s cathedral, Vienna, where he remained from 1740-50, doing duty in the
                    church services, and at the same time enlarging his musical knowledge and
                    experience. His artistic education was, however, all but exclusively practical,
                    and it is said that he received only two theoretical lessons from Reuter the
                    chapel-master. As a composer, therefore, Haydn was in every sense self-taught.
                    Of his zeal in acquiring information he was in the habit of talking with pride
                    in later years, and several works of sacred music were the first fruit of his
                    early studies. In 1749 or 1750 his beautiful boyish voice changed, and he lost
                    his position accordingly. Being now thrown on his own resources, he had to
                    undergo various forms of musical drudgery, such as giving lessons (at the
                    moderate stipend of two florins per month) and even playing in the orchestra at
                    dances and the like. His condition was somewhat improved by his acquaintance
                    with Metastasio, the celebrated operatic poet, in fact the Scribe of the 18th
                    century, who introduced him to Senor Martinez, a Spaniard living in Vienna,
                    whose daughter Haydn instructed for several years. It was through Metastasio
                    also that Haydn came into contact with Porpora the composer, best known as the
                    singing-master of the great Farinelli. For a considerable time Haydn remained in
                    constant intercourse with him, acting as his accompanist, and occasionally it is
                    said as his valet. In return he obtained a perfect acquaintance with Porpora’s
                    method, besides his knowledge of the Italian language, both invaluable to a
                    composer in those days. The works of Emmanuel Bach, son of the great Sebastian,
                    at the same time became his model for chamber music. Fux’s excellent work <hi
                    rend="italic">Gradus</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Parnassum</hi> was his guide in his studies of counterpoint. A mass in F, and a
                    farce <hi rend="italic">Der neue krumme</hi><hi rend="italic">Teufel,</hi> both
                    written in or about 1752, were Haydn’s first important attempts at composition.
                    The former is still in existence, but of the latter the libretto by Kurz only
                    remains. It was produced early in 1752, and seems to have met with considerable
                    success. Haydn’s acquaintance with Gluck also dates from this period. An
                    important event in Haydn’s life was his acquaintance with Baron Furnberg, an
                    accomplished amateur, for whose private concerts he wrote his first string
                    quartet, a form of composition in which he earned some of his greatest and most
                    permanent triumphs. It is in the key of B flat, and was followed in rapid
                    succession by seventeen other works of the same class, written during the years
                    1755 and 1756. To his new protector Haydn also owed his still more important
                    acquaintance with Count Ferdinand Morzin. Count Morzin in 1759 appointed him
                    conductor of his small but excellent band. The opportunities of hearing his own
                    works performed by competent musicians Haydn did not neglect, and his first
                    symphony in D belongs to the year 1759. Soon afterwards Count Morzin was
                    compelled to dissolve his band, but Haydn’s position was by this time
                    sufficiently established, and very soon afterwards he found employment as second
                    chapel-master to Prince Paul Esterhazy, one of the richest Austrian nobles,
                    whose love of art was as great as his wealth. The Esterhazy family have been
                    amongst the foremost patrons of music in Vienna from the days of Haydn to those
                    of Beethoven and Schubert. Prince Paul died in 1762, and left his title and
                    fortune to his brother Nicholas, surnamed the Magnificent. He immediately
                    enlarged his orchestra, and also increased the salaries of its members,
                    including that of Haydn (from 400 to 600 florins), and on the death of his
                    colleague Werner, a scholarly but dry musician, appointed him first conductor.
                    This position, or at least its title and emoluments, Haydn retained till his
                    death, and his attachment to the Esterhazy family remained unchanged by his
                    subsequent fame and fortunes. The events just referred to determined Haydn’s
                    career for the next twenty-eight years. During this period he was in the active
                    service of his protector, residing at Esterhâz, the splendid country seat of the
                    family, described as a second Versailles, or in Vienna, conducting the orchestra
                    of the prince, and writing for his concerts and theatre a number of works,
                    including symphonies, cassationes, quartets, sonatas, and numerous vocal
                    compositions, including several operas, none of which, however, had any
                    permanent success. Thus the opera <hi rend="italic">La vera Constanza,</hi>
                    written for the court theatre of Vienna in 1776, was withdrawn by the composer
                    owing to intrigues against him, it is said; and we are not told that it met with
                    a much better fate on its revival fourteen years later. Another dramatic work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hisola disαbitata</hi> (1779), procured for the composer the
                    membership of the Accademia Filarmonica at Modena, and a gold snuff-box from the
                    king of Spain. But with its companions it has not escaped oblivion. The truth is
                    that Haydn was without the true dramatic spirit, and of this he was himself well
                    aware. According to his own confession his operas were fitted only for the small
                    stage at Esterhâz; in a large theatre, and before a miscellaneous audience, they
                    lost their effect. The scores of most of the operas are preserved in the
                    archives of Eisenstadt, another seat of the Esterhazy family. Of his life during
                    this period little need be said. It was eventless and to a certain extent
                    monotonous, but free from care and exclusively devoted to art. His own words,
                    quoted by Herr Pohl, sum up all that it is necessary to relate. “My prince was
                    always satisfied with my work; I not only had the encouragement of constant
                    approval, but as conductor of an orchestra I could make experiments, observe
                    what produced an effect and what weakened it, and was thus in a position to
                    improve, alter, make additions or omissions, and be as bold as I pleased. I was
                    cut off from the world; there was no one to confuse or torment me, and I was
                    forced to become original.” The only person that could have wished to “confuse
                    or torment” the harmless composer was fortunately kept at distance by the strict
                    order of the prince’s household, that none of his musicians was to be
                    accompanied by his wife. Haydn at an early age became attached to the daughter
                    of a hairdresser, Keller by name, and after her death was persuaded to marry her
                    sister, three years older than himself. The marriage was an unhappy one, and the
                    pair separated soon after their union, Haydn’s inflammable heart subsequently
                    causing him more or less serious trouble on more than one occasion. In the
                    meantime the composer’s fame had begun to spread from an early period of his
                    career. As early as 1766 a journal speaks of him as the “favourite of the
                    nation,” and foreign countries were not slow in acknowledging his merits. Thus
                    one of his works, <hi rend="italic">The Seven Words of our Saviour on the
                    Cross,</hi> a series of orchestral interludes for the church service on Good
                    Friday, was written by special invitation for the cathedral of Cadiz. In Paris
                    his works were performed with immense success at the Concert Spirituel, and a
                    single English firm bought the copyright of no less than 129 of his works,
                    including 82 symphonies. The appreciation of Haydn’s work in England led to
                    important results in his latter years. Several pressing invitations to visit
                    that country had been declined by the composer on account <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0573-0540"/> of his services being required at Esterhâz. But
                    when in 1790 Prince Nicholas died, and his successor dissolved the orchestra,
                    allowing Haydn a considerable pension, the latter was at last at liberty to
                    accept a munificent offer from Salomon, the violinist and entrepreneur, in whose
                    company he started for London, where Salomon occupied a leading position in the
                    musical world. They left Vienna in December 1790, and travelled by way of Bonn,
                    where Salomon had been born. There, accordingly, a halt was made, and Haydn was
                    received by the elector with every honour due to his fame. The amusing
                    description of a dinner given during his stay at Bonn may be read in Thayer’s
                    biography of Beethoven, who at that time was a member of the electoral chapel,
                    and not unlikely made on this occasion Haydn’s acquaintance. On the latter’s
                    return journey the young man submitted a cantata to the celebrated composer,
                    whom he soon afterwards followed to Vienna to become his pupil. It is well known
                    that the relations between the great master and his greater pupil were not
                    altogether what might have been desired. Beethoven’s genius was of too
                    individual a type to bear the impress of a nature so different as Haydn’s, and
                    the latter may not always have taken sufficient trouble to enter into the ways
                    of his wilful pupil. Certain it is that, at one time of his career, Beethoven
                    delighted in speaking slightingly of “Papa Haydn,” and, for instance, refused to
                    call himself Haydn’s pupil, because, as he bluntly said, he never learnt
                    anything under his tuition. He even went so far as to suspect Haydn of w ilfully
                    trying to keep him back in his studies. It was only in his later years that this
                    animosity gave way to the more genial appreciation of his great predecessor, an
                    expression of which is quoted at the beginning of this notice.</p>
                <p>Haydn’s visit to London was a succession of triumphs. Dr Burney welcomed him with
                    a laudatory poem; the various musical societies of the metropolis vied for his
                    presence; and on July 8, 1791, he was created doctor of music by the university
                    of Oxford. At court also he was received with every distinction, and the
                    aristocracy followed the royal example. Neither were more substantial rewards
                    wanting. Haydn’s engagement with Salomon was to write and conduct at the
                    concerts in the Hanover Square Rooms six symphonies, and the success of these
                    may be judged from the fact that at Haydn’s benefit concert, for which £20d had
                    been guaranteed to him, the receipts rose to .£350. He also appeared at other
                    concerts (one given by himself at Hanover Square Rooms, where amongst other
                    works the <hi rend="italic">Seven</hi> JFbrcZs already referred to was
                    performed), always with equal success. The same events were repeated in the
                    following year, when the Salomon concerts began in February, and concluded with
                    an extra concert in June. The symphonies known as the “Salomon Set,” comprising
                    some of Haydn’s finest instrumental works, are the permanent record of the
                    connexion of the two artists. In 1792 Haydn also went to hear the charity
                    children at St Paul’s, whose singing produced on him as deep an impression as it
                    did on Berlioz many years later. “I was more touched by this innocent and
                    reverent music,” he wrote in his diary, “than by any I ever heard in my life.”
                    Haydn left London in June 1792, but only to return in January 1794. In addition
                    to his earlier works six new symphonies were played at the concerts of Salomon,
                    which in the following year were given at the King’s Concert-room and terminated
                    on June 1,1795, when Haydn appeared for the last time in England. In additi m to
                    valuable presents from royalty and other persons, he realized £1200 by his
                    second English visit, from which he returned to Vienna in the autumn of 1795, to
                    resume once more his functions in the newly organized chapel of Prince
                    Esterhazy. He was now well stricken in years, and might have rested on his
                    laurels. But so far from this being the case, the two works on which—apart from
                    bis symphonies and sonatas—his immortality must mainly rest, belong to this last
                    epoch of his life. These were the oratorio <hi rend="italic">The Creation,</hi>
                    and the cantata <hi rend="italic">The Seasons.</hi> They were both written to
                    German translations of English libretti, the former being compiled from <hi
                    rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> the latter from Thomson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seasons. The Creation</hi> was first performed in public on March 19, 1799,
                    when its success was as immediate as it has since proved permanent. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Seasons</hi> was begun soon after the completion of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Creation,</hi> and finished in very little time. No one,
                    delighted by the charm and spontaneity of its melodies, would suspect it to be
                    the work of a feeble old man. Such, however, Haydn had now become. He wrote
                    little after <hi rend="italic">The Seasons,</hi> and his public appearances were
                    few and far between. His old age was surrounded by the love of his friends and
                    the esteem of the musical world, but his failing health did not admit of much
                    active enjoyment. He was seen in public for the last time at a performance of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Creation</hi> in 1808. But his own music made so
                    overpowering an impression on him that he had to be carried out of the hall. He
                    died on May 31, 1809, during the occupation of Vienna by Napoleon’s army, and
                    many French officers followed his body to the grave.</p>
                <p>Haydn’s compositions comprize almost every form of vocal and instrumental music.
                    Of his dramatic works the operas are of infinitely less importance than <hi
                    rend="italic">The Creation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Seasons.</hi> In the
                    former there are points of grand and truly epical conception, surpassed by few
                    masters except Handel, and the idyllic charm of the latter is as fresh to-day as
                    it was eighty years ago. At the same time the great importance of Haydn in the
                    history of music lies elsewhere. It w as as an instrumental composer that he
                    opened a new epoch of musical development. That amongst his 125 orchestral
                    symphonies there are many extremely slight efforts is a matter of course. Even
                    his finest symphonies, such as the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Surprise,</hi>
                    or the one in E flat surnamed in Germany “mit dem Paukenwirbel,” on account of
                    the characteristic drum-roll occurring in it, are pigmies if compared with
                    Beethoven’s colossal efforts. At the same time it is true that without Haydn’s
                    modest substruction Beethoven’s mighty edifice would have been impossible. It
                    was Haydn who first fixed the form of the symphony and gave it consistency of
                    development. The lucid and harmonious treatment of his themes and the
                    symmetrical structure of his symphonic movements remain still unsurpassed. And
                    the same may be said in almost the same words of his string quartets, of which
                    he wrote no less than eighty-three. It is by such works as these that Haydn has
                    earned the name of father of instrumental music, generally and justly applied to
                    him. At the same time it cannot be denied that there is in his works a certain
                    want of intensity and depth. He avoids the high places of thought and passion;
                    his path lies mostly in the smiling plains of humour and agreeable sentiment. In
                    the former especially he excels, and it ought to be noted that his humour is of
                    that peculiarly Viennese type which is as harmless as it is charming, and to the
                    genial influence of which even such serious composers as Beethoven and Brahms
                    have had to submit. Some of Haydn’s minuets especially seem to spring
                    immediately from the consciousness of the people. How much he was at one with
                    his nation is further proved by such a song as his “Gott erhalte Franz den
                    Kaiser,” which has become the Austrian national hymn, and is one of the rare
                    instances in which a genuine volkslied can be traced to a celebrated
                    composer,—for generally the songs of the people are produced by the people. To
                    sum up, Haydn’s place in the history of his art will remain unassailed by all
                    the changes musical taste has undergone since his time, or may still undergo.
                    His melodies, though simple, are genuinely inspired, and will never lose their

                    invaluable model of clearness and symmetry. Haydn’s life has been written by
                    many pens and in many languages, Stendhal, the celebrated novelist, being
                    amongst his French biographers. But all these earlier attempts have been thrown
                    into the shade by the excellent works of Herr C. F. Pohl <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mozart and Haydn in London,</hi> 18G7; <hi rend="italic">Joseph Haydn,</hi>
                    vol. i., 1875; and the article “Haydn” in Grove’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary
                    of Music and Musicians'),</hi> which are full of accurate and comprehensive
                    research. To Herr Pohl all students of Haydn’s life must confess themselves
                    deeply indebted.</p>
                <p>Two of Haydn’s brothers acquired a certain amount of celebrity. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">John Michael Haydn,</hi> born at Rohrau, September 14, 1737,
                    and like his brother a choir-boy at St Stephen’s cathedral, bscame a prolific
                    and able composer of masses and all kinds of church music. He lived during the
                    greater part of his life at Salzburg, and his name is frequently mentioned in
                    the biography of Mozart. Of his numerous compositions few have been printed. A
                    mass in I) is perhaps his masterpiece. He died August 10, 1806. The youngest
                    brother, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Haydn</hi> (born December 23, 1743, died
                    May 20, 1805), had some reputation as a vocalist, and became, most probably by
                    his brother’s intercession, a singer in Prince Esterhazy’s chapel. <hi
