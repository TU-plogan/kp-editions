                    interview with Napoleon, was allowed to leave, when the invaders arrived, as the
                    bearer of a letter from the French to the Russian emperor. His family attended
                    him to the Russian lines. Then the mother of the infant Alexander (a young
                    German Protestant of J ewish extraction from Stuttgart, according to A. von
                    Wurzbach), only seventeen years old, and quite unable to speak Russian, was
                    forced to seek shelter for some time in a peasant’s hut. A year later the family
                    returned to Moscow, where Hertzen passed his youth,—remaining there, after
                    completing his studies at the university, till 1834, when he was arrested and
                    tried on a charge of having assisted, with some other youths, at a festival
                    during which verses by Sokolovsky, of a nature uncomplimentary to the emperor,
                    were sung. The special commission appointed to try the youthful culprits found
                    him guilty, and in 1835 he was banished to Viatka. There he remained till the
                    visit to that city of the hereditary grand-duke (afterwards Alexander II.),
                    accompanied by the poet Joukofsky, led to his being allowed to quit Viatka for
                    Vladimir, where he was appointed editor of the official gazette of that city. In
                    1840 he obtained a post in the ministry of the interior at St Petersburg; but in
                    consequence of having spoken too frankly about a death due to a police officer’s
                    violence, he was sent to Novgorod, where he led an official life, with the title
                    of “state councillor,” till 1842. In 1846 bis father died, leaving him by his
                    will a very large property. Early in 1847 he left Russia, never to return. From
                    Italy, on hearing of the revolution of 1848, he hastened to Paris, whence he
                    afterwards went to Switzerland. In 1852 he quitted Geneva for London, where he
                    settled for some years. In 1864 he returned to Geneva, and after some time went
                    to Paris, where he died, January 21, 1870.</p>
                <p>His literary career began in 1842 with the publication of an essay, in Russian,
                    on <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism in Science,</hi> under the pseudonym of
                    “Iskander,” the Turkish form of his Christian name,—convicts, even when
                    pardoned, not being allowed in those days to publish under their own names. His
                    second work, also in Russian, was his <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Study of
                    Nature</hi> (1845-6). In 1847 appeared his novel <hi rend="italic">Kto
                    Vinovat?</hi> (Whose Fault?), and about the same time were published in Russian
                    periodicals the stories which were afterwards collected and printed in London in
                    1854, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Prervannuie Razskazui</hi>
                    (Interrupted Tales). In 1850 two works appeared, translated from the Russian
                    manuscript, <hi rend="italic">Vom anderen Ufer</hi> (From another Shore) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de France</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    d'Italie.</hi> In French appeared also his essay <hi rend="italic">Du
                    Développement des idées révolutionnaires en Russie,</hi> and his memoirs, which,
                    after being printed in Russian, were translated under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Monde russe et la Révolution</hi> (3 vols. 1860-62), and were
                    in part translated into English as <hi rend="italic">My Exile to Siberia</hi> (2
                    vols., 1855). From a literary point of view his most important work is <hi
                    rend="italic">Kto Vinovat?</hi> a story describing how the domestic happiness of
                    a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of a Russian sensualist
                    of the old type, dull, ignorant, and genial, is troubled by a Russian sensualist
                    of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, without there being
                    any possibility of saying who is most to be blamed for the tragic termination.
                    But it was as a political writer that Hertzen gained the vast reputation which
                    he at one time enjoyed. Having founded in London his “Free Russian Press,” of
                    the fortunes of which, during ten years, he gave an interesting account in a
                    book published (in Russian<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n811/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0811-0774"/>) in 1863, he issued from it a great number of
                    Russian works, all levelled against the system of government prevailing in
                    Russia. Some of these were essays, such as his <hi rend="italic">Baptized
                    Property,</hi> an attack on serfdom; others were periodical publications, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Polyarnaya Zvyezda</hi> (or Polar Star), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kolokol</hi> (or Bell), and the <hi rend="italic">Golosa iz Rοssii</hi> (or
                    Voices from Russia). The <hi rend="italic">Kolokol</hi> soon obtained an immense
                    circulation, and exercised an extraordinary influence. For three years, it is
                    true, the founders of the “Free Press” ⅛ent on printing, “not only without
                    selling a single copy, but scarcely being able to get a single copy introduced
                    into Russia;” so that when at last a bookseller bought ten shillings’ worth of
                    <hi rend="italic">Baptized Property,</hi> the half sovereign was set aside by
                    the surprised editors in a special place of honour. But the death of the emperor
                    Nicholas in 1855 produced an entire change. Hertzen’s writings, and the journals
                    he edited, were smuggled wholesale into Russia, and their words resounded
                    throughout that country, as well as all over Europe. Their influence became
                    overwhelming. Evil deeds long hidden, evil-doers who had long prospered, were
                    suddenly dragged into light and disgrace. His bold and vigorous language aptly
                    expressed the thoughts which had long been secretly stirring Russian minds, and
                    were now beginning to find a timid utterance at home. For some years his
                    influence in Russia was a living force, the circulation of his writings was a
                    vocation zealously pursued. Stories tell how on one occasion a merchant, who had
                    bought several cases of sardines at Nijni-Novgorod, found that they contained
                    forbidden print instead of fish, and at another time a supposititious copy of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Kolokol</hi> was printed for the emperor’s special use, in
                    which a telling attack upon a leading statesman, which had appeared in the
                    genuine number, was omitted. At length the sweeping changes introduced by
                    Alexander II. greatly diminished the need for and appreciation of Hertzen’s
                    assistance'in the work of reform. The freedom he had demanded for the serfs was
                    granted, the law-courts he had so long denounced were remodelled, trial by jury
                    was established, liberty was to a great extent conceded to the press. It became
                    clear that Hertzen’s occupation was gone. When the Polish insurrection of 1863
                    broke out, and he pleaded the insurgents’ cause, his reputation in Russia
                    received its death-blow. From that time it was only with the revolutionary party
                    that he was in full accord, and it is by that section of Russian Liberals alone
                    that his opinions are now considered of authority. For the great reforms,
                    however, which followed the Crimean War, Russia is much indebted to the
                    outspok-enrutterances of Alexander Hertzen, and will be so in all probability
                    for the constitutional changes which are likely to follow the repressive
                    measures of 1879.</p>
                <p>In 1873 a collection of his works in French was commenced in Paris. A volume of
                    posthumous works, in Russian, was published at Geneva in 1870. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> supply the principal information about his life, a
