                <p><label type="entry">HEATING</label>. In temperate latitudes the climate is
                    generally such as to necessitate in dwellings, during a great portion of the
                    year, a temperature warmer than that out of doors, and, similarly, tropical
                    plants growing in temperate climates require artificial heat in the house in
                    which they are preserved. Thus heating is required foι∙ health and comfort: the
                    object of the application of science is to obtain these with the greatest degree
                    of economy. In its aspect as to health it may be assumed that no system of
                    heating is advisable which does not provide for a constant renewal of the air in
                    the locality warmed. In climates such as that of the United Kingdom, the
                    temperature of living rooms should be maintained at from 54° to 68° Fahr, in the
                    daytime; the night temperature may be lower, but should not fall below 40°; and
                    the humidity of the air as measured by the wet and dry bulb thermometers should
                    show a difference of not less than 4° nor much exceeding 8’ between the two
                    thermometers, although with an ample supply of air a greater degree of dryness
                    would probably not be found objectionable.</p>
                <p>All heating apparatus depends upon the transference of heat from the fire to the
                    various parts of the building which <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0624-0591"/> it is intended to warm, and this transfer may be
                    effected by radiation, by conduction, or by convection. Radiant heat is emitted
                    and absorbed in an accelerating ratio in proportion as the difference of
                    temperature between the radiant and the recipient increases, and, with the same
                    difference of temperature between the recipient and the radiant, the effect of
                    the radiant will be greater according to the increased temperature of the
                    recipient. In other words, the ratio of the emission of heat increases with the
                    temperature. It is thus easier to effect the warming of a given space by means
                    of a highly-heated surface than by a surface emitting a lower temperature.</p>
                <p>An open fire acts by radiation; it warms the air in a room by first warming the
                    walls, floor, ceiling, and articles in the room, and these in their turn warm
                    the air. Therefore in a room with an open fire the air of the room is, as a
                    rule, less heated than the walls. In this case the warming of the air depends on
                    the capacity of the surfaces to absorb or emit heat; except that the heat
                    received by the walls may be divided into two parts, one part heating the air in
                    contact with the wall, and the other passing through the wall to the outer
                    surface, where it is finally dissipated and wasted. Fireplaces are sometimes
                    constructed to assist the warming of the air of a room. For instance, in
                    Sylvester’s grate iron bars of which one end terminates under the fire are laid
                    so as to form a projecting radiating hearth. The ventilating fireplace warms the
                    fresh air before its admission into the room by means of gills cast on the back
                    of the grate. *</p>
                <p>In a close stove, heated to a moderate temperature, the heat, as it passes from
                    the fire, warms the surface of the materials which enclose and are in contact
                    with the fire and with the heated gases. The materials next transfer the heat to
                    the outer surface in contact with the air; and the air is warmed by the agency
                    of this outer surface. If heated to high temperatures a stove gives out radiant
                    heat, which passes through the air to warm the objects on which the rays
                    impinge.</p>
                <p>With hot-w ater pipes, the heat from the water heats the inner surface of the
                    pipe, and this surface transfers its heat to the outer surface through the
                    material of the pipes. The rate at which the heat can pass from the inner to the
                    outer surface, and be thus utilized instead of passing away straight into the
                    chimney, depends on the heat evolved by the fire, on the extent of surfaces
                    exposed to the heat and their capacity to absorb and emit heat, and on the
                    quality of the material between the inner and the outer surface as a good or bad
                    conductor of heat. This passage of heat through a body by conduction varies
                    directly with the quality of material, and with the difference between the
                    temperature of the inner surface exposed to the heat and the outer surface
                    exposed to a cooling influence, and inversely as the thickness between the
                    surfaces. Other things being equal, copper is a better material than iron for
                    conveying the heat from the fire to water or air; and coverings of brickwork,
                    wood, or woollen fabrics are better adapted than iron for retaining the heat.
                    The property which appears more than any other to make materials good
                    non-conductors of heat is their porosity to air, and the retention of the air in
                    their pores.</p>
                <p>The direct warming of the air may he effected by stoves with brick or iron flues,
                    or by hot-water or steam pipes. The sizes of the heating surfaces for this
                    object must be proportioned to the volume of air required to be warmed for
                    ventilation, and the degree of heat to be maintained, the thickness of the
                    material, and its capacity for absorbing and radiating heat and for transferring
                    heat from one surface to the other. . When a large volume of air is supplied and
                    removed for ventilation, rapidity in transferring the heat from the fuel to the
                    air is an important consideration. Brick stoves and flues are worse conductors
                    of heat than iron stoves or flues, but the surface of a brick stove parts with
                    the heat which reaches it somewhat more rapidly than do the surfaces of an iron
                    flue. The slow conducting power of the material and the greater thickness of a
                    brick stove prevent alternations which may take place in the fire from being
                    felt so much as with iron stoves or flues; arid therefore the brick stove warms
                    the air more equably, without sudden variations; the air so warmed is free from
                    objectionable elements; and where they can be conveniently applied, it is
                    advisable to use brick stoves for warming air for ventilating purposes.</p>
                <p>With an iron flue pipe from a stove, almost the whole heat which any fuel is
                    capable of developing may be utilized by using a sufficiently long pipe,
                    horizontal for the greater part of its length, to convey the products of
                    combustion to the outer air. The heat given out by a stove pipe varies with the
                    temperature from end to end, being of course greatest at the end next the stove,
                    where the emission of heat is very rapid; and the amount of heat given out per
                    square foot will vary at each point as the distance from the stove increases.
                    The proportions also into which the heat divides itself between radiation and
                    convection vary greatly with the temperature. Thus, with a stove pipe heated at
                    the end nearest the stove to a dull red heat of 1230° Fahr., and of sufficient
                    length to allow the heat to be diminished to 150° at the further end, it would
                    be found that at the stove end of the flue pipe 92 per cent, of the total heat
                    emitted by the pipe is given out by radiation to the walls and only 8 per cent,
                    to the air; but at the exit end the heat is nearly equally divided, the walls
                    receiving 55 and the air 45 per cent. Taking the whole length of such a pipe,
                    the walls would receive 74 per cent, and the air 26 per cent, of the heat
                    emitted. But with a flue pipe heated to lower temperatures, the air might
                    receive half the heat or even more. When therefore the object is to heat the
                    walls rather than the air, the temperature of the pipes should be high; and for
                    this purpose stove pipes are more effective than hot-water or low-pressure steam
                    pipes. At high temperatures there will be practically little difference of
                    effect between horizontal and vertical flue pipes, because the heat given out is
                    principally that due to radiation, which is independent of the form and position
                    of the radiant. An adequate proportion of flue pipes to the form and size of the
                    stove involves a large surface for the flue pipe; with a careful observance of
                    proportion, as much as 94⅜ per cent, of the heat in the fuel has been
                    utilized.</p>
                <p>There are, however, several serious objections to iron stoves, especially for
                    small rooms: a long flue pipe is unsightly, and on that account often
                    inadmissible; iron stoves heat rapidly, and easily become red-hot, and the
                    effect produced therefore is unequal. Carbonic oxide, too, has been found in air
                    warmed by iron stoves very highly heated. It is alleged that highly-heated iron
                    may take oxygen from the carbonic acid in the air in contact with its surface,
                    and thus reduce the acid to carbonic oxide.</p>
                <p>Whenever iron stoves or cockles are used for heating air, care should be taken to
                    prevent the iron from attaining a high temperature, and with this object all
                    iron stoves should have a lining of fire-brick, so as to prevent the fire from
                    coming in direct contact with the iron; such an arrangement preserves greater
                    regularity in the heating of the air. This object may be also attained by giving
                    the stove a large surface in proportion to the fire by means of flanges or gills
                    to carry off the heat as fast as it is generated. Iron coated with a surface of
                    glazed enamel would enable the heat to pass rapidly from the fire to the
                    surface, while the enamel surface would emit the heat more rapidly than the iron
                    surface.</p>
                <p>Hot-water pipes for warming air are free from many of the objections arising from
                    the direct application of heat to iron, because the heat can be regulated with
                    exactness.</p>
                <p>A high temperature may be obtained from water without generating steam by heating
                    it under pressure. In Perkins’s high-pressure system, a continuous iron tube,
                    about 1 inch diameter, is filled with water; about one-sixth of the length of
                    the tube is coiled and placed in a furnace, and the remainder, forming the
                    heating surface, is heated by the circulation of the water. At the highest level
                    to which the tube is carried it is enlarged so as to allow of a space for
                    expansion of the heated water equal to 5 per cent, of the contents of the small
                    tube.</p>
                <p>Pipes may be heated by either hot water or by steam. The higher the temperature,
                    the greater is the comparative effect in warming air; therefore, with a small
                    heating surface, steam pipes are more efficient than hot-water pipes, and steam
                    at a high pressure more efficient than low-pressure steam. The efficient action
                    of hot-water pipes depends upon the upward flow of the heated and expanded water
                    as it passes from the boiler, the passage being made as direct as possible, and
                    so protected as to lose little heat between the boiler and the place where the
                    heat is to be utilized. The return pipe, which brings back the water after it
                    has been cooled down by the abstraction of heat in warming the air, should be
                    passed into the bottom of the boiler as directly and in as uniform a line from
                    the place where the heat has been used as possible. The velocity of flow in the
                    pipes will depend upon the temperature at which the water leaves the boiler, the
                    height to which the heated water has to rise, and the temperature at which it
                    passes down the return pipe back into the boiler. The efficiency of a hot-water
                    apparatus will be regulated by these conditions, by the size of the pipe, and by
                    such other conditions as affect the flow <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0625-0592"/> of water in pipes. When the boiler or source of
                    heat is very near the level of the pipes for heating the air, the average
                    temperature which can be obtained in the pipes will be lower than when the
                    vertical column is long. The heating surface must be regulated with reference to
                    this difference of level. It may further be assumed that with small pipes, the
                    temperature being constant, the velocity of flow in the pipe necessary to
                    furnish a given amount of heat will vary in the ratio of the length of the pipe.
                    When the water circulates through the pipes by virtue of the difference of
                    temperature of the flow and return currents only, it is impossible to count upon
                    a greater mean temperature of the pipes than from 160° to 180°, because above
                    that temperature the water in the boiler begins to boil. To obtain a sufficient
                    velocity of circulation for long distances, or with small differences of level,
                    a forced circulation may be resorted to. This has been done by Messrs Easton and
                    Anderson at the county lunatic asylum at Banstead, in the following mauner. The
                    whole hot-water service is supplied from boilers placed at one end of the asylum
                    buildings, which extend to a distance of several hundred yards. There are two
                    pipes: one of them, which may be called the flow pipe, is connected directly
                    with the boiler, terminating at the point furthest from the boiler in a dead
                    end; the other, which may be termed the return pipe, is parallel to the first,
                    and terminates at one end in a cistern which is placed about 6 feet above, and
                    supplies the boiler. At the other end furthest from the cistern the second pipe
                    also terminates in a dead en&lt;l. At each pavilion or place to which hot water
                    is required to be conveyed, there is a connexion between the two pipes, which
                    can be closed or opened at will; when it is opened, the water can pass from the
                    flow to the return pipe. In the second, or return pipe, near the point where it
                    ascends to the cistern, is placed a rotatory pump, or fan wheel, which is always
                    kept revolving. When the openings are all closed between the two pipes, this
                    pump or fan simply slips through the water; but as soon as the return pipe
                    obtains a supply of water from any of the openings between it and the flow pipe,
                    a circulation is established.</p>
                <p>The following diagram, resulting from Mr Anderson’s experiments, published in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Institution of Civil Engineers</hi> for 1877,
                    shows the total units of heat given out by cast-iron and wrought-iron pipes per
                    square foot of surface per hour for various differences of temperature
                    applicable either to hot-water or steam pipes. Suppose, for example, it is
                    required to know how much heat will be given out by 4-inch cast-iron or 2-inch
                    wrought-iron pipes at 190° in a room, the temperature of which is 60°; the
                    difference of temperature is 130°, and corresponding to this will be found 232

                    wrought-tron pipes at various differences of temperature. The dotted line shows
                    the 4-inch, and the solid line the 2-inch pipes.</p>
                <p>The amount of heating surface to be afforded with hot-water pipes depends mainly
                    upon the volume of air to be admitted and removed, and the temperature desired
                    to be maintained, but in any given building there are other circumstances to be
                    taken into account, viz., the position, aspect, subsoil, temperature of
                    locality, thickness of walls, size and'form of windows, and other influences
                    affecting the temperature of the incoming air, or causing loss of heat. An
                    empirical rule has been laid down that in a dwellinghouse 1 square foot of
                    heating surface is required for every 65 cubic feet of space to be warmed, and
                    in a greenhouse 1 square foot to every 24 cubic feet. This empirical rule does
                    not take into account the sanitary considerations as to the renewal of air.</p>
                <p>Steam-heated pipes present important advantages in some cases over hot-water
                    pipes for heating purposes, because of the higher temperature to which the pipes
                    can be raised, their consequent smaller size, and the facility of conveying the
                    heat to a distance. Steam heating may be applied directly; and the waste steam
                    from an engine is also applicable for heating.</p>
                <p>The direct application of steam heating on a large scale has been made at
                    Lockport, New York. About 200 houses in the city are heated from a central
                    supply through about 3 miles of piping, radiating from a boiler-house, which
                    contains two boilers 16 feet by 5 feet, and one boiler 8 feet by 8 feet. These
                    boilers are fired during the winter to a pressure of 35 lb to the inch, with a
                    consumption of 4 tons of anthracite coal in twenty-four hours. The boiler
                    pressure of 35 lb in winter and 25 lb in summer is maintained through a total
                    length of 3 miles of piping up to the several points of consumption, where there
                    is a cut-off under the control of the consumers. The first 600 feet of mains
                    from the boilers are 4 inches in diameter. There are 1400 feet of 3-inch pipes,
                    1500 feet of 2∣- inch pipes, and 2000 feet of 2-inch pipes. The supply pipes
                    from these mains to the houses are 1⅛ inches in diameter, and within each house
                    f-iuch pipes are used. In addition to the cut-off tap from the main under the
                    control of the consumer, there is a pressure valve regulated to a 5-Ib pressure
                    under the control of the company; and beyond this is an ingeniously constructed
                    meter, which indicates, not only the total consumption in cubic feet of steam,
                    but also the quantity of steam in each apartment. At each 100 feet of main an
                    expansion valve, like an ordinary piston and socket, is inserted, allowing an
                    expansion in each section of 100 feet of If inches for the heat at 35-lb
                    pressure. No condensation occurs in the mains. They are covered with a thin
                    layer of asbestos paper next the iron, then a wrapping of Russian felt, and
                    finally manilia paper, and the whole is encased in timber bored out
                    three-quarters of an inch larger than the felt-covered pipes, and laid along the
                    street like gas-pipes. The distribution of heat in the apartments is by means of
                    radiators consisting of inch pipes, 30 inches long, placed vertically either in
                    a circle or as a double row, and connected together at top and bottom, with an
                    outlet pipe for the condensed water, which escapes at a temperature a little
                    below boiling, and is sufficient for all the domestic purposes of the house, or
                    it may be used as accessory heating power for horticultural and other purposes.
                    The steam has also been applied at a distance of over half a mile from the
                    boilers for motive power, and two steam engines of 10-horse and 14-horse power
                    are worked from the boilers at a distance of half a mile with but a slightly
                    increased consumption of fuel. The laid-on steam is also used for cooking
                    purposes, for boiling, and even for baking. As in the case of gas supply, the
                    steam supply company lay their pipes up to the houses, the consumer paying for
                    all internal pipes, fittings, and radiators. In a moderately-sized eight-roomed
                    house the expense of these amounted to 8150, and in larger houses with costlier
                    fittings to $500.</p>
                <p>Boulton’s system of heating with exhaust or waste steam is devised to cause the
                    steam from a steam engine to travel long distances without any back pressure on
                    the engine. It is especially applicable to drying rooms in which 150° Fahr, has
                    been obtained by a large heating surface; for a lower temperature less heating
                    surface is required. The capacity of heating by exhaust steam is nearly in a
                    ratio with the fuel expended in the boiler. There is some cooling in passing
                    through the engine, and in the conveyance along the pipes to the rooms to be
                    heated, but this loss is comparatively small if the pipes and the cylinder are
                    covered with a good non-conductor, and the condensed water is taken back hot
                    into the boiler. Thus, if the steam be taken from the boiler direct to the pipes
                    at five atmospheres, the temperature would be 307°, and if a comparative
                    capacity of steam were allowed to pass through the engine to create power, and
                    discharged into the pipes at one atmosphere, it would decrease in temperature to
                    213°; but it would increase in bulk according to the expansion; and thus to
                    obtain nearly the same temperature in the room the heating surface should be
                    increased.</p>
                <p>With an engine of 17-inch cylinder and 25-horse power nominal, the exhaust steam
                    has been made to travel 200 yards in a direct line, as well as to pass into
                    various branches, amounting in the aggregate to about 2386 yards (or 1⅜ miles)
                    of l⅛-inch pipes. After this it warms the water for the boiler, and the steam is
                    not all used up. The whole efficiency of the system depends upon so arranging
                    the pipes as to prevent back pressure. Mr Boulton assumed that one-horse power
                    if properly applied should warm about 30,000 cubic feet of space, subject to
                    reductions for window space, wall space, the number of cubic feet of air allowed
                    to escape for ventilation, and other considerations, and lays down the follow -
                    ing empirical rule, viz. :—1 square foot of steam pipe is allowed for each 6

                <p>Wrought-iron pipes l⅛-inch bore are the most economical for steam, as they afford
                    a large heating surface with small area. . In heating living rooms by steam, the
                    high temperature of the pipes affords one of the advantages of an open fire,
                    viz., warmth by radiation, and combines with this the advantage which hot-water
                    pipes possess of directly warming the air. (D. G.)</p>
