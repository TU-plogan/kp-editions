                    that of Lemoine, where he finished his course amid incredible privations and
                    difficulties. He escaped from these when, in 1764, he was himself appointed one
                    of the teachers in the first of the above-named colleges. He began to devote his
                    leisure hours to the study of botany; but an accident directed his attention to
                    another field in natural history. Happening to let fall a beautiful specimen of
                    calcareous spar belonging to a friend, he discovered, by examining the
                    fragments, the geometrical law of crystallization. By experimenting on a
                    hexahedral crystal of this substance, he found that it could be so dissected, by
                    dividing it by planes parallel to certain edges, as to exhibit a rhombohedral
                    nucleus, and, by extending his experiments, lie farther showed that the same
                    result could be obtained from mechanical division of every crystal of the same
                    species. This led him to the theory that crystals are composed of what he called
                    “integrant molecules,” which he held had each the same shape as the respective
                    nuclei got at by mechanical division. To obtain the different crystalline forms
                    these molecules were supposed to be built up in layers round the nucleus, each
                    layer diminishing regularly in the number of rows of molecules, and the rows at
                    the same time diminishing in the number of molecules according to the nature of
                    the crystal. A full account of his mathematical theory of this subject is given
                    by Haüy in his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mineralogie</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Crystallography).</hi>
                    Daubenton and Laplace immediately recognized the scientific value of the
                    discovery, which, when communicated to the Academy, secured for its author a
                    place in that society. Besides the important service which he rendered to
                    crystallography, Haüy also greatly increased our knowledge of pyro-electricity.
                    He demonstrated by experiment in the case of tourmaline that the positive and
                    negative charges of electricity at the respective ends of the crystal diminish
                    rapidly as we approach the middle point, where they disappear. He showed also
                    that each particle of a broken pyro-electric crystal itself exhibits polarity;
                    and he was likewise the first to observe that, in all minerals, the
                    pyro-electric state has an important connexion with the want of symmetry of the
                    crystals. In tourmaline, for instance, he found the vitreous charge always at
                    the summit with six, and the resinous at the summit with three faces (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Electricity).</hi> When the Revolution broke out, Haüy was
                    thrown into prison, and his life was even in danger, when he was saved by the
                    intercession of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Under Napoleon he became professor of
                    mineralogy at the museum of natural history. He also obtained other scientific
                    preferment, of which he was deprived by the feeble Government of the
                    Restoration, though his royalism had been a serious bar to his promotion under
                    the empire. His latter days were consequently clouded by the poverty wdιich had
                    threatened to blight his early career. But the courage and high moral qualities
                    which had helped him forward in his youth did <pb break="no"
