                    family which had been settled for many generations in the adjoining village of
                    Daylesford; but his great-grandfather had sold the ancestral manor-house, and
                    his grandfather had been unable to maintain himself in possession of the family
                    living. His mother died a few days after giving him birth; his father, Pynaston
                    Hastings, drifted away to perish obscurely in the West Indies. Thus unfortunate
                    in his birth, young Hastings received the elements of education at a charity
                    school in his native village. At the age of eight he was taken in charge by an
                    elder brother of his father, Howard Hastings, who held a post in the customs.
                    After spending two years at a private school at Newington Butts, he was moved to
                    Westminster, where among his contemporaries occur the names of Lord Thurlow and
                    Lord Shelburne, Sir Elijah Impey, and the poets Cowper and Churchill. In 1749,
                    when his headmaster Dr Nichols was already anticipating for him a successful
                    career at the university, his uncle died, leaving him to the care of Mr
                    Chiswick, who was in the direction of the East India Company; and he determined
                    to send his ward to seek his fortune as a “writer” in Bengal.</p>
                <p>When Hastings landed at Calcutta in October 1750, the affairs of the East India
                    Company were at a low ebb. Throughout the entire south of the peninsula French
                    influence was predominant. The settlement of Fort St George or Madras, captured
                    by force of arms, had only recently been restored in accordance with a clause of
                    the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. The lurid genius of Dupleix everywhere
                    overshadowed the native imagination, and the star of Clive had scarcely yet
                    risen above the horizon. The rivalry between the English and the French, which
                    had already convulsed the south, did not penetrate to Bengal. That province was
                    under the able government of Ali Vardi Khan, who peremptorily forbade the
                    foreign settlers at Calcutta and Chandarnagar to introduce feuds from Europe.
                    The duties of a young “writer” were then such as are implied in the name. At an
                    early date Hastings was placed in charge of an <hi rend="italic">aurang</hi> or
                    factory in the interior, where his duties would be to superintend the weaving of
                    silk and cotton goodβ under a system of money advances. In 1755 he was
                    transferred to Kâsimbâzâr, the river-port of the native capital of Mûrshidâbâd.
                    In 1756 the old nawâb died, and was succeeded by his grandson Sirfij-ud-Daulah,
                    a spoilt boy of 19, whose name is indelibly associated with the tragedy of the
                    Black Hole. When that passionate young prince, in revenge for a fancied wrong,
                    resolved to drive the English out of Bengal, his first step was to occupy the
                    fortified factory at Kâsimbâzâr, and make prisoners of Hastings and his
                    companions. Hastings was soon released at the intercession of the Dutch
                    resident, and made use of his position at Mûrshidâbâd to open negotiations with
                    the English fugitives at Falta, the site of a Dutch factory near the mouth of
                    the Hooghly. In later days be used to refer with pride to his services on this
                    occasion, when he was first initiated into the wiles of Oriental diplomacy.
                    After a while, he found it necessary to fly from the Mahometan court, and join
                    the main body of the English at Falta. When the relieving force arrived from
                    Madras under Colonel Clive and Admiral Watson, Hastings enrolled himself as a
                    volunteer, and took part in the action which led to the recovery of Calcutta.
                    Clive showed his appreciation of Hastings’s merits, by appointing him in 1758 to
                    the important post of resident at the court of Mιirshi-dàbâd<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0544-0513"/>. It was there that he first came into collision
                    with t'ιe Bengali Brâhman, Nandkumar, whose subsequent fate throws so deep a
                    shadow upon his own fair fame. During his three years of office as resident he
                    was able to render n )t a few valuable services to the Company; but it is more i
                    nportant to observe that his name nowhere occurs in <hi rend="superscript">
                    +</hi> he official lists of those who derived pecuniary profit from the
                    necessities and weakness of the native chiefs. In 1761 he was promoted to be
                    member of council, under the presidency of Mr Vansittart, who had been
                    introduced by Clive from Madras. The period of Vansittart’s government has been
                    truly described as “the most revolting page of our Indian history.” The entire
                    duties of administration were suffered to remain in the hands of the nawàb,
                    while a few irresponsible English traders had drawn to themselves all re ιl
                    power. The members of council, the commanders of the troops, and the commercial
                    residents plundered on a grand scale. The youngest servant of the Company
                    claimed the right of trading on his own account, free from taxation and from
                    local jurisdiction, not only for himself but also for every native subordinate
                    whom he might permit to use hiβ name. It was this exemption, threatening the
                    very foundations of the Mussulman government, that finally led to a rupture with
                    the nawàb. Macaulay, in his celebrated essay, has said that “of the conduct of
                    Hastings at this time little is known.” As a matter of fact, the book which
                    Macaulay was professing to review describes at length the honourable part
                    consistently taken by Hastings in opposition to the great majority of the
                    council. Sometimes in conjunction only with Vansittart, sometimes absolutely
                    alone, he protested unceasingly against the policy and practices of his
                    colleagues. On one occasion he was stigmatized in a minute by Mr Batson with
                    “having espoused the nawâb’s cause, and as a hired solicitor defended all his
                    actions, however dishonourable and detrimental to the Company.” An altercation
                    ensued. Batson gave him the lie, and struck him in the council chamber. When war
                    was actually begun, Hastings officially recorded his previous resolution to have
                    resigned, in order to repudiate responsibility for measures which he had always
                    opposed. Waiting only for the decisive victory of Buxar over the allied forces
                    of Bengal and Oudh, he resigned his seat and sailed for England in November
                    1764.</p>
                <p>After fourteen years’ residence in Bengal Hastings did not return home a rich
                    man, estimated by the opportunities of his position. According to the custom of
                    the time he had augmented his slender salary by private trade. At a later date,
                    he was charged by Burke with having taken up profitable contracts for supplying
                    bullocks for the use of the Company’s troops. It is admitted that he conducted
                    by means of agents a large business in timber in the Gangetic sandarbans. When
                    at Falta he had married Mrs Campbell, the widow of an officer. She bore him two
                    children, of whom one died in infancy at Mûrshidâbâd, and was shortly followed
                    to the grave by her mother. Their common gravestone is in existence at the
                    present day, bearing d ate July 11, 1759. The other child, a son, was sent to
                    England, and also died shortly before his father’s return. While at home
                    Hastings is said to have attached himself to literary society; and it maybe
                    inferred from his own letters that he now made the personal acquaintance of
                    Samuel Johnson and Lord Mansfield. In 1766 he was called upon to give evidence
                    before a committee of the House of Commons upon the affairs of Bengal. The good
                    sense and clearness of the views which he expressed caused attention to be paid
                    to his desire to be again employed in India. His pecuniary affairs were
                    embarrassed, partly from the liberality with which he had endowed his few
                    surviving relatives. The great influence of Lord Clive was also exercised on his
                    behalf. At last, in the winter of 1768, he received the appointment of second in
                    council at Madras. Among his companions on his voyage round the Cape were the
                    Baron Imhoff, a speculative portrait painter, and his wife, a lady of some
                    personal attractions and great social charm, who was destined henceforth to be
                    Hastings’s life-long companion. Of his two years’ work at Madras it is needless
                    to speak in detail. He won the good-will of his employers by devoting himself to
                    the improvement of their manufacturing business, and he kept his hands clean
                    from the prevalent taint of pecuniary transactions with the nawâb of the
                    Carnatic. One fact of some interest is not generally known. He drew up a scheme
                    for the construction of a pier at Madras, to avoid the dangers of landing
                    through the surf, and instructed his brother-in-law in England to obtain
                    estimates from the engineers Brindley and Smeaton.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1772 his ambition was stimulated by the nomination to the
                    second place in council at Bengal with a promise of the reversion of the
                    governorship when Mr Cartier should retire. Since his departure from Bengal in
                    1764 the situation of affairs in that settlement had scarcely improved. The
                    second governorship of Clive was marked by the transfer of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diwdni</hi> or financial administration from the Mogul emperor to the Company,
                    and by the enforcement of stringent regulations against the besetting sin of
                    peculation. But Clive was followed by two inefficient successors; and in 1770
                    occurred the most terrible Indian famine on record, which is credibly estimated
                    to have swept away one-third of the population. In April 1772 Warren Hastings
                    took his seat as president of the council at Fort William. His first care was to
                    carry out the instructions received from home, and effect a radical reform in
                    the system of government. Clive’s plan of governing through the agency of the
                    native court had proved a failure. The directors were determined “to stand forth
                    as <hi rend="italic">dîwàn,</hi> and take upon themselves by thcir own servants
                    the entire management of the revenues.” All the officers of administration were
                    transferred from Mûrshidâbâd to Calcutta, which Hastings boasted at this early
                    date that he would make the first city in Asia. This reform involved the ruin of
                    many native reputations, and for a second time brought Hastings into collision
                    with the wily Brâhman, Nandkumar. At the same time a new settlement of the land
                    revenue on leases for five years was begun, and the police and military systems
                    of the country were placed upon a new footing. Hastings was a man of immense
                    industry, with an insatiable appetite for details. The whole of this large
                    series of reforms was conducted under his own personal supervision, and upon no
                    part of his multifarious labours did he dwell in his letters home with greater
                    pride. As an independent measure of economy, the stipend paid to the titular
                    nawâb of Eengal, who was then a minor, was reduced by one-half—to sixteen <hi
                    rend="italic">lakhs</hi> a year (say £160,000). Macaulay imputes this reduction
                    to Hastings as a characteristic act of financial immorality; but in truth it had
                    been expressly enjoined by the court of directors, in a despatch dated six
                    months before he took up office. His pecuniary bargains with Sùjah Daula, the
                    nawâb wazir of Oudh, stand on a different basis. Hastings himself always
                    regarded them as incidents in the general scheme of his foreign policy. The
                    Mahrattas at this time had got possession of the person of the Mogul emperor,
                    Shâh Alam, from whom Clive obtained the grant of Bengal in 1765, and to whom he
                    assigned in return the districts of Allahâbâd and Kora and a tribute of
                    £300,000. With the emperor in their camp, the Mahrattas were threatening the
                    province of Oudh, and causing a large British force to be cantoned along the
                    frontier for its defence. Warren Hastings, as a deliberate measure of policy,
                    withheld the tribute due to the emperor, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n545/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0545-0514"/> and resold Allahâbâd and Kora to the wazir of
                    Oudh. The Mahrattas retreated, and all danger for the time was dissipated by the
                    death of their principal leader. The wazir now bethought him that he had a good
                    opportunity for satisfying an old quarrel against the adjoining tribe of
                    Rohillas, who had played fast and loose with him while the Mahratta army was at
                    hand. The Rohillas were a race of Afghan origin, who had established themselves
                    for some generations in a fertile tract west of Oudh, between the Himalayas and
                    the Ganges, which still bears the name of Rohilkhand. They were not so much the
                    occupiers of the soil, as a dominant caste of warriors and freebooters. But in
                    those troubled days their title was as good as any to be found in India. After
                    not a little hesitation, Hastings consented to allow the Company’s troops to be
                    used to further the ambitious designs of his Oudh ally, in consideration of a
                    sum of money which relieved the ever-pressing wants of the Bengal treasury. The
                    Rohillas were defeated in fair fight. Some of them fled the country; and so far
                    as possible Hastings obtained terms for those who remained. The fighting, no
                    doubt, on the part of the wazir was conducted with all the savagery of Oriental
                    warfare; but there is no evidence that it was a war of extermination.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the affairs of the East India Company had again come under the
                    consideration of Parliament. The Regulating Act, passed by Lord North’s ministry
                    in 1773, effected considerable changes in the constitution of the Bengal
                    Government. The council was reduced to four members with a governor-general, who
                    were to exercise certain indefinite powers of control over the presidencies of
                    Madras and Bombay. Hastings was named in the Act as governor-general for a term
                    of five years. The council consisted of General Clavering and the Hon. Colonel
                    Monson, two third-rate politicians of considerable parliamentary influence;
                    Philip Francis, then only known as an able permanent official; and Barwell, of
                    the Bengal Civil Service. At the same time a supreme court of judicature was
                    appointed, composed of a chief and three puisne judges, to exercise an
                    indeterminate jurisdiction at Calcutta. The chiefjustice was Sir Elijah Impey,
                    already mentioned as a schoolfellow of Hastings at Westminster. The whole
                    tendency of the Regulating Act was to establish for the first time the influence
                    of the crown, or rather of parliament, in Indian affairs. The new members of
                    council disembarked at Calcutta on the 19th of October 1774; and on the
                    following day commenced the long feud which scarcely terminated twenty-one years
                    later with the acquittal of Warren Hastings by the House of Lords.' Macaulay
                    states that the members of council were put in ill-humour because their salute
                    of guns was not proportionate to their dignity. In a contemporary letter Francis
                    thus expresses the same petty feeling: “Surely Mr H. might have put on a ruffled
                    shirt.” Taking advantage of an ambiguous clause in their commission, the
                    majority of the council (for Barwell uniformly sided with Hastings) forthwith
                    proceeded to pass in review the recent measures of the governor-general. All
                    that he had done they condemned; all that they could they reversed. Hastings was
                    reduced to the position of a cipher at their meetings. After a time they lent a
                    ready ear to detailed allegations of corruption brought against him by his old
                    enemy Nandkumar. To charges from such a source, and brought in such a manner,
                    Hastings disdained to reply, and referred his accuser to the supreme court. The
                    majority of the council, in their executive capacity, resolved that the
                    governor-general had been guilty of peculation, and ordered him to refund. A few
                    days later Nandkumar was thrown into prison on a stale charge of forgery, tried
                    before the supreme court sitting in bar, found guilty by a jury of Englishmen,
                    and sentenced to be hanged. That Hastings set this prosecution in motion, no
                    reasonable person can doubt; and it is equally clear that Chief-Justice Impey is
                    free from all personal blame. The majority of the council abandoned their
                    supporter, who was executed in due course. He had forwarded a petition for
                    reprieve to the council, which Clavering took care should not be presented in
                    time, and which was subsequently burnt by the common hangman on the motion of
                    Francis. At the time no one dared to impute to Hastings the crime of a judicial
                    murder. But though he had thus silenced the charges brought·against him, a
                    combination of circumstances placed him in a position of fresh difficulty. While
                    the strife was at its hottest, he had sent an agent to England, with a general
                    authority to place his resignation in the hands of the Company under certain
                    conditions. The agent thought fit to exercise that authority. The resignation
                    was promptly accepted, and one of the directors was appointed to the vacancy.
                    But in the meantime Colonel Monson had died, and Hastings was thus restored, by
                    virtue of his casting vote, to the supreme management of affairs. He refused to
                    ratify his resignation; and when Clavering attempted to seize on the
                    governor-generalship, he judiciously obtained an opinion of the supreme court in
                    his own favour. From that time forth, though he could not always command an
                    absolute majority in council, Hastings was never again subjected to gross
                    insult, and his general policy was able to prevail.</p>
                <p>A crisis was now approaching in foreign affairs which demanded all the experience
                    and all the genius of Hastings for its solution. Bengal was prosperous, and free
                    from external enemies on every quarter. But the Government of Bombay had hurried
                    on a rupture with the Mahratta confederacy at a time when France was on the
                    point of declaring war against England, and when the mother-country found
                    herself unable to subdue her rebellious colonists in America. Hastings did not
                    hesitate to take upon his own shoulders the whole responsibility of military
                    affairs. All the French settlements in India were promptly occupied. On the part
                    of Bombay, the Mahratta war was conducted with procrastination and disgrace. But
                    Hastings amply avenged the capitulation of Wârgâon by the complete success of
                    his own plan of operations. Colonel Goddard with a Bengal army marched across
                    the breadth of the peninsula, from the valley of the Ganges to the western sea,
                    and achieved almost without a blow the conquest of GuzerAt. Captain Popham, with
                    a small detachment, stormed the rock fortress of Gwalior, then deemed
                    impregnable and the key of Central India; and by this feat held in check Sindiâ,
                    the most formidable of the Mahratta chiefs. The bhonsla, or Mahratta râjâ of
                    Nagpur, whose dominions bordered on Bengal, was won over by the diplomacy of an
                    emissary of Hastings. But while these events were taking place, a new source of
                    embarrassment had arisen at Calcutta. The supreme court, whether rightly or
                    wrongly, assumed a jurisdiction of first instance over the entire province of
                    Bengal. The English common law, with all the absurdities and rigours of that
                    day, was arbitrarily extended to an alien system of society. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zaminddrs,</hi> or government renters, were arrested on mesne process; the
                    sanctity of the zαnc0mr, or women’s chamber, as dear to Hindus as to Mahometans,
                    was violated by the sheriff’s officer; . the deepest feelings of the people and
                    the entire fabric of revenue administration were alike disregarded. On this
                    point the entire council acted in harmony. Hastings and Francis went joint-bail
                    for imprisoned natives of distinction. At last, after the dispute between the
                    judges and the executive threatened to become a trial of armed force, Hastings
                    set it at rest by a characteristic stroke of policy. A new judicial office was
                    created in the name of the Company, to which Sir Elijah Impey was appointed,
                    though he never consented to draw the additional salary <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0546-0515"/> offered to him. The understanding between
                    Hastings and Francis, originating in this state of affairs, was for a short
                    period extended to general policy. An agreement was come to by which Francis
                    received patronage for his circle of friends, while Hastings was to be unimpeded
                    in the control of foreign affairs. But a difference of interpretation arose.
                    Hastings recorded in an official minute that he had found Francis’s private and
                    public conduct to be “void of truth and honour.” They met as duellists. Francis
                    fell wounded, and soon afterwards returned to England.</p>
                <p>The Mahratta war was not yet terminated, but a far more formidable danger now
                    threatened the English in India. The imprudent conduct of the Madras authorities
                    had irritated beyond endurance the two greatest Mussulman powers in the
                    peninsula, the nizâm of the Deccan and Hyder Ali, the usurper of Mysore, who
                    began to negotiate an alliance with the Mahrattas. A second time the genius of
                    Hastings saved the British empire in the east. On the arrival of the news that
                    Hyder had descended from the highlands of Mysore, cut to pieces the only British
                    army in the field, and swept the Carnatic up to the gates of Madras, he at once
                    adopted a policy of extraordinary boldness. He signed a blank treaty of peace
                    with the Mahrattas, who were still in arms, reversed the action of the Madras
                    Government towards the nizâm, and concentrated all the resources of Bengal
                    against Hyder Ali. Sir Eyre Coote, a general of renown in former Carnatic wars,
                    was sent by sea to Madras with all the troops and treasure that could be got
                    together; and a strong body of reinforcements subsequently marched southwards
                    under General Leslie along the coast line of Orissa. The landing of Coote
                    preserved Madras from destruction, though the war lasted through many campaigns
                    and only terminated with the death of Hyder. Leslie’s detachment was decimated
                    by an epidemic of cholera (perhaps the first mention of this disease by name in
                    Indian history); but the survivors penetrated to Madras, and not only held in
                    check the bhonsla and the nizâm, but also corroborated the lesson taught by
                    Goddard—that the Company’s sepoys could march anywhere, when boldly led.
                    Hastings’s personal task was to provide the ways and means for this exhausting
                    war. A considerable economy was effected by a reform in the establishment for
                    collecting the land tax. The Government monopolies of opium and salt were then
                    for the first time placed upon a remunerative basis. But these reforms were of
                    necessity slow in their beneficial operation. The pressing demands of the
                    military chest had to be satisfied by loans, and in at least one case from the
                    private purse of the governor-general. Ready cash could alone fill up the void;
                    and it was to the hoards of native princes that Hastings’s fertile mind at once
                    turned. Clιeyte Sing, râjâ of Benares, the greatest of the vassal chiefs who had
                    grown rich under the protection of the British rule, lay under the suspicion of
                    disloyalty. The wazir of Oudh had fallen into arrears in the payment due for the
                    maintenance of the Company’s garrison posted in his dominions, and his
                    administration was in great disorder. In his case the ancestral hoards were
                    under the control of his mother, the begum of Oudh, into whose hands they had
                    been allowed to pass at the time when Hastings was powerless in council.
                    Hastings resolved to make a progress up country in order to arrange the affairs
                    of both provinces, and bring back all the treasure that could be squeezed out of
                    its holders by his personal intervention. When he reached Benares and presented
                    his demands, the râjâ rose in insurrection, and the governor-general barely
                    escaped with his life. But the faithful Popham rapidly rallied a force for Ids
                    defence. The native soldiery were defeated again and again; Cheyte Sing took to
                    flight, and an augmented permanent tribute was imposed upon his successor. The
                    Oudh business was managed with less risk. The wazir consented to everything
                    demanded of him. The begum was charged with having abetted Cheyte Sing in his
                    rebellion; and after the severest pressure applied to herself and her attendant
                    eunuchs, a fine of more than a million sterling was exacted from her. Hastings
                    appears to have been not altogether satisfied with the incidents of this
                    expedition, and to have anticipated the censure which it received in England. As
                    a measure of precaution, he procured documentary evidence of the rebellious
                    intentions of the râjâ and the begum, to the validity of which Impey obligingly
                    lent his extra-judicial sanction.</p>
                <p>The remainder of Hastings’s term of office in India was passed in comparative
                    tranquillity, both from internal opposition and foreign war. The centre of
                    interest now shifts to the India House and to the British Parliament. The long
                    struggle between the Company and the ministers of the crown for the supreme
                    control of Indian affairs and the attendant patronage had reached its climax.
                    The decisive success of Hastings’s administration alone postponed the inevitable
                    solution. His original term of five years would have expired in 1778; but it was
                    annually prolonged by special Act of Parliament until his voluntary resignation.
                    Though Hastings was thus irremovable, his policy did not escape censure.
                    Ministers were naturally anxious to obtain the reversion to his vacant post, and
                    Indian affairs formed at this time the hinge on which party politics turned. On
                    one occasion Dundas carried a motion in the House of Commons censuring Hastings,
                    and demanding his recall. The directors of the Company were disposed to act upon
                    this resolution; but in the court of proprietors, with whom the decision
                    ultimately lay, Hastings always possessed a sufficient majority. Fox’s India
                    Bill led to the downfall of the Coalition Ministry in 1783. The Act which Pitt
                    successfully carried in the following year introduced a new constitution, in
                    which Hastings felt that he had no place. In February 1785 he finally sailed
                    from Calcutta, after a dignified ceremony of resignation, and amid enthusiastic
                    farewells from all classes.</p>
                <p>On his arrival in England, after a second absence of sixteen years, he was not
                    displeased with the reception he met with at court and in the country. A peerage
                    was openly talked of as his due, while his own ambition pointed to some
                    responsible office at home. Pitt had never taken a side against him, while Lord
                    Chancellor Thurlow was his pronounced friend. But he was now destined to learn
                    that his enemy Francis, whom he had discomfited in the council chamber at
                    Calcutta, was more than his match in the parliamentary arena. Edmund Burke had
                    taken the subject races of India under the protection of his eloquence. Francis,
                    who had been the early friend of Burke, supplied him with the personal animus
                    against Hastings, and with the knowledge of details, which he might otherwise
                    have lacked. The Whig party on this occasion unanimously followed Burke’s lead.
                    Dundas, Pitt’s favourite subordinate, had already committed himself by his
                    earlier resolution of censure; and Pitt was induced by motives which are still
                    obscure to incline the ministerial majority to the same side. To meet the
                    oratory of Burke and Sheridan and Fox, Hastings wrote an elaborate minute with
                    which he wearied the ears of the House for two successive nights, and he
                    subsidized a swarm of pamphleteers. The impeachment was decided upon in 178G,
                    but the actual trial did not commence until 1788. For seven long years Hastings
                    was upon his defence on the charge of “high crimes and misdemeanours.” During
                    this anxious period he appears to have borne himself with characteristic
                    dignity, such as is consistent with no other hypothesis than the consciousness
                    of innocence. At last, in 1795, the House of Lords gave a verdict of not guilty
                    on all the charges laid against him; and he left the bar at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n547/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0547-0516"/> which he had so frequently appeared, with his
                    reputation clear, but ruined in fortune. However large the wealth he brought
                    back from India, all was swallowed up in defraying the expenses of his trial.
                    Continuing the line of conduct which in most other men would be called
                    hypocrisy, he forwarded a petition to Pitt praying that he might be reimbursed
                    his costs from the public funds. This petition, of course, was rejected. At
                    last, when he was reduced to actual destitution, it was arranged that the East
                    India Company should grant him an annuity of £4000 for a term of years, with
                    £90,000 paid down in advance. This annuity expired before his death; and he was
                    compelled to make more than one fresh appeal to the bounty of the Company, which
                    was never withheld. Shortly before his acquittal he had been able to satisfy the
                    dream of childhood, by buying back the ancestral manor of Daylesford, where the
                    remainder of his life was passed in honourable retirement. In 1813 he was called
                    on to give evidence upon Indian affairs before the two Houses of Parliament,
                    which received him with exceptional marks of respect. The university of Oxford
                    conferred on him the honorary degree of D.C.L.; and in the following year he was
                    sworn of the Privy Council, and took a prominent part in the reception given to
                    the duke of Wellington and the allied sovereigns. He died on the 22d of August
                    1818, in his 86th year, and lies buried behind the chancel of the parish church,
                    which he had recently restored at his own charges.</p>
                <p>In physical appearance, Hastings “looked like a great man, and not like a bad
                    man.” The body was wholly subjugated to the mind. A frame naturally slight had
                    been further attenuated by rigorous habits of temperance, and thus rendered
                    proof against the diseases of the tropics. Against his private character not
                    even calumny has breathed a reproach. As brother, as husband, and as friend, his
                    affections were as stedfast as they were warm. By the public he was always
                    regarded as reserved, but within his own inner circle he gave and received
                    perfect confidence. In his dealings with money, he was characterized rather by
                    liberality of expenditure than by carefulness of acquisition. A classical
                    education and the instincts of family pride saved him from both the greed and
                    the vulgar display which marked the typical “nabob,” the self-made man of those
                    days. He could support the position of a governorgeneral and of a country
                    gentleman with equal credit. Concerning his second marriage, it suffices to say
                    that the Baroness Imhoff was about forty years of age, with a family of grown-up
                    children, when the complaisant law of her native land allowed her to become Mrs
                    Hastings. She survived her husband, who seems to have cherished towards her to
                    the last the sentiments of a lover. Her children he adopted as his own; and it
                    was chiefly for her sake that he desired the peerage which was twice held out to
                    him.</p>
                <p>Hastings’s public career will probably never cease to be a subject of
                    controversy. It was his misfortune to be the scape-goat upon whose head
                    Parliament laid the accumulated sins, real and imaginary, of the East India
                    Company. If the acquisition of our Indian empire can be supported on ethical
                    grounds, Hastings needs no defence. No one who reads his private correspondence
                    will admit that even his least defensible acts were dictated by dishonourable
                    motives. It is more pleasing to point out certain of his public measures upon
                    which no difference of opinion can arise. He was the first to attempt to open a
                    trade route with Thibet, and to organize a survey of Bengal and of the eastern
                    seas. It was he who persuaded the <hi rend="italic">pandits</hi> of Bengal to
                    disclose the treasures of Sanskrit to European scholars. He founded the Madrasa
                    or college for Mahometan education at Calcutta, primarily out of his own funds:
                    and he projected the foundation of an Indian Institute in England. The Royal
                    Asiatic Society was established under his auspices, though he yielded the post
                    of president to Sir W. Jones. No Englishman ever understood the native character
                    so well as Hastings; none ever devoted himself more heartily to the promotion of
                    every scheme, great and small, that could advance the prosperity of India.
                    Natives and Anglo-Indians alike venerate his name, the former as their first
                    beneficent administrator, the latter as the most able and the most enlightened
                    of their own class. If Clive’s sword conquered the Indian empire, it was the
                    brain of Hastings that planned the system of civil administration, and his
                    genius that saved the empire in its darkest hour.</p>
                <p>The bibliography dealing with Warren Hastings is not large. The histories of Mill
                    and Thornton both adopt a standpoint that is on the whole adverse. The <hi
