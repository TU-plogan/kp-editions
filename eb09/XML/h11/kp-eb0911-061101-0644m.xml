                <p>ΠEEM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jan Davidsz van</hi> (or <hi rend="smallcaps">Johannes
                    de),</hi> was born according to Houbraken and Sandrart in 1604, according to
                    Descamps in 1600, at Utrecht, and died at Antwerp in 1683 or 1684. Thoré has
                    said of Heda, but it is only true of De Heem, that “he glorified insects,
                    butterflies, and all the minute beings that swarm in vegetation, and made the
                    moth drink in cups of chased gold.” He was, if not the first, certainly the
                    greatest painter of still life in Holland; no artist of his class combined more
                    successfully perfect reality of form and colour with brilliancy and harmony of
                    tints. No object of stone or silver, no flower humble or gorgeous, no fruit of
                    Europe or the tropics, no twig or leaf, with which he was not familiar.
                    Sometimes he merely represented a festoon or a nosegay. More frequently he
                    worked with a purpose to point a moral or illustrate a motto. Here the snake
                    lies coiled under the grass, there a skull rests on blooming plants. Gold and
                    silver tankards or cups suggest the vanity of earthly possessions; salvation is
                    allegorized in a chalice amidst blossoms, death as a crucifix inside a wreath.
                    Sometimes De Heem painted alone, sometimes in company with men of his school,
                    Madonnas or portraits surrounded by festoons of fruit or flowers. At one time he
                    signed with initials, at others with Johannes, at others again with the name of
                    his father joined to his own. At rare intervals he condescended to a date, and
                    when he did the work was certainly of the best. De Heem entered the guild of
                    Antwerp in 1635-6, and became a burgher of that city in 1637. He steadily
                    maintained his residence till 1667, when he moved to Utrecht, where traces of
                    his presence are preserved in records of 1668, 1669, and 1670. It is not known
                    when he finally returned to Antwerp, but his death is recorded in the guild
                    books of that place. A very early picture, dated 1628, in the gallery of Gotha,
                    bearing the signature of Johannes in full, shows that De Heem at that time was
                    familiar with the technical habits of execution peculiar to the youth of Albert
                    Cuyp. In later years he completely shook off dependence, and appears in all the
                    vigour of his own originality.</p>
                <p>Out of 100 pictures or more to be met with in European galleries scarcely
                    eighteen are dated. The earliest after that of Gotha is a chased tankard, with a
                    bottle, a silver cup, and a lemon on a marble table, dated 1640, in the museum
                    of Amsterdam. A similar work of 1645, with the addition of fruit and flowers and
                    a distant landscape, is in Lord Radnor’s collection at Longford. A chalice in a
                    wreath, with the radiant host amidst wheatsheaves, grapes, and flowers, is a
                    masterpiece of 1648 in the Belvedere of Vienna. A wreath round a Madonna of life
                    size, dated 1650, in the museum of Berlin, shows that De Heem could paint
                    brightly and harmoniously on a large scale. In the Pinakothek at Munich is the
                    celebrated composition of 1653, in which creepers, beautifully commingled with
                    gourds and blackberries, twigs of orange, myrtle, and peach, are enlivened by
                    butterflies, moths, and beetles. A landscape with a blooming rose tree, a jug of
                    strawberries, a selection of fruit, and a marble bust of Pan, dated 1655, is in
                    the Hermitage at St Petersburg; an allegory of abundance in a medallion wreathed
                    with fruit and flowers, in the gallery of Brussels, is inscribed with De Heem’s
                    monogram, the date of 1668, and. the name of an obscure artist called
                    Lambrechts. All these pieces exhibit the master in full possession of his
                    artistic faculties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cornelius de Heem,</hi> the son of Johannes, was in practice
                    as a flower painter at Utrecht in 1658, and was still active in his profession
                    in 1671 at the Hague. His pictures are not equal to those of his sire, but they
                    are all well authenticated, and most of them in the galleries of the Hague,
                    Dresden, Cassel, Vienna, and Berlin. In the Staedel at l· rankfort is a fruit
                    piece, with pot-herbs and a poιcelaιn jug, dated 1658; another, dated 1671, is
                    in the museum of Brussels. <hi rend="smallcaps">David de Heem,</hi> another
                    member of the family, entered the guild of Utrecht in 1668 and that of Antwerp
                    in 1693. lhe best piece assigned to him is a table with a lobster fruit, and
                    glasses, in the gallery of Amsterdam; others bear his signature in the museums
                    of Florence, St Petersburg, and Brunswick. It is well to guard against the
                    fallacy that David de Heem above mentioned is the hither of Jan de Heem. We
                    should also be careful not to make two persons of the artist who sometimes signs
                    Johannes, sometimes Jan Davidsz or J. D. Heem.</p>
