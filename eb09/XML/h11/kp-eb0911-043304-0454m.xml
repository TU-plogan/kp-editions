                    (1685-1759), one of the greatest names in the history of music generally, is
                    absolutely paramount in that of English music. His influence on the artistic
                    development of England and his popularity, using that word in the most
                    comprehensive sense, are <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0455-0434"/> perhaps unequalled. He has entered into the
                    private and the political life as well as into the art life of Englishmen;
                    without him they cannot bury their dead or elect their legislators; and never
                    has a composer been more essentially national than the German Handel has become
                    in England. It may on the other hand be said that but for his sojourn in that
                    country Handel would never have been what he was. It was under the influence of
                    English poetry, and of English national and religious life, that his artistic
                    conception broadened and gained the dignity and grandeur which we see in his
                    oratorios, and which was wanting, and, seeing the style of art, could not but be
                    wanting, in his Italian operas. The day of Handel’s arrival in London, late in
                    the autumn of 1710, was indeed an eventful day in the life of Handel as well as
                    in the annals of English music, and the facts of his biography preceding that
                    date may be summed up with comparative brevity. George Frederick Handel (in
                    German the name is always Händel) was born at Halle in Saxony on February 23,
                    1685, the same year which gave birth to his great fellow composer Johann
                    Sebastian Bach.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    date, 23d February 1684, given on his tombstone in Westminster Abbey is
                    incorrect.</p></note> He was the son of George Handel, who according to the
                    custom of the time combined the occupations of barber and surgeon, and
                    subsequently rose to be valet-de-chambre to the elector of Saxony. His second
                    wife, Dorothea Taust, was the daughter of a clergyman, and to her the great
                    composer remained attached with all the ties of filial affection. His father was
                    sixty-three years old when Handel was born, and the musical talent shown by the
                    youth at a very early age found little encouragement from the stern old
                    gentleman, who looked upon art with contempt, and destined his son for the law.
                    Many are the anecdotes relating to the surreptitious way in which the youth
                    practised the forbidden art on a little spinet smuggled into his attic by the
                    aid of a good-natured aunt, and fortunately of too feeble tone to be audible in
                    the lower part of the house. At the age of eight the boy accompanied his father
                    on a visit to Saxe-Weiäsenfels, and it was there that the proficiency acquired
                    in the manner above described was turned to excellent account; for, having made
                    acquaintance with the court musicians, and being allowed to practise on the
                    organ, he was on one occasion overheard by the duke himself, who immediately
                    recognizing his talent spoke seriously to the father on his behalf. To such a
                    remonstrance coming from such a quarter the valet-de-chambre had of course to
                    submit, and henceforth Handel was allowed to practise his art, and after his
                    return to Halle even received musical instruction from Zachau, one of the best
                    organists of the town. It was under his somewhat mechanical but thorough tuition
                    that Handel acquired his knowledge of counterpoint; he also soon became an
                    excellent performer on the organ. His first attempts at composition date from an
                    equally early period, and in his twelfth year he made his début as a virtuoso at
                    the court of Berlin with such success that the elector of Brandenburg,
                    afterwards King Frederick I. of Prussia, offered to send him to Italy, a
                    proposal declined by Handel’s father for unknown reasons. In 1697 the latter
                    died, and the young artist was henceforth thrown on his own resources. For some
                    years he remained in Halle, where in 1702 he obtained a position as organist ·
                    but in the following year we find him at Hamburg, at that time one of the
                    musical centres of Germany. There the only German opera worth the name had been
                    founded by Reinhold Keiser, the author of innumerable operas and operettas, and
                    was flourishing at the time under his direction. Handel entered the orchestra,
                    and soon rose from his place amongst the second violins to the conductor’s seat
                    at the clavicembalo, which he occupied during Keiser’s absence, necessitated by
                    debt. It was at Hamburg that he became acquainted with Mattheson, a fertile
                    composer and writer on musical subjects, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vollkommener</hi><hi rend="italic">Kapellmeister</hi> (1739) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ehrenpforte</hi> (1740) are valuable sources for the history of
                    music. The friendship of the two young men was not without some curious
                    incidents. On one occasion they set out together on a journey to Lübeck, where
                    the place of organist at one of the churches was vacant. Arrived at Lübeck, they
                    discovered that one of the conditions for obtaining the place was the hand of
                    the elderly daughter of the former organist, the celebrated Buxtehude, whereat
                    the two candidates forthwith returned to Hamburg. Another adventure might have
                    had still more serious consequences. At a performance of Mat th eson’s opera <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> at Hamburg, Handel refused to give up the
                    conductor’s seat to the composer, who was also a singer, and was occupied on the
                    stage during the early part of his work. The dispute led to an improvised duel
                    outside the theatre, and but for a large button on Handel’s coat which
                    intercepted his adversary’s sword, there would have been no <hi rend="italic"
                    >Messiah</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Israel in Egypt.</hi> In spite of all this
                    the young men remained friends, and Mattheson’s writings are full of the most
                    valuable facts for Handel’s biography. He relates in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ehrenpforte</hi> amongst other things that his friend at that time used to
                    compose “interminable cantatas” of no great merit, but of these no trace now
                    remains, unless we assume that a “Passion” according to St John (German words by
                    Postel), the MS. of which is at the Royal Library, Berlin, is amongst the works
                    alluded to. It was composed in 1704. The year after this witnessed Handel’s
                    first dramatic attempt—a German opera, <hi rend="italic">Almira,</hi> performed
                    at Hamburg on January 8, 1705, with great success, and followed a few weeks
                    later by another work of the same class, <hi rend="italic">Hero</hi> by name. In
                    1706 he left Hamburg for Italy, at that time still the great school of music, to
                    which indeed Handel himself owed his skill and experience in writing for the
                    voice. He remained in Italy for three years, living at various times in
                    Florence, Rome, Naples, and Venice. He is said to have made the acquaintance of
                    Lotti, of Alessandro Scarlatti, and of the latter’s son Domenico, the father of
                    modern pianoforte playing. His compositions during his Italian period were two
                    operas, two oratorios, <hi rend="italic">Resurrezione</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >II Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno,</hi> afterwards developed into the
                    English oratorio <hi rend="italic">The Triumph of Time and Truth,</hi> and
                    numerous other choral works. It was during these years that the composer’s
                    earlier or Italian style reached its full maturity, and that his name became
                    widely known in the musical world. In the chief cities of Italy “il Sassone,” as
                    Handel, like his countryman Hasse twenty years later, was nicknamed, was
                    received with every mark of favour and esteem. But his own country also began to
                    acknowledge his merits. At Venice in 1709 Handel received the offer of the post
                    of capellmeister to the elector of Hanover, transmitted to him by his patron and
                    staunch friend of later years Baron Kielmansegge. The composer at the time
                    contemplated a visit to England, and he accepted the offer only on condition of
                    leave of absence being granted to him for that purpose. To England accordingly
                    Handel journeyed after a short stay at Hanover, arriving in London towards the
                    close of 1710. Curiously enough he came as a composer of Italian opera, and in
                    that capacity he earned his first success at the Haymarket with the opera <hi
                    rend="italic">Rinaldo,</hi> composed it is said in a fortnight, and first
                    performed on February 24, 1711. The beautiful and still universally popular air
                    “Lascia ch’io pianga” is from this opera. A similar air in the form of a <hi
                    rend="italic">sarabande</hi> occurs in <hi rend="italic">Almira.</hi> After the
                    close of the season in June of the same year Handel seems to have returned to
                    Germany for a short time; but the temptation of English fame or English gold <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0456-0435"/> proved too powerful, and in January 1712 we find
                    him back in London, evidently little inclined to return to Hanover in spite of
                    his duties at the court there. Two Italian operas, the celebrated Utrecht <hi
                    rend="italic">Te</hi><hi rend="italic">Deum</hi> written by command of Queen
                    Anne, and other works belong to this period. It was in such circumstances
                    somewhat awkward for the composer when his deserted master came to London as
                    George I. of England. Neither was the king slow in resenting the wrongs of the
                    elector. For a considerable time Handel was not allowed to appear at court, and
                    it wa3 only through the intercession of his patron Baron Kielmansegge that his
                    pardon was at last obtained. Commissioned by the latter, Handel wrote his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Water-Music,</hi> which was performed at a great
                    fête on the Thames, and so pleased the king that he at once received the
                    composer to his good graces. A salary of £200 a year granted to Handel was the
                    immediate re3ult of this happy consummation. In 1716 he followed the king to
                    Germany, where he wrote a second German “Passion,” the words this time being
                    supplied by Brockes, a well-known poet of the day. After his return to England
                    he entered the service of the duke of Chandos as conductor of his private
                    concerts. In this capacity he resided for three years at Cannons, the duke’s
                    splendid seat near Edgeware, and produced the two Te Deums and the twelve
                    Anthems surnamed <hi rend="italic">Chandos.</hi> The English pastoral <hi
                    rend="italic">Acis and Galatea</hi> (not to be mistaken for the Italian cantata
                    of that name written at Naples, with which it has nothing in common), and his
                    first oratorio to English words <hi rend="italic">Esther,</hi> were written
                    during his stay at Cannons. It was not till 1720 that he appeared again in a
                    public capacity, viz., in that of impresario of an Italian opera at the
                    Haymarket Theatre, which he managed for the so-called Royal Academy of Music.
                    Senesino, a celebrated singer, to engage whom the composer specially journeyed
                    to Dresden, was the mainstay of the enterprise, which opened with a highly
                    successful performance of Handel’s opera <hi rend="italic">Radamista. Muzio
                    Scevola,</hi> written in conjunction with Buononcini and Ariosti, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tamerlane, Rodelinda,</hi> and other operas composed for the same
                    theatre, are now forgotten, only detached songs being heard at concerts. To this
                    time also belongs the celebrated rivalry of Handel and Buononcini, a gifted
                    Italian composer, who by his clique was declared to be infinitely superior to
                    the German master. The controversy raised a storm in the aristocratic teapot,
                    and has been perpetuated in the lines generally but erroneously attributed to
                    Swift, and in reality written by John Byrom :—</p>
                <p>Some say, compared to Buononcini,</p>
                <p>That Mynheer Handel’s but a ninny; Others aver that he to Handel Is scarcely fit
                    to hold a candle. Strange all this difference should be ’ Twixt Tweedle-dum and
                    Tweedle-dee.</p>
                <p>Although the contempt for music, worthy of Chesterfield himself, shown in these
                    lines may seem absurd, they yet contain a grain of truth. Handel differed from
                    his rival only in degree not in essence. In other words, he was an infinitely
                    greater composer than Buononcini, but had he continued to write Italian opera
                    there is no reason to conclude from his existing works of that class that he
                    would have reformed or in any essential point modified the existing <hi
                    rend="italic">genre.</hi> The contest was therefore essentially of a personal
                    nature, and in these circumstances it is hardly necessary to add that Handel
                    remained victorious. Buononcini for a reason not sufficiently explained left
                    London, and Handel was left without a rival. But in spite of this his connexion
                    with Italian opera was not tobe a source of pleasure or of wealth to the great
                    composer. For twenty years the indomitable master was engaged in various
                    operatic ventures, in spite of a rival company under the great singer Farinelli,
                    started by his enemies,—in spite also of his bankruptcy in 1737, and an attack
                    of paralysis caused by anxiety and overwork. Of the numerous operas produced by
                    him during this period it would be needless to speak in detail. Only the name of
                    the final work of the long series, <hi rend="italic">Deidamia,</hi> produced in
                    1741, maybe mentioned here. That Handel’s non-success was not caused by the
                    inferiority of his works to those of other composers is sufficiently proved by
                    the fact that the rival company also had to be dissolved for want of support.
                    But Handel was in more than one way disqualified for the post of operatic
                    manager, dependent in those days even more than in ours on the patronage of the
                    great. To submit to the whims and the pride of the aristrocracy was not in the
                    nature of the upright German, who even at the concerts of the princess of Wales
                    would use language not often heard at courts when the talking of the ladies
                    during the performance irritated him. And, what was perhaps still more fatal, he
                    opposed with equal firmness the caprices and inartistic tendencies of those
                    absolute rulers of the Italian stage—the singers. The story is told that he took
                    hold of an obstinate <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">donna</hi>
                    and held her at arm’s length out of window, threatening to drop her into the
                    street below unless she would sing a particular passage in the proper way. Such
                    arguments were irresistible at the time, but their final results were equally
                    obvious, in spite of Handel’s essentially kindly nature and the ready assistance
                    he gave to those who really wished to learn. No wonder therefore that his
                    quarrels with virtuosi were numerous, and that Senesino deeerted him at a
                    critical moment for the enemy’s camp.</p>
                <p>It is a question whether Handel’s change from opera to oratorio has been
                    altogether in the interest of musical art. The opera lost in him a great power,
                    but it may well be doubted whether dramatic music such as it was in those days
                    would have been a proper mould for his genius. Neither is it certain that that
                    genius was, strictly speaking, of a dramatic cast. There are no doubt in his
                    oratorios— for in these alone Handel’s power is displayed in its
                    maturity—examples of great dramatic force of expression; but Handel’s genius was
                    in want of greater expansion than the economy of the drama will allow of. It was
                    no doubt for this reason that from an inner necessity he created for himself the
                    form of the oratorio, which in spite of the dialogue in which the plot is
                    developed is in all essentials the musical equivalent of the epic. This breadth
                    and depth of the epic is recognized in those marvellous choral pieces expressive
                    either of pictorial detail (as the gnats and the darkness tangible and
                    impenetrable in <hi rend="italic">Israel in Egypt)</hi> or of the combined
                    religious feeling of an entire nation. By the side of these even the finest solo
                    pieces of Handel’s scores appear comparatively insignificant, and we cannot
                    sufficiently wonder at the obtuseness of the public which demanded the insertion
                    of miscellaneous operatic arias as a relief from the incessant choruses in <hi
                    rend="italic">Israel in Egypt</hi> at the second performance of that great work
                    in 1740. Handel is less the exponent of individual passion than the interpreter
                    of the sufferings and aspirations of a nation, or in a wider sense of mankind.
                    Take, for instance, the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Dead March in Saul.</hi> It
                    is full of intense grief, in spite of the key of C major, which ought once for
                    all to dispel the prejudice that sorrow always speaks in minor keys. Even Chopin
                    himself has not been able to give utterance to the feeling in more impressive
                    strains. And yet the measured and decisive rhythm, and the simple diatonic
                    harmonies, plainly indicate that here a mighty nation deplores the death of a
                    hero. It is for the same reason that Handel’s stay in England was of such great
                    influence on his artistic career. Generally speaking, there is little connexion
                    between politics and art. But it may be said without exaggeration that only
                    amongst a free people, and a people having a national <pb break="no"

                    century, such national epics as <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Maccaboeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Israel in Egypt</hi> could have been
                    engendered. In the same sense the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> became the
                    embodiment of the deep religious feeling pervading the English people, and
                    Handel, by leaving Italian opera for the oratorio, was changed from the
                    entertainer of a caste to the artist of the people in the highest and widest
                    sense. The <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> is indeed the musical equivalent of
                    Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi> This leads us to another and
                    equally important aspect of the same subject— the important influence of English
                    poetry on Handel’s works. Not only are some of the greatest names of English
                    literature—Milton <hi rend="italic">(Allegro and Peηseroso),</hi> Dryden <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alexander's Feast),</hi> Pope <hi rend="italic">(St Cecilia's
                    Ode)—</hi> immediately connected with Handel’s compositions, but the spirit of
                    these poets, and especially of Milton, pervades his oratorios even when he has
                    to deal with the atrocious doggerel of Morell or Humphreys. In addition to this
                    Handel received many a valuable suggestion from the works of Purcell and other
                    early English musicians with which he was well acquainted. No wonder therefore
                    that Englishmen claim Handel as one of themselves, and have granted him honours
                    both during his lifetime and after his death such as have fallen to the share of
                    few artists. But in spite of all this it is impossible to deny that the chances
                    of a national development of English music were, if not absolutely crushed, at
                    least delayed for centuries by Handel. Under Elizabeth and James England had a
                    school of music which, after the storms of the civil war, was once more revived
                    by such masters as Pelham Humphrey and his great pupil Purcell. The latter,
                    although cut off in his youth, had left sufficient seed for a truly national
                    growth of English music. But Handel soon concentrated the interest of
                    connoisseurs and people on his own work, and native talent had to abandon the
                    larger sphere of the metropolis for the comparative seclusion of the cathedral.
                    The following is a chronological list of Handel’s English oratorios taken from
                    the catalogue of his works appended to Mr J. Marshall’s article in Grove’s <hi

                    >Hercules</hi> (1744), <hi rend="italic">Belshazzar</hi> (1744), <hi
                    rend="italic">Occasional</hi> (1746), <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maccaboeus</hi> (1746), <hi rend="italic">Alexander Balas</hi>
                    (1747), <hi rend="italic">Joshua</hi> (1747), <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi>
                    (1748), <hi rend="italic">Susanna</hi> (1748), <hi rend="italic">Theodora</hi>
                    (1749), <hi rend="italic">Jephtha</hi> (1751), <hi rend="italic">Triumph of Time
                    and Truth</hi> (1757). The sequence of these dates will show that the transition
                    from Italian opera to sacred music was very gradual, and caused by circumstances
                    rather than by premeditated choice. It would lead us too far to enter here into
                    the genesis of each of these works, but a few remarks must be added with regard
                    to Handel’s <hi rend="italic">summum</hi><hi rend="italic">opus</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Messiah.</hi> It was written in twenty-four days and first
                    performed April 18, 1712, at Dublin, where Handel was staying on a visit to the
                    duke of Devonshire, lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Its first performance in London
                    took place on March 23d of the following year. Its introduction into Handel’s
                    native country was due to Philip Emanuel Bach, the son of the great Bach, who
                    conducted it at Hamburg. At Berlin it was for the first time given in April
                    1786, under the leadership of Adam Hiller, who also introduced it a few months
                    later at Leipsic against the advice of all the musicians of Saxony. At the
                    Berlin performance Signora Carrara, the celebrated singer, inserted in the first
                    part an aria by Traetta, in which, according to a contemporary account, “she
                    took much trouble to please the public, and the bravura passages of which she
                    delivered with great success.” Two years before this had taken place the great
                    Handel commemoration at Westminster Abbey, when on the third day of the
                    festival, May 29, 1784, the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> was splendidly
                    performed by an orchestra and chorus of 525 performers. In the appreciation of
                    Handel England thus was far in advance of Germany. The remainder of Handel’s
                    life may be told in few words. Owing to the machinations of his enemies he for a
                    second time became a bankrupt in 1745, but nothing, not even his blindness
                    during the last six years of his life, could daunt his energy. He worked till
                    the last, and attended a performance of his <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> a
                    week before his death, which took place on April 14, 1759. He was buried in
                    Westminster Abbey. His monument is by Roubilliac, the same sculptor who modelled
                    the statue erected during Handel’s lifetime in Vauxhall Gardens.</p>
                <p>Handel was a man of character and high intelligence, and his interest was not,
                    like that of too many musicians, confined to his own art exclusively. He liked
                    the society of politicians and literary men, and he was also a collector of
                    pictures and articles of vertu. His power of work was enormous, and the list of
                    his works would fill many pages. They belong to all branches of music, from the
                    simple air to the opera and oratorio. His most important works of the two
                    last-named classes have already been mentioned. But his instrumental
                    compositions, especially his concerti for the organ and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >suites</hi><hi rend="italic">de pièces</hi> for the harpsichord, ought not to
                    be forgotten. Amongst the contrapuntists of his time Handel had but one
                    equal—Bach. But he also was a master of the orchestra, and, what is more,
                    possessed the rare gift of genuine melody, unfortunately too often impeded by
                    the rococo embellishments of his arias. The extraordinary rapidity with which he
                    worked has been already referred to. It is true that when his own ideas failed
                    him he helped himself to those of others without the slightest compunction. The
                    system of wholesale plagiarism carried on by him is perhaps unprecedented in the
                    history of music. He pilfered not only single melodies, but frequently entire
                    movements from the works of other masters, with few or no alterations and
                    without a word of acknowledgment.</p>
                <p>A splendid collection of Handel’s MSS., six volumes in all, is in the possession
                    of her Majesty at Buckingham Palace. The Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge also
                    possesses seven volumes, mostly sketches and notes for greater works, in the
                    composer’s handwriting. The German and English Handel Societies (the latter
                    founded in 1843 and dissolved iu 1848) have issued critical editions of his more
                    important works. Three biographers of Handel deserve mention— an Englishman,
