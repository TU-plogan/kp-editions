                <p>1. A city of Syria Cyrrhestica, situated on some hills about 16 miles south-west
                    from the junction of the Euphrates and the Sajur. Besides the natural strength
                    of its position, it was important as lying on the line of intercourse between
                    Northern Syria and Mesopotamia, and was always a great trading city. Its early
                    history is quite unknown. It is not mentioned during the Assyrian wars in this
                    part of Syria (see Sayce, <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> October 1876). Abul
                    Farâz asserts that Josiah was defeated there by Pharaoh Necho (611 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) on his march towards Carchemish; but according to 2
                    Chron. xxxv. 20 the battle took place at Carchemish, which lay on the Euphrates
                    a little further north on the site of the modern Jerablûs, or Jerabis; and
                    probably Abul Farâz confounded the two cities. The same confusion perhaps has
                    caused the statement of Ammianus that Hierapolis was identical with Ninus Vetus
                    on the Euphrates. Jerablûs is clearly a corruption of Hierapolis, by which name
                    therefore Carchemish must at some time have been styled by the Greeks; but it is
                    surprising to find two great cities of the same name so near one another. No
                    proof exists that Hierapolis was an important city before the time of the
                    Seleucidae, and Professor Say ce suggests that it then succeeded to the trade
                    and name of the older city, which had now decayed. Its original name is given in
                    Greek as <hi rend="italic">⅛αpβνκη,</hi> which points back to a form Bambyg or
                    Mambug, while the Syrian form is given by Pliny as Mabog, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Mabbog for Mambog. The romance of trade by which this name has
                    become naturalized in many European languages deserves a passing notice. As the
                    city lay on the highway to the East, cotton and silk were important branches of
                    its trade. Probably cotton plantations existed there in old time; and after the
                    cultivation of silk was introduced to western Asia in the time of the Sassan ian
                    kings, large groves of mulberry trees surrounded the city. The name Mambe was
                    afterwards confounded with the Persian word pambe, silk; and the Greek form <hi
                    rend="italic">^B&gt;apβvκη</hi> also was similarly mixed up with the word <hi
                    rend="italic">β0pβvξ,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Βόμβυξ</hi> is borrowed from the Persian word (Benfey, <hi
                    rend="italic">Wurzellex.,</hi> ii. 113), though the form it has taken in Greek
                    is influenced by the word <hi rend="italic">βομβόω,</hi> to buzz. It is used by
                    Aristotle, &amp;c., to denote a gnat found in Asia Minor, which has certainly
                    nothing to do with silk.</p></note><hi rend="italic superscript"> γ</hi> which
                    originally denoted the fly supposed to spin on trees the cotton or silk (for the
                    two substances were confused by the Greeks and Romans) which men then gathered
                    off the trees (Virg., <hi rend="italic">Georg.,</hi> ii. 121). Hence the
                    “Bombycinae vestes” of the Roman writers; while the city itself is called
                    “Bombycina urbs.” In Asia cotton seems to have been known as a distinct article,
                    and was named after the city which was the chief seat of its manufacture, as
                    muslin is from Mosul. By the crusaders the stuff and the name were carried to
                    Europe, and the latter exists in English in the form “bombazine.” The Syrian
                    goddess Atargatis, called by the Greeks Derceto, a personification of the nature
                    power worshipped under different names over the whole of western Asia, had one
                    of her most famous temples in the. city; and perhaps Mambe may have been a local
                    name of the goddess. Hence in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi>
                    when, under the Seleucid kings, Bambyce became a great Greek city and the most
                    important station between Antioch and Seleucia, it was called Hierapolis or
                    Hieropolis. The latter form is found on coins, the former is used in classical
                    literature. The coinage of Hierapolis begins under the Seleucidae. The
                    autonomous coins, probably for commercial reasons, imitate closely the coins of
                    Antioch. The temple was plundered by Crassus on his Parthian expedition (53
                    B.C.). Under Diocletian or Constantine, Hierapolis became the capital of the new
                    province of Euphratensis, a name which soon gave place to the older name
                    Commagene. As paganism decayed, Hierapolis ceased to be the sacred city, and
                    recovered its ancient name; at the same time its importance and population
                    declined. In the time of Julian, who concentrated there the Roman troops for the
                    fatal Parthian campaign, it was still one of the greatest cities of Syria; but
                    under Justinian, who made some attempt to restore it, great part of its area was
                    a desert, and the once strong fortifications were so decayed that the place was
                    not defensible against the Parthian king Chosroes. At the Arab conquest it
                    passed into the hands of the caliphs. Haroun-al-Raschid '(786-808) restored it
                    and strengthened its walls, and it is mentioned about 1150 by Edrisi as a strong
                    city. As the empire of the caliphs dwindled, Mambedj became a frontier post in
                    the struggle between Christians and Mahometans, and its possession carried with
                    it the rule in this part of Syria. The emperor Romanus Diogenes captured it in
                    his gallant struggle against the Turks (1068). Recaptured by the Seljuk Turks,
                    it soon afterwards fell into the power of the crusaders, until it was stormed by
                    Saladin (1175). It was for some time the headquarters of the Mongol host under
                    Hulagu Khan; and, as with many other Syrian cities, its desolation dates from
                    this time. The ruins which still exist called Kara Bambuche or Buyuk Mambedj,
                    have been described by Pococke and others, and most carefully by Chesney <hi
                    rend="italic">{Euphrates Expedition,</hi> i. 420).</p>
                <p>Strabo (xvi. p. 748) confuses this Hierapolis with Edessa in Mesopotamia. A very
                    full account of the city to supplement the brief outline here given may be found
                    in Ritter, <hi rend="italic">Erdkunde,</hi> x. 1041-65.</p>
                <p>2. A city in Phrygia, at the junction of the Lycus and Meander, on the road from
                    Apamea to Sardis. In it there were warm springs which had and still have a
                    remarkable power of forming incrustations. Its name Hierapolis is due to the
                    sanctity conferred on it by these hot springs, and by the Plutonium, a small
                    cave under a projecting rock, from which there constantly emanated a dark vapour
                    deadly to man and beast (Strabo, xiii. 629; Vitruv., viii. 3; Apuleius, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Mundo,</hi> p. 65). In reference to this we find sometimes on
                    its coins Pluto carrying off Proserpine.</p>

                <p>The water was also much used for dyeing. Nothing is known of the origin of the
                    city; from the legend <hi rend="italic">αρχηγέτη·:</hi> on coins, with a radiate
                    head of the sun-god, Eckhel concludes that a Greek foundation was made under the
                    guidance of Apollo; but a native city may have already existed there. The native
                    name of the sun-god was <hi rend="italic">Baιpβηvoς,</hi> which often occurs on
                    coins; he was probably a Phrygian form of the Greek Zeus. The goddess of
                    healthful drinking, Euposia, is also seen on coins. Cybele also, who is found on
                    the coins, was one of the chief deities of the place. Little is known of the
                    history of the city. The philosopher Epictetus was born there; and there St Paul
                    founded a church (Coloss. iv. 13). The very considerable ruins which still
                    exist, called Pambuk Kalessi (“Cottoh Castle <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi>),
                    have been described by Pococke, Leake, &lt;fcc. The ancient theatre and
                    gymnasium are in a state of remarkable preservation.</p>
