                    an eminent American physicist, was born in Albany, the capital of the State of
                    New York, on the 17th of December 1797. He received his education at an ordinary
                    school, and afterward at the Albany academy, which enjoyed considerable
                    reputation for the thoroughness of its classical and mathematical courses. On
                    finishing his academic studies he contemplated adopting the medical profession,
                    and prosecuted his studies in chemistry, anatomy, and physiology with that view.
                    He occasionally contributed papers to the Albany institute, in the years 1824
                    and 1825, en chemical and mechanical subjects; and in the latter year, having
                    been unexpectedly appointed assistant engineer on the survey of a route for a
                    State road from the Hudson river to Lake Erie, a distance somewhat over 300
                    miles, he at once embarked with zeal and success in the new enterprise. This
                    diversion from his original bent gave him an inclination to the career of civil
                    and mechanical engineering; and in the spring of 1826 he was elected by the
                    trustees of the Albany academy to the chair of mathematics and natural
                    philosophy in that institution. In the latter part of 1827 he read before the
                    Albany institute his first important contribution, “On some Modifications of the
                    Electro-Magnetic Apparatus.” Struck with the great improvements then recently
                    introduced into such apparatus by Mr William Sturgeon of Woolwich, he had still
                    further extended their efficiency, with considerable reduction of battery-power,
                    by adopting in all the experimental circuits (where applicable) the principle of
                    Schweigger’s “multiplier,that is, by substituting for single wire circuits,
                    voluminous coils (7 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> rαπs. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Albany Institute,</hi> October 10, 1827, vol. i. pp. 22 <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> 23). In June 1828 and .in March 1829 he exhibited before the institute
                    small electromagnets closely and repeatedly wound with silk-covered wire, which
                    had a far greater lifting power than any then known. Henry appears to have been
                    the first to adopt insulated or silk-covered wire for the magnetic coil; and
                    also the first to employ what may be called the “spool” winding for the limbs of
                    the magnet. He was also the first to demonstrate experimentally the difference
                    of action between what he called a “quantity” magnet excited by a “quantity”
                    battery of a single pair, and an “intensity” magnet with long fine wire coil
                    excited by an “intensity” battery of many elements, having their resistances
                    suitably proportioned. He pointed out that the latter form alone was applicable
                    to telegraphic purposes. A detailed account of these experiments and exhibitions
                    was not, however, published till January 1, 1831 (Silliman’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am. Jour. Sci.,</hi> xix. 400-408). Henry’s “quantity” magnets acquired
                    considerable celebrity at the time, from their unprecedented attractive
                    power,—one (August 1830) lifting 750 pounds, another (March 1831) 2300, and a
                    third (1834) 350Ö.</p>
                <p>Early in 1831 he arranged a small office-bell to be tapped by the polarized
                    armature of an “intensity” magnet, whose coil was in continuation of a mile of
                    insulated copper wire, suspended about one of the rooms of his academy. This was
                    the first instance of magnetizing iron at a distance, or of a suitable
                    combination of magnet and battery being so arranged as to be capable of such
                    action. It was, therefore, the earliest example of a true “magnetic” telegraph,
                    all preceding experiments to this end having been on the galvanometer or needle
                    principle. About the same time he devised and constructed the first
                    electromagnetic engine with automatic polechanger (Silliman’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am. Jour.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sei.,</hi> July 1831, xx. 340-343; and
                    Sturgeon’s <hi rend="italic">Annuls Electr.,</hi> 1839, iii. 554). Early in 1832
                    he discovered the induction of a current on itself, in a long helical wire,
                    giving greatly increased intensity of discharge (Silliman’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am. Jour. Sci.,</hi> July 1832, xxii. 408). In 1832 he was elected to the chair
                    of natural philosophy in the New Jersey college at Princeton. In 1834 lie
                    continued and extended his researches “On the Influence of a Spiral Conductor in
                    increasing the Intensity of Electricity from a Galvanic Arrangement of a Single
                    Pair;” a memoir of which was read before the American Philosophical Society,
                    February 6, 1835 <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Am. Phil. Soc.,</hi> v. 223-231, ms.)
                    In 1835 he combined the short circuit of his monster magnet (of 1834) with the
                    small “intensity” magnet of an experimental telegraph wire, thereby establishing
                    the fact that very powerful mechanical effects could be produced at a great
                    distance by the agency of a very feeble magnet used as a circuit maker and
                    breaker, or as a “trigger ”— the precursor of later forms of relay and receiving
                    magnets. In 1837 he paid his first visit to England and Europe. In 1838 he made
                    important investigations in regard to the conditions and range of induction from
                    electrical currents,—showing that induced currents, although merely momentary,
                    produce still other or tertiary currents, and thus on through successive orders
                    of induction, with alternating signs, and with reversed initial and terminal
                    signs. He also discovered similar successive orders of induction in the case of
                    the passage of frictional electricity <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Am. Phil.
                    Soc.,</hi> vi. 303-337, ms.). Among many minor observations, he discovered in
                    1842 the oscillatory nature of the electrical discharge, magnetizing about a
                    thousand needles in the course of his experiments <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Am.
                    Phil. Soc.,</hi> i. 301). He traced the influence of induction to surprising
                    distances, magnetizing needles in the lower story of a house through several
                    intervening floors by means of electrical discharges in the upper story, and
                    also by the secondary current in a wire 220 feet distant from the wire of the
                    primary circuit. The five numbers of his <hi rend="italic">Contributions to
                    Electricity and Magnetism</hi> (1835-1842) were separately republished from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Transactions.</hi> In 1843 he made some interesting original
                    observations on “Phosphorescence” <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Am. PhU. S∩c.,</hi>
                    iii. 38-44). In 1844, by experiments on the tenacity of soap-bubbles, he showed
                    that the molecular cohésion of water is equal (if not superior) to that of ice,
                    and hence generally, that solids and their liquids have practically the

                    57, and 84, 85). Tn 1S45 he showed, by means of a thermo-galvanometer, that the
                    solar spots radiate less heat than the general solar surface <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.,</hi> iv. 173-176).</p>
                <p>In December 1846 Henry was elected secretary and director of the Smithsonian
                    Institution, then-just established. While closely, occupied with the exacting
                    duties of that office, he still found time to prosecute many original
                    inquiries,—as into the application of acoustics to public buildings, and the
                    best construction and arrangement of lecture-rooms, into the strength of various
                    building materials, &amp;c. Having early devoted much attention to meteorology,
                    both in observing and in reducing and in reducing and discussing observations,
                    he (among his first administrative acts) organized a large and widespread corps
                    of observers, and made arrangements for simultaneous reports by means of the
                    electric telegraph, which was yet in its infancy (<hi rend="italic">Smithson.
                    Report</hi> for 1847, pp. 146, 147). He was the first to apply the telegraph to
                    meteorological research, to have <pb break="no"

                    large map, and to utilize the generalizations made in weather forecasts, and the
                    first to embrace a continent under a single system,—British America and Mexico
                    being included in the field of observation. In 1852, on the reorganization of
                    the American lighthouse system, he was appointed a member of the new board; and
                    on the resignation of Admiral Shubrick as its chairman, Henry, in 1871, became
                    the presiding officer of the establishment—a position he continued to hold
                    during the rest of his life. His diligent investigations into the efficiency of
                    various illuminants under differing circumstances, and into the best conditions
                    for developing their several maximum powers of brilliancy, while greatly
                    improving the usefulness of the line of beacons along the extensive coast of the
                    United States, effected at the same time a great economy of administration. His
                    equally careful experiments on various acoustic instruments also resulted in
                    giving to his country the most serviceable system of fogsignals known to
                    maritime powers. In the course of these varied and prolonged researches from
                    1865 to 1877, he also made important contributions to the science of acoustics;
                    and he established by several series of laborious observations, extending over
                    many years and along a wide coast range, the correctness of Professor Stokes’s
                    hypothesis <hi rend="italic">(Report Brit. Assoc.,</hi> 1857, part ii. 27) that
                    the wind exerts a very marked influence in refracting sound-beams. The complex
                    conditions of such acoustic refraction he found to be exceedingly variable and
                    curious <hi rend="italic">(Report American Lighthouse Board,</hi> 1874, 1875,
                    and 1877). From 1868 Henry continued to be annually chosen as president of the
                    National Academy of Sciences; and he was also president of the Philosophical
                    Society of Washington from the date of its organization in 1871.</p>
                <p>Henry was by general concession the foremost of American physicists. He was a man
                    of varied culture, of large breadth and liberality of views, of generous
                    impulses, of great gentleness aud courtesy of manner, combined with equal
                    firmness of purpose and energy of action. He died at Washington, May 13,1878.
