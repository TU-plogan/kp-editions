                    to have at any time attempted to obtain practice. Early in life he devoted
                    himself to literary work, and became connected with the brilliant band of
                    authors and politicians who then led the Whig party. A commissionership of
                    audits, obtained through that connexion, together with some private means, made
                    him independent in point of . worldly fortune, and enabled him to devote himself
                    entirely to the studies of his life. He took no active part in practical
                    politics, and was in fact unsuited by nature for the rough work of party
                    polemics. But he was an active supporter of many popular movements— particularly
                    of that which ended in the abolition of the slave trade; and he was throughout
                    his entire life sincerely and profoundly attached to the political principles of
                    the Whigs, both in their popular and in their aristocratic aspect. Hallam’s
                    earliest literary work was undertaken in connexion with the great organ of the
                    Whig party, the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> where his review of
                    Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Dryden</hi> attracted much notice. His first great
                    work, <hi rend="italic">The View of the State of Europe during the Middle
                    Ages,</hi> was produced in 1818, and was followed nine years later by the <hi

                    fame-of Hallam rests. They at once took a place in English literature which has
                    never been seriously challenged. A volume of supplemental notes to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle Ages</hi> was published in 1848. These facts and dates
                    represent nearly all the events of Hallam’s career. The strongest personal
                    interest in his life was the affliction which befell him in the loss of his
                    children, one after another. His eldest son, Arthur Henry Hallam,—the “A. H. H.”
                    of Tennyson’s <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic">Memoriam,</hi> and by
                    the testimony of his contemporaries a man of the most brilliant promise,—died in
                    1833 at the age of twenty-two. Seventeen years later, his second son,. Henry
                    Fitzmaurice Hallam, was cut off like his brother at the very threshold of what
                    might have been a great career. The premature death and high talents of these
                    young men, and the association of one of them with the most popular poem of the
                    age, have made Hallam’s family afflictions better known than any other incidents
                    of his life-. He survived wife, daughter, and sons by many years. In 1834 Hallam
                    published <hi rend="italic">The Remains in Prose and Verse of Arthur Henry
                    Hallam, with a Sketch of his Life.</hi> In 1852 a selection of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Literary Essays and Characters</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Literature of
                    Europe</hi> was published. Hallam was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a
                    trustee of the British Museum, and. enjoyed many other appropriate distinctions.
                    In 1830 he received the gold medal for history, founded by George III.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages</hi> is described by Hallam himself as a series
                    of historical dissertations, a comprehensive survey of the chief circumstances
                    that can interest a philosophical inquirer during the period from the 5th to the
                    15th cenr tury. The work consists of nine long chapters, each of which is a
                    complete treatise in itself. The history of France, of Italy, of Spain, of
                    Germany, and of the Greek and Saracenic empires, sketched in rapid and general
                    terms, is the subject of five separate chapters. Others deal with the great
                    institutional features of mediaeval society— the development of the feudal
                    system, of the ecclesiastical system, and of the free political system of
                    England. The last chapter sketches the general state of society, the growth of
                    commerce, manners, and literature in the Middle Ages. The book may be regarded
                    as a general view of early modern history, preparatory to the more detailed
                    treatment of special lines of inquiry carried out in his subsequent works,
                    although Hallam’s original intention was to continue the work on the scale on
                    which it had been begun.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Constitutional History of England</hi> takes up the subject
                    at the point at which it had been dropped in the <hi rend="italic">View of the

                    stopped here for a characteristic reason, which it is impossible not to respect
                    and to regret. He was unwilling to excite the prejudices of modern politics
                    which seemed to him to run back through the whole period of the reign of George
                    III. As a matter of fact they ran back much further, as Hallam soon found. The
                    sensitive impartiality which withheld him from touching perhaps the most
                    interesting period in the history of the constitution did not save him from the
                    charge of partisanship. The <hi rend="italic">(Quarterly</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0413-0394"/><hi rend="italic">Review</hi> for 1828 contains an
                    article on the <hi rend="italic">Constitutional History,</hi> written by
                    Southey, full of railing and reproach. The work, he says, is the “production of
                    a decided partisan,” who “rakes in the ashes of long-forgotten and a thousand
                    times buried slanders, for the means of heaping obloquy on all who supported the
                    established institutions of the country.” No accusation made by a critic ever
                    fell so wide of the mark. Absolute justice is the standard which Hallam set
                    himself and maintained. His view of constitutional history was that it should
                    contain only so much of the political and general history of the time as bears
                    directly on specific changes in the organization of the state, including therein
                    judicial as well as ecclesiastical institutions. But while abstaining from
                    irrelevant historical discussions, Hallam dealt with statesmen and policies with
                    the calm and fearless impartiality of a judge. It was his cool treatment of such
                    sanctified names as Charles, Cranmer, and Laud that provoked the indignation of
                    Southey and the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly,</hi> who forgot that the same
                    impartial measure was extended to statesmen on the other side. If Hallam can
                    ever be said to have deviated from perfect fairness, it was in the tacit
                    assumption that the 19th century theory of the constitution was the right theory
                    in previous centuries, and that those who departed from it on one side or the
                    other were in the wrong. He did unconsciously antedate the constitution, and it
                    is clear from incidental allusions in his last work that he did not regard with
                    favour the democratic changes which he thought to be impending. Hallam, like
                    Macaulay, ultimately referred all political questions to the standard of Whig
                    constitutionalism. This prepossession may be connected with the legal tone that
                    runs through all his political writings. The spirit of the English lawyer is as
                    strong in Hallam as in Bentham, who, like him, was never a practising lawyer. It
                    is no doubt owing to this quality that the <hi rend="italic">Constitutional
                    History</hi> has become one of the text-books of English politics. Hallam, like
                    Blackstone, has become an authority to whom men of all parties appeal. The
                    origin of English institutions has since been explored with greater
                    elaborateness by Professor Stubbs, but our leading guide to the constitution in
                    its maturity is still Hallam.</p>
                <p>Like the <hi rend="italic">Constitutional History,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the Literature of Europe</hi> continues one of the branches of
                    inquiry which had been opened in the <hi rend="italic">View of the Middle
                    Ages.</hi> In the first chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Literature,</hi> which
                    is to a great extent supplementary to the last chapter of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Middle Ages,</hi> Hallam sketches the state of literature in Europe down to the
                    end of the 14th century :—the extinction of ancient learning which followed the
                    fall of the Roman empire and the rise of Christianity; the preservation of the
                    Latin language in the services of the church; and the slow revival of letters,
                    which began to show itself soon after the 7th century—“the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nadir</hi> of the human mind ”—had been passed. For the first century and a
                    half of his special period he is mainly occupied with a review of classical
                    learning, and he adopts the plan of taking short decennial periods and noticing
                    the most remarkable works which they produced. The rapid growth of literature in
                    the 16 th century compels him to resort to a classification of subjects. Thus in
                    the period 1520-1550 we have separate chapters on ancient literature, theology,
                    speculative philosophy and jurisprudence, the literature of taste, and
                    scientific and miscellaneous literature; and the subdivision of subjects is
                    carried further of course in the later periods. Thu3 poetry, the drama, and
                    polite literature form the subjects of separate chapters. One inconvenient
                    result of this arrangement is that the same author is scattered over many
                    chapters, according as his works fall within this category or that period of
                    time. Names like Shakespeare, Grotius, Bacon, Hobbes, appear in half a dozen
                    different places. The individuality of great authors is thus dis∙ sipated except
                    when it has been preserved by an occasional sacrifice of the arrangement—and
                    this defect, if it is to be esteemed a defect, is increased by the very sparing
                    references to personal history and character with which Hallam was obliged to
                    content himself. His plan excluded biographical history, nor is the work, he
                    tells us, to be regarded as one of reference. It is rigidly an account of the
                    books which would make a complete library of the period,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Technical subjects like painting or English
                    law have been ex« eluded by Hallam, and history and theology only partially
                    treated.</p></note> arranged according to the date of their publication and the
                    nature of their subjects. The history of institutions like universities and
                    academies, and that of great popular movements like the Reformation, are of
                    course noticed in their immediate connexion with literary results; but Hallam
                    had little taste for the spacious generalization which such subjects suggest.
                    The great qualities displayed in this work have been universally
                    acknowledged—conscientiousness, accuracy, judgment, and enormous reading. Not
                    the least striking testimony to Hallam’s powers is his mastery over so many
                    diverse forms of intellectual activity. In science and theology, mathematics and
                    poetry, metaphysicsand law, he is a competent and always a fair if not a
                    profound critic. The bent of his own mind is manifest in his treatment of pure
                    literature and of political speculation,—which seems to be inspired with
                    stronger personal interest and a higher sense of power than other parts of his
                    work display. Not less worthy of notice in a literary history is the good sense
                    by which both his learning and his tastes have been held in control. Probably no
                    writer ever possessed ajuster view of the relative importance of men and things.
                    The labour devoted to an investigation is with Hallam no excuse for dwelling on
                    the result, unless that is in itself important. He turns away contemptuously
                    from the mere curiosities of literature, and is never tempted to make a display
                    of trivial erudition. Nor do we find that his interest in special studies leads
                    him to assign them a disproportionate place in his general view of the
                    literature of a period.</p>
                <p>Hallam is generally described as a “philosophical historian.” The description is
                    justified not so much by any philosophical quality in his method as by the
                    nature of his subject and his own temper. Hallam is a philosopher to this extent
                    that both in political and in literary history he fixed his attention on results
                    rather than on persons. His conception of history embraced the whole movement of
                    society. Beside that conception the issue of battles and the fate of kings fall
                    into comparative insignificance. “We can trace the pedigree of princes,” he
                    reflects, “fill up the catalogue of towns besieged and provinces desolated,
                    describe even the whole pageantry of coronations and festivals, but we cannot
                    recover the genuine history of mankind.” But, on the other hand, there is no
                    trace in Hallam of anything like a philosophy of history or society. Wise and
                    generally melancholy reflexions on human nature and political society are not
                    infrequent in his writings, and they arise naturally and incidentally out of the
                    subject he is discussing. His object is the attainment of truth in matters of
                    fact. Sweeping theories of the movement of society, and broad characterizations
                    of particular periods of history, seem to have no attraction for him. The view
                    of mankind on which such generalizations are usually based, taking little
                    account of individual character, was highly distasteful to him. Thus he objects
                    to the use of statistics because they favour that tendency to regard all men as
                    mentally and morally equal which is so unhappily strong in modern times. At the
                    same time Hallam by no means assumes the tone of the mere scholar. He is even
                    solicitous to show that his point of view is that of the cultivated gentleman
                    and not of the specialist of any order. Thus <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n414/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0414-0395"/> he tells us that Montaigne is the first French
                    author whom an English gentleman is ashamed not to have read. In fact, allusions
                    to the necessary studies of a gentleman meet us constantly, reminding us of the
                    unlikely erudition of the schoolboy in Macaulay. Hallam’s prejudices, so far as
                    he had any, belong to the same character. His criticism is apt to assume a tone
                    of moral censure when he has to deal with certain extremes of human
                    thought,—scepticism in philosophy, atheism in religion, and democracy in
                    politics.</p>
                <p>Hallam’s style is singularly uniform throughout all his writings. It is sincere
                    and straightforward, and obviously innocent of any motive beyond that of clearly
                    expressing the writer’s meaning. In the <hi rend="italic">Literature of
                    Europe</hi> there are many passages of great imaginative beauty. <hi
