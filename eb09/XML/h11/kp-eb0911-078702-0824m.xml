                    temperate climates pass the winter. In hot and dry countries, on the contrary,
                    various animals pass into a similar condition during the hottest season of the

                    are liable to fall into a similar state at intervals during mild weather, and Dr
                    Marshall Hall has applied the term “Diurnation” to the day-sleep of bats, which
                    he regards as precisely analogous to hibernation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> —Although comparatively few mammals
                    hibernate, the phenomena of hibernation and similar conditions have been better
                    studied in this class than in any other. Dr Marshall Hall has laid down the
                    principle that the amount of respiration is inversely as the degree of
                    irritability of the muscular fibre. Every gradation may be met with between
                    ordinary sleep, the imperfect or abnormal hibernation of some animals, and the
                    profound hibernation of others, in which all the functions of life are almost
                    suspended. Such a condition is always accompanied by reduced respiration, and
                    increased irritability of the muscular fibre. If the respiration is reduced
                    without this irritability being increased, death results from torpor and
                    asphyxia, whereas, if the respiration is increased simultaneously with increased
                    irritability (as when an animal is aroused too suddenly), death likewise
                    results*from too great stimulation of the vital powers. The well-known danger of
                    suddenly awakening a patient from a state of somnambulism is doubtless due to a
                    similar cause.</p>
                <p>Hibernation, however, is a physiological condition, and not produced simply by
                    cold, though it is favoured by it, because cold induces sleep, which may
                    afterwards pass into hibernation. It is an error to suppose that hibernating
                    animals are capable of resisting any amount of cold, though their capacity of
                    doing so must vary according to their species and to the climate which they
                    inhabit. They always seek secure hiding-places where they may be protected from
                    too great a degree of cold, as well as from interference. During hibernation the
                    temperature of their bodies sinks to a point corresponding nearly to that of the
                    surrounding atmosphere; but if they are exposed to an unusual amount of cold,
                    they are first awakened by it, and then sink into a fatal torpor like other
                    animals. Many hibernating animals perish in this manner during severe
                    winters.</p>
                <p>Respiration being almost suspended during hibernation, the maintenance of
                    vitality depends almost wholly on the action of the heart, which will continue
                    for a long time after an hibernating animal has been decapitated. Animals may
                    also be placed in carbonic acid or under water for several hours, without
                    injury, when in this condition, though they would die in a very few minutes if
                    they were in their normal state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Man.—</hi> Long-continued suspension of consciousness in man,
                    whether voluntary or otherwise, is rare in temperate climates, but it is more
                    frequent in India, where some religious ascetics are stated on unimpeachable
                    authority to possess the power of throwing themselves into a state closely
                    resembling hibernation for an indefinite period. Many curious cases have been
                    recorded by Mr Braid in his small treatise on <hi rend="italic">Human
                    Hybernations</hi> published in 1850, the most celebrated of which is that of a
                    fakir who was actually buried alive at Lahore, in 1837, in the presence of
                    Runjeet Singh and Sir Claude Wade, and who was dug up and restored to
                    consciousness several months afterwards, after every precaution had been taken
                    to prevent any one from disturbing the grave in the interval.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bats.—</hi> Dr Marshall Hall says that the hibernating bat
                    never wakes at all, except from warmth or excitement, and that the digestive
                    functions are suspended to a far greater degree than in the dormouse or
                    hedgehog. Respiration is also suspended, and when the animal is disturbed it
                    quickly subsides again into total quiescence, after a few feeble respirations.
                    It is to be regretted that Dr Hall has not stated to which species of bat his
                    remarks refer, as the habits of the various species differ. Earlier or later in
                    autumn, according to the species, they retire to caves, hollow trees, and
                    similar hiding-places, where they cluster together, hanging head downwards by
                    their hinder claws, and clinging to each other, as well as to the walls and
                    sides of their retreat, so that a great number can crowd themselves into an
                    amazingly small space. Although such assemblies frequently consist of more than
                    one species, yet the various species do not all retire to their winter quarters
                    at the same period; the noctule is rarely seen abroad later than July, whereas
                    the pipistrelle may be seen flying on mild evenings almost every month in the
                    year. It is only natural to suppose that the hibernation of the former species
                    is much more profound than that of the latter, which doubtless feeds in winter
                    as well as summer; for though insects are far less numerous in winter than in
                    summer, yet some species appear only at that season of the year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bear and Badger.—</hi> These animals retire to winter quarters
                    in northern climates, and pass the greater part of their time in sleep; but the
                    brown bear and badger do not fall into a state of genuine hibernation. When the
                    bear retires for the winter, he is very fat, and it is said that the black bear
                    will not hibernate if this is not the case. Digestion is suspended, and his
                    intestines become stopped up with an indigestible mass chiefly composed of pine
                    leaves, which is not discharged till spring. The brown bear of Europe and
                    Siberia is very dangerous if disturbed during the winter; but the black bear of
                    America can scarcely be aroused from his torpor, which there is thus reason to
                    believe is a state of true hibernation, differing from that in which the former
                    species passes the winter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hedgehog.—</hi> This animal hibernates more completely than
                    almost any other. In the autumn it retires to a hole among rocks or under the
                    roots of a tree, where it remains for the winter, seldom or never awakening till
                    spring, and of course taking no food until then. If a sleeping hedgehog is
                    disturbed, it merely stirs, and then coils itself up more closely; but if a
                    hibernating hedgehog is interfered with, it takes a deep sonorous inspiration,
                    followed by a few feeble respirations, and then by total quiescence. The tenrec,
                    an allied animal found in Madagascar, sleeps for three months in its burrow
                    during the hottest period of the year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rodentia.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Several animals
                    belonging to this order hibernate more or less completely, among which we may
                    mention the hamster, the porcupine, the dormouse, the squirrel, and the marmot.
                    Several of these awake at intervals to feed, and therefore lay up a store of
                    provisions before they retire, although they all become very fat before winter.
                    Other species of this order hibernate less perfectly, or only occasionally, like
                    the hare, which will lie beneath deep snow in a small cavity, just large enough
                    to receive her body, for some weeks unharmed. But this is not true hibernation,
                    as respiration is maintained during the whole time, a small air-hole being
                    always kept open by the warm breath of the animal. In a similar manner sheep
                    (though belonging to a very different order of animals) have sometimes been
                    buried in snow-drifts in Scotland for several weeks without sustaining any
                    injury. The dormouse not only hibernates in the strict sense of the term, but
                    will sleep at intervals for several days together during mild weather. When a
                    <hi rend="italic">Myoxus</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> an allied
                    animal inhabiting Africa, was brought to Europe, it hibernated as if this were
                    its normal habit. Whether it aestivates in its native country is not known, but
                    its hibernating in Europe shows a greater power of adapting itself to changed
                    conditions of life than we should have been inclined to suspect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aves</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">and Pisces.</hi> —It was
                    formerly supposed that various species of swallows hibernated, and it was even
                    asserted that the sand martin was accustomed to bury itself <pb break="no"

                    has long been regarded as an exploded error. For the hibernation of fish,
                    compare the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Ichthyology.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphibia and</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Reptilia.</hi> —All the
                    animals belonging to these classes hibernate in cold or temperate climates. Land
                    tortoises bury themselves in holes in the ground, and fresh-water tortoises in
                    the banks or at the bottom of lakes and rivers. Lizards and snakes retire to
                    holes in trees, under stones, or among dead leaves, where many species
                    congregate in large numbers, and pass the winter closely entwined, and in a
                    still more torpid condition than that of the hibernating mammals, their
                    digestion and respiration being entirely suspended. Many tortoises, crocodiles,
                    and serpents bury themselves in mud in both South America and Africa, and
                    aestivate in the hard-baked ground during the dry season of the year. When the
                    viper is disturbed during the winter its bite is harmless; but this is not the
                    case with the venomous serpents which aestivate in tropical countries.</p>
                <p>Frogs generally hibernate in masses in the mud at the bottom of the water, and if
                    awakened from hibernation by warmth can remain eight times longer under water
                    without drowning than frogs in the breeding season. We should hardly expect the
                    habits of such an animal as the frog to be greatly affected by domestication,
                    but Professor Bell was acquainted with a gentleman living at Kingston, whose
                    kitchen Was built on the banks of the Thames, and whose servants made a pet of a
                    frog which had his hole in the skirting. It was unnecessary for the frog to
                    hibernate, and instead of doing so he came out of his hole every evening to bask
                    before the kitchen fire for three successive winters. It is impossible to say
                    how long frogs and toads may continue to retain a dormant life, if the mud in
                    which they bury themselves should become hardened around them during
                    hibernation. Too many circumstantial accounts of the discovery of live toads
                    embedded in solid rock, and even in coal, have been published to allow us to
                    dismiss .them all as fabulous, notwithstanding the difficulty and obscurity in
                    which this subject is still involved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca.</hi> —Many species hibernate. The land-snails bury
                    themselves in the ground, or conceal themselves under the bark of trees, in
                    holes in walls, or even in the stems of large umbelliferous plants. They close
                    the mouth of the shell with a calcareous plate, technically called an epiphragm,
                    which they secrete by means of their mantle, and which is perforated by a small
                    hole to admit the air. In winter they bury themselves with the head upwards, and
                    do not grow at all during the winter; but while growing they bury themselves in
                    summer, with the head downwards, at occasional intervals, for several days
                    together, and then grow very rapidly. Snails are not considered in season at
                    Paris till after the first frost, when they are closed with a white epiphragm.
                    In dry weather, and during the heat of summer, snails also close their shells
                    with an epiphragm, to protect themselves from drought, but this covering is
                    thinner than that which they construct during the winter. In the British Museum
                    is preserved the shell of a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">desertorum,</hi> from Egypt, which revived after having been
                    gummed to a board for four years in the Museum, and lived for two years
                    afterwards. Other instances of the revival of land-shells after a still longer
                    period are equally well authenticated. Some species retire to winter quarters
                    earlier than others, and their pulsation, which ranges from 30 to 110 during
                    summer, ceases entirely in winter. Slugs also bury themselves in the ground, and
                    become torpid during frosts or droughts, but it is doubtful whether their
                    condition is that of genuine hibernation. The fresh-water mussels <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anodonta)</hi> hibernate before the close of autumn, and bury
                    themselves in the mud till the beginning of spring. It is believed that many of
                    the marine <hi rend="italic">Mοlluscα</hi> also hibernate, but very little is
                    known of their habits at present <hi rend="smallcaps">Insecta.</hi> —Most of the
                    insects which pass the winter as larvae or perfect insects hibernate during the
                    period that they can obtain no food. Larvae which are full grown in autumn
                    frequently lie dormant during the winter, and do not assume the pupa state till
                    spring. In the case of insects which have more than one brood in the year, the
                    last brood generally hibernates, sometimes retiring to winter quarters quite
                    early in the autumn, while the perfect insects of the previous brood are still
                    flying about, and while the weather is still fine and warm. Insects which
                    hibernate in the perfect state do not pair till spring, and are probably not
                    fully developed till after hibernation. Hive-bees probably do not hibernate, and
                    it is well known that they require food during the winter. It is asserted that
                    the aphides, on whose sweet secretion ants chiefly subsist in inclement weather,
                    become torpid at exactly the same low temperature as the ants themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Concluding Remarks.</hi> —The seeds of many plants, and the
                    eggs of many of the lower forms of animal life, may remain dormant for years in
                    cold or dry climates, until heat or moisture awakes them to vitality. Many
                    plants die down in winter, the roots remaining in the ground, while many trees
                    then shed their leaves, the sap retiring to the roots. Similar phenomena take
                    place in tropical countries during the hot, dry season, wherever the amount of
                    humidity in the atmosphere is insufficient to maintain a perennial vegetation
                    during the year. These phenomena in the vegetable world are regarded as
                    analogous to those of hibernation in animals, and the term “hibernation of
                    plants” is sometimes applied to them.</p>
