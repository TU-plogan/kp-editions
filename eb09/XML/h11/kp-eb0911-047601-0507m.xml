                <p><label type="entry">HARE</label>, the common name of all the species, excepting
                    the rabbit, of <hi rend="italic">Leporidoe,</hi> a family of rodent mammals,
                    distinguished from the rest of that order by the possession of four incisor
                    teeth in the upper jaw, two in front, which are well developed and
                    longitudinally grooved, and two exceedingly small ones behind. The molars are
                    formed for the mastication of vegetable food, an uneven surface being produced
                    by the presence of transverse enamel plates which are worn down more slowly than
                    the intermediate dentine. The teeth are without permanent roots, and thus the
                    constant waste at the surface is compensated for by continuous growth at the
                    opposite extremity. Hares all possess long ears, and in most species the hind
                    legs are much longer than those in front. They are without exception timid,
                    defenceless animals, although during the breeding season two males have been
                    known to fight together for possession of the female until one was killed; while
                    all the species are protectively coloured. They form a single genus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lepus),</hi> containing from thirty-five to forty species
                    according as certain forms are regarded as independent species, or merely as
                    geographical varieties. They occur in all the great zoological regions of the
                    world, but are especially characteristic of the northern and temperate areas of
                    both hemispheres.</p>
                <p>The common hare <hi rend="italic">{Lepus</hi><hi rend="italic">timidus,</hi> fig.
                    1) is a typical example of the family. The ears in this species are longer than
                    the head, and its hind legs are so long in comparison with those in front, that
                    it is only by descending a hill diagonally that it can avoid overbalancing
                    itself. It is found in all parts of Europe except the north of Russia, the
                    Scandinavian peninsula, and Ireland, and is specially abundant in those
                    countries in which it enjoys the protection of game laws. Its fur is usually of
                    a tawny grey colour above and white beneath, with the upper surface of the short
                    tail and the tips-of the ears black. The colour of the fur, however,
                    differs-considerably in different latitudes and at different seasons of the
                    year, showing, for example, a tendency to become-white during winter in northern
                    countries, while assuming a reddish-yellow hue in the more genial climate of
                    southern Europe. On the strength mainly of such outward differences various
                    species have been described, but these have been found to be so linked together
                    by intermediate forms as to satisfy most naturalists that they are merely
                    climatal varieties of one species. The hare is a night-feeding animal,,
                    remaining during the day on its “Torrn,” as the slight depression is called
                    which it makes in the open field,, usually among grass. This it leaves at
                    nightfall to seek the fields of young wheat and other cereals whose tender
                    herbage forms its favourite food. It is also fond of gnawing the bark of young
                    trees, and thus often does great damage-to plantations. In the morning it
                    returns to its form,, where it finds considerable protection in the close
                    approach which the colour of its fur makes to that of its surroundings should it
                    thus fail, however, to elude observation it depends for safety on its
                    extraordinary fleetness. On the first alarm of danger it is said to sit erect
                    and to reconnoitre, when it either seeks concealment by clapping close to the
                    ground, or takes to instant flight. In the latter case its great speed,, and the
                    cunning endeavours it makes to outwit its canine pursuers, form the chief
                    attractions of coursing. The hare takes readily to the water, where it swims
                    well; and Yarrell records an instance in which one was observed crossing an arm
                    of the sea about a mile in width. Hares are remarkably prolific. They pair when
                    scarcely a year old, and the female brings forth several broods in the year,
                    each consisting of from two to five leverets (from the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >lièvre),</hi> as. the young are called. These have their sight at birth, and
                    after being suckled for a month they are able to look after themselves. In
                    Europe this species has never been known to breed in confinement. The hare was
                    well known to theancient Greeks and Romans.</p>
                <p>In those parts where the common hare does not occur,, its place is taken by the
                    varying or mountain hare <hi rend="italic">{Lepus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >variabilis,</hi> fig. 2). It is found throughout the entirenorthern portion of
                    the great Palaearctic region, from Ireland eastward to Japan, while it also
                    occurs on the Pyrenees, the-Alps, the highlands of Bavaria and the Caucasus,
                    although altogether absent in the less elevated regions which connect those
                    mountain ranges. Its presence in such isolated situations in company with many
                    truly arctic plants is regarded as one of the many proofs of a former glacial
                    epoch, during which boreal plants and animals were spread all over southern and
                    central Europe. On the advent, however, of milder climatic conditions, this
                    northern flora and fauna retired towards the Arctic Circle, leaving a few
                    species, such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0508-0477"/> as the varying hare, behind on the various
                    mountain ranges, where by ascending to a sufficient altitude the iiecessary
                    boreal conditions could be obtained. The mountain hare differs from the
                    preceding species in its ears .being shorter than its head, and in its fur
                    becoming in most cases white in winter,—a change of colour which renders it
                    almost invisible in the snow. Along the southern limit of its range, or in
                    districts where the temperature is from any cause exceptionally mild, this
                    change of colour either does not take place at all, as in Ireland, or is only
                    partial, as in many parts of Scotland. In this respect it resembles the ermine,
                    which it further resembles in having a part of its fur always remaining black;
                    in the hare, however, it is the tips of the ears, and not the point of the tail,
                    which thus remain unaltered. In Scotland, where it is known as the “blue hare,”
                    it occurs plentifully throughout the hilly regions north of the Forth, where it
                    descends to the low grounds in winter; while in Ireland it is the only hare
                    found. Owing to the mildness of the climate, however, in the “Green Isle,” the
                    colour of the fur undergoes little or no alteration in winter, and on this
                    account it was until recently regarded by many as a distinct species <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lepus luibernicus).</hi> Throughout the Arctic regions of North
                    America a closely allied species, the polar hare <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lepus</hi><hi rend="italic">glacialis),</hi> occurs. Naturalists have hitherto
                    had considerable difficulty in distinguishing this from the preceding species,
                    the chief difference being in the colour of the fur, which in the Polar hare is
                    white all the year round, with the exception of the tips of the ears.
                    Considerable light has, however, been thrown on this point by the observations
                    of the naturalists attached to the late Arctic Expedition under Sir George
                    Nares, who found this species inhabiting the shores of Grinnell Land, and
                    obtained evidence in footprints on the snow of its existence in latitude 83°
                    10', about 20 miles north of the nearest land. Unlike all other hares, and
                    resembling in this respect the rabbit, the polar hare would seem to occupy a
                    burrow—“a hole,” says Captain Feilden, “4 feet in length, scraped horizontally
                    into a snow drift.” “I have no doubt,” he continues, “the same burrow is
                    regularly occupied, as this one was discoloured by the feet of the animal, and a
                    quantity of hair was sticking to the sides.” Another point of importance in
                    establishing the specific distinctness of this species from -the former lies in
                    the difference in the number of young composing a brood in each of these
                    species. The number of young found in gravid females by the naturalists already
                    referred to varied from seven to eight, while in the varying hare of Europe the
                    number does not exceed five. According to Captain Lyon, the polar hare is by no
                    means a shy animal, as during his cruise in the Arctic seas hares were in the
                    habit of coming out on the ice to his ships to feed on the tea leaves which were
                    thrown overboard. This species has thus been found inhabiting the highest
                    northern lands yet visited by man, where it also attains its normal weight of
                    from 8 to 10 tt&gt;., subsisting on the stoneworts and other hardy plants which
                    form the scanty vegetation of circumpolar valleys. The American varying hare <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lepus amencanus)</hi> is one of the most widely distributed
                    species of this family, extending, in one or other of its four geographical
                    varieties, from the borders of the Arctic barren grounds southwards to New
                    Mexico. It differs from the mountain hare of Europe in its smaller size and
                    relatively smaller ears, but resembles it in the change of colour in the fur,
                    especially of the northern varieties, during winter. It is exceedingly abundant
                    on the banks of the Mackenzie River, where it is killed in great numbers by the
                    Hare Indians. A favourite device among the Indians for catching it, according to
                    Darwin, is to walk spirally round and round it, when on its form, especially at
                    midday when the shadow of the hunter is shortest. It has still more implacable
                    enemies, however, in the wolves, gluttons, and lynxes of those regions, of the
                    last of which it is said to form the principal food. The fur of this species is
                    imported into Great Britain, but it is of little value. In the swampy district
                    of the south-eastern portion of the United States, the swamp hare <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lepus</hi><hi rend="italic">aquaticus)</hi> and the marsh hare
                    <hi rend="italic">{Leρus</hi><hi rend="italic">palustris)</hi> occur. These take
                    readily to the water, and are said to dive for some distance, their legs being
                    less thickly clothed with hair than are those of the less amphibious species.
                    They feed chiefly on aquatic plants. Only one species of hare <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lepus brasiliensis)</hi> occurs in South America. It is found throughout
                    Brazil, and on various parts of the Andes in Bolivia and Peru. Fossil remains of
                    several species of <hi rend="italic">Leporidae</hi> have been found in the
                    Post-Glacial deposits and the bone-caves of Europe, while the remains of many
                    extinct species have been lately discovered in the Miocene deposits of Dakota
                    and Colorado. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">gi.)</hi></p>
