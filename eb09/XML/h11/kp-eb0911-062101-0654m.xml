                    (1791-1860), Danish poet and critic, was the son of the political writer Peter
                    Andreas Heiberg, and of the famous novelist, afterwards the Baroness
                    Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd. He was born at Copenhagen, December 14, 1791. In 1800
                    his fatherwas exiled, and he was taken by Rahbek and his excellent wife into
                    their house at Bakkehuset. They found him, however, very difficult to manage,
                    and about 1802 sent him back to his own family. His mother’s marriage being by a
                    state decree annulled, she married the Swedish baron Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd,
                    keeping up, however, friendly correspondence with her first husband in Paris. In
                    1805 she describes, in one of these letters, the brilliant precocity of the
                    young Johan. The latter proceeded to the university of Copenhagen in 1809. It
                    was not needful that he should earn his bread, and accordingly his mother
                    indulged for many years his extraordinary thirst for knowdedge. In 1812 he
                    visited Sweden, and made some long stay in Stockholm; he afterwards sent to his
                    mother from Upsala the first important poem which he composed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hfemkomsten</hi> (The Return Home), a piece of remarkable strength and
                    brightness. In 1813 his first publication appeared, a romantic drama for
                    children, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Theatre for Marionettes.</hi> This was
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">Christmas Jokes and New Year</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s Tricks</hi> in 1816, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Initiation of Psyche,</hi> 1817, and <hi rend="italic">The Prophecy of
                    Tycho Brahe.</hi> These works attracted attention at a time when Baggesen,
                    Oehlenschläger, and Ingemann possessed the popular ear, and were understood at
                    once to be the opening of a great career. In 1817 Heiberg took his degree, and
                    in 1819 went abroad with a grant from Government. He proceeded to Paris, and
                    spent the next three years there, under his father’s roof. In 1822 he published
                    his drama of <hi rend="italic">Nina,</hi> and was made professor of the Danish
                    language at the university of Kiel. At this town he delivered a course of
                    lectures, comparing the Scandinavian mythology as found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edda</hi> with the poems of Oehlenschläger. These lectures were published in
                    German in 1827. In 1825 Heiberg came back to Copenhagen for the purpose of
                    introducing the vaudeville<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>He composed a great number of vaudevilles, ’ of which the best known are <hi
                    rend="italic">King Solomon and George Hatmaker,</hi> 1825; <hi rend="italic"
                    >April Fools,</hi> 1826; <hi rend="italic">A Story in Rosenborg Garden,</hi>

                    1839; and <hi rend="italic">Emily's Beating Heart,</hi> 1840.</p></note> on the
                    Danish stage. Meanwhile he was producing dramatic work of a more serious kind:
                    in 1828 he brought out the national drama of <hi rend="italic">Elυerhoi,</hi> in
                    1835 the comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Elves,</hi> and in 1838 <hi
                    rend="italic">Fata Morgana.</hi> In 1841 Heiberg published a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">New Poems,</hi> containing “A Soul after Death,” which is perhaps
                    his masterpiece, “The Newly Wedded Pair,” and other pieces. All this time he had
                    been busily engaged in editing the famous journal, <hi rend="italic">The C
                    openhagen Flying Post,</hi> which he founded in 1827 and continued until 1837.
                    In 1831 he married Johanne Louise Paetges, the greatest actress that Scandinavia
                    has produced. Heiberg’s scathing satires at last began to make him very
                    unpopular; and this antagonism reached its height when, in 1845, he published
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n655/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0655-0622"/> his little malicious drama of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Nut Crackers.</hi> Notwithstanding this he received in 1847 the responsible
                    post of director of the national theatre, for which indeed he was more eminently
                    fitted than any other living person. He filled it for seven years, working with
                    great zeal and conscientiousness, but was forced by intrigues from without to
                    resign it in 1854. His health was much disturbed by these attacks, and he
                    retired into private life. Heiberg died at Bonderup, near Ringsted, on the 25th
                    of August 1860.</p>
                <p>It has been said that “the average cultivated Dane nowadays is very much what
                    Heiberg has made him.” His influence upon taste and critical opinion was greater
                    than that of any writer of his time, and can only be compared with that of
                    Holberg in the 18th century. Most of the poets of the Romantic movement in
                    Denmark were very grave and serious; Heiberg added the element of humour,
                    elegance, and irony to the dignity of Oehlenschlager, the pathos of Ingemann,
                    and the passion of Hertz. His versification was refined and exact, and his very
                    best pieces are those in which he mingles rich lyrical expression with what is
                    satirical or purely ludicrous. The works of Heiberg were collected, in 11 vols.,
                    in 1861-62.</p>
