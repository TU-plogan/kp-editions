                <p><label type="entry">HERALDRY</label>, though etymologically denoting all the
                    business of the herald, has long in practice been restricted to one part of it
                    only, and may be defined as the art of blazoning or describing in proper terms
                    armorial bearings. It treats also of their history, of the rules observed in
                    their employment and transmission, of the manner in which by their means
                    families and certain dignities are represented, and of their connexion with
                    genealogies and titular rank.</p>
                <p>Particular symbols have in all ages been assumed by the various families of
                    mankind, civilized and uncivilized. Such were the lion of the tribe of Judah,
                    the S. P. Q. R. upon the standards of ancient Rome and the eagle surmounting
                    them, the tattoo marks of the savages of America and the Pacific, the Danish
                    raven, and the white horse of Saxony, which still remains carved upon the chalk
                    downs of western England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The subject of ancient and especially of Greek “heraldry” is discussed by
                    Curtius in a learned and interesting paper “Wappengebrauch und Wappenstyl im
                    Alterthum” in the <hi rend="italic">Abhandlungen der Königl.</hi><hi

                    >Gems,</hi> vol. x. p. 136.</p></note> Heraldry, however, is a purely feudal
                    institution, coeval with close armour, devised possibly in Germany, adopted and
                    improved in France, Spain, and Italy, and imported into England by the Norman
                    invaders and settlers. Its figures have little or nothing to do with the older
                    symbols, though these have occasionally been incorporated into its charges, and
                    an apparent connexion thus established between them. These symbols, as has been
                    well said, were the precursors and not the ancestors of heraldic bearings. The
                    supposed connexion, however, misled the credulous heraldic writers of the 16th
                    and 17th centuries, and caused them to attribute coats of arm3 to the heroes of
                    sacred and profane history, who were certainly as ignorant of hèraldry as ever
                    was Adam of genealogy.</p>
                <p>“Arms” or “armories,” so called because originally displayed upon defensive
                    armour, and “coats of arms” because formerly embroidered upon the surcoat or
                    camise worn over the armour, are supposed to have been first used at the great
                    German tournaments, and to have reached England, though to a very moderate
                    extent, in the time of Henry II. and Coeur de Lion. To “blazon,” now meaning to
                    describe a coat of arms, is the German “blasen,” to blow as with the horn,
                    because the style and arms of each knight were so proclaimed on public
                    occasions. The terms employed in heraldry are, however, mostly French or of
                    French origin. Though now matters of form and ceremonial, and subject to the
                    smile which attaches to such in a utilitarian age, armorial bearings were once
                    of real use and importance, and so continued as long as knights were cased in
                    plate, and their features thus concealed. At that time leaders were recognized
                    in the field by their insignia alone, and these—both figures and colours—became
                    identified with their fame, from personal became hereditary, were subject to
                    certain rules of descent, and to the laws of property and the less certain rules
                    of honour.</p>
                <p>Froissart mentions a case in which a knight of the Scrope family could with
                    difficulty be restrained from putting to death a prisoner because he wore the
                    same bearings with himself. The last De Clare owed his death on the field of
                    Bannockburn to his having neglected to wear his cotte d’armes; had he been
                    recognized, his great value as a prisoner would have saved him. Also the loss of
                    the battle of Barnet was in part attributed to the similarity between the royal
                    cognizance of a sun and that of John de Vere, a star with streamers,—Warwick
                    charging Oxford by mistake for the king.</p>
                <p>The best if not the only absolutely safe evidence for the origin of armorial
                    bearings is that afforded by seals. Seals were in common use both before and
                    after the introduction of armorial bearings, and they are not so likely as rolls
                    of arms or monumental effigies to be the work of a later age. There are said by
                    Courcelles to be extant, appended to charters of 1030 and 1037 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> two seals of Adalbert, duke of Lorraine, which bear
                    on a shield an eagle with wings closed. This however wants confirmation; but
                    Anna Comnena, describing the shields of the French knights who visited
                    Constantinople about 1100, gives their surfaces as of metal only, polished but
                    plain; nor have any decided traces of arms been discovered among the early
                    crusaders. Louis le Jeune, who seems first of the French kings to have used the
                    fleur-de-lys, caused it to be represented in gold over the azure mantle and
                    chaussures worn by his son at his coronation. Also, in 1180, he seals with a
                    fleur -de-lys, but it is placed in a circle, not upon a shield. Planché cites
                    two seals of Philip, count of Flanders, one plain, in 1157, and another in 1164
                    charged with a lion, their subsequent bearing. Seton mentions the seal of John
                    de Mundegumbri in 1170 as bearing a fleur-de-lys, which, like that of Louis, has
                    two intermediate flower-stems, as seen on Florentine coins. He also gives the
                    seal of Falconer (1170) as bearing a falcon; and that of Corbet bore two ravens
                    perched upon a fleur-de-lys, while his brother bore them upon a tree. This
                    indeed was at a period when fleurs-de-lys, stars, and various animals were
                    commonly represented as mere ornaments on seals, but the peculiarity of the
                    instances named is that the falcon and the raven, like the fleur-de-lys of
                    France, were afterwards the heraldic bearings of those families. The seals of
                    the close of the 12th century, though not generally heraldic, certainly betray
                    many of the elements of heraldry. No doubt, when once introduced, armorial
                    bearings were felt to supply a real and serious want, and came rapidly into use,
                    but Wace, the poet of the reign of Henry II., although he tells us that</p>
                <p>“N’i a riche home ne Baron, Ki n’ait lez li son gonfanon, U gonfanon u altre
                    enseigne,”</p>
                <p>can scarcely be seriously held to mention armorial bearings.</p>
                <p>It is uncertain at what period armorial bearings found their way into England.
                    The Conqueror and his successors certainly did not use them; they do not appear
                    upon their seals, nor are they shown upon the banners of the Bayeux tapestry.
                    The monk of Marmoutier, probably a contemporary, describes Henry I., upon the
                    marriage of his daughter to Geoffrey of Anjou in 1122, as hanging about the
                    bridegroom’s neck a shield adorned with small golden lions, “leonculos aureos;”
                    and, making mention of a combat in which Geoffrey was engaged, he describes him
                    as “pictos leones praeferens in clypeo.” It is true that the number, attitude,
                    and position of these lions on the shield are not specified, but considering
                    that not long afterwards two lions became the arms of Plantagenet, and so of
                    England, this may fairly be taken as their introduction. Stephen is said to have
                    used a centaur, Sagittarius, as an emblem, because he landed in England when the
                    sun was in that sign, but on his great seal his shield is quite plain, save a
                    ridge down the .centre, evidently a part of its construction. On the seals of
                    the Conqueror, Rufus, and Henry I., only the hollow or under side of the shield
                    is shown; so there probably was no design upon the front. There is no seal of
                    Duke Robert, but William, earl of Flanders, his son, shows a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n717/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0717-0684"/> plain shield on his seal. His monumental effigy
                    (1128) bears a large pavesse shield, and upon it an escarbuncle, apparently a
                    highly ornamented clamp. The seal of Henry II. also shows the hollow of the
                    shield. The first great seal of Richard I. bears a lion rampant, who from his
                    position may be inferred to be fighting with a similar lion upon the sinister
                    and concealed half of the shield, blazoned in a MS. cited by Mr Way as “two
                    lion3 confrontés.”</p>
                <p>Up to this time the kings, though represented on horseback and in full armour,
                    have the face uncovered, and therefore their persons would be known. The seal of
                    Richard I. in 1189 shows a close helmet, and upon the shield two lions passant
                    gardant in pale, “leones lopardés,” as they were then or soon after called. On a
                    later seal, after his return from captivity in 1194, Richard added a third lion.
                    John, while earl of Mortaine, sealed with two lions, but his seal as king bears
                    three, and the coat has so remained. That the two lions were more than a mere
                    ornament is evident from their having been adopted by John’s natural son,
                    Richard de Warren, who seals with two lions passant regardant. The seals of the
                    great barons show the growth of the practice. Richard, constable of Chester,
                    contemporary with Stephen, bears a shield covered over with small plates,
                    tegulated, like his armour; but Stephen, earl of Richmond, as early as 1137,
                    seals with seven fleurs-de-lys, a very early heraldic seal. Waleran, earl of
                    Meulan (died 1166), also used an heraldic seal. Duchesne gives a seal of
                    Bouchard de Montmorenci (1182), a contemporary of Louis le Jeune, with a cross
                    between four alerions on his shield, and another in whch the cross is charged
                    with roundels. Mathieu, his son, seals also with the cr0s3 and alerions, which
                    had evidently become, as they remained, hereditary. In England, William, earl of
                    Essex (died 1190), seals with the escarbuncle of his family. In 1187 Gervase
                    Paganel, a great Anglo-Norman baron, seals with two lions passant, which his
                    family continued to bear.</p>
                <p>With the 13th century arms came rapidly into use. The second seal of Mathieu de
                    Montmorenci in 1209 has them introduced upon his horse furniture, but this
                    practice does not appear upon the seals of the kings of England until the second
                    seal of Edward I. Baldwin de Bethune, earl of Albemarle (died 1214), sealed with
                    three martlets in chief, and many other early examples of regular heraldic seals
                    occur at this period attached to extant charters. The earliest roll of arms is
                    of the reign of Henry III.; of a second of the same reign a copy is preserved in
                    the Harleian collection; and a third, in the next reign, is the roll of
                    Caerlavrock, 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps">ad.</hi> So that for the reign of Henry
                    and his son the evidence for armorial bearings is copious and excellent. Other
                    rolls exist carrying the practice through the 14th and 15th centuries, before
                    the middle of which there is no known work on heraldry, nor any trace of
                    heraldic regulations save what may be deduced from recorded practice.</p>
                <p>Coats of arms were not at first strictly hereditary, nor even always permanent in
                    the same person. Thus William de Ferrars, 6th earl of Derby (died 1216), seems
                    to have borne “argent, 6 fers de cheval, or horse shoes, 3, 2, 1, sable.”
                    William, his son, in consequence of a match with Peveril, who bore “vair,”
                    changed his bearing to “vair, or and gules, on a border azure 8 horse shoes
                    argent.” Robert his son, 8th earl (died 1278), dropped the horse shoes, and bore
                    “vair, or and gules.”</p>
                <p>“Ferrars his tabard with rich vair yspread.”</p>
                <p>After the match with Quincy, the Ferrarses laid aside their own coat and bore
                    that of Quincy, “gules, 7 mascles conjoined 3, 3, 1, or.” Their male heir
                    through a younger branch, —Ferrers of Baddesley-Clinton,—commemorates these
                    various changes by bearing “quarterly,—(1st) vair, or and gules; (2d) sable, 6
                    horse shoes, 3, 2, 1, argent; (3d) gules, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> mascles, 3,
                    3, 1, or, a canton ermine.” Hugh Lupus, earl of Chester (died 1101), is fabled
                    to have borne a wolf’s head, and not improbably his surname arose from some such
                    emblem. Richard, his son, is said to have borne “azure, semée of crosslets or, a
                    wolf’s head erased argent” Ranulph Meschines, 3d earl (died 1128), was sister’s
                    son to the first earl, and to him is assigned “or, a lion rampant gules.” Hugh
                    Cyfeliøc, 5th earl (died 1180), certainly bore “azure 6 garbs of wheat, 3, 2, 1,
                    or;” and Ranulph Blondevile, his son, bore “azure, 3 garbs or.” With him the
                    line failed, but as the wheat-sheaf is a common Cheshire bearing, it is probable
                    that arms came into general use in the palatinate, in the time of the last two
                    earls.</p>
                <p>Sir Nicholas Carru (died 1283) seals with a tricorporate lion, but at Caerlavrock
                    in 1300 is found with a</p>
                <p>“Banière et jaune bien passable, O trois passans lyons de sable/’ the arms of the
                    Carews of our day. The fess and label of Saher de Quincy, earl of Winchester, in
                    1170, were changed by Roger his son for the mascles by which they were best
                    known, and which he repeats upon his housings. The fact is that, at the close of
                    the 13th century, arms, though on the whole hereditary, had not quite acquired
                    that fixed character that belonged to them half a century later. That the
                    changes were the exception rather than the rule is, however, clear from the roll
                    of Henry IΠ., and from the arms of the forty great barons which he caused to be
                    painted on the walls of Westminster Abbey, almost all of which, so far as they
                    are on record, are the same with those borne or quartered by their
                    representatives. There exist also in England a few families of Norman origin,
                    the period of whose arrival in England is known, and whose arms are the same
                    with those of the present stock in the parent country. Such are Harcourt of
                    Ankerwyke and D’Aubigny, who therefore bore their arms before the separation
                    from Normandy under Henry III.</p>
                <p>Early bearings were usually very simple, the colours in strong contrast, and
                    their form and outline such as could readily be distinguished even in the dust
                    and confusion of a battle. They are mostly composed of right lined figures known
                    in heraldry as ordinaries. The favourite beast is the lion.</p>
                <p>The earliest and most valuable records relating to English armorial bearings are
                    undoubtedly the rolls of arms of the reigns of Henry III and the first three
                    Edwards, which have been well edited by Sir II. Nicolas. That of Henry III.
                    known as Glover’s roll, drawn up between 1243 and 1246, describes or blazons 218
                    coats of arms, and therefore shows very sufficiently the heraldry of the period.
                    Of these coats nearly one-half are composed solely of the ordinaries and
                    subordinaries, and other simple lines and figures. About two score of them
                    exhibit lions, chiefly rampant, and leo-pardés, a form of the sune animal. The
                    only other beast is the “teste de sanglier” borne by Swinburne. Of birds there
                    are but the eagle and the papagay, several martlets, and single examples of the
                    raven, the cock, the heron, and the horiole. The luce or pike is the only fish.
                    The cinquefoil and sexfoil, the fleurde-lys, the rose, and the wheat-sheaf, used
                    very sparingly, represent the vegetable world. For the rest there are annulets,
                    barnacles, crescents, estoiles, escallops, fers de cheval, mullets, and water
                    budgets. There is one ray of the sun, and one whirlpool.</p>
                <p>The coat of Mortimer “barré, a chef palée,a corner geren-née d’or et d’azur, a
                    ung escucheon d’argent,”—or, in modern terms, “harry, a chief paly, its corners
                    gyronny or and azure, an escutcheon argent ’’ (fig. 63),—is the only one at all
                    of a complex character, and this is composed of ordinaries and subordinaries';
                    and though many of the ordinaries bear the smaller charges, or are placed
                    between them, there are very few examples of an ordinary so charged also <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0718-0685"/> placed between charges, a common usage in later
                    coats. An exception is Chandos, who bears three estoiles on a pile, which again
                    is placed between six others; but this stands alone.</p>
                <p>The roll of Edward II. blazons 957 coats of the bannerets of England, so that the
                    use of arms had increased considerably. The lions have risen to 225, the eagles
                    to 43; and there are 102 crosses of various kinds. Of new beasts, fabulous or
                    real, there are the griffin, the wyvern, the stag, wolf, goat, and greyhound: of
                    new birds, the falcon <hi rend="italic">; of</hi> fishes, the dolphin. Of other
                    objects the additions are the millrind, buckle, covered cup, chaplet, gauntlet,
                    arrow, trumpet, hammer, battle-axe, palmer’s staff, pots, winnowing fans or
                    vans, pens, cushions, and chessrooks. The character of the arms remains very
                    simple, and the blazon employed agrees in the main with that still in use, and
                    is in general perfectly intelligible. These rolls give various examples of
                    changes of coats, either altogether or by the introduction of a difference to
                    distinguish members of the same∣ family; and it is observable that when the
                    figures are altered the colours are usually adhered to, as though it were
                    considered undesirable to change them. Thus Gilbert de Segrave (died 1254) bore
                    “sable, 3 garbs argent.” Of his grandsons John and Nicholas, John bore the
                    paternal coat, but Nicholas, at Caerlavrock, had exchanged the garbs for a lion.
                    This afterwards became the family bearing as “sable, a lion rampant argent,
                    crowned or,” the colours being retained.</p>
                <p>No sooner had the great barons assumed arms for themselves than they began to
                    grant them to their followers. Arms so granted commonly bore some resemblance to
                    those of the grantor, and hence certain charges prevailed in certain districts.
                    Thus the chevron of De Clare was common in South Wales, in the Honours of
                    Gloucester and Clare, and about Tonbridge. The garb or wheat-sheaf was found in
                    Cheshire; the cinquefoils of the Bellomonts in Leicestershire; the annulets of
                    Vipont in Westmoreland; the lion all over England, and the tressure in Scotland,
                    both from the royal arms. Some of these grants remain; others can with certainty
                    be inferred. Stephen Curzon, who held under the earls of Derby, bore “vair, with
                    a border of 8 popinjays argent,” and Richard, his brother, bore “vair, on a fess
                    3 horse-shoes.” Hubert, earl of Kent, bore “7 lozenges vair;” and Anselm de
                    Guise, on taking under him lands in Berks and Gloucester, assumed the same coat,
                    with the addition of a canton or, charged with a mullet sable. In 1349 Robert
                    Morle granted to Robert de Corby and his heirs the arms “d’argent, ove un
                    saltier engrailé de sable,” which he himself had inherited from Baldwin de
                    Manoirs. In 1356-7 William, baron of Greystock, who bore “harry of 6 argent and
                    azure, 3 chaplets gules,” granted to Adam de Blencowe and his heirs for ever “an
                    escutcheon sable with a bend closetted [or barred] argent and azure, with 3
                    chaplets gules.” In 1391-2 Thomas Grendale granted to William Morgue his heirs
                    and assigns, “argent, on a cross azure 5 garbs or,” which, as cousin and heir,
                    he himself hid inherited from John Beaumeys. Finally, in 1442, Humphrey, earl of
                    Stafford, who bore “or, a chevron gules,’ granted to Robert Whitgreaves “un
                    escue d’azure, a quatre points d’or, quatre chevrons de gules,” to him and hi3
                    heirs, of lineage,—in modern terms “azure, a cross quarter-pierced or, on each
                    limb a chevron gules.” A coat o. arm3 was not only heritable, subject to certain
                    heraldic customs, but could, be willed or granted away, wholly or in part, like
                    chattel property.</p>
                <p>The crusades, by bringing together soldiers of different nations, tended to
                    produce a certain assimilation in their heraldries, but their influence upon the
                    arms themselves has been exaggerated. The stories as to bearings adopted to
                    commemorate feats of arms in Palestine are mostly inventions. The cross no doubt
                    was a crusading bearing, but it was so because it was the emblem of
                    Christianity, and primarily popular as such. The stars, torteaux, water budgets,
                    and other charges attributed to the crusaders, were of earlier date and of
                    independent origin. There is no evidence that the crosses pâtée of the
                    Berkeleys, or the crosslets of Beauchamp, Clinton, Windsor, and Howard, were
                    added to their simpler bearings in token of services in the Holy Land. The star
                    of De Vere, always attributed to an adventure there, was evidently a mark of
                    cadency, adopted by Robert de Vere, brother of Alberic, 2d earl of Oxford. The
                    fact appears to be that most of the additions to or alterations in the earlier
                    coats of arms were made for some genealogical reason, to commemorate a match
                    with some great family or to distinguish between the several branches from the
                    parent tree. After, usually long after, the period of the crusades, arms were
                    invented for “fabled knights in battles feigned,” and but few of the Saracens’
                    heads which figure so formidably in many coats of arms are contemporary with any
                    Saracenic war.</p>
                <p>The diversion of the tournament did even more than actual war to promote the
                    glories of heraldry. On these occasions the presence of spectators, and
                    especially of ladies, encouraged all sorts of heraldic display. At a tournament
                    at Calais in 1381 Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, one of the most
                    accomplished knights of the reigns of Richard II., Henry IV., and Henry V.,
                    suspended on three shields three several coats of arms, as representing three
                    several knights who professed to be ready successively to meet all comers. Three
                    Frénch knights appeared to the challenge. Against the first the earl came forth
                    as the green knight with a black quarter, bearing “silver, a maunch gules,” the
                    arms of De Tony, a maternal ancestor, and so overcame his adversary and retired
                    unknown to his pavilion. On the second day he appeared as the green knight, and
                    bearing “silver, .two bars gules,” the arms of Mauduit of Hanslape, another
                    ancestor, he met a second knight with equal success. On the third day he
                    appeared in his proper person bearing the arms of Guy of Warwick and Beauchamp
                    on his shield, and those of De Tony and Mauduit on his caparisons, and thus with
                    great honour won the third day also.</p>
                <p>The shield, as the most obvious piece of the defensive armour, was that upon
                    which arms were first displayed. The Norman shield was of wood covered with
                    hide, and clamped and stiffened in a fashion which is thought to have given rise
                    to the first simple bearings. It was 3 to 4 feet long, pointed below, and 18
                    inches broad. This shield is common on early monumental effigies armed in chain
                    mail, and it is unusual to find it with armorial bearings. It was succeeded by
                    the small triangular heater shield, and that, in the reign of Edward III., by a
                    somewhat larger and full bottomed shield, which by degrees ceased to be used in
                    war, and became more and more an architectural ornament. The arms were also
                    displayed upon the breast-plate, and upon the camise or surcoat that covered the
                    armour, and were repeated upon the housings of horses both before and behind the
                    saddle. When the Comte d’Artois fell at Damietta, the Saracens showed <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> » in triumph his “cotte d’armes toute dorée et
                    fleur-de-lisée.” The emperor Henry of Luxembourg is described in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle of Flanders</hi> as bearing “an aigle noir, sur un
                    tornicle d’or qui pendoit jusq’ a mi-jambe.” Sir Alexander Nevile appeared at
                    Halidon Hill in a surcoat of his own arms, the quarters filled up with the arms
                    of his friends. The fine effigy of William de Valence at Westminster is
                    decorated with small escutcheons of his arms on various parts of his dress and
                    weapons. An actual remnant of the richly embroidered surcoät of William de
                    Fortibus, earl of Albemarle (died 1261), is still preserved, and has been
                    engraved in the <pb break="no"

                    against the embroidery of the surcoat that the severe sumptuary enactments of
                    Richard and Philip Augustus were mainly directed.</p>
                <p>The importance attached to armorial bearings is strongly shown in the uses to
                    which they were applied. A sovereign who wished to assert his claim to a kingdom
                    placed its arms upon his shield. In 1479 when Alphonso of Portugal resigned his
                    claim to Castile, he was required to lay aside its armorial ensigns. It appears
                    that when Edward III. assumed the French lilies, he at first did so simply as
                    representing his mother, who was an heiress, and placed her arms in his second
                    quarter; when, however, he claimed the kingdom of France in her right, he
                    removed the lilies to the first quarter as representing the more important
                    kingdom. A grant of arms at the hand of a sovereign had great value. Among the
                    more solid bribes which Louis XI. bestowed upon the courtiers of Edward IV.
                    occurs a grant of three fleurs-de-lys to a knight of the Croker family. Thus
                    also when Juan de Orbieta captured Francis I. on the Ticino, he was rewarded by
                    a grant of arms from Charles V.,.though of so complex a character as to do
                    little credit to Spanish heraldry. In later times John Gibbon, the heraldic
                    author, having a quarrel with two maiden ladies of his name, obtained a licence
                    to convert the scallops in their common coat into the black balls called
                    ogresses,—a most heraldic revenge.</p>
                <p>Armorial bearings were largely painted, enamelled, and embroidered upon personal
                    ornaments, furniture, and weapons. The sword of Edward, prince of Wales (died
                    1483), is a curious example of this; it bears on its pommel the words “aves
                    fortes” and five shields :—(1) England, (2) the duchy of Cornwall, (3) England
                    and France with a label, (4) Mortimer quartering Ulster, (5) the earldom of
                    Chester. In the middle is the cross of St George. The citizens of London were
                    bound to provide their banner bearer, Lord Fitz Walter, with “a saddle with his
                    arms,” and the seal of one of that family, about 1300, shows the arms upon the
                    back or rest of his war saddle. The seal of Sir Hugh le Despenser (1292) also so
                    shows his arms. Various bequests of plate and furniture with arms occur in the
                    14th century. In 1368 William, Lord Ferrars of Groby, bequeathed his green bed
                    “with his arms thereon, and his furniture bearing the arms of Ferrars and
                    Ufford, impaled.” In 1380 Edward Mortimer devised “à notre tres chier friere
                    John Gilbert, evesque de Hereford, une plate de argent pour espices et enamillés
                    ove les armes de Mortimer en la face.”</p>
                <p>Richard, earl of Arundel, in 1392, bequeathed a canopy of the arms of Arundel and
                    Warren quarterly. In 1399 Eleanor Bohun, duchess of Gloucester, had a psalter
                    with her father’s arms upon the clasps. In the Decorated and Perpendicular
                    styles of architecture shields of arms are common ornaments. Those of
                    benefactors were set up in church windows in glass, and those of a family in
                    their houses. In the Scrope roll is a list of sixty-six churches in which the
                    Scrope arms were set up, and the histories of Dugdale and Burton show us that
                    nearly every church in Warwickshire and Leicestershire had a multitude of arms
                    on its windows. Those still remaining in the east windows of Bristol cathedral
                    are early and good examples of the arms of great barons, Berkeley, Clare, and
                    Warren. They are also seen upon floor tiles of the same period.</p>
                <p>As arms became hereditary, and their use ceased to be confined to the
                    battle-field, but was largely extended to seals and ornaments, it was natural
                    that some notice should be taken of the arms of females, and that the wife’s
                    coat should be combined in some way with that of the husband, especially when
                    she was the last of, and represented, her family. This seems first to have been
                    managed by giving the wife a separate shield. The kings of France so bore the
                    arms of Navarre after the marriage with the heiress of that kingdom. Another
                    very early plan was to form a composite coat. Thus the old coat of Willoughby
                    was fretty, but on their marriage with Bec of Eresby they adopted the coat of
                    Bec, and Sir John Willoughby (13th Edward III.) bears the cross moline of Bec,
                    but the wings of his crest are fretty for Willoughby, and on either side is a
                    buckle taken from the arms of Roscelin, his wife. Rose of Kilravock bore “or, 3
                    water budgets sable,” but on a marriage with the heiress of Chisholm they added
                    “a boar’s head couped gules” from her arms. S.o also Halyburton of Pitcur, who
                    bore “or, on a bend azure 3 lozenges of the field,” after a marriage with
                    another Chisholm heiress, added to their coat “3 boars’heads erased sable.”
                    Bohun, who bore “azure, a bend argent, cotised or, between 6 lioncels rampant of
                    the third,” is thought to have added the bend on the occasion of a marriage with
                    Maud, daughter and heir of Milo, earl of Hereford. As this, however, led to
                    complexity and indistinctness in the bearings, and the introduction of a second
                    shield was obviously inconvenient, the method of impalement was devised, by
                    which the sinister half of the shield was appropriated to the lady’s arms, at
                    first under the process known as dimidiation. When, however, the lady was an
                    heiress, a different plan was adopted which ultimately led to quartering or the
                    marshalling of many coats in one shield, a practice, when pushed to any extent,
                    quite inconsistent with the original use of coat armour. This also led to a
                    corresponding alteration in the shape of the shield, which was expanded to
                    contain the arms of each heiress who had married into the family, together with
                    such other heiresses as her family had previously been allied with, so that when
                    a Percy heiress married a Seymour, she added her heiress ancestors’ arms with
                    her own arms to those of her husband, expanded in a similar fashion by the
                    previous matches of his family. Thus the great shield of a family became a
                    compendium of the family pedigree which, to those who could read its language,
                    conveyed a considerable mass of semi-historical information. The defect of this
                    system was that it only took account of heiresses, and did not provide for the
                    purity of the whole descent, so that under it the children of a man of no birth
                    who married a great heiress, would display all her quarterings, and no account
                    would be taken of the absence of any on his side; and further, if it happened,
                    as was actually the case in the last century with the Rodneys of Rodney-stoke,
                    that a family, though ancient, had never intermarried with an heiress, they
                    could display no quarterings.</p>
                <p>In France and Germany and to some extent in Scotland a far more perfect system
                    was pursued. There the genealogical escutcheon included the arms of every
                    ancestor and ancestress, whether an heiress or not; thus one generation gave two
                    coats, two generations four coats, and so on. “Seize quartiers” gave evidence of

                <p>As the combinations out of which the early coats were formed were limited, it
                    occasionally happened that two persons of the same nation bore the same arms,
                    and this gave rise to disputes which, as matters connected with military
                    discipline, came under the jurisdiction of the earl marshal. One of the earliest
                    of these disputes is mentioned in the roll of Caerlavrock—</p>

                    in 1321, and Sytsylt and Fakenham in 1333, when Sir William Fakenham disputed
                    the arms, “le champ de dise barretz argent et azure, supportez de cinq
                    escocheons sables, chargés ovesque tant de lyons primers rampant incensés
                    gules'” They were adjudged by a commission to Sytsylt. Hugh Maltby and Hamon
                    Beckwith had a similar dispute in 1339. But by far the most celebrated dispute
                    of this nature arose in 1384 between Sir Richard Scrope of Bolton and Sir Robert
                    Grosvenor, for the right to bear the arms “azure, a bend or.” The greatest men
                    in the country, including John of Gaunt, gave testimony on one side or the
                    other, and it was shown that each family had used the coat beyond the memory of
                    man. It was finally adjudged to Scrope, and Grosvenor was directed to bear “les
                    ditz armes ove une pleyne border d’argent.” Grosvenor, however, declined to
                    accept the arms so differenced, and assumed “azure, a garb or,” retaining his
                    colours and marking his connexion with the old earls of Chester. It was proved,
                    incidentally, that an ancestor of Grosvenor’s had granted his coat, with a
                    difference, to William Coton of Coton. It is remarkable that both disputants are
                    still represented in the male line, and continue the arms as then settled. Both
                    families had previously had disputes with other parties, and the Scropes long
                    afterwards had a quarrel with the Stanleys for the right to bear the arms of the
                    Isle of Man. The matter was compromised by Edward IV. The Hastings and Grey de
                    Ruthyn case, which rises to the rank of a tragedy, illustrates still more
                    forcibly the value attached to a coat of arms. On the death, childless, in 1389,
                    of John de Hastings, earl of Pembroke, a dispute arose for his heirship between
                    Reginald Grey, his heir-general, and Edward Hastings, the heir male and of the
                    name, but of the half-blood. A court military decided in favour of Grey. Pending
                    the trial Hastings had ceased to difference his arms as a cadet, and assumed
                    them unbroken. He was, however, ordered to bear them with a label, and for
                    contumacy was imprisoned for sixteen years. A suit for arms was decided as
                    lately as 1720 in Blount <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Blount, in the earl
                    marshal’s court.</p>
                <p>The same necessity that made it important to prevent the use of similar bearings
                    by different families in the same country made it also necessary to distinguish
                    between the bearings of different members of the same family, all of whom had a
                    right to the paternal coat. As this right was strongest in the eldest son he
                    alone bore the paternal arms unaltered (in French heraldry “sans brisure”); and
                    the other sons were obliged to introduce some sufficient change, called in
                    heraldry a “difference.” This was at first managed by inverting the colours or
                    substituting one ordinary or one inferior charge for another, as a bend for a
                    fess, martlets for mullets, and the like; and sometimes by the use of a coat
                    compounded of the paternal bearing with that of an heiress. A multitude of these
                    early differences occur in the rolls of Henry III. and Edward II., and in
                    various early lists of arms. The family of Grey, always numerous, differenced
                    their cadets in at least fourteen different ways, almost all preserving in some
                    tangible form the paternal coat; and this was also the case with the very
                    numerous family of Basset. Generally no rule is followed, save that on the whole
                    some reference is retained either to the charges upon, or the colours of, the
                    paternal coat. Very frequently, even in the earliest times, the eldest son
                    differenced his father’s coat by a label. In the roll of Henry HI. the label
                    occurs fifteen times, though not always as a difference. Gradually, however, it
                    came to be used almost entirely for that purpose, and finally a set of marks,
                    called of cadency, were devised for each of the sons, the label being the mark
                    of the eldest during his father’s life.</p>
                <p>All these rules and alterations were, however, the growth of a later age, and
                    came into use as the bold and simple heraldry of the 13th and 14th centuries
                    began to be overlaid with florid fancies. So long as heraldry represented a real
                    want, its expressions were simple and intelligible, but as “villainous
                    saltpetre” came into use and closed helmets were laid aside, and as skill and
                    strategy rather than personal valour became the attribute of a leader, armorial
                    bearings fell into disuse in war, and were no longer worn upon the person, or
                    upon the horse trappings. But though armorial bearings ceased to be of actual
                    use, they continued to be emblems of rank and family, and a mark of gentle
                    blood. They became, however, exceedingly and often absurdly complex, partly
                    because simplicity was no longer necessary, and partly because it was scarcely
                    practicable, owing to the enormous increase in the number of the gentry, which
                    produced a demand for new combinations.</p>
                <p>The glories of heraldry reached their zenith in the reign of Richard II., with
                    “youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm” of the vessel of the state, but it
                    was not till the reign of Richard III. that it was thought necessary to place
                    under specific control the whole heraldry of the kingdom; and this, in close
                    imitation of the example of France, was done by the incorporation of the heralds
                    into a college placed under the presidency of the earl marshal.</p>
                <p>The office of the herald as the messenger of war or peace between sovereigns or
                    between contending armies in the field is of far earlier date than the
                    introduction of armorial bearings, but as these came into use they were
                    gradually placed under his charge, and he took his specific name sometimes from
                    that of the noble or leader who employed him, sometimes from one of his castle3
                    or titles of honour, and sometimes from one of his badges or cognizances, which
                    the herald wore embroidered upon his dress and by which he was known. In the
                    pages of Froissart and other chroniclers frequent mention is made of
                    heralds-at-arms and their attendants the pursuivants, and we read of Somerset
                    and York, Windsor, Chester, and Lancaster heralds, Clarencieux, Arundel,
                    Fleur-de-Lys, and Leopard; and of pursuivants, Antelope, Blanch Lion, Falcon,
                    Portcullis,, and many more. At an early period the principal heralds, and
                    especially those attached to sovereigns, were called kings-at-arms, and as early
                    as Edward I. an officer, called from his jurisdiction, Norroy, was placed in
                    charge of the heraldries north of the Trent. It is probable that a herald was
                    always attached to each order of chivalry, as Toison d’or to the Fleece, and
                    Garter to the chief English order. Garter, however, was only officially
                    appointed by Henry V., when he seems to have been recognized as the principal
                    king-at-arms—“Principalis rex armorum Anglicanorum.” At the institution of the
                    college, or soon afterwards, it was decided that its officers should be Garter,
                    principal king-at-arms Norroy and Clarencieux, provincial kings north and south
                    of Trent; six heralds, Windsor, Chester, Lancaster, Richmond, Somerset, and
                    York; and four pursuivants, Rouge Croix, Blue Mantle, Rouge Dragon, and
                    Portcullis; who constitute the present establishment, though some special
                    officers have since been appointed, as a king-at-arms to the revived order of
                    the Bath, and some others, not members of the college.</p>
                <p>It became the duty of the new incorporation to take note of all existing arms, to
                    allow none without authority, and to collect and combine the rules of blazoning
                    into a system. To effect a supervision of the armorial bearings throughout the
                    kingdom, it was necessary to visit the several counties. Such a commission of
                    visitation seems to have been issued by Henry IV. as early as 1412, but the
                    first regular commission acted upon was issued by Henry VIII., 1528-9, and the
                    last early in the reign of James II. The visitations were taken about every
                    thirty years, and for contemporary events are most valuable records. The
                    provincial king, either <pb break="no"

                    of each county in his division, and summoned the surrounding gentry to record
                    their pedigrees, and show a title to their armorial bearings. The earl marshal’s
                    court survived the fall of the house of Stuart, and a few causes relative to a
                    right to particular arms were decided in the course of the last century, but its
                    powers fell into disuse, and not long since it was finally abolished, and with
                    it fell any pretence on the part of the. college to regulate, by compulsory
                    authority, the heraldry of the kingdom. At present, however, notwithstanding the
                    democratic tendencies of the age, armorial bearings are in greater demand than
                    ever in England, and more or less coveted in the United States, and a good deal
                    of the proper business of heraldry is still transacted within the college of
                    arms, and a good deal more, irregularly and improperly, outside it. A
                    considerable number of persons still bear arms derived from an ancestor who bore
                    them before the institution of the college; others bear them under grants and
                    patents from that body; and others still more numerous, who or whose fathers
                    have risen from obscurity, have assumed arms according to their fancy, or under
                    the uninstructed advice of some silversmith or finder of arms. The Smiths, said
                    a distinguished member of the family, had no arms; they sealed their letters
                    with their thumbs. It is to avoid so inconvenient a signet that the new men have
                    recourse to the demi-lions and demi-griffins now so much in vogue, aud possibly
                    because they are not aware that Garter and his colleagues are still willing to
                    grant arms, crest, and motto, on terms within reach of almost every aspirant to
                    chivalry.</p>
                <p>There is no college or corporation of heralds in Scotland or Ireland; but in
                    Scotland heraldry has been to the full as much considered, and at least as well
                    regulated as in England. “Lyon-king at-arms,” “Lyon rex armorum,” or “Leo
                    fecialis,” called from the lion on the royal shield, is the head of the office
                    of arms in Scotland. When first the dignity was constituted is not known, but
                    Lyon was a prominent figure in the coronation of Robert II. in 1371. The office
                    was at first, as in England, attached to the earl marshal, but it has long been
                    conferred by patent under the great seal, and is held direct from the crown.
                    Lyon is also king-at-arms for the national order of the Thistle. He is styled
                    “Lord Lyon,” and the office has always been held by men of family, and
                    frequently by a peer. His powers have been declared by statute, and extend to
                    fine and imprisonment. He is supreme in all matters of heraldry in Scotland.
                    Besides the “Lyon depute,” there are the Scottish heralds, Islay, Rothesay,
                    Marchmount, Albany, Ross, and Snowdown, with precedence according to date of
                    appointment; and six pursuivants, Kintyre, Dingwall, Carrick, Bute, Ormond, and
                    Unicorn. Heralds and pursuivants are appointed by Lyon.</p>
                <p>In Ireland also there is but one king-at-arms, Ulster. The office was instituted
                    by Edward VI. in 1553. The patent is given by Rymer, and refers to certain
                    emoluments as “praedicto officio . . . . ab antiquo spectantibus.” The allusion
                    is to an Ireland king-at-arms mentioned in the reign of Richard II. and
                    superseded by Ulster. Ulster holds office by patent, during pleasure; under him
                    are two heralds, Cork and Dublin; and four pursuivants, Athlone, and St Patrick
                    Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Ulster is king-at-arms to the order of St Patrick. He held
                    visitations in parts of Ireland from 1568 to 1620, and these and other records,
                    including all grants of arms from the institution of the office, are kept in the
                    Birmingham Tower, Dublin, under the charge of the present most courteous and
                    learned Ulster, Sir B. Burke. The precedence of the three chiefs has been the
                    subject of dispute, but is now generally arranged, Garter being followed by
                    Lyon, and he by Ulster.</p>
                <p>Heraldry should be studied with reference to the period in which it was a useful
                    art, and in the simple examples of the 14th and 15th centuries. Before that
                    period it was in a changing and elementary state; after it, it became merely
                    ornamental, and its examples are complicated and debased. In a general treatise
                    on the subject notice must of course be taken of the later as well as the
                    earlier conditions of the art, but the greater number of the illustrations in
                    the following pages are taken from the earlier and best examples.</p>
                <p>A curious evidence of the vitality of heraldry, and of the desire of all mankind
                    for ancestral distinctions, is afforded by its extension among the republics of
                    the New World. The United States boast some excellent genealogical societies,
                    and a great and very general desire is shown by individuals to trace their
                    pedigrees to the stocks of the Old World, and to assume the arms proper to their
                    name. The national emblem of the stars and stripes, now so widely and honourably
                    known throughout the world, has been traced back to the paternal coat of the
                    first and greatest president, George Washington, whose English ancestors bore
                    “argent, 2 bars gules, in chief 3 mullets of the second.” In Canada, Australia,
                    and other English colonies, the assumption of arms by individuals and by the
                    community is not less general; and the republics of South America, of Spanish
                    origin, almost all have adopted coats of arms. The Peak of Teneriffe, the
                    Beaver, the Red Indian, contribute to the list of charges, and the clear
                    firmament of Chili is indicated by a star. “Coupé d’azur sur gules, à une étoile
                    d’argent en abîme.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Divisions of Arms.</hi></p>
                <p>Armorial bearings may be conveniently divided into those of dominion, of a
                    community, of office, of concession, family or paternal arms, and arms of
                    alliance. To these may perhaps be added arms of attribution. There is also
                    another division, or rather peculiarity, called canting arms, of which many of
                    the former divisions present examples.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Arms of Dominion</hi> are those of a kingdom or a feudal
                    lordship. The origin of such arms is often obscure. Those of the Isle of Man are
                    three legs conjoined in triangle at the thigh (fig. 116), probably borrowed from
                    the emblem of Sicily, the ancient Trinacria, found upon Greek vases. The Irish
                    harp is an emblem probably allusive to the instrument of Brian Boroimhe. The
                    origin of the lion of Scotland is also obscure, and of the tressure equally so,
                    though fabled to be</p>
                <p>“First by Achaius borne.”</p>
                <p>Not unfrequently the arms of kingdoms were those of an early sovereign, adopted
                    by succeeding dynasties to the exclusion of their own coat. The lions of England
                    were certainly personal to the Plantagenet kings, if not to Henry I.; but they
                    have become national to the exclusion of the arms of the Tudor, Stuart,
                    Brunswick, and Saxon dynasties, just as neither the arms of Baliol, Bruce, nor
                    Stuart ever became the arms of Scotland. The lion rampant azure, crowned gules,
                    so long borne by the head of the German empire, belonged originally to the house
                    of Hapsburg, and was not used by such of the early emperors as were not members
                    of it; and the bend and alerionsof Lorraine only became a part of the arms of
                    the empire after the marriage of Francis of Lorraine with Maria Theresa. It
                    seems indeed to have been the custom of elected sovereigns, as those of the
                    empire and of Poland, to place their paternal arms on a shield of pretence over
                    those of the dominion. Cromwell so placed his arms over those of the
                    commonwealth, and William of Nassau over those of England, but they disappeared
                    with the individual who introduced them. On the other hand the arms of kingdoms
                    and lordships are sometimes continued to be used as personal arms by the
                    descendants of their former lords. The great shield of Mary of Burgundy quarters
                    the arms of a number of <pb break="no"

                    used the arms of the Honour of Hinkley. Richard de Monthermer (who married the
                    countess of Gloucester, and was, by courtesy, earl of that name) at Caerlavrock,
                    while he bore on his shield his own arms, “or, an eagle displayed vert,” on his
                    banner displayed “or, three chevrons gules” for the earldom. So also Humphrey,
                    duke of Gloucester, (died 1446), used on one of his seals the three fusils of
                    Montacute, because he held lands which belonged to that barony. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Booh of St Albans</hi> says that, if the king grant a lordship to
                    a yeoman entitling him to bear arms, he may. take those of that lordship.</p>
                <p>Under this head may be described the armorial shield of Great Britain (fig. 1).
                    The arms, gules 3 lions passant in pale or, are for England, and are so borne by
                    the kings of England till the reign of Edward III., who in 1340 quartered with
                    them, in the first quarter, the arms of France, azure, semée of fleurs-de-lys
                    or. Thus they continued till the latter part of the reign of Henry IV., when the
                    fleurs-de-lys were reduced to <hi rend="italic">three.</hi> No alteration
                    occurred in the royal achievement during any of the succeeding reigns till the
                    accession of James VI. of Scotland to the throne of England, when that sovereign
                    introduced the royal arms of Scotland into the second quarter, and the arms of
                    Ireland into the third quarter. The royal arms were thus borne by all the
                    monarchs of the house of Stewart till the reign of Anne, though William III.
                    bore over the quarterings of the royal arms those of his Dutch dominions—the
                    house of Nassau. In the reign of Anne a change again took place, occasioned by
                    the union of England and Scotland; and the arms of these kingdoms were impaled
                    in .the first and fourth quarters (England on the dexter, Scotland on the
                    sinister); France was removed to the second; and Ireland retained its former
                    position. On the accession of the house of Brunswick in 1714, the fourth quarter
                    in the royal shield gave place to the arms of his Majesty’s German dominions, an
                    arrangement which continued till 1st January 1801, when, upon the Union of Great
                    Britain and Ireland, the arms of France were excluded, England occupied the
                    first and fourth quarters, Scotland the second quarter, and Ireland its old
                    position in the third quarter; while over all, on an escutcheon of pretence,
                    were placed the arms of Hanover, ensigned with the electoral bonnet, in 1816
                    exchanged for the Hanoverian crown. On the death of William IV. Hanover passed
                    away, and its arms were withdrawn, and the present arrangement introduced. In
                    Scotland, and in Scotch official documents, the Scottish coat is placed in the
                    first quarter. It bears “or, a lion rampant, w ithin a double tressure
                    flory-counterflory, gules.” There is no positive authority for any early coat of
                    arms being used for Ireland, though the bearing “azure, 3 crowns in pale or”
                    granted by Richard III. to De Vere has been so regarded. From the reign of Henry
                    VII., “azure, a harp or, strings argent,” has been regarded as the Irish coat,
                    and as such is inserted into the imperial shield. There is no authority of any
                    standing for a coat of arms for the whole of the principality of Wales, but the
                    coat usually attributed to it is “quarterly azure and gules, 4 lions passant
                    gardant, counterchanged.” The ancient princes of Wales would scarcely have
                    adopted the lions of England. Moreover, this coat was never used by any leading
                    chief in either middle or south Wales.</p>
                <p>In Scotland arms territorial are much recognized. The dukes of Athole quarter
                    Man. The garbs are quartered by the Erskines for the earldom of Bute. When
                    Archibald Douglas was created duke of Touraine, he placed the arms of that
                    duchy, three fleurs-de-lys, on his first quarter, before those of Douglas,
                    Annandale, and Galloway. The dukes of Richmond bear three buckles for the
                    dukedom of Aubigny. “Paly of 6 argent and sable” are the reputed arms of the
                    earldom of Athole, and “a saltire between 4 roses” those of that of Lennox.</p>
                <p>To this head belong arms of pretension, where a sovereign claims <hi
                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> a possession which he no longer holds, and sometimes
                    never held, <hi rend="italic">de facto.</hi> Thus the kings of England from
                    Edward III. to George IΓΓ. bore the French lilies, and claimed to be kings of
                    France, and the kings of Sardinia and Naples used the arms of Cyprus and
                    Jerusalem. In fact, nearly all the older sovereigns of Europe used arms of this
                    character. The armorial shield of the house of Austria at the dissolution of the
                    empire affords a number of curious examples of arms of pretension. Besides
                    Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia, it contained Aragon and Sicily,
                    Brabant, Swabia, Antwerp, Flanders <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Burgund} <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, Naples, Jerusalem, Lombardy, and Milan.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Arms of Commzιnities</hi> are borne by co: porations,
                    religious houses, colleges, cities and boroughs, the cinque ports, guilds, and
                    inns of court, some of which were allowed arms from an early period. These are
                    very generally adopted in honour of some founder, great benefactor, or early and
                    distinguished member of the body. Thus Birmingham bears the arms of the barons
                    of that name, Manchester of the Byrons, Leicester of the Bellomonts, Cardiff of
                    the De Clares. Of religious houses Atherstone bore the arms of Basset; Garendon
                    of the earls of Leicester; Kirby-Bellers of Bellers. Of colleges, Balliol and
                    All Souls at Oxford, and Pembroke and Clare at Cambridge, so commemorate
                    Balliol, Chichele, Valence, and De Clare. The Cinque Ports all bear a part of
                    the arms of England. The arms of the guilds and city companies usually contain
                    some allusion to their trade; those of the grocers are 9 ’ cloves; of the
                    fishmongers, 3 dolphins; of the blacksmiths; 3 hammers. Of the inns of court,
                    the Inner and Middle Temples bear badges of that order; Lincoln’s Inn uses the
                    purple lion of the De Lacys, earls of Lincoln; Furnival·s Inn the bend and
                    martlets of the Barons Furnival. A bishop, as a corporation sole, represents his
                    see and bears its arms. These usually contain some ecclesiastical emblem, keys,
                    crosses, mitres, martyrs’ crowns, or the like. Hereford bears the arms of
                    Cantilupe, possibly from its canonized bishop of that family. The arms of
                    Lichfield and Coventry are founded upon those of Jerusalem; London, Winchester,
                    and Bath and Wells assert their temporal power by bearing swords. The English
                    sees were early provided with arms, but in Scotland they were of very late
                    introduction. Bishops before the 17th century seem <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n723/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0723-0690"/> to have used their personal arms. Thus Gawain
                    Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld,</p>
                <p>“Who gave fair Scotland Virgil’s page,”</p>
                <p>and Alexander Douglas, bishop of Moray in 1606, placed the Douglas arms upon
                    their seals. Sometimes, however, this seems to have been combined with some
                    ecclesiastical emblem, for the archbishops of St Andrews placed the cross of St
                    Andrew on their seals, while below were their paternal arms, and the bishops of
                    Glasgow so bore a figure of St Mungo.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Arms of Office</hi> are not uncommon. The electors and chief
                    officers of the empire each bore some token of their office. The crossed swords
                    so well known on Dresden china were borne by the electors of Saxony; the sceptre
                    by those of Brandenburg; the crown of Charlemagne by the electors of Hanover as
                    arch-treasurers. The ancestors of the dukes of Ormond were hereditary butlers of
                    Ireland, and bore three covered cups. The kings-at-arms bear arms of office.
                    Garter, the principal king, bears “argent, a cross gules, on a chief azure a
                    crown or encircled with a garter of the order buckled and nowed between a lion
                    of England and a lily of France,” by no means such an example of heraldry as
                    might be expected from the chief herald of England. The knights of St John of
                    Jerusalem augmented their paternal arms with a chief gules, charged with a cross
                    or. Several civic offices in France gave a right to bear arms. Ménage observed
                    of a mayor of Angers who died upon his election, and was buried with his newly
                    acquired arms—</p>
                <p>“Il étoit de bonne nature,</p>
                <p>Et ne fut armé qu’en peinture.”</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Arms of</hi><hi rend="italic">Concession</hi> were granted
                    by a sovereign or some feudal superior, sometimes in memory of some great deed,
                    but more frequently to indicate the connexion between the lord and his follower,
                    when they are called arms of patronage. Of the former character was the heart in
                    the arms of Douglas, first used by William I., earl of Douglas, 1356, in memory
                    of James Lord Douglas’s mission with Robert Bruce’s heart; and to this a crown
                    was added in the time of William II., earl of Angus, in 1617. Also the families
                    of De la Warr, Pelham, Vane, and Fane bear arms in allusion to the share of the
                    ancestors of each in the capture of John of France at Poitiers. Sir James
                    Audley, after Poitiers, not only divided the Black Prince’s present between his
                    four squires, but allowed them to bear portions of his coat armour, “gules, a
                    fret or,” in memory of which the family of Delves still bear “argent, a chevron
                    gules, fretty or, between 3 billets sable” (fig 82); and that of DuttθD,
                    “quarterly, argent and gules, on the 2d and 3d quarters a fret or.” It was
                    probably in memory of the same event that John Touchet, Lord Audley, granted to
                    John and Thomas MackworLh, for services performed by their ancestors and
                    themselves to his ancestors and himself, to bear “party dentelle de sable et d’
                    hermines, un chevron de gules fretté d’or,”—arms still used by the Mackworths,
                    with a slight addition, and now blazoned “per pale indented sable and ermine, on
                    a chevron gules 5 crosses pâtée or.” Among many similar instances may be
                    mentioned Tatton of Cheshire, who bears “quarterly argent and gules,” evidently
                    derived from Massy. Harvey of Ickworth bears “gules, on a bend argent 3 trefoils
                    slipped vert,” derived from Foliot, who bore “gules, a bend argent.” Staunton of
                    Longbridge, who held by the service of repairing a tower of Belvoir Castle, bore
                    “argent, 2 chevrons within a border engrailed sable,” derived from Albini of
                    Belvoir, who bore “or, 2 chevronsand a border gules.” Lowther and Musgrave
                    derive their annulets from Vipont. Moton of Peckleton, Brailsford, Astley of
                    Hillmorton, Besington, bore “argent, a cinquefoil azure;” “or, a cinquefoil
                    sable;” “azure, a cinquefoil ermine;” and “azure, a cinquefoil or,” all derived
                    from the bearings of the Bellomont3, “gules, a cinquefoil ermine.” Hardress, who
                    held under De Clare at Tonbridge, bore “gules, a lion rampant debruised by a
                    chevron or;” and the lords of Avan, Welsh barons under De Clare, bore the three
                    chevrons. Thus also Flamville and Wharton used the mauuch of Hastings. “Ermine
                    and checquy,” from the Newburgh earls, were common in Warwickshire, and the
                    “canton” in Westmoreland, derived from the Lancasters, barons of Kendal. · In
                    Douglasdale the “stars” of Douglas preponderate, and in Annandale the
                    “saltire”.of Johnstone.</p>
                <p>Arms also passed from one friend to another by deed or will, even when there was
                    no blood relationship. Henry de Lacy, the last earl of Lincoln, bequeathed to
                    his friend and executor Sir H. Scrope a lion passant purpure, in augmentation of
                    his coat, and Sir Henry wore it accordingly, though for life only. Maud Lucy,
                    heiress of her brother Anthony Lord Lucy of Cockermouth, married Henry Percy,
                    earl of Northumberland, 1414. She died childless, but bequeathed her lands to
                    the Percys on condition they bore her arms, “gules 3 luces,” quarterly with
                    Percy, which they continued to do, and indeed, though without any right, often
                    styled themselves Barons Lucy. To this class also belong arms of augmentation,
                    sometimes called additions of honour. Thus Richard II. chose to impale with his
                    own the imputed arms of the Confessor, “gules, a cross patonce between 5
                    martlets or,” and he granted to Thomas Holland, duke of Surrey, to impale them
                    within a border argent with his own arms. Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, was
                    also allowed to impale the entire arms of the Confessor, a fatal gift, as it was
                    one of the charges brought against his ambitious descendant Henry Howard.
                    Richard also allowed De Vere, duke of Ireland, to bear for life “azure, 3 golden
                    crowns within a bordure,” which seems then to have been regarded as the arms of
                    Ireland. They are found on tiles marshalled quarterly with De Vere. After the
                    victory of Flodden, Henry VIII. granted to the earl of Surrey to augment his
                    arms with a “demi-lion gules pierced through the mouth withan arrow, within·a
                    double fressure flowered of the same,” to be placed on the Howard bend. Henry
                    used both the pile and the flaunch in his augmentations to the families of his
                    English wives. Seymour bore “quarterly, 1 and 4, or, on a pile gules between 6
                    fleurs-de-lys azure 3 lions of England; 2 and 3, Seymour.” The augmentation to
                    Catherine Howard includes 2 flaunches, that to Catherine Parr a pale. Manners of
                    Belvoir bore “or, 2 bars argent, a chief quarterly azure and gules, in the 1st
                    and 4th quarter 2 fleurs-de-lys, in the 2d and 3d a lion of England, or.” The
                    bars were no doubt taken from the Muschamps. The chief and its contents were an
                    augmentation from Henry VIII.</p>
                <p>In Scotland an early Lord Seton had a concession from Robert Bruce of a sword
                    supporting a crown, and his descendant in 1601 received as an augmentation
                    “azure, a blazing star of 8 points within a double fressure or.”</p>
                <p>Most of the earlier grants or concessions seem intended to commemorate some
                    territorial or genealogical concession, those of later date some connexion with
                    royalty, or some deed of arms in the field. Thus Sir Cloudesly Shovel received 2
                    fleurs-de-lys in chief and a crescent in base in memory of two victories over
                    the French and one over the Turks, and Nelson and other naval commanders
                    received additions rather to be described as sea pieces than as heraldic
                    augmentations.</p>

                    their arms. This rule has indeed been much abused, and on every side are seen

                    are of very various dates and origin. There seem, however, always to have
                    existed certain recognized rules which the earl marshal had power to enforce.
                    One of the most important of these was that no two persons in the same kingdom
                    should bear the same arms, a practice clearly subversive of the main use of such
                    insignia. Many were the disputes and challenges that arose out of this
                    regulation, of which two of the most remarkable have already been mentioned.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Arms of Alliance</hi> or heirship were used when those of a
                    great heiress were allowed to supersede the paternal coat. Thus the heiress of
                    Mandeville, earl of Essex, married Say, and their heiress, Beatrice de Say,
                    married Geoffrey Fitz Piers. Geoffrey (died 14 John) became earl of Essex, and
                    their descendants took the name and bore the arms of Mandeville exclusively.
                    William II., earl Warren (died 1148), left a daughter and heiress Isabel, who
                    married Hamelin, natural son of Geoffrey of Anjou and brother to Henry II. He
                    became earl of Surrey, and bore the name and arms and continued the line of
                    Warren. The De la Bisse family, who claimed to descend from the male stock of
                    the De Clares, bore the 3 chevrons differenced with a label of 3 points, though
                    when, in the reign of Richard II., they intermarried with the Staffords, they
                    laid this aside, and adopted “a chevron between three roses.” When Gilbert
                    Talbot (died 1274) married Gwenllian, or Gwendoline, the heiress of the Welsh
                    prince Rhys ap Griffith, he laid aside his paternal coat, “bendy of 10 pieces,
                    argent and gules,” and adopted that of the lady, “gules, a lion rampant or,
                    within a border engrailed of the field,” as still used by the earls of
                    Shrewsbury.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Arms of Attribution</hi> are altogether fictitious, and such
                    as the heralds of the 15th and 16th centuries indulged in to an absurd extent,
                    providing every hero of antiquity with a coat of arms. The same age that
                    represented the Virgin Mary as versed in the canon law declared that Solomon, us
                    the wisest of men, must have been a good herald, and described the armorial
                    bearings of Achilles and Hector. Perhaps the most extravagant example of this
                    fashion is contained in the work of Dame Juliana Berners, who says: “Of the
                    offspring of the gentielman Japhet, comes Habre-ham, Moyses, Aron, and the
                    profetys, and also the kyng of the right lyne of Mary, of whom the gentilman
                    Jhesus was borne, very God and man; after his manhode King of the londe of Jude,
                    and of Jues, gentilman by is modre Mary, prynce of coat armure and again, “The
                    four doctors of holy chirch, Seynt Jeromy, Ambrose, Augustyn, and Gregori, war
                    gentilmen of blode and of cotarmures.” At an earlier period, in the reign of
                    Richard II., it was believed that many of the bearings in use had been borne
                    ever since the Conquest, as appears from the evidence in the Scrope and
                    Grosvenor controversy. Almost all the older genealogists attribute coats of arms
                    to ancestors long before they were in use. On the tomb of Queen Elizabeth are
                    emblazoned the arms of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, and of
                    Henry I. and Matilda of Scotland, all of course pure inventions. It is only of
                    very late years, since a critical spirit has found its way even into heraldry,
                    that these absurdities have been exposed.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Canting Arms,</hi> the “armes parlantes” of French heraldry,
                    are common to all the preceding classes of arms, and most common in those of the
                    earliest date. Such were the castle and lion for Castile and Leon, the fers de
                    cheval of Ferrers, the lion (löwe) of Louvaine, the luces of Lucy, the
                    sharp-pointed row of fusils of Montacute, the corbeau or raven of Corbet, the
                    herons of Heron, the falcon of Falconer, the greyhounds (levriers) of
                    Mauleverer, the barnacles of Bernak, the castle of Chastil, the swine’s head of
                    Swinbourne, the penfeathers of Coupenne, the hirondelles of Arundel, the
                    storm-finches of Tempest, the hammers of</p>
                <p>Hamerton, the tyrwhits of Tyrwhitt, the hanks of cotton of Cotton, the fusils of
                    Trefusis, the oxen of Oxenden, the fer de moline of Molyneux, the hazel leaves
                    of Hazlerigge, the Danish axes of Hakluyt, the bozons or bird bolts of
                    Bol-tesham and Bozon, the bend wavy of Wallop, or Well-hope, the whelk-shell of
                    Shelley, and many more, mostly early coats, and borne by considerable persons
                    and families. In fact the practice was introduced whenever the name admitted of
                    it, and sometimes when the allusion is very farfetched indeed, as in the boar
                    pig “verres,” the crest of De Vere, and the cock for Law, alluding to his cry,
                    cock-a-leary-law! Canting arms were equally common in other countries. In Italy
                    the Colonne, Frangipani, and Ursini families bore a column, a piece of broken
                    bread, and a bear. They were also common in France, Spain, and Germany.</p>

                    but more probably from <hi rend="italic">gula,</hi> “the throat.” The other
                    terms are French. To the older colours have been added “sanguine” and “tenné” or
                    tawny, a compound of red and yellow. They are almost unknown in English
                    heraldry, and are symbolized, the one by sardonyx and dragon’s tail, and the
                    other by jacinth and dragon’s head. The blazoning by precious stones and
                    planets, and even by the virtues, was a foolish fancy of the heraldic writers of
                    the 16th century, and applied to the arms of peers and princes. Gwillim
                    condescends to use it.</p>
                <p>A shield is rarely of one tincture only. In the roll of Caerlavrock, however, Sir

                <p>“La banière eut toute rougeate,”</p>
                <p>The original bearing of the Gournays of Norfolk seems to have been sable. De
                    Barge of Lorraine bore “azure.” The Captai de Buch, who figures in Froissart as
                    a Guyenne knight, bore “or,” and Boguet, a Norman knight, bore “argent.”</p>
                <p>The furs (fig. 2) are all supposed to be formed of the skins of small animals
                    fastened together. Ermine and vair were long the only furs acknowledged, and
                    even now the rest are not common. Ermine (a) represents the skin of the animal
                    of that name, and is white powdered with black spots.</p>
                <p>In vair (δ) the skins in shape resemble small escutcheons, the wings representing
                    the forelegs and the point the tail. The fur is that of a sort of squirrel,
                    bluish-grey on the back and white on the belly, and thence called “varus.” The
                    skins are arranged alternately argent and azure; and if of other colours they
                    must be specified. There are varieties of vairs, as vair-en-point<pb break="no"

                    opposite to the base of that below; counter-vair (7&lt;), where those of the
                    same colour are placed base to base and point to point. At first the vair was
                    drawn bell shaped <hi rend="italic">(e).</hi></p>
                <p>In ermines (c) the field is sable and the spots white, in eπninois <hi
                    rend="italic">(d)</hi> the field or and the spots sable; pean (∕) is the
                    reverse, having golden spots on a black field. Erminites resembles ermine, save
                    that the two lateral hairs of each spot are red. This fur, however, is seldom if
                    ever used in English heraldry. Guillim in blazoning a fur prefixed the word
                    “purfled.”</p>
                <p>Potent <hi rend="italic">(i)</hi> is a variety of vair, and often blazoned as
                    “vair-potent.” There is also a form of it called “potentcounter-potent” <hi
                    rend="italic">(fh</hi> Manchester, of the county of Stafford, bore
                    “potent-counter-potent, argent and sable, a bend gules.” The escutcheons or
                    skins are T-shaped, and resemble a “potence,” that is, a gallows or a crutch
                    head.</p>
                <p>Ermine and vair are used almost to the exclusion of all other furs. Even erminois
                    is very rare.</p>
                <p>• The dukes of Britanny, earls of Richmond, bore “ermine” (this was the coat of
                    John de Montfort, duke of Britanny, whose widow married Henry IV.); Lattin, “per
                    pale argent and sable, a saltire engrailed ermines and ermine Beauchamp (old),
                    “vair, a label gules Gresley of Drakelow, “vair, ermine and gules Calvert, “paly
                    of 6 erminois and pean, a bend engrailed counterchanged.”</p>
                <p>Of the colours, gules, azure, and sable are by far the most common in early
                    bearings. They contrasted strongly with each other and with the metals. To
                    preserve this contrast, arose the very early and general rule not to place metal
                    upon metal, or colour upon colour. Scott takes the licence of a poet to break
                    this rule in <hi rend="italic">Harmion,</hi> whose falcon “Soar’d sable on an
                    azure field,”</p>
                <p>and in <hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe,</hi> where the black knight bears “a fetterlock
                    and shakle bolt azure, on a field sable.” He pleasantly defended himself by
                    quoting the arms of the kingdom of Jerusalem, “argent, a cross potent between
                    four crosses, all or,” which thus violates this fundamental canon. The French
                    call such coats “armés à engueris.” There are a few other less illustrious but
                    early instances.</p>
                <p>Venour, warden of the Fleet, 1480, bore gules on a fess sable, five escallops or,
                    2, 2, 1.</p>
                <p>Leycester of De Tabley: azure, a fess gules between three fleurs-de-lys or.</p>

                    lioncels d’argent, a une fesse de gules.”</p>
                <p>When an object is given of its natural colour it is blazoned as “proper.” Thus in
                    the insignia of the order of St George and St Michael we have “the archangel
                    encountering Satan, all proper;” though the German family of Teufel displays a
                    teufel or devil gules. A very striking contrast of colour is produced by a
                    process called “counterchanging,” where a shield is divided between two colours,
                    and a charge placed over the dividing line is also divided between the same
                    colours transposed.</p>

                    counterchanged.</p>
                <p>A very convenient practice of representing the tinctures by certain marks and
                    lines arose in the 16th century, and is attributed to Padre Silvestre de Petro
                    Sancto, an Italian. It was devised to allow of the representation of armorial
                    bearings in drawings or engravings where it was inconvenient to colour them.
                    Planché states the earliest known instance of the use of this method in England
                    to be in an engraving of the seals of the regicides attached to the death
                    warrant of Charles I. Sir E. Bysshe in Upton, 1654, gives a representation of
                    these marks. Or (fig. 3) is represented by hatched points; silver is plain;
                    azure is represented by horizontal lines, gules by vertical lines; those for
                    purpure are drawn diagonally from sinister to dexter. and those for vert from
                    dexter to sinister, For sable, the lines are vertical and horizontal; for
                    sanguine, diagonal, or in saltire, from right to left and left to right, a
                    compound of purpure and vert; and for tenné, diagonal from sinister to dexter,

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Escutcheon.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Escutcheon,</hi> écu, or shield, called in blazon the
                    field, upon which all lines are drawn and charges delineated, represents the
                    shield borne in war upon which the arms of the knight were displayed. The figure
                    of the shield varied in heraldry as in war. First came the long-pointed,
                    kiteshaped shield or “pavesse,” slightly convex, and used with chain armour. As
                    late as the reign of Richard I. and John such may be seen on early effigies,
                    commonly but by no means always without armorial bearings, which were not then
                    generally -in use (fig. 4). Varieties of this are the heart-shaped or pear
                    shaped shields (fig. 5), and sometimes a shield representing a third part of a
                    cylinder with square top and bottom, much used in siege operations. Early in the
                    13th century was introduced the small heater-shaped shield, also triangular but
                    narrow, short, and somewhat lancet-shaped. This was in use in the reign of Henry
                    III., and in the Early English period of architecture (fig. 6). The three water
                    budgets of Ros appear on a shield of similar form of the date of Edward I. in
                    the Temple Church (fig. 7). As coats of arms were then simple, this shield was
                    large enough to contain them without crowding, and therefore with sufficient
                    distinctness. When drawn or carved in architecture it is suspended by its
                    “guiges” or shield straps, either upright or by the upper sinister angle, when
                    it is said to be “couché.” Fig. 8 is from the great seal of Thomas de Beauchamp,
                    earl of Warwick, and shows the form of shield in use during most of the
                    Edwardian period.</p>
                <p>As fluted and fancy plate armour came into fashion, the shield also altered its
                    figure and became four-sided, and concave in the top and side edges, with a
                    central point below; a notch also was cut in the upper dexter corner to <pb

                    projected from the breastplate, as in the shields upon the tower of the chapel
                    of the Babingtons at Dethick, and on their tombhouse at Kingston (fig. 9). Such
                    shields were called “chancrée,” or “à la bouche.” They are frequently carved as
                    ah ornament in the Perpendicular style of architecture. As the shield ceased to
                    be used in war, and was only known as a representation upon tombs or in
                    pedigrees, it was altered to suit the fashionable practice of introducing large
                    numbers of quartered coats, frequently twenty or thirty, and sometimes a
                    hundred, as in an escutcheon of the earls of Huntingdon in Burnham church.</p>
                <p>In the construction of the shield, while actually used in war, great strength had
                    to be combined with as much lightness as possible, and this was attained by the
                    use of cuir-bouilli and plates of horn stretched upon a wooden frame. The cramps
                    and cross pieces employed to stiffen the whole are sometimes seen upon early
                    shields, and are supposed, with much reason, to have been painted or gilded as
                    ornaments, and to have given rise to the bars or ordinaries which predominate in
                    the first simple coats. Our acquaintance with the forms and fashions of the
                    earlier shields is chiefly derived from their representations on tombs, but the
                    actual shield of John of Gaunt was long preserved in old St Paul’s, and that of
                    the Black Prince still hangs above his tomb at Canterbury, as do those of his
                    father and of Henry V. at Westminster. An unmarried woman did not place her arms
                    upon an escutcheon, but, whether maiden or widow, upon a lozenge, an early
                    practice in a∏usion probably to a fusil or distaff. When married she shared the
                    shield of her husband.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>When an eminent geologist and proprietor of a well-known patent lozenge left
                    his business for the militia, and after a short time returned to civil life, it
                    was said—</p><p>“So maidens who to Hymen yield Exchange the lozenge for the
                    shield, But, when they lose the best of men, Return' to lozenges
                    again."</p></note> The lozenge is an ancient usage, being found in the seals of
                    English ladies of the middle of the 14th century, and in Scotland a century
                    later. In modern heraldry the shields of knights of an order are usually oval or
                    circular, called “cartouche” shields, and encircled with a ribbon bearing the
                    motto of the order. When married the knight’s arms are blazoned alone within the
                    ribbon, and again represented with those of his wife in a second shield
                    encircled with a plain ribbon, and placed on the sinister side of the other. The
                    dexter side of the escutcheon is that on the proper right of the bearer aûd
                    therefore on the left of the spectator.</p>
                <p>To secure due precision in blazoning, nine points, indicated by as many names,
                    are taken on the surface of the shield. These (represented by the letters in
                    fig. 10) are —at the top in a horizontal line three, the middle, dexter, and
                    sinister chief; at the base three, also horizontal, the middle, dexter, and
                    sinister base; and in the central or vertical axis also three, of which the
                    upper is the honour point, the lower t’he nombril point, and the middle the fess
                    point —the central point of the shield. The last three are of course in a line
                    with the chief and base middle points.</p>
                <p>Before passing to the ordinaries, it will be convenient here to mention a species
                    of decoration applied to the shield, which, though not strictly heraldic, is
                    often used in early heraldry and called “diaper.” A shield “diapered,”
                    “bracteatus,” is covered with a ground pattern usually in squares or lozenges
                    with a flower or scroll work in each compartment. The idea is said to be copied
                    and named from the linen cloths of Ypres. An often-quoted example of diaper, and
                    a very good one, is the shield of Robert de Vere upon his tomb at Earls Colne
                    (fig. 4). Also the shield of William de Valence upon his effigy in Westminster
                    Abbey is a very fine example of diaper. There the ground is divided into small
                    squares, and each contains a pattern. The row of shields in the tabernacle work
                    of the old chapel of St Stephen’s, Westminster, exhibits some fine specimens of
                    diapered work in squares, lozenges, and circles. The shield of Earl Warren at
                    Castle Acre Priory is a good example of diaper, as is the counterseal of Thomas
                    le Despenser affixed to a Kenfig charter in 1397 (fig. 11).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ordinaries,</hi> or, as they are called in most heraldic
                    books, “the honourable ordinaries,” have been supposed to represent the clamps
                    or fastenings of the shield, converted into ornaments by painting or gilding.
                    They may be regarded as nine in number—the chief, the pale, the fess, the
                    chevron, the bend, the cross, the saltire, the pile, and the quarter. When
                    charged they are drawn somewhat broader than when blank, and each has one or
                    more diminutives. All were more or less in use in thé earliest times of
                    heraldry, and they were then drawn more boldly and narrower than is now the
                    custom. When such of the ordinaries as admit of it are cut short so as not to
                    reach to the margin of the field, they are said to be humettée or coupée.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Partition Lines,</hi> closely allied to the ordinaries named
                    from them, are the lines by which shields may be divided, and which vary both in
                    direction and pattern. It will be convenient to notice these before proceeding
                    to a detailed account of the ordinaries, as the partition lines will be
                    constantly referred to in the examples. When the field is divided in the
                    direction of an ordinary it is said to be “party per” that ordinary, as party
                    per fess or per bend. Party per chief is rare, party per pile or per quarter urn
                    known; party per cross is called quarterly; party per cross and per saltire is
                    gyronny. When the partition line is mentioned without qualification, it is a
                    straight line, but it may be broken in a variety of ways, as indented, dancette,
                    engrailed, invected, undy, nebuly, embattled, dove-tailed, and raguly. These
                    partition lines in some cases, if not in all, have arisen from the outline of a
                    charge or bearing. Thus Charnels of Snareston at first bore eleven <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0727-0694"/> lozenges conjoined in cross, which at a later
                    date became a cross engrailed, and fusils in the same way became converted into
                    dancette. In English heraldry the partition lines are per pale, per fess, per
                    chevron, per bend dexter and sinister, quarterly, per saltire, and gyronny.</p>
                <p>The annexed shield (fig. 12) represents these partition lines. It may be
                    blazoned—quarterly of nine coats: 1. Butler: or, a chief indented azure; 2.
                    Fleetwood: party per pale nebuly, azure and or, six martlets counter-changed; 3.
                    Vavasour: or, a fess dancette sable; 4. — or, a chevron invected azure; 5.
                    Boyle: party per bend embattled, argent and gules; 6. Trevor: party per bend
                    sinister, ermine and ermines, a lion rampant or; 7. Lawrence: argent, a cross
                    raguly gules; 8. Bottetourt: or, a saltire engraded sable; 9. —party per fess
                    dovetailed, or and sable. A good example of a cross raguly, not an armorial
                    bearing, is found upon a 12th century tomb in the church of
                    Llanfihangel-yn-Gwynfa in Powysland.</p>
                <p>The French use parti and coupé for per pale and per fess; they do not part per
                    chevron, but per bend and per bend sinister are tranché and taillé; quarterly is
                    écartelé, and per saltire écartelé en sautoir; gyronny is gironé. Besides these
                    the French have a number of other divisions, as “tierce,” when the shield is
                    divided into three parts, as “tierce en pal, tierce en fasce, àc. Tierce en pal
                    is convenient when the coats of two wives are to be marshalled on the husband’s
                    shield.</p>
                <p>Formerly such broken lines as were used were not mere margins, but affected the
                    whole ordinary; a fess indented was a zigzag and called a daunce or dancette.
                    This practice is still preserved with the line undy. A bend undy or wavy is not
                    a mere bend with a wavy edge, but the whole bend is in waves, whereas a bend
                    nebuly or raguly has merely a particular kind of edge.</p>
                <p>Returning to the ordinaries, it may be remarked that very many both of these and
                    of the subordinaries in heraldry are very frequent constituents in mouldings in
                    the Norman style of architecture. The chevron and the billet are amongst the
                    most common. The roundel forms the hood moulding of a door at Peterborough, and
                    is inserted in a moulding in the intersecting arches of St Augustin’s,
                    Canterbury. The fret, the billet, and the roundel or pellet are largely used in
                    the oldest parts of Malmesbury, and on Lincoln tower is a good example of
                    undy,—and this before the regular employment of heraldic bearings.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Chief,</hi> chef, caput, is the upper part or head of
                    the shield, covering one-third of it, and parted off by a horizontal line. It is
                    found in the earliest examples of arms. In the roll of Henry III. it occurs
                    fourteen times, in that of Edward II. twenty-one times. T&gt;3 Vivonne: ermine,
                    a chief gules (flg. 13).</p>
                <p>Butler (see flg. 12).</p>
                <p>Aston: argent, a chief undy (fig. 14).</p>
                <p>St John of Melchbourne: argent, on a chief gules, two mullets pierced or (fig.

                    which might also be blazoned as gules, a chief argent, and a bend azure (fig.
                    16).</p>
                <p>Heraldic writers give the <hi rend="italic">fillet</hi> as a diminutive of the
                    chief. It was a narrow strip laid upon the chief; a little above its lower
                    margin. Guillim mentions, but gives no examples of it.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Pale,</hi> pal, palus,, is a vertical strip set upright
                    in the middle line of the shield, and one-third of its breadth. One of its
                    earliest examples, if indeed it be not a mere gilt ornament, is ascribed to
                    Graintmaisnel, baron of Hinkley, who is reported to have borne gules, a pale or;
                    but the banner of the barons of Hinkley carried by Simon de Montfort was per
                    pale indented, gules and or. The “sable pale of Mar” is the well-known bearing
                    of Erskine, argent, a pale sable (fig. 17), but when it was introduced into
                    Scotland is not clear. In the roll of Henry III. there occurs no pale, but there
                    are three examples of paly. Party per pale is also there found. In the roll of
                    Edward II. there is also no pale, but paly or party per pale occurs thirteen
                    times. The latter is called simply “party”:— Pluys, “party d’or et goules. *</p>
                <p>The diminutives of the pale are the <hi rend="italic">pallet,</hi> one-fourth,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">endorse,</hi> one-eighth, of the breadth of the pale,
                    both unknown anciently. The pallet may be used singly, the endorse only in

                    across the middle of the field. It occurs about twenty-five times in the roll of
                    Henry III., and its diminutives about twenty-three times, or fortyeight times in
                    all, against ninety in the roll of Edward II.</p>

                    pairs only, usually called <hi rend="italic">gemelles,</hi> and these are
                    sometimes quadrupled, two pairs on each side, and sometime» are used without the
                    bend between them. The bar is rarely used singly, the number must be specified
                    if above four, when the coat is ’ ‘ barry” of the given number. The term fessy
                    is not used. Harcourt of Ankerwyke: gules, two bars or.</p>

                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Chevron,</hi> chevcron, canterius, from whatever sôurce
                    derived,, seems to have been named from its resemblance to the main rafters or
                    principals of a roof, a familiar sight in early buildings. It is common to find
                    orders on the royal foresters for so many pairs of chevrons. Mr Planché points
                    out that in the earliest English examples of this ordinary, in the seal of
                    Gilbert, earl of Pembroke, in the reign of Stephen, the upper edge of the shield
                    is pointed like a ridged roof, and the chevrons are parallel to it, and divide
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0728-0695"/> shield into thirteen spaces. He regards as a part
                    of the structure of the shield these chevrons, afterwards reduced to three and
                    used as a regular heraldic bearing by the house of Clare. The chevron occurs six
                    times in the roll of Henry III., and the chevronel, its diminutive, nine times.
                    The two occur ninety-two times in the roll of Edward 11. In breadth it is
                    one-fifth of the shield. Its diminutives are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chevronel</hi> or étage, of half, and the <hi rend="italic">couple-close,</hi>
                    of a quarter its breadth. The latter is borne in pairs above and below the
                    chevron. When the chevron is repeated up to three they may be chevrons or
                    chevronels. If exceeding that number the bearing is chevronny, unless the number
                    be specified. The chev!,.n is still used to denote the rank ot the
                    non-commissioned officers of the British army, but of late years has been borne
                    by them inverted.</p>

                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Bend,</hi> bande, balteum, is a strip extended upon the
                    shield from the dexter chief to sinister base, and in breadth one-fifth of the
                    field. The diminutives are the <hi rend="italic">bendlet,</hi> half the bend,

                    bend. The ribbon is used as a difference, and is sometimes couped or cut short,
                    when it becomes a <hi rend="italic">bâton,</hi> and is the French barre. The
                    bâton often marks illegitimacy. The term bâton, however, is also applied to the

                    in heraldry it is usually the Greek cross, or that of equal arms. The breadth is
                    one-third of the shield. It is an early and very common bearing, and whatever
                    its originit speedily became identified with the emblem of Christianity, and was
                    popular throughout Christendom—</p>
                <p>“Crux mihi certa salus, crux est quam semper adoro, Crux domini mecum, crux mihi

                <p>When plain it is blazoned only as “a cross.” Thus the cross of St George is
                    “argent, a cross gules,” and the statutes of the Temple direct each knight to
                    wear a red cross upon his “cotte d’armes,” on breast and back. Asa plain cross
                    it occurs six times in the roll of Henry III., and in its varieties eleven
                    times, and in the roll of Edward II. these numbers have risen from 17.to 102,
                    when it was the most popular of the ordinaries.</p>

                    form of the Ufford coat. There is'also a mullet in dexter canton, possibly to
                    mark a younger branch.</p>

                    quarter-pierced, a cross quarter-pierced.</p>
                <p>The varieties of the cross are almost innumerable. Edmondson gives 107 of them,
                    and there are many more. Of these it will be sufficient to notice those
                    comparatively few that are older and in general use; as the cross botonny, the
                    cross crosslet, the cross flory, moline, pâtée, patonce, potent, receτcelee, and
                    voided. None of these varieties extended to the margin of the field. When a
                    plain cross does not so extend it is blazoned as couped or humetty.</p>
                <p>The cross botonny, treflée, or modulata has each limb capped by a trefoil, or
                    sort of button.</p>
                <p>Northcote of Pynes: argent, three crosses botonny sable, palewise in bend (fig.

                <p>The cross crosslet has its extremities crossed. It is usually borne as a charge
                    in numbers, but not always.</p>

                    argent, a cross pâtée fitchy sable (fig. 47).</p>
                <p>The cross pâtée was the emblem of the Knights of St John, and is known as the
                    “Croix de Malthe.” Thθ cross patonce has expanded ends like the cross pâtée, but
                    each terminates in three points. Pâtée and patonce were not always
                    distinguished. At <pb break="no"

                    of the upper millstone. When the millrind itself is borne it is pierced, but the
                    cross moline is not necessarily so. Its extremities are split, curved outwards,
                    and cut off square. It is an early bearing. When pierced this must be
                    specified.</p>

                <p>An early example is seen in the arms of Jerusalem, argent, a cross potent between
                    four crosslets or (fig. 51). Originally, however, the arms of the cross ended in
                    knobs like the handles of a pilgrim’s staff, thence called “bourdonnée.”</p>
                <p>The cross recercelée has the ends split and curled outwards, but differs from the
                    cross moline in having them pointed. The two bearings were occasionally
                    confounded, and while the Baron Bee bore a cross moline, Bishop Antony Bee, his
                    brother, is described as bearing a cross recercelée.</p>
                <p>The cross voided is the outline only, called by the French “un croix faux; " the
                    field is seen through it. The cross recercelée is usually also voided.</p>

                    the limbs terminate in anchors; the cross of the crucifixion or of Calvary,
                    mounted on steps. A cross with a narrow border of another colour is

                    of St Andrew, and is a common constituent in Scottish coats of arms. The origin
                    is said to be a sort of stirπιp or crossed loop suspended from the saddle by
                    -the aid of which the knight leaped into his seat. Such a stirrup certainly
                    appears on the steed of Patrick, earl of March, on his seal, and on the seal of
                    an early Despenser, and this is the only suggestion that accounts for the name.
                    The saltire is in breadth one-third of the field.</p>

                    upright. The deanery of Hengham, dedicated to St Andrew, bore on its seal a
                    saltire raguly. The saltire has no regular ^diminutives, but when several are
                    borne they are couped.</p>
                <p>8. The <hi rend="italic">Pile,</hi> pieu, pila, is a triangular strip, its base
                    one-third of the breadth of the shield, and usually applied to its upper margin,
                    the point coinciding with the lower point of the shield. It has been derived
                    from the Roman <hi rend="italic">pilum,</hi> a military weapon, and from the <hi
                    rend="italic">pile</hi> of the engineer. The origin is obscure, but it is a very
                    early bearing. It has no diminutive.</p>
                <p>Sir John Chandos, as Froissart often tells us, bore “d’argent, a ung peel de
                    goules, e un label d’azure” (fig. 57), and his ancestor Robert? <hi
                    rend="italic">temp.</hi> Henry III., bore or, on a pile gules three estoiles,
                    between six of the same, counterchanged, an unusually complicated bearing for
                    that age.</p>
                <p>waterhouse: or, a pile engrailed sable.</p>
                <p>Frequently more piles than one were used, generally three, when they are to be
                    blazoned as meeting in base.</p>
                <p>Holies: ermine, three piles sable meeting in base (fig. 58).</p>
                <p>Hulse: argent, three piles sable, one issuant from the chief between two from the
                    base.</p>
                <p>When the base of the pile is applied to any other part of the shield than the
                    chief it must be specified. The pile was used by Henry VIII. as a vehicle for
                    some of his grants of augmentation.</p>
                <p>9. The <hi rend="italic">Quarter</hi> or franc-quartier covers the upper dexter
                    quarter of the shield. If placed in the sinister quarter, this must be
                    specified. Its diminutive is the <hi rend="italic">canton, of</hi> two-thirds
                    its area. Both are early bearings, but in the roll of Henry III. the quarter
                    appears in several coats which in later rolls are blazoned with the canton. Both
                    are frequently charged. When either occurs in conjunction with another ordinary
                    or subordinary, they are placed above it, and therefore blazoned after it, as
                    further from the field. Both are used as early differences, as in the families
                    of Zouch and Basset, and both are always borne with straight edges. A canton is
                    also called a corner, and a cross between 4 crosses is said to be cantoned of
                    them. De Clare (old): or, a quarter gules (fig. 59).</p>

                    and independent bearing, was frequently used as a difference, and occasionally
                    as a mark of illegitimacy. It is what its name expresses, and its breadth is
                    one-fifth of the field. When used in an impaled coat the border is not continued
                    round the inner side; in fact it is dimidiated. In old examples this was not
                    always attended to. In a quartered coat the border is borne complete.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tressure</hi> is in fact a narrow'orle, almost always home
                    double, and usually flowered. It is a favourite Scottish bearing, and is set
                    with fleurs-de-lys placed alternately, the upper and the lower half on each face
                    of the tressure, when it is blazoned “flory-counterflory.” This, in the Scottish
                    royal arms, is said to denote the early alliance between that country and
                    France. The bearing is, or, a lion rampant within a double tressure,
                    flory-counterflory, gules (fig. 67). The tressure was a common grant of
                    augmentation from the crown for services or in memory of an alliance. Scott of
                    Thirlstane had it from James V. and bore or, a bend azure, charged with a mullet

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fret</hi> was originally borne fretty, representing a
                    trellis. The single fret is very rare in ancient arms, but many of those
                    families who at first bore fretty afterwards bore a fret. Fretty is usually
                    composed of eight pieces.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gyron,</hi> also an old bearing, is the lower half of a
                    quarter divided diagonally. It is a Spanish ordinary, and said to come from
                    “giron,” a gusset. It is seldom borne singly, and usually is gyronny, when the
                    shield is divided per pale, per fess, per bend dexter, and per bend sinister
                    into eight sections. If more, the number must be specified. In the earliest
                    examples the divisions are twelve. Bassin⅛boume: gyronny of twelve, or and

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Flasque,</hi> or flaunch, is the segment of a circle taken
                    out of the two sides or flanks of the shield, the margin of which forms the
                    chord. They are always used in pairs, one on each side. This bearing is not of
                    great antiquity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Voider,</hi> the diminutive of the flasque, has a flatter
                    curve. The voider in defensive armour was a gusset-piece either of plate or of
                    mail, used to cover a void or unprotected space at the elbow or knee joints.</p>

                    division of the field known as <hi rend="italic">checquy,</hi> where the field
                    is divided into small squares like a chess-board. Their number is not specified,
                    but usually is made up of seven squares in a line, and in depth according to the
                    length of the shield. Hugh, earl of Vermandois, is said to have borne checquy,
                    or and azure, and as his daughter married Warren, it is possible that the earls
                    of Surrey thence derived their well-known coat, warren: checquy, or and azure

                <p>Next to the purely heraldic figures connected with the shield and their
                    diminutives and subordinaries, come those imported into heraldry as charges from
                    all quarters, including an immense variety of objects, natural and artificial,
                    beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles and insects, flowers, and the fruits of the
                    field, chimaeras, astronomical and celestial figures, man and his parts, arms
                    and armour, implements of war and the chase, ships, articles of dress, and a
                    miscellaneous budget far too heavy to enumerate.</p>
                <p>The rules for the placing of these charges are simple. If single, they stand in
                    the centre of the shield; if two, in pale, or one over the other; if three, 2
                    and 1; if the number is longer the order must be specified (see fig. 85). The
                    French carry the unexpressed understanding much further. With them, four pieces
                    are placed 2 and 2; five pieces, in saltire; six are 3,2,1; seven are 3,3,1;
                    eight are in orle; and nine are 3,3,3.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Animals.</hi></p>
                <p>The following rales are applicable to the blazoning of animals. Generally, unless
                    otherwise specified, they are shown in profile. looking towards the dexter side;
                    when to the sinister, the word counter is prefixed, “a lion counter-passant.”
                    Animals back to back are “addorsed”; face to face, “confrontée”; facing the
                    spectator, “gardant,” or “affrontée”; looking back, “regardant”; when rising out
                    of the edge of an ordinary, “issuant;” when out of the middle of it, ‘ ‘
                    naissant.” When the claws, horns, tongues, hoofs, or mane are shown of a special
                    colour, the animal is “armed,” “corned,” “langued” or “lampassé,” “ungued,”
                    or“crined.” Sometimes he is crowned royally or ducally, sometimes “collared,”
                    “gorged,” or “accollée.” When wounded he is “vulned.”</p>
                <p>When of its natural colour an animal is “proper,” but it maybe of any metal,
                    colour, or fur, and divided by any partition lines. When a head or member is
                    torιι off it is “erased.” When cut off “couped.” When men are clothed, they are
                    “habited”; when nude, they are “salvage.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrupeds.</hi> —Of these the <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi>
                    is by far the most popular, nor is his popularity confined to England. He
                    appears not only in the British arms, but in those of Spain, Holland, Denmark,
                    Bohemia, and Saxony, and many lesser states. Of Edward II.’s 918 bannerets, 225
                    bear lions in some form or other. The favourite attitude is rampant, but he may
                    be passant, saliant, statant, sejant, couchant, or dormant. About thirty
                    varieties of attitude are enumerated by writers; but most are rarely if ever
                    used, and indeed it is seldom the lion is other than rampant or passant.
                    Sometimes he is borne “demi,” especially as a crest. His paws or jambs are also
                    borae, and his tail. In one or two well-knoλvn instances on the Continent he is
                    “déhaché,” that is, his head and paws and the tuft of his tail are cut off. When
                    a member is borne upright, it is “erected.” As a set off to this dismemberment,
                    in early rolls the lion is sometimes represented as two-tailed, or “queue
                    furchée,” and there are examples of bicorporate and tricorporate lions, though
                    not many. When above three lions are shown, they become lioncels or lions’
                    whelps, unless otheιwise specified.</p>
                <p>It has been shown that as early as 1127 Henry I. used the lion as an ornament
                    upon the shield he gave to his son-in-law, who bore those animals upon his
                    brodekins, as did the early French kings the fleur-de-lys. Mr Planché has
                    investigated this early use of the lion by Henry with great acuteness. A
                    prophecy of Merlin, held to apply to that king, designated him as the Lion of
                    Justice; his favourite residence and death-place was in the forest of Leon or
                    Lyons in Normandy; his wife Adeliza was a daughter of Godfrey, duke of Louvain
                    or Lowen, a name which certainly gave rise to the lion as the arms of that
                    family.</p>
                <p>William, earl of Gloucester, Henry’s grandson, sealed with a lion. Richard de
                    Redvers, earl of Devon, who married a granddaughter of Henry, also bore a lion,
                    as did Ranulph, earl of Chester, who married another grandchild. William d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Albini who married Henry’s widow, used the same
                    animal. All this occurred at a period when armorial bearings were by no means an
                    established institution, and when every great noble was taking it up, and quite
                    open to assume a bearing. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that to
                    Henry I. was due the introduction of the lion into English heraldry. It has been
                    seen that under Richard and John the lions became the settled arms of England,
                    and this will account for the general adoption of the royal beast in English
                    coats of arms. In heraldry a “lion passant gardant or” is always blazoned as “a
                    lion of England.”</p>
                <p>The identity of the lion of England with the leopard has been the subject of much
                    controversy, and when Napoleon talked of driving the leopards into the sea he
                    evidently used the word in disparagement of our national bearing. The early
                    heralds, who probably were not zoologists, seemed to have confounded the lion
                    with the leopard, and to have used the names according to the attitude of the
                    animal. When rampant he was a lion, when in any other attitude, as passant, he
                    was leo-pardé or a lion-as-a-leopard, but never drawn spotted like a real
                    leopard. As the lion came more generally into use, and was borne in various
                    attitudes, the allusion to the leopard was gradually dropped, though as late as
                    the reign of Edward III. and Richard II. the royal crest was described as a
                    leopard, and Henry V. had a Leopard herald. Among the greater barons of the 13th
                    and 14th century, the lion was borne by the earls of Arundel, Cornwall, Devon,
                    Hereford, Leicester, Lincoln, the Earl Marshal and the earl of Salisbury, as
                    well as by scores of the lesser barons or knights. Sir Tristem, the knight of
                    lionesse, bore a lion when</p>

                    “attires;” a pair of attires attached to a fragment of the skull bone forms ‘ ’
                    a massacre.” The head is usually borne full-faced, when it is said to be

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> —The bird of heraldry before all others is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eagle,</hi> the symbol of the fourth evangelist. Its earliest
                    and chief popularity was in Germany, where it was adopted by the empire and by
                    many of the principal sovereign princes.</p>
                <p>It appears but twice in the roll of Henry III., but after his brother Richard,
                    earl of Cornwall, became king of the Romans, he adopted the eagle, which on that
                    account was to be seen in all the armorial glass of the midland churches, and
                    was widely copied in private coats of arms. His son Edmund, while bearing
                    “Cornwall’’ for his arms, suspended his shield from the beak, and placed it on
                    the breast of an eagle in reference to his father’s rank. In the roll of Edward
                    II. there are forty-three examples of eagles.</p>
                <p>The nobles of the old Holy Roman empire place their shields upon the breast of an
                    eagle, as may be seen in England in the insignia of the duke of Marlborough as a
                    prince, and of the earl of Denbigh and Lord Arundel of Wardour as counts, of
                    that empire.</p>
                <p>The imperial eagle is always represented with two heads, the origin of which is
                    obscure. The emperor Frederick II. on his contemporary shield in Westminster
                    Abbey has a single-headed eagle. The second head is supposed to have been
                    produced by the dimidiation of two coats, each an eagle, but this is scarcely
                    probable. The eagle of the house of Brandenburg has hut one head. Some of the
                    North Wales gentry, headed by Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, place their shields upon
                    the breast of an eagle, single-headed, and the practice is not unknown in
                    Scotland. The seal of the widow of one of the Warwickshire Harpurs in the time
                    of Edward 11, gives an eagle, and in his two claws shields of her husband’s arms
                    and her own.</p>
                <p>Besides the eagles of Austria, Brandenburg, Russia, imperial France, and the
                    United States, the bird was the emblem of Este, Bohemia, and Moravia, of many of
                    the German, Italian, and French nobles, and of many very ancient English and
                    Scottish names, as Monthermer, Bedingfield, Biddulph, Glyn, Weston, in England,
                    and Ramsay, Maxwell, and Carnegie, in Scotland. The great financiers Rothschild
                    use an eagle for their arms.</p>
                <p>The eagle is always shown “displayed,” that is, upright, with his breast to the
                    front, and his legs, tail, and wings expanded,—what is commonly known as a
                    spread eagle.</p>
                <p>When the beaks and talons of birds of prey are specified, they are said to be
                    beaked and armed. In the roll of Henry III., Sir Dru de Barenton bore sable,
                    three eagles or, and his descendents in the reign of Edward II. had. increased
                    the number to six and gave them argent. Piers Gaveston bore six eagles upon his
                    shield and horse furniture.</p>
                <p>Peter, earl of Richmond and Savoy, who built the Savoy Palace in 1250, and was
                    uncle of Eleanor, queen of Henry III., on the shield of his monumental effigy at
                    Aqua Bella bears an eagle for Savoy. The cross, the later arms of that house,
                    appears on the pommel of his sword. Long before this, about 1142, when Mathieu
                    de Montmorenci married Adela of Savoy, he added four alerions or eaglets to his
                    arms, probably in compliment to his wife, who bore an eagle displayed; and
                    certainly in 1206 the acknowledged arms of the house of Savoy were an eagle.</p>
                <p>Parts of birds, especially of eagles, are borne, as the head, wings, legs, and
                    feathers. When feathers are used, and the quill is of a special colour, they are
                    said to be quilled. When a bird is leaving the ground it is “rising,” when on
                    the wing it is “au vol,” when the wings are down it is “closed,” when open
                    “disclosed.” Bedingfeld of Oxburgh: ermine, an eagle displayed barry argent and
                    gules («g. 104).</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ealcon,</hi> as an accessory to field sports, was much
                    esteemed, and is often borne in heraldry. It is also called a gerfalcon,
                    peregrine falcon, and tiercelet. The falcon is usually borne with the jesses or
                    leather thongs about its legs, sometimes with a hood and bells. It is then
                    jessed, hooded, and belled. When feeding it is “atprey.’’ The lure was a bunch
                    of feathers towards which the bird was taught to return. On the seal of Alice,
                    countess of Eu (1234-42), she bears on her hand a falcon with its jesses
                    pendant. It was the custom to slip over the claws of the young birds a silver
                    ring, which could not afterwards be removed. Two such rings were found at Castle
                    Hedingham, the seat of the De Veres, engraved “Ox-en-forde.” One of gold found
                    at Biggleswade bore “Sum regis Angliae,’’ and within the ring “et comitis
                    Herfordiae.” However well trained, these birds were always liable to prove
                    riflers, that is, not to return to the lure—</p>
                <p>“For though thou night and day take of him hcde, And strew his cage faire and
                    soft as silk, And give him sugre, hony, bred, and milke, Yet right anon so that

                    to it, it is called a cygnet royal. The swan was marked or nicked according to
                    the rank of its owner. By a statute of 22 Edward IV. no man having less than

                    very important part in heraldry, and are scarcely known among the more ancient
                    coats, although a special and interesting volume has been written by Mr Moule on
                    the heraldry of fishes. When borne horizontally they are “naiant;” when
                    vertically, “hauriant,” though this is not always expressed; when bent they are
                    “em∙ bowed” as the dolphin in the crest of Courtenay.</p>

                    to its being the sign of a pilgrim. The seal of the fraternity of St James at
                    Wisby (about 1200) represents St James as a pilgrim with a scallop upon his
                    scrip. Sir Walter Raleigh says—</p>

                    weapon and that most thought of. The soldier in all time was the man of the
                    sword. Damascus, Cologne, Bilbao were in turn famous for the manufacture, as was
                    among smiths Andrea di Ferrara. The swords of great soldiers have been
                    celebrated: Bhowanee as the sword of Sivajee, Excalibar of Arthur, Taillefer of
                    Coeur de Lion—</p>
                <p>“Schwafurlama’s magic blade</p>
                <p>Was by dwarfs at midnight made.”</p>
                <p>There was also the weapon by which Roland, with “huge two-handed sway,” cleft the
                    pass of Roncesvalles,</p>
                <p>“And to the enormous labour left his name.”</p>
                <p>The sword of Talbot bore “Sum Talboti pro vincere inimicos suos,”—“Bad Latin,”
                    says Fuller, “on it, but good steel in it.” King John gave his own sword to the
                    town of Lynn Regis with the inscription, “Ensis hic donum fuit regis Joannis, a
                    suo ipsius latere datum.” The sword of heraldry is two-handed.</p>
                <p>Kilpec of Kilpec: argent, a sword bendwise sable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Axe</hi> was reckoned a manly weapon—</p>

                <p>Thereon were twenty pound of steele.”</p>
                <p>The Danish battle-axe was famous. Walter de Plumpton held Plumpton by the tenure
                    of a Danish axe that hung up in his hall there.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arblast,</hi> or cross-bow, was a most unpopular weapon, as
                    requiring no strength or manliness for its use. Richard I. is generally said to
                    have met his death from a cross-bow; but the earls of Aberdeen, who claimed to
                    represent Bertrand de Gourdon, bear as r <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ⅛Λj <hi

                    Conrad at a council in 1139. Guillaume de Dôle, who wrote before 1 ‘200, says of
                    this weapon—</p>
                <p>“Par effort de lance et d ’ escπ, Conqueront toy ses ennemies. Ja arbalétriees nu
                    fu mis, Por sa guerre li autoritez.”</p>
                <p>Nevertheless as early as 1270 the master of the cross-bows was a great officer of
                    the French crown.</p>
                <p>Arblaster: ermine, a cross-bow in pale gules.</p>

                    essentially an •English weapon. It occurs in heraldry, though scarcelyso
                    frequently as might have been expected, and chiefly in allusion to a name. The
                    belt or baldrick, sheaf of arrows, buckler, and sword completed the equipment of
                    an archer—</p>
                <p>“Their baudricks set with studs, athwart their shoulders cast, To which, under
                    their arms, their sheaves were buckled fast; A short sword at their belt, a
                    buckler scarce a span, who struck below the knee, not counted then a man.</p>
                <p>All made of Spanish yew, their bows were wondrous strong;</p>
                <p>They not an arrow drew, but was a clothyard long.</p>
                <p>Of archery they had the very perfect craft.”</p>
                <p>The bow was used by the English in the attack on the isle of Rhé in 1627.'</p>

                <p>Besides these, and also more or less connected with war and the chase, are the

                    maul, pick, spur, stirrup, and some hundreds of miscellaneous objects,
                    travelling so far out of the legitimate charges of heraldry as to include apples
                    and acorns, beehives, and a turnstyle. A very few of the most ancient have been
                    selected. Walter Agard held Tutbury under Henry III. by a white hunter’s horn,

                    as a prize to be contended for. Bayard himself won it, and the lady wore it for
                    his sake. Fig. 123 is from the seal of John de Hastings, 1291.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Escarbuncle</hi> was a very early bearing of the

                    fleurs-de-lys. In another form the ends are connected by cross-bars. The

                    with the names of Ros and Rose. Ros, however, got it from the Trusbuts of
                    Belvoir, who possibly bore it as lords of Watre in Holderness. Mr Planché has
                    discovered a drawing of a pair of water budgets in actual use. They were of
                    leather, and carried in pairs on a stick over the shoulder.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Debased Heraldry.</hi></p>
                <p>Of debased heraldry there is no lack of examples, and a few are ancient. Thomas
                    de Insula, bishop of Ely (1345-61), bore gules, three bezants, on each a crowned
                    king, robed sable, doubled eπnine, sustaining a covered cup in his right hand
                    and a sword in his left, both or. No doubt, like the arms of the sees of
                    Chichester and Salisbury, this extraordinary coat was meant to be painted on a
                    banner. Camden granted a great number of coats, mostly of a complex character,
                    and since his time heraldic taste has not improved. Tetlow (granted 1760) bore
                    “on a book erect gules, clasped and leaved or, a silver penny argent, thereon
                    written the Lord’s Prayer; at the top of the book a dove proper, in his beak a
                    crowquill pen sable.” Other grants show negroes working in a plantation, Chinese
                    porters carrying cinnamon, &amp;c. The grants to Lord Nelson and his gallant
                    captains, and to the elder Herschel, are utterly unheraldic. It can scarcely be
                    wondered at that Lord Chesterfield, correcting the Garter of his day, remarked,
                    “You foolish man, you don’t understand your own foolish business.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Differences and Marks of Cadency.</hi></p>
                <p>The object of an armorial bearing having been to distinguish one iron-sheathed
                    warrior from another, it was necessary to provide bearings for the members of a
                    family, all entitled to take the paternal coat. This was managed by the
                    introduction of a difference (French, <hi rend="italic">brisure),</hi> usually
                    some slight but well-marked alteration, sometimes by inverting the tinctures,
                    sometimes by changing an ordinary or a smaller charge, as a bend for a fess, or
                    a crosslet for a martlet. Where an heiress had been married a part of her coat
                    was often introduced. The object was with a sufficient difference to show the
                    connexion with the head of the house. The following examples are from the
                    families of Hastings and Zouch. Females, who wore no armour, did not need
                    distinguishing marks, and bore the coat unbroken. Sir John Hastings bore (see
                    fig. 123) or, a maunch gules, called “le de plein armes.”</p>
                <p>Sir William Hastings bore the same, with a label of Pembroke. Sir John Hastings
                    bore the same, with a border of Valence. Sir Edmund Hastings bore the same, with
                    a label vert.</p>
                <p>Sir Nicholas Hastings bore the same, with a label azure.</p>
                <p>Sir Miles Hastings bore or, a fess and a chief, three mullets gules. Sir Philip
                    Hastings bore the same, with a label azure.</p>
                <p>Sir Robert Hastings bore ermine on a chief azure, three mullets or.</p>
                <p>The label of Pembroke and border of Valence show the match with the heiress of
                    Valence, earl of Pembroke. Sir Miles formed a distinct branch, that of
                    Daylesford, probably before armorial bearings were fixed; his descendants,
                    however, returned to the maunch.</p>
                <p>Sir Alan la Zouch bore gules, bezanty.</p>
                <p>Sir William la Zouch bore the same, with a quarter ermine. Sir William la Zouch
                    bore the same, with a label azure.</p>
                <p>Sir Oliver la Zouch bore the same, with a chevron ermine. Sir Amory la Zouch bore
                    the same, with a bend argent.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas la Zouch bore the same, on a quarter argent a mullet sable. ’ . '
                    -</p>
                <p>The quarter ermine is to show the descent from the dukes ol Britanny.</p>
                <p>These and many others of an early date are suitable foi their purpose; but, as
                    armorial bearings became less actually useful, alterations of a different
                    character crept in. The label, however, retained its place. It closely resembles
                    the strap with pendants which from the saddle crossed the horse’s chest. The
                    earliest example of its use is said to be by Geoffréy, son of Henry II., in
                    1153, but a more certain case is the seal of Saher de Quincy, though whether
                    there borne as a charge or as a difference is uncertain. At Caerlavrock Maurice
                    de Berkeley bore a blue label “parceque ces pere vivoit.” In Scotland William
                    Fraser, in 1295, uses a label of three points and on each three roses or
                    mullets, probably meant for “fraises” or strawberry leaves. The mullet,
                    crescent, and fleur-de-lys are used as differences about the same time. The
                    label, even then, was most frequently used by the eldest son, but occasionally
                    he used the crescent, and the label was taken by the second son. The royal house
                    generally used the label, but occasionally the border. Edward I., as prince,
                    bore a label of five points azure; Edmund Crouchback his brother, who married a
                    French princess, charged the label with fleurs-de-lys. His second son, Henry,
                    bore England with a bendlet ermine. Thomas and Edward, second and third sons of
                    Edward I., used labels. Edward IV., as prince, bore on his great seal a label of
                    three, and on his counterseal one of five points. John of Eltham, his brother,
                    bore England with a border of France. The Black Prince, who bore France and
                    England quarterly, added a label argent, and Richard, during his father’s life,
                    placed a cross of St George on the middle point. Lionel, third son of Edward
                    III., having married the heiress of De Clare and De Burgh, used a label and on
                    each point a canton gules, said to be the original arms of De Clare, and on his
                    seal as earl of Ulster each point bore a cross for De Burgh. The number of
                    points was matter of indifference, though usually confined to three. The label
                    itself was, on the whole, and has continued to be, a mark for all the princes of
                    the royal house.</p>
                <p>Setting aside the royal family, a new system of differences came into use, and is
                    touched upon by Upton early in the 15th century, though then but imperfect. He
                    gives the crescent to the eldest son, and to the others the label with three or
                    more points in succession. Dame Berners, in 1486, besides employing the billet,
                    crosslet, and other marks, describes a method of differencing by “gerratting,”
                    that is, powdering the field with billets or other charges, but the good lady’s
                    coats are often mere fancies. The first regular appearance of the modern system
                    is on the effigies of seven Beauchamp cadets in St Mary’s windows at Warwick.
                    There the label, annulet, crescent, martlet, fleurde-lys, and mullet indicate
                    the several cadets. The label is placed in chief, the rest on the fess point of
                    each surcoat.</p>
                <p>The modern marksnow regularly admitted are—(1) the label of three points; (2) the
                    crescent; (3) the mullet; (4) the martlet; (5) the annulet; (6) the
                    fleur-de-lys; (7) the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0738-0705"/> rose; (8) the cross moline; (9) the octofoil
                    (fig. 124). The elder son of the elder son places a label upon a label, the
                    second a crescent, and so on, so that the ninth son of a ninth son would bear an
                    octofoil upon an octofoil, pointing out the relationship of each member to the
                    parent stock; Practically, however, marks of cadency are but seldom used. The
                    earls of Harrington indeed, descending from the second son of a second son,
                    place a crescent upon a crescent. Lords Abergavenny and Braybrooke difference
                    their Neville saltire with a rose, as springing from the seventh son of Ralph,
                    earl of Westmoreland. On the other hand Lord Derby, though a cadet, bears his
                    arms unbroken.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Harks of Illegitimacy</hi> are very various, and on the earlier
                    coats not to be distinguished from differences. Probably the earliest English
                    example is afforded by Wm. Longspee, natural son of Henry II., who bore six
                    lioncels, no doubt derived from his father, though usually attributed to his
                    wife Ela, heiress of the earldom of Salisbury. His counterseal bears the long
                    sword whence he derived his name. The sons of Richard, brother of Henry 1II.,
                    bore their father’s lion of Poitou, inverting the colours, until Sir Geoffrey
                    Cornwall took prisoner the duke of Britanny, when he changed his field to
                    ermine. In the roll of Edward II., Sir John Lovel le Bastard bore Lovel, usually
                    or and gules, with “un label d’azur.” Sir Roger Clarendon, son of the Black
                    Prince, has already been mentioned (page 701). John Beaufort, son of John of
                    Gaunt, bore per pale argent, and azure on a bend gules three lions of England,
                    with his father’s label. After his semi-legitimization he bore England with a
                    border gobonny argent and azure, the Lancaster colours. Arthur, Viscount Lisle,
                    son of Edward IV., placed a bâton over his father’s arms. Sometimes the father’s
                    coat was altered. Sir John Stanley bore a coat compounded of Stanley and Lathom.
                    Sometimes a bâton sinister was added, sometimes a border. Strictly a natural son
                    does not adopt his father’s quarterings, unless such as are habitually borne
                    conjoined, as the royal arms. The descendants of Charles II. bear the whole arms
                    with a bâton sinister or border; those of William IV. the bâton. With the house
                    of Bourbon the bâton marked the cadets, the bâton sinister the bastards. Sir
                    Gilbert Talbot (1569), son of a bastard son of Sir Gilbert Talbot, was allowed
                    Talbot and the usual five quarterings of the family, with a bendlet sinister
                    over the whole, but this is unusual.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rules of Blazon.</hi></p>
                <p>To blazon a coat of arms is to describe it in the technical language of heraldry;
                    and, although the works of the fathers of heraldic lore contain much irrelevant
                    matter, and some confusion of arrangement, the rules of blazon, by whomsoever
                    devised or perfected, are remarkable for their precision, brevity, and
                    completeness. Great and successful care has been taken to produce clear and
                    simple order, to avoid repetition, and to preserve a certain uniformity of
                    arrangement through much complexity of detail. The technicalities arise in great
                    measure from the use of terms once well known, and the language, as was to be
                    expected, shows traces of the French and Franco-Norman channels through which
                    the “gentle art” reached England.</p>
                <p>First comes the description of the field, its colour, or the arrangement of the
                    colours (if more than one), and the character of the partition lines when
                    parted. Thus the “parma inglorius alba” would be blazoned “he beareth argent.”
                    The coat of Waldgrave is per pale argent and gules; that of D’Ebroicis, earl of
                    Gloucester, was “per pale dancette argent and gules.”</p>
                <p>Next follow the charges, and first those of most importance and nearest the
                    field, their name, number, and position (if an animal, its attitude), and
                    finally the colour. The principal charge is that which occupies the principal
                    position. Thus Backhouse of Keilet bore party per saltire, azure and or, a
                    saltire ermine; Bigland of Bigland, azure, two ears of bigg or. Where the
                    principal charge is an ordinary placed between smaller charges, it follows the
                    field: Foliot,—or, a fess between two chevrons gules. The same rule holds where
                    the ordinary is charged, as in Braithwaite of High Wray,—gules, on a chevron
                    argent three cross crosslets fitchy sable; or when the two are combined, as Kerr
                    of Cessford,—vert, upon a chevron between three unicorns’ heads erased argent,
                    horned and crined or, as many mullets sable. Where the ordinary may be charged,
                    but does not admit of being placed between charges, it is blazoned thus:
                    Russell,—argent, a lion rampant gules, on a chief sable three escallops of the
                    field. If the field be semée of figures <hi rend="italic">lf.e.,</hi>
                    besprinkled with them in regular order) they follow it: Pierrepoint,—argent,
                    semée of cinquefoils gules, a lion rampant sable. Had the cinquefoils been on
                    the lion instead of on the field the blazon would have run, argent a lion
                    rampant sable, semée of cinquefoils gules.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of common charges has already been explained (page 698, fig. 85)
                    if one, central; if two, per pale; if three, 2 and 1; if more, as must be
                    specified, as in Babington (fig. 9). Such diminutives as are borne in pairs
                    follow their ordinary: Cludde,—argent, a bend between four cotises sable. To
                    avoid repetition, if a tincture occurs twice reference is made to the first:
                    Scott of Abbotsford, —or, two mullets in chief and a crescent in fess, azure,
                    within an orle of the last; and so if the same number of charges occurs twice,
                    the words “as many” are used: Maling of Scarborough,—ermine, on a chevron vert
                    between three hawks’ jesses as many roses argent. Upton, who wrote in Latin, is
                    put to strange shifts to express his meaning. He thus blazons the arms of
                    Mortimer (fig. 63) :—</p>
                <p>“Portavit arma barrata, et caput scuti palatum est et angulatum de azorio et
                    auro, cum quodam scuto simplici de argento.” In heraldic French this is, “11
                    portoit barrée et ungchef palée cunetée d’asur et d’or, et ung escu simple
                    d’argent.”</p>
                <p>The following, from Menestrier, is the full blazon of the arms of the old kings
                    of France :—</p>
                <p>D’asur a trois fleurs-de-lys d’or 2 and 1. Escu timbré d’un casque ouvert d’or
                    placé de front, assorty de ses lambrequins d’or et d’asur, couronné de la
                    couronne imperiale Françoise, entouré des colliers des ordres du St Esprit et St
                    Michel, soutenu par deux anges vetus en Levites; la dalmatique des émaux de
                    l’escu tenant chacun un baniere de France; le tout placé sous un grand pavillon
                    d’asur fleurde-lisé d’or doublé d’ermines; le comble rayonné d’or et couronné de
                    la couronne imperiale Françoise.</p>
                <p>Le dit pavillon attaché à la baniere ou oriflamme du Royeaume. Cri du guerre,
                    “Montjoye St Denis.” Devise, “Lilia non laborant neque nent,” alluding to the
                    operation of the Salic law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Marshalling Arms.</hi></p>
                <p>Marshalling is the disposing or arranging of such coats of arms as have to be
                    included in one shield. Blazoning deals with the particulars of each coat,
                    marshalling with its position as regards other coats. Arms maybe arranged per
                    pale or impaled, or the shield maybe divided into as many squares as may be
                    required, when it is said to be quartered. The first coat, that of the bearer,
                    may or may not be repeated in the last quarter as may be required to make up an
                    even number of squares, which, though not necessarv. is desirable.</p>

                <p>For a time armorial bearings were purely personal, and intended to supply a want
                    only felt by the wearer of armour. Hence, at first, females do not seem to have
                    used them, and when a place was found for them on armorial seals, the coat was
                    regarded as that of their father, and therefore not differenced. For a time they
                    seem to have had a separate shield. On one of the seals of Margaret of France,
                    queen of Edward L, his three lions are displayed upon the point of her tunic,
                    and on her right hand is a shield of France, on her left, one with a lion
                    rampant. On the reverse is a shield of England, and around it, outside, a border
                    of France. Margaret Bruce of Skelton married Robert de Ros. Her seal (1280)
                    bears her effigy, somewhat defaced, so that nothing can be distinguished on her
                    dress, but on her right is a shield of Ros, on her left one of Bruce.</p>
                <p>A well-known seal, date about 1347, is that of Joan, daughter of Henry count of
                    Bar, by Eleanor daughter of Edward I. by Eleanor of Castile. Joan was widow of
                    Warren, earl of Surrey. Her seal is circular, with nine compartments. In the
                    centre is Warren for her husband; above and below, England for her grandsire;
                    right and left are two barbels for her father. These four are on lozenges. In
                    the four corner compartments are—(1) and (4) a lion for Leon, and (2) and (3) a
                    castle for Castile, for her grandmother. This is a sort of nebulous
                    quartering.</p>
                <p>To this succeeded the allotment to the wife of the sinister half of the husband’s
                    shield, displayed as though two shields had been divided vertically and united,
                    omitting therefore the adjacent half of each coat. This is called dimidiation,
                    and the shields so joined constitute an impalement. Another seal of Margaret of
                    France illustrates this practice. In it half of England impales half of France.
                    There is a good example of dimidiation in the tomb of William de Valence at
                    Westminster, where Valence impales Clermont-Nesle, both dimidiated. An early
                    German seal combines half an eagle with half a lion in this way. The arms of the
                    Cinque Ports are remarkable examples of dimidiation. In each, the lions of
                    England are dimidiated with the arms of the special Port. That of Hastings (fig.
                    125) is party per pale dimidiated, Dexter, gules, three lions passant gardant
                    or; Sinister, azure, three demi-hulks of ships argent. Sometimes one of the
                    coats only was dimidiated. Eleanor (Montendre) was widow of Guy Ferre. Her seal
                    (1348) has a shield of Ferre, a cross moline and over it a bâton, dimidiated,
                    impaling Montendre, a lion within an orle of trefoils. The lion is whole. The
                    seal of Elizabeth, wife of Sir Lawrence Berkerolles (fig. 126),—azure, a chevron
                    or, between three crescents argent, impaling a lion rampant,—is a good example
                    of an impalement without dimidiation (date 1392).</p>
                <p>Usually the lady has the sinister side, but in the seal of Marion, wife of Sir
                    William Dalziel (1392) this is reversed, as it is in the impaled shield of John
                    of Gaunt, where his wife, a daughter of Peter of Castile and Leon, has the
                    dexter side. Dimidiation is not applicable to all coats. A canton on the
                    sinister coat would be lost, and a chevron be converted into a bend. The
                    tressure, orle, and border were usually, not always, dimidiated; and although
                    this form of impalement has fallen into disuse, these charges are still borne
                    dimidiated, as may be seen with the border and tressure on the tomb of Mary,
                    queen of Scots.</p>
                <p>When the lady was the last of her race, various modes were devised for the
                    conservation of her name and arms. Thus on the death (1193) of Robert de Lacy,
                    last of the line of Pontefract, John, constable of Chester, half-brother to
                    Robert by his mother, took the name and arms of Lacy, and was ancestor of the
                    earls of Lincoln of that name. In the same century Isabel, heiress of Earl
                    Warren, married Hamelin Plantagenet, who took the name, and their children bore
                    the arms of Warren; and so with the Mandevilles, earls of Essex.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a coat was compounded of the two families. Thus Mr Planché is of
                    opinion that the bend was added to the paternal coat of Bohun, on the marriage
                    with the heiress of Milo, earl of Hereford. Scottish seals show many examples of
                    such composition. Eustacea Colvile, widow of Reginald le Chein, in 1316, bore a
                    cross moline, square pierced, for Colvile, between four cross crosslets fitchy
                    for Chein. About the middle of the 14th century began the practice of placing
                    the arms of females upon a lozenge. As early as 1347 Elizabeth D’Arcy so bears
                    her arms, as in 1356 does Maud Fitz Payne. The seal of Joan Beaufort, widow of
                    James I., affords the earliest Scottish example.</p>
                <p>The first step towards a regular method of preserving heraldically the memory of
                    a family extinct in the male line seems to have been taken in Spain by a process
                    now known as quartering. Eleanor of Castile, queen of Edward I., has upon her
                    tomb a shield divided into four quarters, in the first and fourth of which is
                    Castile, and the second and third Leon. The practice, though not finally
                    regulated, was approved, for on the seal of the “She-wolf of France,” queen of
                    Edward II., the shield is quartered (1) England, (2) France, (3) Navarre, (4)
                    Champagne, mixing up confusedly the arms of husband and wife, as they also are
                    upon the shield of Philippa of Hainault, queen of Edward TIL, who bore
                    quarterly, (1) and (4) England, (2) and</p>
                <p>(3) Hainault and Holland. A very early instance of regular quartering occurs in
                    the will of Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, dated 11th August 1319, by which
                    he bequeaths a courte-point quartered with the arms of England and Bohun. This
                    is five years before the accession of Edward III., and makes it probable that
                    the quartered coat of William de Foix at Winchester is original.</p>
                <p>Under Edward III. quartering came into general use. The king led the way by
                    quartering France and England, and the earl of Pembroke followed, quartering
                    Hastings and Valence. John Hastings, his son, commemorated on his shield his
                    father’s match with Ann daughter of Margaret, duchess of Norfolk, a co-heir of
                    Thomas of Brotherton, and this affords an early instance of the precedence often
                    given in quartering to the royal arms. John Hastings bore quarterly of four—(1)
                    and (4) Brotherton (Plantagenet), (2) Hastings, (3) Valence; and, on another
                    example—(1) and</p>
                <p>(4) Brotherton, (2) and (3) Hastings quartering Valence. This latter arrangement
                    of sub-quartering shows a considerable advance in the system. Henry IV. combined
                    quartering with dimidiation in a shield long preserved in the window of Christ
                    Church, Newgate, which bore France and England quarterly, impaling France with a
                    bend gobonny, and Navarre quarterly, dimidiated, for Joan of Navarre. In this
                    case the 1st and 3d quarters were removed, and the sinister bearings thus
                    reduced to what may be better blazoned as party per fess, (1) Navarre, (2)
                    France. The French sometimes quartered diagonally, called “Écartèle en sautoir.”
                    The old kings of Sicily thus divided their shield: party per saltire, (1) and
                    (4) Aragon, (2) and (3) Swabia. This plan never found favour in England, where
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0740-0707"/> a regular system of quartering sprang up, and has
                    continued in use. A quartered shield, though of no special family, is shown by
                    fig. 12.</p>
                <p>At first the arms of an heiress were impaled by her husband, but latterly they
                    were placed on a central inescutcheon designated an escutcheon of pretence. The
                    children divided the shield into four quarters, and placed the paternal coat 1
                    and 4, the maternal 2 and 3. If a second heiress came in, she was placed in No.
                    3; if a third, in No. 4; if more, the shield was divided as required. The
                    following pedigree will explain the system. In it all the descents that did not
                    bring in an heiress are omitted.</p>

                <p>The above, being a well-known and very noble pedigree, has been selected
                    toillustrate the system of quartering, which is explained by the shield (fig.
                    127), thus emblazoned :—</p>
                <p>1, George, duke of Clarence; 2, Neville, who brings in 3, Montacute; 4,
                    Monthermer; 5, Beauchamp, who brings in 6, Mauduit; 7, Newburgh; 8, Le
                    Despenser; 9, De Clare.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately the several bearers of these arms were fanciful, and sometimes gave
                    precedence to one and sometimes to another coat, and indeed never used the
                    whole, which would have crowded their shields and caparisons. The four woodcuts
                    <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> figs. 128-31, will illustrate this.</p>
                <p>They represent the great seals of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, who married
                    Isabel le Despenser, and Richard Neville, carl of Warwick, who married Anne
                    Beauchamp.</p>
                <p>Beauchamp quarters the arms of his wife, but makes De Clare impale Le Despenser,
                    while he himself impales Newburgh. The blazon would thus be quarterly of four
                    grand quarters—I. and IV., Beauchamp impaling Newburgh; II. and III., De Clare
                    impaling Le Despenser (fig. 128). On the counterseal (fig. 129) the earl bears
                    on his shield Beaucha mp and Newburgh quarterly, and on his caparisons
                    Beauchamp, Newburgh, De Clare, and Le Despenser also quarterly.</p>

                <p>The other is the seal of the king-maker. As lord of Glamorgan he gives precedence
                    to De Clare and Le Despenser, and hears quarterly of four grand quarters—I. and
                    IV. quarterly, De Clare and Le Despenser; II. and HL, Montacute and Monthermer;
                    Neville not appearing at all. The crests are those of Beauchamp and Montacute.
                    The remaining supporter is the Neville hull, muzzled, and below are ragged

                <p>The counterseal gives on the shield Neville above with a label, and the swan
                    crest on the helmet. The caparisons are quarterly of four grand quarters: I.
                    quarterly—1, effaced; 2 and 3, Newburgh charged with five pards’ heads, jessant
                    fleurs-de-lys for Cantelupe; 4, Beauchamp; II. and III.—1 and 4, De Clare; 2 and
                    3, Le Despenser; IV.—1 and 4, Beauchamp; 2 and 3, Newburgh (fig. 131).</p>
                <p>The rules were also departed from where the royal arms were quartered, as by
                    Devereux, Hastings, and Stafford, when it was usual to place them in the first
                    or second quarter out of their genealogical order. Also in certain cases the
                    quarterings of an heiress are not broken up, but borne combined as a
                    sub-quarter, sometimes called a grand quarter. Thus the royal arms always form a
                    special quarter, and probably the arms of Howard, quartering, as they always do,
                    Brotherton, Mowbray, and Warren, would be so treated.</p>
                <p>Tlιe English mode of quartering is defective, inasmuch as it affords no proof of
                    purity of descent on both sides. A new man whose father married a Talbot or
                    Clinton heiress would combine their ancient quarterings with his new coat, and
                    few would be the wiser. On the Continent and in Scotland the system is far more
                    perfect, and the quarterings include all ancestors and ancestresses of every
                    kind. Thera a man who can prove the arms of his father and mother has two
                    quarters <hi rend="italic">; of</hi> his grandfather and grandmother, four; and
                    so on. The following scheme, supplied from the family records of Mr C. J.
                    Middleton, registrar of the prerogative court, the representative in the male
                    line of a Scottish family, the Middletons of Fettercairn, two of whom were earls
                    of Middleton, will explain this. It gives, or nearly gives, the well-known
                    “seize quartiers,” without which, in former days, scarcely any important office
                    was ever to be obtained :—</p>

                <p>This sort of’ escutcheon at once placed before the eye the heraldic history of
                    the family for four generations.</p>
                <p>Bishops, deans, kings-at-arms, and the heads of certain corporations weir their
                    paternal arms impaled by those of their office. No provision is made for the
                    wife.</p>
                <p>Single women or widows bear their arms upon a lozenge. Widows and peeresses use
                    their husband’s supporters. Peeresses in their own right use their own. But no
                    lady uses crest or motto.</p>
                <p>A commoner who marries a peeress in her own right uses two shields. On the dexter
                    are his own arms with those of his wife on a scutcheon of pretence ensigned with
                    her coronet; on the sinister the lady’s arms alone on a lozenge with supporters
                    and coronet. If the lady be only a dowager peeress, and not an heiress, there
                    are also two shields. On one the husband impales her arms in the ordinιry way;
                    on the other are the lady’s arms, &lt;fcc., as a widow, impaled by those of her
                    first husband, with his supporters and coronet, but no crest, and the arms in a
                    lozenge.</p>
                <p>A baronet of England or Ireland bears a sinister hand couped gules on an
                    inescutcheon or a canton. It is blazoned “argent, a sinister hand, couped at the
                    wrist and ap-paumée, gules.” Those of Nova Scotia bear argent on a shield of
                    pretence, Scotland ensigned with a crown.</p>
                <p>Bacon of Redgrave, the premier baronet, bears gules, on a chief argent two
                    mullets pierced sable (fig. 133).</p>
                <p>A knight of an order surrounds his shield, usually a cartouche, with the ribbon
                    and motto of the order. If married he takes a second and sinister shield, and
                    thereon impales his wife’s arms, the whole within a plain ribbon.</p>
                <p>A widower marrying a second wife divides his shield tierce per pale, and places
                    his own arms in the centre, his first wife’s on the dexter, his second’s on the
                    sinister side. For a greater number there is no strict rule. A certain Sir
                    Gervase Clifton who survived seven wives, placed himself in the centre of the
                    shield, and his wives around him. The widow of two husbands may divide her
                    lozenge tierce per pale, and place her first husband on the dexter side, her
                    second in the centre, and herself in the sinister place; or she may divide the
                    dexter half on her lozenge per fess, and place the arms of the first husband
                    above, and those of the second below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Appendages.</hi></p>
                <p>These include whatever is borne outside the shield, as the crest, badge, motto,
                    supporters, helmet, coronet, and some other additions. Strictly speaking,
                    armorial bearings are confined to the contents of the shield; and heralds have
                    never regarded the appendages as of the same importance.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crest</hi> was the ornament of the headpiece, and afforded
                    protection against a blow. In early rolls of arms it is not noticed. In early
                    seals when it appears it is rarely heraldic. Richard I. wears a sort of
                    fan-shaped ornament, but has a lion passant gardant on the front of his helmet.
                    Edmund Crouchback in 1296 uses distinctly a crest. Of fourteen seals of horsemen
                    in complete armour appended to the barons’ letter to the pope in 1301, three
                    only have regular crests, although many have plumes. The three are—Thomas earl
                    of Lancaster and Ralph earl of Gloucester, men of high rank, and Sir John St
                    John, a great military commander. In the 14th century they became general. In
                    1355 the count of Hainault presented to Edward III. “unam galeam pretiosam cum
                    apparatu quam idem comes solebat in capite suo gestare.” This was the crest of
                    the eagle seen on the count’s seal, and which the king regranted at the fords of
                    Annan to Montagu, earl of Salisbury. Edward himself used the lion, which has
                    continued to be the crest of the English sovereigns. Adam de Blencowe (1356-7)
                    had a grant of arms and crest of the Greystoke bearings from William, lord of
                    Greystoke.</p>
                <p>Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (died 1439), rests his feet upon the crests of
                    the bear and griffin for Warwick and Montagu. His paternal crest, the swan’s
                    head out of a ducal coronet, is placed upon his helmet, beneath his head. The
                    dragon and wyvern were common crests, and the plume of feathers is still used by
                    Scrope and Courtenay. Ralph, LordNeville of Raby, used the bull’s head in 1353;
                    Hastings, a bull’s head in 1347. Crests were, like arms, allusive. Grey of
                    Wilton used a “gray” or badger; Lord Welles, a bucket and chain; Botreaux, a
                    buttress. The crest was sometimes placed on a ducal coronet, sometimes rises out
                    of a wreath or torse of the colours of the arms. The coronet below the crest is
                    not a mark of rank. In Carlisle cathedral is the crest of Davidson, a bird
                    rising out of an earl’s coronet. This, however, is rare; the coronet so used is
                    generally ducal. Crests were granted and bequeathed. In Germany it is usual to
                    bear the crests of the “seize quartiers” or some of them. This of course is
                    inconsistent vith the actual use of the crest in war. At first crests were
                    confined to persons of rank, but they have long been included in every grant of
                    arms. In England two or more can only legitimately be borne when the bearer has
                    from the crow n a grant of name and arms in addition to his own, as
                    Chetwynd-Talbυt, Fitz-Alan-Howard.</p>
                <p>With the crest is usually combined some flowing drapery known as the “panache,”
                    “mantling,” or <hi rend="italic">lambrequin.</hi> This seems to have served to
                    protect the helmet from heat and dust, and was also ornamental. It is
                    represented in great perfection on tombs of the 15th and 16th centuries,
                    commonly of some brilliant colour with a lining and tassels. The tilting helmet
                    which supports the head of the effigy of Humphrey de Bohun (died 1267), at
                    Gloucester, is accompanied by a grand early specimen of the lambrequin.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Badge</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cognizance</hi> was not
                    worn on the helmet, but displayed upon the persons of the retainers of great
                    barons, and sometimes used to ornament the shield or seal. At the celebrated
                    judicial combat at Coventry before Richard II. in 1398, Henry of Lancaster
                    appeared wdth his housings of blue and green embroidered with swansand
                    antelopes, his badges; and Mowbray had housings of crimson velvet, embroidered
                    with silver lions and mulberry trees, his badges. The bear was the Beauchamp
                    badge, derived possibly from Urso D’Abitot. They also used the ragged staff and
                    the combination of the two.</p>
                <p>The seal of Richard III., 1484, as lord of Glamorgan, exhibits the boar as a
                    supporter, and the counterseal repeats it as a badge (figs. 134, 135). This seal
                    well illustrates various heraldic points. Its blazon is per pale, baron and
                    femme; baron, France modern and England quarterly, over all a label of three
                    points; femme, per fess, Beauchamp, and checquy, on a chevron five pards’ heads
                    jessant fleurs-de-lys, for Newburgh combined with Çantilupe. The same arms are
                    repeated on the shields and caparisons of the counterseal. Richard married Anne
                    Neville, but the Neville saltire does not appear, only the arms of Beauchamp and
                    Newburgh, both of whom were earls of Warwick.</p>
                <p>“The rampant bear chained to the ragged staff” was inherited by the Nevilles and
                    Dudleys, and granted about 1759 to the Grevilles as the owners of Warwick
                    castle. Pelham used a buckle, Percy a crescent, Boucher, Bowen, Dacre, Heneage,
                    Hungerford, Lacy, Stafford, Wake, and <pb break="no"

                    crown brought his own tenants into the field, and led them, distinct war-cries
                    were common. The royal cry was “St George for England.” The French cried,
                    “Montjoye St Denis;” the <hi rend="italic">cri de guerre</hi> of Bauffrement was
                    their name; that of Barr, “Au feu”; Seyton, “St Bennet and Set on.” The common
                    Highland cry or slogan was “Claymore”; that of the Medici, “Palle, palle,”
                    alluding to their arms. The motto succeeded to this (1291); Bruce of Annandale
                    used “Esto fortis in bello”; Courtenay, “Passez bien devant’’; Hastings,
                    “Honorantes me honorabo;” Kirkpatrick used the crest of the bloody dirk with the
                    motto “I mak sicker.” The Warren motto, alluding to the earls’ resistance to the
                    “quo warranto,” was “tenebo;” Vernon, “God save the Vernon,” ill exchanged for
                    “Vernon semper viret” The Scottish borderers, who lived by harrying their
                    neighbours by moonlight, used stars and crescents for their arms, and such

                    and are usually animals or human figures. They seem to have arisen from the
                    ornaments introduced by the seal engraver, and became heraldic with the practice
                    of quartering. The seal of Edmund Crouchback bears a shield flanked by two
                    wyverns, probably ornaments. That seal (1286) and the seal of Henry of Lancaster
                    in 1300 contain both crest and helm, lambrequin and supporters. The seal of
                    Catherine, queen of Henry IV., has two antelopes, and her husband as prince used
                    two swans. At Naworth the family supporters, of gigantic size, support the
                    principals of the roof of the hall. Under the house of Tudor many families of
                    knightly rank, as Babington, Stanhope, and Luttrel, used supporters, but at this
                    time supporters are only granted to peers, knights of the garter, grand crosses
                    of the bath, Nova Scotia baronets, and a few private persons who hold them by
                    prescription. In Scotland they are used by heads of clans and by a few lowland
                    families. .Fletcher of Saltoun uses two griffins.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Livery</hi> has long lost its early signification, and is
                    used only for the dress of the retainers in their lord’s colour. At Richard
                    III.’s coronation 8000 badges of the white boar were wrought upon liveries of
                    fustian. A statute of Henry IV. forbade the use of liveries under heavy
                    penalties, but they reappeared in the Wars of the Roses. Richard III. used
                    “collars of livery,” but these were for persons of rank. One remains upon a
                    Neville effigy at Brancepeth.</p>

                    head attire of a sovereign prince. It is usually closed at the top by four
                    arched bars called diadems, and surmounted by a globe and cross. Edward IV. is
                    said to have first closed the English crown. That now in use is a circle of
                    gold, jewelled, edged above with crosses patce and fleurs-de-lys alternate, and
                    closed above with four bars and the cross and globe called in Germany the
                    Reichsapfel (fig. 136). Since the Restoration the crown of the Princes of Wales
                    has been surmounted by two bars, also with the Reichsapfel (fig. 137). They also
                    use the plume of three ostrich feathers, with the words “Ich dien,” adopted by
                    the Black Prince (fig. 138). Figs. 139 and 140 give representations of the
                    imperial crown of Austria and the crown of the old kings of France. The Pope
                    places three crowns over his mitre or tiara (fig. 141), said to have been
                    severally assumed in 1295, 1335, and 1411. The crown imperial of Charlemagne

                    Venice and Genoa bore a peculiar cap or toque, seen in Greek statuary, and upon
                    the figures on the arch of Constantine.</p>
                <p>The coronet is the head attire of a noble. In England those of princes of the
                    blood are bordered with crosses pâtée and fleurs-de-lys under a regulation of 13
                    Charles II. (fig. 143). The princesses alternate the same ornaments with
                    strawberry leaves (fig 144).</p>
                <p>The coronet of a duke is bordered with eight strawberry leaves (fig. 145); that
                    of a marquis with four alternating with four pearls placed on low points (fig.
                    146). An earl’s coronet· has eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight
                    pearls upon tall points (fig. 147). The viscount borders his coronet with an
                    indefinite number of pearls, set close upon the rim (fig. 148). The baron’s
                    coronet, granted to the order by Charles II., carries six pearls placed on the
                    rim at equal intervals,—four being seen at once (fig. 149). These coronets are
                    all lined with ermine, and enriched with jewels. On occasions of state, when not
                    worn by the peer, they are carried before him on a cushion.</p>
                <p>The eldest sons of peers above the rank of viscount wear the coronet due to their
                    father’s second title. The crowns of the kings at-arms are of gold, bordered
                    with and encircled by the motto “Miserere mei, Domine.” The ducal, as an ancient
                    form of coronet, is often used without reference to rank, as the base for a
                    crest. It was so used by Sir Simon de Felbrigge in 1442.</p>
                <p>A bishop has neither crest nor coronet, but ensigns his arms with a mitre. The
                    bishops of Durham, while palatines, placed their mitre in a ducal coronet,
                    as—though without authority—do the archbishops (fig. 150). The Berkeley crest is
                    a mitre. The ancient mitre was low, and of linen stiffened with vellum. The
                    central band and the margin, embroidered with fleurs-de-lys or other patterns,
                    were called the orphreys. The pendent side ribbons were the “infulae.” Prelates
                    of the church of Rome ensign their shields with a hat, the tassels of which
                    indicate their rank. A cardinal has four rows of red tassels, arranged 1, 2, 4,
                    8, or 15 on each side; an archbishop the same, but green. A bishop has three
                    rows, an a∣&gt;bυt two; the abbot’s hat is black. Prelates and legates place a
                    patriarchal cross in pale behind their shield.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Helmet</hi> also indicates the rank of the wearer. It is
                    placed above the shield, and beneath the crest. The sovereign and the royal
                    family bear the helmet full-faced or affrontée with six bars, all of gold (fig.
                    151). Those of dukes and marquises are of gold with five steel bars (fig.</p>
                <p>152) . The lesser nobles have silver helmets borne in profile with gold ornaments
                    and four silver bars. Those of baronets and knights are of steel, full-faced and
                    open (fig.</p>
                <p>153) . An esquire’s helmet is of steel, represented in profile, with the vizor
                    closed (fig. 154). These distinctions were probably introduced after the
                    Restoration.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mantling</hi> is a sort of cloak or mantle of fur extended
                    behind the shield, and sufficiently ample to include the whole achievement.
                    Those of sovereigns are of gold doubled with ermine, and are called “pavilions.”
                    Peers’ mantlings are of crimson velvet, doubled with white fur and barred with
                    ermine spots; a duke has four bars, a marquis three and a half, an earl three, a
                    viscount two and a half, and a baron two. Commoners use red mantlings lined with
                    white fur. The prior of St John, whose place was on the right of the temporal
                    barons, used a sable mantling doubled with murrey. The pavilion of France was of
                    blue velvet, powdered with gold fleurs-de-lys, and lined with ermine. Such a
                    mantling may be seen behind the arms of Beaumont in Rothley Temple chapel, in
                    right of their descent from the blood-royal of France.</p>
                <p>Certain officers of state accompanied their armorial shields with exterior marks
                    of their rank. The Earl Marshal placed two truncheons saltirewise behind his
                    shield, tipped above with the arms of England, and below with his own arms. His
                    deputy places one truncheon in bend dexter.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the Lord High Constable, the earl of Errol, places on either side of
                    his shield an arm issuant from a cloud, and grasping a sword. Under the old
                    monarchy the French colonels commandant placed the standards of their regiments
                    saltirewise behind their shields.</p>
                <p>The Lords High Admiral have been variously distinguished. Thomas de Berkeley
                    bears on his brass a collar of tritons. Thomas, duke of Exeter, sealed with a
                    ship and his arms on the mainsail. The anchor in some form or other was a common
                    emblem.</p>
                <p>Merchants’ marks are scarcely heraldic, though they took the place of arms with
                    the trading classes. They were usually monograms of the name or initials. They
                    were protected by law as marks on goods, and are seen on merchants’ tombs and
                    sometimes in architecture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Funeral Escutcheons.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of the.most valuable records in the College of Arms are the certificates of
                    funerals conducted under their superintendence and authority. These gorgeous and
                    expensive ceremonials have happily fallen into disuse, save on very rare
                    occasions, and for royal persons or eminent public characters. The last private
                    funeral conducted with anything like the ancient ceremonial was that of Charles,
                    earl of Shrewsbury, in 1828. All that is now usual is the suspension of a shield
                    of arms in a large black lozenge-shaped frame called a hatchment or achievement
                    against the wall of the house of the deceased. It is usually placed over the
                    entrance at the level of the second floor, and remains for from six to twelve
                    months, when it is removed to the parish church. Even this custom, scarcely
                    consistent with living in hired houses and burying in cemeteries, is falling
                    into disuse, though still not uncommon.</p>

                <p>If for a bachelor, the hatchment bears upon a shield his arms, crest, and other
                    appendages, the whole on a black ground. If for a single woman her arms are
                    represented upon a lozenge, bordered with knotted ribbons, also on a black
                    ground. If the hatchment be for a married man (as in fig. 155), his arms upon a
                    shield impale those of his wife; or if she be an heiress they are placed upon a
                    scutcheon of pretence, and crest and other appendages are added. The dexter half
                    of the ground is black, the sinister white. For a wife whose husband is alive
                    the same arrangement is used, but the sinister ground only is black. For a
                    widower the same is used as for a married man, but the whole ground is black;
                    for a widow the husband’s arms are given with her own, but upon a lozenge, with
                    ribbons, without crest or appendages, and the whole ground is black. When there
                    have been two wives or two husbands the ground is divided into three parts per
                    pale, and the division behind the arms of the survivor is white. Colours and
                    military or naval emblems are sometimes placed behind the arms of military or
                    naval officers. It is thus easy to discern from the hatchment the sex,
                    condition, and quality, and possibly the name of the deceased.</p>
                <p>In Scottish hatchments it is not unusual to place the arms of the father and
                    mother of the deceased in the two lateral angles of the lozenge, and sometimes
                    the 4, 8, or 16 genealogical escutcheons are ranged along the margin.</p>
                <p>Undertakers are fond of substituting “In coelo quies” or some such commonplace
                    for the family motto. This is irregular.</p>
                <p>The literature of heraldry commences with the treatises of Sassoferrato about
                    1358, De Fosse in the reign of Richard 11., and Upton about 1441, all written in
                    Latin and printed by Sir E. Bysshe in 1654. They are followed, by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Boke of St Albans,</hi> written by Dame Juliana Berners, prioress
                    of Sopwell, and printed in 1486. These, especially those of Upton and Dame
                    Juliana, are valuable. The lady writes in a mixture of early English and Latin,
                    but her descriptions are intelligible and copious. These writers were followed
                    by a crowd of others, of whom the chief were Gerard Leigh, Ferne, and Morgan,
                    who wrote in the latter half of the 16th century. Their great aim was to elevate
                    their subject by tracing back the use of armoiries to the patriarchs and heroes
                    of Jewish and pagan antiquity, whom they invested with coats of arms on the type
                    of those used by Norman barons. There are traces of this folly in Dame Juliana,
                    but it reached its height in the writings of her successors, and was not quite
                    extinguished when Guillim wrote his <hi rend="italic">Display of Heraldry
                    in.</hi> 1610. Guillim, whose work is still a standard, wrote in English, but as
                    late as 1654 and 1688 Spelman, in his <hi rend="italic">Aspilogia,</hi> and John
                    Gibbon strove hard to restore the use of a dead language upon a subject to which
                    it was eminently unsuitable. In 1722 and 1780 were published the excellent
                    volumes of Nisbet, chiefly relating to Scotland, and of Edmondson, whose list or
                    ordinary of bearings was long very useful to those who seek to identify the name
                    to which a coat belongs, until superseded by the very laborious and far more
                    complete work of Papworth.</p>
                <p>Recently the same critical spirit that has pervaded the works of our historians
                    has been applied with equal diligence to the whole subject of heraldry; a number
                    of authors, led by Planché, Boutell, Seton, Nichols, and Lower, have set aside
                    all the fabulous pretensions and baseless assertions of the earlier writeιs,
                    have sifted the old evidence and adduced much that is new. The whole subject of
                    heraldic and quasi-heraldic seals has been brought under notice by the
                    publication of Laing’s fine plates of Scottish seals; and it may truly be said
                    that the real origin and growth of the use of armorial bearings is placed before
                    the reader in the books of these writers in a truthful and most attractive form.
