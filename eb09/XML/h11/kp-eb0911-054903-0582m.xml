                    at Hackney, where he first began to speculate upon metaphysical subjects.
                    Feeling disinclined to enter the dissenting ministry, he returned to Wem in
                    Shropshire, where his father had in the meantime settled, and there led an idle
                    and desultory life until, about 1802, he determined upon becoming a painter.
                    Metaphysics and art continued his joint passion throughout his life. It was his
                    singular lot to be animated by an equal enthusiasm for two of the most
                    dissimilar fields of human effort, in neither of which was he capable of
                    achieving eminence, and yet, by a combination of the qualities proper to both,
                    to obtain the most distinguished success in another sphere which he only entered
                    by accident. The secret of his distinction as a critic is the union in him of
                    the metaphysician’s acuteness with the painter’s eye for colour and substance.
                    Nowhere else is abstract thought so picturesquely bodied forth by concrete
                    illustration. He commenced the practice of painting in London, where his elder
                    brother had already acquired some reputation as an artist, and soon found his
                    way into literary and artistic circles, becoming especially intimate with Lamb,
                    Hunt, and Godwin. Previously to this he had (January 1798) been powerfully
                    influenced by Coleridge, who had come to preach in his father’s neighbourhood,
                    and of whose conversation and general demeanour he has left a most vivid
                    picture. His professional painting did not prosper, and little remains of it
                    except a few portraits; butin 1805 he published his <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    the Principles of Hitman Action,</hi> w hich had occupied him at intervals for
                    six or seven years. This work, further defined by the author as an argument in
                    favour of the natural disinterestedness of the human mind, was preferred by him
                    to all his other writings, but never attracted any attention from the public. In
                    1807 appeared a most useful abridgment of Abraham Tucker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Light of Nature Pursued,</hi> and a clever but fallacious attempt to invalidate
                    the natural law established in Malthus’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Population.</hi> In the following year he married Sarah, sister of Dr Stoddart,
                    well known for his connexion with the journalism of the day, a woman of literary
                    tastes and great strength of character, but cold, formal, and utterly
                    uncongenial to him, No mau indeed could well be less adapted for domestic life
                    than Hazlitt, whose habits, notwithstanding his exemplary sobriety, were most
                    irregular <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n583/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0583-0550"/> whose temper was fitful and moody, and the
                    intensity of whose passions rendered him for the time insensible to the feelings
                    and rightful claims of those who might stand in the way of their gratification.
                    The dissolution of the ill-assorted union was nevertheless deferred for fourteen
                    years, during which much of his best literary work had been produced. After
                    three or four years, during which he almost disappears from observation, he came
                    forward pro minently as a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> and as a
                    lecturer at the Surrey Institution, bringing out in rapid succession his <hi
                    rend="italic">Round Table,</hi> a collection of essays on literature, men, and
                    manners, his <hi rend="italic">Vieιv</hi> of the contemporary English stage, and
                    his lectures on the poets, the English comic writers, and the dramatic
                    literature of the age of Elizabeth. By these works, together with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Characters of</hi><hi rend="italic">Shakespeare''s</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plays</hi> (1817), and his <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi>
                    (1821), his reputation as a critic and essayist will mainly be sustained. Next
                    to Coleridge, Hazlitt was perhaps the most powerful exponent of the dawning
                    perception that Shakespeare’s art was no less marvellous than his genius; and
                    Hazlitt’s criticism did not, like Coleridge’s, remain in the condition of a
                    series of brilliant but fitful glimpses of insight, but was elaborated with
                    steady care. His lectures on the Elizabethan dramatists performed a similar
                    service for the earlier, sweeter, and simpler among them, such as Dekker, till
                    then unduly eclipsed by later writers like Massinger, better playwrights but
                    worse poets. Treating of the contemporary drama, he successfully vindicated for
                    Edmund Kean (whom, however, he had at first disparaged) the high place which he
                    has retained as an actor; while his criticisms on the English comic writers and
                    men of letters in general are masterpieces of ingenious and felicitous
                    exposition, though rarely, like Coleridge’s, penetrating to the inmost core of
                    the subject. As an essayist Hazlitt is even more effective than as a critic, for
                    this style of composition allows more scope to the striking individuality of his
                    character. Being enabled to select his own subjects, he escapes dependence upon
                    others either for his matter or his illustrations, and presents himself by turns
                    as a metaphysician, a moralist, a humorist, a painter of manners and
                    characteristics, but always, whatever his ostensible theme, deriving the essence
                    of his commentary from his own bosom. This combination of intense subjectivity
                    with strict adherence to his subject is one of Hazlitt’s most distinctive and
                    creditable traits. Intellectual truthfulness is a passion with him. He steeps
                    his topic in the hues of his own individuality, but never uses it as a means of
                    self-display. The first reception of these admirable essays was by no means in
                    accordance with their deserts. Hazlitt’s political sympathies and a ιtipathies
                    were vehement, and he had taken the unfashionable side. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly</hi> attacked him with deliberate malignity, stopped the sale of his
                    writings for a time, and blighted his credit with publishers. He had become
                    estranged from his early friends, the Lake poets, by what he uncharitably but
                    not unnaturally regarded as their political apostasy; as well as by an escapade
                    of his own, obscurely related, but apparently not creditable. His inequalities
                    of temper separated him for a time even from Leigh Hunt and Charles Lamb, and on
                    the whole the periol of his most brilliant literary success was that when he was
                    most soured and broken. Domestic troubles supervened; his marriage, long little
                    more than nominal, was dissolved in consequence of the infatuated passion he had
                    conceived for a servant girl, a most ordinary person in the eyes of every one
                    else. It is impossible to regard Hazlitt as a responsible agent while he
                    continued subject to this influence. His own record of the transaction,
                    published by himself under the title of <hi rend="italic">Liber Λmocis, or the
                    New</hi><hi rend="italic">Pygmalion</hi> (1823), is a most remarkable
                    psychological curiosity, and one of the most signal examples extant of the power
                    of genuine passion, not merely to palliate what is wrong, but to dignify what is
                    ridiculous. “His idolatry,” says Mrs Jameson, “in its intense earnestness and
                    reality assumes something of the sublimity of an act of faith.” The
                    business-like dissolution of his marriage under the law of Scotland is related
                    with amazing naivete by the family biographer. Rid of his wife and cured of his
                    mistress, he shortly afterwards astonished his friends by marrying a widow. “All
                    I know,” says his grandson, “is that Mrs Bridgewater became Mrs Hazlitt.” They
                    travelled on the Continent for a year, and then parted never to meet again.
                    Hazlitt’s study of the Italian masters during this tour, described in a series
                    of letters contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle,</hi> had a
                    deep effect upon him, and perhaps conduced to that intimacy with the cynical old
                    painter Northcote which, shortly after his return, engendered a curious but
                    eminently readable volume of conversations with him. The respective shares of
                    author and artist are not always easy to determine. During the recent agitations
                    of his life he had been writing essays, collected in 1826 under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Plain Speaker</hi>; others subsequently written were published
                    after his death. They are in no respect inferior to his earlier performances.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of the Age</hi> (1825), a series of criticisms on
                    the leading intellectual characters of the day, reveals that he was less
                    qualified to assign their true place to contemporaries than to revise the
                    verdicts of the past, but is in point of style perhaps the most splendid and
                    copious of his compositions. It is eager and animated to impetuosity, with no
                    trace of carelessness or disorder. He now undertook a work which was to have
                    crowned his literary reputation, but which can hardly be said to have even
                    enhanced it— <hi rend="italic">The Life of Napoleon</hi> (1828-30). The
                    undertaking was at best premature, and was inevitably disfigured by partiality
                    to Napoleon as the representative of the popular cause, excusable and even
                    becoming in a Liberal politician writing in the days of the Holy Alliance, but
                    preposterous now that the true tendencies of French imperialism are recognized.
                    Owing to the failure of his publishers Hazlitt received no recompense for this
                    laborious work. Pecuniary anxieties and disappointments may have contributed to
                    hasten his death, which took place on September 18, 1830. Charles Lamb was with
                    him to the last.</p>
                <p>With many serious defects both on the intellectual and the moral side, Hazlitt’s
                    character in both had at least the merit of sincerity and consistency. He was a
                    compound of intellect and passion, and the refinement of his critical analysis
                    is associated with vehement eloquence and glowing imagery. He was essentially a
                    critic, a dissector, and, as Bulwer justly remarks, a much better judge of men
                    of thought than of men of action. But he also possessed many gifts in no way
                    essential to the critical character, and transcending the critic’s ordinary
                    sphere. These, while giving him rank as an independent writer, frequently
                    perturbed the natural clearness of his critical judgment, and seduced him into
                    the paradoxes with which his works abound. These paradoxes, however, never
                    spring from affectation;. they are in general the sallies of a mind so agile and
                    ardent as to overrun its own goal. His style is perfectly natural, and yet
                    admirably calculated for effect. His diction, always rich and masculine, seems
                    to kindle as he proceeds; and when thoroughly animated by his subject, he
                    advances with a succession of energetic, hard-hitting sentences, each carrying
                    his argument a step further, like a champion dealing out blows as he presses
                    upon the enemy. Although, however, his grasp upon his subject is strenuous, his
                    insight into it is rarely profound. He can amply satisfy men of taste and
                    culture; he cannot, like Coleridge or Burke, dissatisfy them with themselves by
                    showing them how much they would have missed without him. He belongs to the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0584-0551"/> class of critics that exhibits the beauties of an
                    author, rather than to the class that reveals them. He was somewhat backward in
                    appreciating contemporary merit; he venerated Coleridge’s intellect, but his
                    estimate of his poetry is ridiculously low; his review of Shelley’s posthumous
                    poems, though rhetorically fine, is critically poor; and he did little to
                    vindicate the fame of Keats. As a moralist and observer of manners his chief
                    merit consists in the extreme felicity of his occasional observations. But all
                    shortcomings are forgotten in the genuineness and fervour of the writer’s
                    selfportraiture, and the bold relief in which he stands out from the crowd of
                    mankind. The intensity of his personal convictions causes all he wrote to appear
                    in a manner autobiographic. Other men have been said to speak like books,
                    Hazlitt’s books speak like men. To read his works in connexion with Leigh Hunt’s
                    and Charles Lamb’s is to be introduced into one of the most attractive of
                    English literary circles, and this alone will long preserve them from
                    oblivion.</p>
                <p>The most copious source of information respecting Hazlitt is the biography by his
                    grandson (1867), a medley rather than a memoir, yet full of interest. A slight
                    but appropriate sketch had previously been prefixed by his son to the posthumous
                    essays published in 1836, accompanied by elegant but partial estimates of his
                    intellectual character by Bui wer and Talfourd. Valuable biographical
                    Eιrticulars have been preserved in Barry Cornwall’s memoirs of amb, and in the
                    reminiscences of Mr P. G. Patmore, Hazlitt’s most intimate associate in his
                    latter years. A full bibliographical list of his writings, with a collection of
                    the most remarkable critical judgments upon them from all quarters, has been
                    tastefully and industriously prepared by Mr Alexander Ireland (1868). (R.
