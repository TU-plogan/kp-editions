                    c∕3pαcoς) is a transcription of <hi rend="italic">'ebrâyâ,</hi> the Aramaic
                    equivalent of the original Old Testament word '*PJζ <hi rend="italic"
                    >'ibrι,</hi> pl. 'tδr⅛ι, which is the proper Gentile name of the people who also
                    bore the collective name of Israel or Children of Israel (B’nâ Israel). The name
                    of Israel with its sacred associations in the patriarchal history is that by
                    which the Old Testament writers prefer to designate their nation; and this
                    circumstance, combined with the fact that the Sacred Text frequently employs the
                    term Hebrews where foreigners are introduced as speaking or spoken to <hi
                    rend="italic">(f.g.,</hi> Exod. ii. 6; 1 Sam. iv. 6, 9; Gen. xl. 15; Ex. iii.
                    18), has led to the conjecture that the name of Hebrews (men from the other
                    side, <hi rend="italic">scil.</hi> of the Euphrates) was originally given to the
                    descendants of Abraham by their Canaanite neighbours, and continued to be the
                    usual designation of the Israelites among foreigners, just as the Magyars are
                    known to other Europeans as Hungarians (foreigners), as we call the High-Dutch
                    Germans (warriors), or as the Greeks gave the name of Phoenicians to the people
                    that called themselves Canaanites.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    A closer view of the case does not confirm this conjecture. The name of Israel
                    is often found in the Old Testament in the mouth of foreigners, and the whole
                    <hi rend="italic">usus loquendi</hi> is explained by the observation that the
                    Gentile noun corresponding to the collective “Israel” is regularly “Hebrew” and
                    not “Israelite,” the latter word being rare and apparently of late

                <p>The form <hi rend="italic">'ibrι</hi> is, in the language of Semitic grammarians,
                    a relative noun, presupposing the word <hi rend="italic">'Eber</hi> as the name
                    of the tribe, place, or common ancestor, from whom the Hebrews are designated.
                    Accordingly we find Eber as a nation side by side with Assyria in the obscure
                    poetical passage Num. xxiv. 24, and Eber as ancestor of the Hebrews in the
                    genealogical lists of Gen. x., xi. Here we must apparently distinguish two
                    records.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See De Goeje in

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0628-0595"/> Gen. xi. (and Gen. x. 24) Eber is the
                    great-grandson of Shein through Arphaxad, and ancestor of Terah through Peleg,
                    Reu, Serug, and Nahor. These are not to be taken a3 the names of individual men.
                    Several of them are designations of places or districts near the upper waters of
                    the Euphrates and Tigris, and among other circumstances the place at the head of
                    the series assigned to the district of Arrapachitis (Arphaxad), through which a
                    migration from Ararat to the lands occupied by the Semites in historical times
                    would first pass, suggests the probability that the genealogy is not even meant
                    to exhibit a table of ethnological affinities, but rather presents a
                    geographical sketch of the early movements of the Hebrews, who are personified
                    under the name of Eber. If this is so we can hardly venture to assert (with some
                    scholars) that the author of the list (the Levitical Elohist) extended the name
                    of Hebrews to all descendants of Terah.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Terahites, according to other testimonies, are Aramaeans
                    (Gen. xxii. 20seg ’.; Deut, xxvi. 5), but our Elohist, who can hardly have
                    written before the captivity, makes Aram a separate offshoot oi Shem, having
                    nothing to do with Eber (Gen. x. 22, 23).</p></note> The case is different with
                    another and apparently older record of which a fragment seems to be preserved in
                    Gen. x. 21, 25-30. Here there is no intermediate link between Shem and Eber.
                    Sons of Shem and sons of Eber appear to be coextensive ideas, and to the latter
                    are reckoned not only the descendants of Peleg (Aramaeans, Israelites,
                    Ishmaelite Arabs, &lt;fcc.), but the South Arabian tribes of Joktan. We possess
                    no information which casts light on this wide conception of the sons of Eber,
                    and in the ordinary language of the Old Testament Hebrew and Israelite are
                    strictly synonymous.</p>
                <p>Compare, however, the interesting conjectures of Sprenger, <hi rend="italic">Alte
                    Geographie Arabiens</hi> (Bera, 1875), p. 294, who identifies Peleg with Falag
                    in Central Arabia, and finds in the record a witness to the truth of the view
                    that Arabia is the original centre of the Semitic dispersion, a view which is
                    shared by other scholars, as Hitzig <hi rend="italic">{Geschichte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Israels,</hi> pp. 26, S9), and Schrader (Z. <hi rend="italic">D.
                    Μ. G.,</hi> 1873, pp. 397-424). In this connexion it is perhaps worth while to
                    note the Arabic Gentile name Obri, belonging to Obra, a minor division of the
                    Joktanic tribe of the Azd <hi rend="italic">{Lubb-il-l·ubdb,</hi> ed. Veth, p.

                <p>When it is recognized that Eber in Genesis is not an actual personage but an
                    ethnological or geographical abstraction, we are thrown back on etymological
                    conjecture as to the origin of the name of Hebrews. 'Eber means the further bauk
                    of a river, from a root meaning <hi rend="italic">to cross.</hi> Hence in Gen.
                    xiv. 13 the Septuagint renders Abram the Hebrew by ό τrepciπ∕ς, “the

                    generally adopted. It is, however, far from satisfactory, and almost of
                    necessity depends on the theory that the name was fixed upon the Hebrew
                    immigrants by the earlier inhabitants of Canaan.<note anchored="true"

                    (Steiner in the <hi rend="italic">Bibel-Lex.,</hi> ii. 613). This goes well with
                    Peleg (watercourse), as in Arabia we have the district Falag, so named because

                    By the Hebrew language we understand the ancient tongue of the Hebrews in Canaan

                    Aramaic passages (Jer. x. 11; Ezra iv. 8-vi. 18; vii. 12-26; Dan. ii. 4-vii.
                    28). But we do not find that this language was called Hebrew by those who spoke

                <p><hi rend="italic">Character and Philological Relations of Hebrew.—</hi> Hebrew is
                    a language of the group which since Eichhorn has generally been known as
                    Semitic, and of which Arabic and Ethiopie (Southern Semitic), the various
                    dialects of Aramaic, and the language of the Assyrian and Babylonian cuneiform
                    inscriptions are the other chief representatives. From its geographical position
                    as the language of Palestine between the Aramaeans of the north and the Arabs of
                    the south, Hebrew has been called AIiddle Semitic. Or Aramaic Assyrian and
                    Hebrew may be grouped together as Northern Semitic in contrast to Arabic and
                    Ethiopie. The affinities of the Semitic languages are so close that they may
                    fairly be compared with a sub-group of the Indo-Germanic family—for example,
                    with the Teutonic languages. The fundamental unity of the Semitic vocabulary is
                    easily observed from the absence of compounds (except in proper names) and from
                    the fact that almost all words are derived from their roots in definite patterns

                    The roots regularly consist of three consonants (seldom four or five), the
                    accompanying vowels having no radical value, but shifting according to
                    grammatical rules to express various embodiments of the root idea. The
                    triliteral roots are substantially common to the whole Semitic group, subject to
                    certain consonantal permutations, of which the most important are strikingly
                    analogous to those laid down by Grimm for the Teutonic languages.</p>

                <p>Derivation from the roots and inflexion proceed partly by the reduplication of
                    root letters and the addition of certain preformatives and afformatives (more
                    rarely by the insertion of formative consonants in the body of the root), partly
                    by modifications of the vowels with which the radicals are pronounced. Almost
                    every root expresses in its origin something that can be grasped by the senses,
                    and the mechanism by which words are formed from the root is adapted to present
                    sensible notions in a variety of <hi rend="italic">nuances</hi> and in all
                    possible embodiments and connexions, so that there are regular forms to express
                    in a single word the intensity, the repetition, the production of the root
                    idea—the place, the instrument, the time of its occurrence, and so forth. Thus
                    the expression of intellectual ideas is necessarily metaphorical, almost every
                    word being capable of a material sense or at least conveying the distinct
                    suggestion of some sensible notion. For example, the names of passione depict
                    their physiological expression; “to confer honour” means also “to make heavy,”
                    and so on. The same concrete character, the same inadequacy to convey purely
                    abstract thoughts without a substratum appealing to the senses, appears in the
                    grammatical structure of the Semitic tongues,—for example, in the absence of the
                    neuter gender, in the extreme paucity of particles, in the scanty provision for
                    the subordination of propositions, which deprives the Semitic style of all
                    involved periods and reduces it to a succession of short sentences linked by the
                    simple copula <hi rend="italic">and.</hi> The fundamental element of these
                    languages is the noun, and in the fundamental type of sentence the predicate is
                    a noun set down without any copula and therefore without distinction of past,
                    present, or future time. The finite verb is developed from nominal forms
                    (participial or infinitive), and is equally without distinction of time. Instead
                    of tenses we find two forms, the perfect and the imperfect, which are used
                    according as the speaker contemplates the verbal action as a thing complete or
                    as conditional, imperfect, or in process. It lies in the nature of this
                    distinction that the imperfect alone has moods. In their later stages the
                    languages seek to supply the lack of tenses by circumlocutions with a
                    substantive verb and participles. Other notable features common to the Semitic
                    tongues are the use of appended suffixes to denote the possessive pronouns with
                    a substantive, or the accusative of a personal pronoun with a verb, and the
                    expression of the genitive relation by what is called construction or
                    annexation, the governing noun being placed immediately before the genitive, and
                    if possible slightly shortened in pronunciation so that the two words may run
                    together as one idea. A characteristic of the later stages of the languages is
                    the resolution of this relation into a prepositional clause.</p>
                <p>Theβe and other peculiarities are sufficient to establish the original unity of
                    the group, and entitle us to postulate an original language from which all the
                    Semitic dialects have sprung. Of the relation of this language to other
                    linguistic stems, especially to the Indo-Germanic on the east and the
                    North-African languages on the west, we cannot yet speak with certainty; but it
                    appears that the present system of triliteral roots has grown out of an earlier
                    biliteral system which, so far as it can be reconstructed, must form the basis
                    of scientific inquiry into the ultimate affinities of the Semitic group.<note

                <p>Before the rise of comparative philology it was a familiar opinion that Hebrew is
                    the original speech of mankind. Taken from the Jews, and as already expressed in
                    the Palestinian Targum on Gen. xi. 1, this opinion drew its main support from
                    etymologies and other data in the earlier chapters of Genesis, which, however,
                    were as plausibly turned by Syriac writers in favour of their own tongue.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Theodoret <hi rend="italic"

                    by Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bib. Or.,</hi> iii. 314. The same opinion appears
                    among the Babylonian Jews (Rab in <hi rend="italic">Synh.,</hi> 38b).
                    Conversely, Jacob of Sarug concedes the priority of Hebrew (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> xxv., p. 520). The Arabs, whose language is in
                    many points older than either, yield priority to Hebrew (Abulfeda, <hi
                    rend="italic">IT. A.,</hi> p. IS), or to Syriac (Tabari, i., 220; Abu ’Isa in
                    Abulfeda, p. 148), the language of the race to which they owed their first
                    knowledge of letters.</p></note> Till quite recently many excellent scholars
                    (including Ewald) have claimed for Hebrew the greatest relative antiquity among
                    Semitic tongues. But though Hebrew has by far the oldest literature, this does
                    not prove that its structure comes nearest to the original Semitic language. And
                    it is now generally recognized that in grammatical structure the Arabic, shut up
                    within its native deserts till the epoch of Islam, preserved much more of the
                    original Semitic forms than either Hebrew or Aramaic. In its richer
                    vocalization, in the possession of distinct case-endings, in the use for
                    feminine nouns of the affbrmative <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> which in the
                    northern dialect has passed through <hi rend="italic">h</hi> (originally audible
                    as in Egyptian Arabic) into a mere vowel, in the more extensive range of passive
                    and modal forms, and in other refinements of inflexion, Arabic represents no
                    later development, but the original wealth and primitive subtlety of Semitic
                    speech, as appears not only from fragmentary survivals in the other dialects but
                    from an examination of the process of decay which has brought the spoken Arabic
                    of the present day into a grammatical condition closely parallel to the Old
                    Testament Hebrew. But while Arabic is in many respects the elder brother, it is
                    not the parent of Hebrew or Aramaic. Each member of the group had an independent
                    development from a stage prior to any existing language, though it would seem
                    that Hebrew did not branch off’ from Aramaic so soon as from Arabic, while in
                    its later stages it came under direct Aramaic influence.</p>
                <p>Among the points in which Hebrew differs both from Arabic and Aramaic may be
                    mentioned the consonantal relations already spoken of, the system of tone long
                    vowels, the use of Waw consecutive, the ∏ of the causative and reflexive stems
                    and of the article, and the compensation for omitting the reduplication of
                    gutturals and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> by lengthening a preceding vowel.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The verbal prefixes <hi

                    >r</hi> (Nöldeke, <hi rend="italic">Mand. Gram.,</hi> p. 17). On the other hand,
                    the transcription of the LXX. shows that Hebrew once could double r.</p></note>
                    Again, Hebrew agrees with Arabic against Aramaic in possessing a prefixed
                    article, in the use of the Nifal (Arab. vπ. ), and in other minor points. But in
                    more notable features Hebrew and Aramaic agree against Arabic, as in the absence
                    of broken plurals, the place of the accent, the aspiration of certain letters
                    whenever they are preceded by a vowel sound, and the substitution of <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> for <hi rend="italic">w</hi> as the first radical of roots.
                    To give further details would carry us too far into comparative grammar.
                    Speaking generally, it may be said that Hebreλv is less copious in vocabulary
                    than Arabic (in which tongue, however, the abundance of synonyms is largely due
                    to an artificial combination of several dialects), and less rich in subtle
                    distinctions of grammatical form and refinements of syntax. On the other hand,
                    Hebrew is much superior to Aramaic in flexibility of structure, in fulness of
                    vowels, and in all the qualities which adapt a language for poetical
                    expression.</p>

                    by proper names, as well as the acknowledged affinity of Israel with these
                    tribes, make the same thing probable for Ammon and Edom. More remarkable is the
                    fact that the Phoenicians and Canaanites, with whom the Israelites acknowledged
                    no brotherhood, spoke a language which, at <pb break="no"

                    Biblical Hebrew. This observation has been used in support of the very old idea
                    that the Hebrews originally spoke Aramaic, and changed their language in Canaan.
                    But an exacter study of the Phoenician inscriptions shows differences from
                    Hebrew which suffice to constitute a distinct dialect, and combine with other
                    indications to favour the view that the descendants of Abraham brought their
                    Hebrew idiom with them from Haran. And in this connexion it is important to
                    observe that the old Assyrian, which preceded Aramaic in regions with which the
                    book of Genesis connects the origins of Abraham, is in many respects closely
                    akin to Hebrew.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    differences of speech is proved by Judges xii. 6; but the attempt to make out in
                    the Old Testament records a northern and a Judaean dialect, or even besides'
                    these a third dialect for the Simeonites of the extreme south,<note

                    may be said that the Biblical text supplies inadequate data for studying the
                    history of the language. Semitic writing, especially a purely consonantal text
                    such as the Old Testament originally was, gives an imperfect picture of the very
                    grammatical and phonetic details most likely to vary dialectically or in course
                    of time. The later punctuation (including the notation of vowels), and even many
                    things in the present consonantal text, represent the formal pronunciation of
                    the Synagogue as it took shape after Hebrew became a dead language—for even the
                    Septuagint has often a more primitive pronunciation of proper names. This modern
                    system being applied to all parts of the Old Testament alike, many archaisms
                    were obliterated or disguised, and the earlier and later writings present in the
                    received text a grammatical uniformity which is certainly not original. It is
                    true that occasional consonantal forms inconsistent with the accompanying vowels
                    have survived—especially in the books least read by the Jews—and appear in the
                    light of comparative grammar as indications of more primitive forms. These
                    sporadic survivals show that the correction of obsolete forms was not carried
                    through with perfect consistency; but we are never safe to argue as if we
                    possessed the original form of the texts.</p>
                <p>In the Pentateuch, for example, the form Kl∏ stands not only for ΝΙΠ (3d personal
                    prom masc.) but for K'Π (the feminine). And hence a favourite argument was drawn
                    for the superior antiquity of this part of the Old Testament. But the same thing
                    is found elsewhere (Frensdorff, <hi rend="italic">Mass.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >JVörterb.,</hi> p. 233), especially in Babylonian codices of the prophets
                    (Geiger, <hi rend="italic">Urschrift,</hi> p. 236; <hi rend="italic">Z. D. Μ.
                    G.,</hi> xxviii. 676). The feminine can never by any possibility have been
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">hu,</hi> but the old orthography was probably
                    J&lt;∏ for <hi rend="italic">hu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hi</hi> alike

                <p>The chief historical changes in the Hebrew language which we can still trace are
                    due to Aramaic influence. The Northern Israelites were in immediate contact with
                    Aramaean populations and some Aramaic loan-words were used, at least in Northern
                    Israel, from a very early date. At the time of Hezekiah Aramaic seems to have
                    been the usual language of diplomacy spoken by the statesmen of Judah and
                    Assyria alike (2 Kings xviii. 26). After the fall of Samaria the Hebrew
                    population of Northern Israel was partly deported, their place being taken by
                    new colonists most of whom probably had Aramaic as their mothertongue. It is not
                    therefore surprising that even in the language of Judea increasing signs of
                    Aramaic influence appear before the Exile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    daily intercourse with a surrounding Aramaean population, aud the Aramaic
                    tongue, which was the official language of the western provinces of the Persian
                    empire, began to take rank as the recognized medium of polite intercourse and
                    letters even among tribes of Arabic blood— the Nabataeans whose inscriptions in
                    the Hauran are written in Aramaic. Thus Hebrew as a spoken language gradually
                    yielded to its more powerful neighbour, and the style of the latest Old
                    Testament writers is not only full of Aramaic words and forms but largely
                    coloured with Aramaic idioms, while their Hebrewhas lost the force and freedom
                    of a living tongue (Ecclesiastes, Esther, some Psalms, Daniel). The Chronicler
                    no longer thoroughly understood the Old Hebrew sources from which he worked,
                    while lor the latest part of his history he used a Jewish Aramaic document, part
                    of which he incorporated in the book of Ezra. Long before the time of Christ
                    Hebrew was the exclusive property of scholars, and its further history is that
                    of a merely literary language.</p>

                    Semitic nations between Assyria and Egypt—an alphabetic character in contact on
                    the east and on the west with more complicated syllabic or hieroglyphic systems,
                    from one or other of which it may possibly have been derived.</p>

                    complete before the time of Christ, for Mat. V. 16 alludes to the new form of

                    points and accents belongs to the history of the study of Hebrew as a dead
                    language. The forms of the old Semitic alphabet are most suitable to be cut on
                    stone, and indicate a special adaptation for monumental inscriptions (c∕. the
                    two tables of the Docalogue). Between the beginnings of such inscriptions and
                    the general use of writing for literary purposes a considerable period might
                    intervene. The earliest products of Hebrew authorship seem to have been lyrics
                    and laws, which would circulate in the first instance from mouth to mouth
                    without the use of written copies. We have notice of early written collections
                    of lyrics prior to our present historical books—the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    the Wars of Jehovah</hi> (Num. xκi. 14) and the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Jashar</hi> (Josh, x., 2 Sam. i). We have no clue to the age of the former book,
                    but the lines quoted from it are plainly of great antiquity. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Jashar</hi> is not earlier than the time of Solomon; for a
                    fragment from it referring to the building of the temple has been recovered from
                    the Septuagint of 1 Kings viii. (Wellhausen in Bleek, <hi rend="italic">ut
                    supra,</hi> p. 236). The earliest date of written law books is uncertain. It may
                    fairly be made a question whether Moses left in writing any other laws than the
                    commandments on the tables of stone. Even Ex. xxiv. 4 and xxxiv. 27 may in the
                    original context have referred to the ten words alone. And it is certain that
                    ancient law was handed down by oral tradition and local custom to a much later
                    date. The prophets frequently allude to the oral decisions of the priests as a
                    source of law, and the practice of appealing to the local customs of certain
                    towns is alluded to in 2 Sam. xx. 18 (as restored by Ewald from the LXX.)—“Ask
                    at Abel and at Dan whether the genuine old statutes of Israel have lost their
                    force.” In like manner the story of the early fortunes of the nation down to the
                    time of David often presents characteristics which point to oral tradition as
                    its original source. Yet written history began comparatively early. A scribe was
                    attached to the royal court from the reign of David downwards; and the older
                    parts of the books of Samuel, which must have been written not long after the
                    time of that king (see <hi rend="smallcaps">David),</hi> are framed in a
                    masterly style, which shows that the art of composition in prose was already
                    thoroughly understood. So too the best written and most brilliant part of the
                    narrative of. the Pentateuch—the combined history of the Jehovist and the
                    non-Levitical Elohist— appears to be unquestionably earlier than the rise of
                    prophetic literature in the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In this
                    narrative —itself the product of more than one writer—are included several
                    collections of old laws, so that we have between the time of David and the age
                    of Amos and Hosea a flourishing historical and legal literature, in which and in
                    lyrical collections like the <hi rend="italic">Book of Jashar</hi> were embodied
                    many poems, legends, and other remains, transmitted, whether orally or by
                    writing, from a much earlier date. To the same period may be assigned the most
                    interesting and graphic histories in the book of Kings, the splendid episode of
                    Elijah, and other remains of Ephraitic history; and to these must probably be
                    added the main stock of the Song of Solomon, though this lyric drama has
                    suffered much from interpolation, and presumably was not written down till a
                    comparatively late date and from imperfect recollection, so that its original
                    shape is very much lost. It is mainly from the admirable prose narratives, to
                    which nothing in later books can be compared, that we must judge of the first
                    bloom of Hebrew literature under the ancient kingdoms of Judah and Ephraim,
                    before the convulsions that accompanied the advance of Assyria and prior to the
                    influence of written prophecy. It is a literature eminently fresh and vivacious,
                    full of exact observation of nature’and of men, always drawing directly from
                    life, and working on the reader not by elaborate description but by dramatic
                    presentation of character and action. The authors are too intent upon the story
                    to interpose their own comments or point a moral, but they tell their tale with
                    sympathy and often with an undercurrent of dry humour. It can hardly be said
                    that the writings of this period have a specifically religious purpose.
                    Reflecting with admirable veracity the actual life of the nation they are full
                    of the relation between Israel and Jehovah, because that relation was constantly
                    present to the people as a very real fact without which the history could not be
                    told. It is to this circumstance that we owe the preservation of so large a mass
                    of early prose, which was taken over and incorporated in their works by later
                    historians who wrote with a distinctly religious purpose; while on the other
                    hand the early lyric collections have disappeared, all but a few fragments,
                    presumably because their tone was prevailingly secular. That the Hebrews once
                    possessed a poetry of high merit drawn from the themes of ordinary life appears,
                    not only from the book of Canticles and such relics as the Song of the Well
                    (Num. xxi. 17, 18), but from the names of popular airs preserved in the titles
                    of the Psalms. Thus we learn from Isa. lxv. 8 that the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Al-Taschith</hi> (Ps. lvii.) is taken from a vintage song of which the first
                    line was “Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it.” These popular songs, then,
                    survived the Exile and long continued to live in the mouths of the people. But
                    they were without interest to the later guardians of Israel’s literature, and
                    fell into oblivion when Hebrew ceased to be the vernacular of the nation. A last
                    echo of the festal songs of the Jewish maidens in the Talmud <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mishna Ta</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αηit,</hi> iv. 8, and the corresponding Gemara) shows only the total decay of
                    the popular muse.</p>
                <p>In this earliest period—the age of popular literature, as we may call it,
                    modelled upon the songs and histories that circulated orally through the
                    country—there is a remarkable preponderance of writings connected with the
                    northern kingdom, and these include the narratives that are fullest of human
                    interest and the poetry richest in colour and imagination, such as the loves of
                    Jacob and Rachel, the history of Joseph, the life of Elijah, the pictures of
                    nature <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n632/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0632-0599"/> in the Canticles. The political and social
                    superiority of Ephraim before the conflict with Assyria is reflected in the
                    literature. A new epoch begins with the rise of written prophecy in the 8th
                    century. By this time writing and literary knowledge were widely diffused (Isa.
                    viii. 1; xxx. 8; X. 19).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ingenuity can trace marks of rusticity (“imperitum sermone,” says Jerome), was a
                    simple herdsman in the wilderness of Judah. Yet it appears that the origin of
                    written prophecy was due less to the spread of education than to the rise of a
                    new school of men whose whole method . and aims were in conflict with the
                    official prophetic societies, the unworthy successors of Samuel and Elijah.</p>
                <p>In the terrible struggle with Nineveh, when the kingdom of Ephraim perished and
                    Judea seemed lost beyond hope, the new prophecy, clear of vision when all were
                    blinded, calm in its unshaken faith of ultimate victory, and pursuing with
                    unfaltering steadfastness a great purpose of righteousness, established a
                    spiritual and intellectual ascendency which is stamped on the whole literature
                    of the Assyrian and Chaldaean periods. . In the book of Deuteronomy the ancient
                    ordinances of Israel were rewritten in the prophetic spirit, and the reformation
                    carried out by Josiah on the basis of this book is the decisive proof of the
                    influence of the written word as the organ of prophetic ideas. The same
                    influence can be traced in other directions,—in psalms that express the type of
                    individual faith, and in the historical books as they were finally shaped after
                    the fall of Jerusalem, when the old popular narrative was filled out and
                    continued in a spirit of prophetic pragmatism, and with the direct object of
                    enforcing prophetic teaching. The Exile, which robbed Israel of every other
                    inheritance, gave increased value and authority to the written word, and in the
                    author of Isa. xl.-lxvi. we find a prophet who no longer appears in person
                    before his audience but does his whole work by the pen. There are other short
                    prophecies of the Babylonian age, as Isa. xiii., xiv., which seem to have been
                    first published as anonymous broadsides—a characteristic change from the method
                    of the former prophets, who wrote only what they had first spoken to the people.
                    The earliest written prophecy is nervous rhetoric of the old pregnant Hebrew
                    style interspersed with bursts of song. Even before the Exile this style had
                    undergone a change; the prophecies of Jeremiah have lost something of the old
                    force, while they display a subtler habit of reflexion and a pathos which has
                    its origin in the conflict of a sensitive and shrinking temperament with the
                    overpowering sense of prophetic duty. Jeremiah was much occupied with the dark
                    problems of providence and the meaning of the sufferings of the faithful in
                    Israel, a topic which goes beyond the sphere of the earlier prophecy, but forms
                    a chief theme of Isa. xl.-lxvi., and from a different point of view is taken up
                    and discussed in the book of Job. The last-named book is the highest utterance
                    of another characteristic form of Hebrew literature, the Chokma, that is, wisdom
                    or practical philosophy in parabolic, epigrammatic, and poetic form. The
                    earliest distinct trace of literary cultivation of this philosophy, which from
                    its nature must at first have passed unwritten from mouth to mouth, is the
                    collection of ancient proverbs by scholare in the service of Hezekiah (Prov.
                    xxv. 1). Along with the simple epigrammatic proverbs which continued to be a
                    favourite vehicle of Jewish thought long after Hebrew had given way to Aramaic,
                    the earliest form of Hebrew wisdom seems to have been the fable about plants and
                    trees (Jud. χi., 2 Kings xiv. 9, cf. 1 Kings iv. 33), so different from the
                    animal fables of Kalilag and</p>
                <p>Damnag or Sindbân, which the later Semitic literature borrowed from India. The
                    further development of the Chokma ran parallel with the progress of prophecy,
                    and though it is generally maintained that Jeremiah quotes the book of Job, it
                    is perhaps more likely that the contrary is the case, and that the latest and
                    most meditative phase of prophecy was absorbed into the poetry of the Chokma.
                    The brief revival of spoken prophecy after the Exile lacks the old fire, and
                    presents no notable literary feature except the use of somewhat fantastic
                    symbolic imagery, the prototype of the later apocalyptic literature.</p>
                <p>The decadence of prophecy and the synchronous systematization of the ceremonial
                    law on lines first drawn by Ezekiel, mark the commencement of the third and last
                    period of Hebrew literature. The age of religious productivity was past, and the
                    narrow limits and political nullity of the new Jewish settlement under the
                    Persians presented no favourable conditions for a fresh development of truly
                    national literature. The scribes took the place of the prophets, and the growth
                    of traditionalism imposed increasing restrictions on original thought. The
                    freshest and best products of this period are the post-Exile psalms, the hymns
                    of the second temple, which occupy a large part of the Psalter, and, though
                    generally inferior to the older lyrics in the highest poetical qualities, are
                    often full of the charm of genuine feeling and sweet utterance, and sometimes
                    rise to a sublime energy of devotion and faith. With these psalms the graceful
                    prose idyll of Ruth has a natural affinity. The other writings of the last age
                    are on the whole much inferior. As the language decayed, the graces of the older
                    prose style were lost. The memoirs of Ezra and Nehemiah, the colourless
                    narrative of the Chronicles, and even the book of Esther, are singularly
                    destitute of literary merit.</p>
                <p>Yet letters were sedulously cultivated. The <hi rend="italic">Midrash,</hi> or
                    sermonizing treatment of the old history which holds so large a place in later
                    Jewish literature, had come in before the time of the Chronicler, who quotes a
                    work of the kind by name—the Midrash of the Book of Kings (2 Chron. xxiv. 27,
                    <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> xiii. 22). Along with this came the beginnings of
                    Haggada, the formation of parables and tales attached to historical names, of
                    which the book of Jonah is generally taken as an early example, and which
                    attains much greater dimensions in the apocryphal additions to the Hagiographa.
                    And so at the close of the Old Testament period the author of Ecclesiastes could
                    speak of the weariness of much study and the endless sterility of bookmaking.
                    His judgment was confirmed by posterity, for of these many books scarcely a
                    trace remains.</p>

                    have seen that when the latest books of the Old Testament were written Aramaic
                    had already supplanted Hebrew as the language of common life. But the knowledge
                    of the ancient idiom was kept alive not merely by the study of the sacred books
                    but by the continued use of Hebrew for literary purposes. Several books of the
                    Apocrypha appear to be translated from Hebrew originals—Sirach, Judith, 1
                    Mac.—the last according to the express testimony of Jerome. It is even probable
                    that the Old Testament canon contains elements as late as the epoch of national
                    revival under the Maccabees (Daniel, certain Psalms), for Hebrew was the
                    language of religion as well as of scholarship. As for the scholars, they
                    affected not only to write but to speak in Hebrew; but they could not resist the
                    influence of the Aramaic vernacular, and indeed made no attempt to imitate <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n633/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0633-0600"/> the classical models of the Old Testament, which
                    neither famished the necessary terminology for the new ideas with which they
                    operated, nor offered in its forms and constructions a suitable vehicle for
                    their favourite processes of legal dialectic. Thus was developed a new
                    scholastic Hebrew, “the language of the wise” (D ’ O2Π pt½), preserving some
                    genuine old Hebrew words which happen not to be in the Bible, and supplying some
                    new necessities of expression by legitimate developments of germs that lay in
                    the classical idiom, but thoroughly interpenetrated with foreign elements and as
                    little fit for higher literary purposes as the Latin of the mediaeval schoolmen.
                    The chief monument of this dialect is the body of traditional law called the
                    Mishna, which is formed of materials of various dates, but was collected in its
                    present form about the close of the 2d Christian century. The doctors of the
                    subsequent period still retained some fluency in the use of Hebrew, but the mass
                    of their teaching preserved in the Gemara is Aramaic.<note anchored="true"

                <p>During the Talmudic period nothing was done for the grammatical study of the old
                    language, but there was a traditional pronunciation for the synagogue, and a
                    traditional interpretation of the sacred text. The earliest monument of Jewish
                    interpretation is the Septuagint, but the fiual form of traditional exegesis is
                    embodied in the Targums or Aramaic paraphrases, especially in the more literal
                    Targums of Oakelos and Jonathan, which are often cited by the Talmudic doctors.
                    Many things in the language of the Old Testament were already obscure, and the
                    meaning of words was discussed in the schools, sometimes by the aid of
                    legitimate analogies from living dialects,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See B. Rosh hash-Shana, 26b; Delitzsch on Ps. lv. 23 and

                    as the <hi rend="italic">Notam-kon,</hi> or use of analogies from shorthand.</p>
                <p>The real service rendered to Hebrew philology by the Talmudic doctors consists
                    not in what they produced but in the knowledge which they preserved from the
                    time when the idiom of the Old Testament was a living tongue. The exaggerated
                    value which their casuistic exegesis attached to every syllable and every letter
                    of the sacred books resulted in a finical preservation, not indeed of the
                    original text, but of the text which had become authoritative, and which is
                    hardly later than the 1st Christian century. And fortunately for later
                    scholarship the period immediately subsequent to the close of the Talmud (about
                    600 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> devised in the vowel points and accents a
                    means for preserving not merely the consonants of this text but the exact
                    pronunciation and intonation of the synagogue. The idea of this system of
                    punctuation appears to have been taken from a similar usage adopted in Syriac
                    MSS.; the complete development of the idea as we find it in our present Hebrew
                    Bibles must have been reached by successive steps which we cannot now trace. The
                    current punctuation is the work of the Palestinian schools; another system
                    resting on the same foundations was developed in Babylon, and is known from the
                    MSS. of the Petersburg library collected by Firkowitsch, and also from copies
                    brought from Yemen. The difference between the two systems lies more in the
                    notation than in the pronunciation, and neither punctuation can claim absolute
                    priority.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Babylonian
                    punctuation can be best studied in Strack’s facsimile (St Petersburg, 1876) of

                    Christian universities.</p>
                <p>Up to the revival of letters there was no productive Hebrew scholarship among

                    tradition. In the Middle Ages some knowledge of Hebrew was preserved in the
                    church by converted Jews and even by Christian scholars, of whom the most
                    notable were the Dominican controversialist Raymundus Martini and the Franciscan
                    Nicolaus de Lyra, through whose popular commentaries the exegesis of Rashi was

                    no continuous tradition of Hebrew study apart from the Jews, and in the 15th
                    century, when the revival of independent scholarship kindled the desire to add a
                    third learned tongue to Latin and Greek, only the most ardent zeal could conquer
                    the obstacles that lay in the way. Orthodox Jews refused to teach those who were
                    not of their faith, and on the other hand the bigotry of ignorant churchmen
                    desired nothing better than the entire suppression of Jewish learning. Even
                    books were to be had with the greatest difficulty, at least north of the Alps.
                    In Italy things were somewhat better. Jéws expelled from Spain received favour
                    from the popes. Study was facilitated by the use of the Hebrew printing press,
                    which wιs at work at Reggio as early as 1475, while the whole Hebrew Bible
                    appeared at Soncino in 1488.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the claim of Hebrew studies on scholar ship and the church.</p>
                <p>The new learning spread fast. Sebastian Münster in Heidelberg, and Paul Büchlein
                    (Fagius) at Isny, Strasburg, and Cambridge, were worthy pupils of the famous and
                    liberal Jewish scholar Levita. France drew teachers from Italy. Santes Pagninus
                    of Lucca was at Lyons; and the trilingual college of Francis I. at Paris, of
                    which Vatablus and Le Mercier soon became the ornaments, attracted among other
                    foreigners Giustiniani, bishop of Nebbio, the editor of the Genoa Psalter of
                    1516. In Rome the Jewish convert Felix Pratensis taught by invitation of Leo X.,
                    whose name and that of the more famous convert J. b. Hayyîm live mainly in
                    connexion with the great Rabbinical Bibles that issued from the Bomberg press at
                    Venice. In Spain, the old home of Jewish scholarship, Hebrew learning was
                    promoted by Cardinal Ximenes, the patron of the Complutensian Polyglot. Printing
                    presses were multiplied, and the great humanist printers, as Froben at Basel and
                    Etienne at Paris, competed with Italy in the production of Hebrew books. In
                    brief, before the middle of the 16th century the place of Hebrew studies was
                    secure throughout learned Europe, while in Protestant countries opposition to
                    the authority of the Vulgate combined with scholarly interest to make the study
                    of the original text of Scripture appear indispensable. Thus in Scotland the
                    establishment of a trilingual course in the universities is contemplated in the

                <p>For a time the best Christian scholars leaned mainly on the Rabbins. But in the
                    larger air of humanism a more independent type of learning soon arose, of which
                    Le Mercier in the 16th and Drusius in the beginning of the 17th century may be
                    taken as representatives. The importance of the ancient versions was recognized,
                    and their study was fostered by the publication of the Polyglots.</p>
                <p>In the 17th century the cognate dialects were cultivated with great vigour and
                    success by men like Selden, Castell, and Pococke in England, De Dieu in Holland,
                    Bochart in France, Ludolf and Hottinger in Germany; and these studies bore fruit
                    both for the Hebrew grammar and for the lexicon. Rabbinic learning was not
                    forgotten, and found its chief ornament in the elder Buxtorf at Basel, who was
                    also the author of grammars and a handy lexicon which long remained favourite
                    manuals in England and on the Continent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>At the same time a critical spirit arose, which involved Hebrew philology in the
                    meshes of theological controversy. The battle as to the age of the vowel points
                    has already been referred to. It was part of a larger question as to the
                    integrity of the received Hebrew text, and the legitimacy of text criticism,
                    which received dogmatic importance from the prevalence of extreme theories of
                    verbal inspiration in the Protestant Church. Thus the Protestant Cappellus found
                    his main support in the Catholic Church (Morinus, R. Simon), while the authority
                    of the Massoretic text and punctuation was elevated to a dogma in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Formula Consensus Helvetica</hi> (1675), not without protest from
                    the wiser Protestantism of France. The critical school had also its
                    extravagances, and an undue depreciation of tradition was one of several false
                    principles that it would be tedious to enumerate, which came into vogue in the
                    latter part of the 17th century, and long continued to impede the progress of
                    scientific Hebrew philology. In the beginning of the 18th century Semitic
                    studies had their chief seat in Holland, where Albert Schultens took up the
                    comparative method with fresh energy, and applied it to Hebrew on a scale which
                    gave a new shape to the study of the language.<note anchored="true"

                    emphasis on the limited extent of the Old Testament literature, which makes it
                    an inadequate record of the phenomena of the Hebrew language, and proposed to
                    supply these defects by a large use of the dialects, mainly of the Arabic, in
                    which he had wide and accurate reading. His <hi rend="italic"

                    commentaries is accumulated an enormous mass of material of the highest value
                    for the lexicographer. Schultens founded an influential school, of which
                    Schroeder was the chief ornament; but his method was easily abused, and fell
                    into discredit in the hands of arbitrary expositors like Venema. After Holland,
                    Germany became the chief seat of Hebrew studies. In Halle, where the influence
                    of Francke directed special attention to Biblical learning, there sprang up
                    contemporaneously with the Dutch school a school of Hebraists, —earnest,
                    laborious, and thorough, but somewhat jejune and deficient in aesthetic
                    sympathy,—of which the Michaelis family were the chief representatives. J. D.
                    Michaelis (1717-1791) exercised a sort of sovereignty in Hebrew letters, and the
                    stamp of Halle has left a permanent impress on the German schools, though a more
                    sympathetic and emotional type of scholarship, beginning with Herder and
                    Eichhorn, became dominant under the influence of Ewald.</p>

                <p>By the epoch-making labours of Silvestre de Sacy (1758- 1838), which first placed
                    Oriental learning and especially Semitic grammar on a broad and thoroughly
                    scientific footing, a new impulse was given to Hebrew philology, which since
                    that time has moved with the advance of general Semitic studies, and can hardly
                    again fall into devious paths. The great teachers of Hebrew in the present
                    century have been two Germans, Gesenius and Ewald,—the former excelling in
                    method and lucidity of exposition, the latter in range of view and creative
                    fertility of ideas. Among the direct or indirect disciples of these great
                    scholars may be reckoned almost every Hebraist in Europe, and to them is mainly
                    due the revival in England of a branch of learning which had almost become
                    extinct through the prevailing dilettantism of last century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Helps to the Study of Hebrew.—Grammars. —</hi> The principal
                    modern methods are those of Gesenius, Ewald, and Olshausen. Gesenius’s larger
                    work, his <hi rend="italic">Lehrgebäude der hebräischen Sprache,</hi> (Leipsic,
                    1817), is still useful for occasional reference. His smaller grammar has passed
                    through innumerable editions, and in its most recent shape, as recast by Rodiger
                    and finally by Kautzsch (1878), holds its ground as one of the best books for
                    learners. Davies’s version of Rodiger’s Gesenius is the best of several English
                    translations (1869- 1876). The method of Gesenius is mainly empirical. Much more
                    philosophic, but less simple and sometimes arbitrary in its refinements, is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ausführliches Lehrbuch</hi> of Ewald (8th ed., Gottingen,
                    1870), of which the “Syntax” has been translated into English by Kennedy (1879).
                    The shorter <hi rend="italic">Sprachlehre für Anfänger</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(4th ed.,</hi> 1874; Eng. trans, by Smith, 1870) is valuable but too difficult
                    for ordinary beginners. Olshausen’s <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch</hi> (Brunswick,
                    1861) is incomplete, the syntax having never appeared; but it is, on the whole,
                    the best and most scientific exposition of the Hebrew grammatical forms. Two
                    elementary grammars on Olshausen’s system have been translated into
                    English,—BickelΓs <hi rend="italic">Grundriss</hi> (Leipsic, 1869- 1870; English
                    by Curtiss, 1877) and Land’s <hi rend="italic">Hebreeuwsche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatica</hi> (Amsterdam, 1869; English by Poole, 1876). The
                    latter work has some peculiarities which detract from its utility, and neither
                    Bickell nor Land supplies a proper syntax. Muller’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schulgrammatik</hi> (Halle, 1878) is also mainly on Olshausen’s method with the
                    addition of an excellent syntax. In English A. B. Davidson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductory Hebrew Grammar</hi> (3d ed., Edin., 1878) may be commended to
                    beginners as a good practical method and easy introduction to the larger
                    scientific grammars. Of other more extensive works may be named Böttcher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ausführliches Lehrbuch,</hi> posthumously edited by Mühlau
                    (Leipsic, 1866-68), a huge book serving as a sort of grammatical concordance to
                    the Old Testament; Luzzatto’s Italian <hi rend="italic">Grammatica</hi> (Padua,
                    1853-69), which is valuable from the thorough Jewish scholarship of the author,

                    Green (New York, 1861). Among useful monographs on special points of grammar may

                    technical terms in the scholastic Hebrew of the Middle Ages, the best lexicon is
                    Buxtorf’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Chaldaicum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Talmudicum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rabbinicum</hi> (1640). The recent reprint is not so good. A new lexicon by
                    Levy has been in the course of publication since 1875 <hi rend="italic"
                    >{.Neu-hebräisches und Chaldäisches</hi><hi rend="italic">WorterbucK).</hi> The
                    beginner will find the <hi rend="italic">Lexicon breve
                    Rabbinico-philosophicurn</hi> appended to Buxtorf’s small <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebraicum</hi> very useful, and may also consult
                    the treatises in Reland’s <hi rend="italic">Analecta Rabbinica</hi> (1702). In
                    reading Rabbinical Hebrew it is well to have Selig’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compendia</hi><hi rend="italic">Vocum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hebraico-Rabbinicarurn</hi> (1780). The similar work of Buxtorf is less
                    full.</p>
                <p>On the whole subject of this article consult Gesenius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte der hebräischen Sprache und Schrift</hi> (Leipsic, 1817); Renan, <hi
