                    rend="italic">C. Oxyacantha,</hi> L., is a shrub or small tree having a smooth
                    blackish bark; numerous branches, beset usually with thorns, which represent
                    aborted twigs; alternate, long-stalked, obovate-wedge-shaped, 3- or 5-lobed,
                    incised or serrate smooth leaves; flowers sweet-scented, arranged in corymbs,
                    and having caducous bracts, broad, white, pink, or scarlet petals, and 1 to 3
                    styles; and fruit or “haw” an oblong or nearly globular mealy pome, commonly
                    dark red, but occasionally yellow, black, or even greenish-orange or dull white,
                    and of 1 or 2 cells. The common hawthorn is a native of Europe as far north as
                    60⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> in Sweden, and of North Africa, Western Asia,
                    and Siberia, and has been naturalized in North America and Australia. It thrives
                    best in dry soils, and in height varies from 4 or 5 to 12, 15, or, in
                    exceptional cases, as much as between 20 and 30 feet. There are several
                    varieties of the plant. It may be propagated from seed or from cuttings. The
                    seeds must be from ripe fruit, and if fresh gathered should be freed from pulp
                    by maceration in water. They germinate only in the second year after sowing; in
                    the course of their first year the seedlings attain a height of 6 to 12 inches.
                    In England the hawthorn has been employed for enclosure of land since the Roman
                    occupation, but for ordinary field-hedges it is believed it was not generally in
                    use till about the end of the 17th century. James I. of »Scotland, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Quair,</hi> ii. 14 (early 15th century), mentions the “hawthorn
                    hedges knet” of Windsor Castle. The first hawthorn hedges in Scotland are said
                    to have been planted by soldiers of Cromwell at Inch Buckling Brae in East
                    Lothian, and Finlarig in Perthshire. On the planting and use of hawthorn fences,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> vol. i. pp. 296, 310. The wood of the
                    hawthorn is white in colour, with a yellowish tinge. Fresh cut it weighs 68 lb
                    12 oz. per cubic foot, and dry 57 lb 3 oz. It can seldom be obtained in large
                    portions, and has the disadvantage of being apt to warp; its great hardness,
                    however, renders it valuable for the manufacture of various articles, such as
                    the cogs of mill-wheels, flails and mallets, and handles of hammers. Both green
                    and dry it forms excellent fuel. The bark possesses tanning properties, and in
                    Scotland in past times yielded with ferrous sulphate a black dye for wool. The
                    leaves are eaten by cattle, and have been employed as a substitute for tea.
                    Birds and deer feed upon the haws, which are used in the preparation of a
                    fermented and highly intoxicating liquor, and for their astringency are
                    sometimes resorted to in dysentery. The hawthorn serves as a stock for grafting
                    other trees. As an ornamental feature in landscapes, it is worthy of notice; and
                    the pleasing shelter it affords, and the beauty of its blossoms, have frequently
                    been alluded to by poets. The custom of employing the flowering branches for
                    decorative purposes on the first of May is of very early origin; but since the
                    alteration in the calendar (see vol. iv. p. 677) the tree has rarely been in
                    full bloom in England before the second week of that month. In Cornwall,
                    however, in 1846, the flowers, though scarce, were gathered on the 18th April;
                    and in the Scotch Highlands they may be seen as late as the middle of June. The
                    hawthorn has been regarded as the emblem of hope, and its branches are stated to
                    have been carried by the ancient Greeks in wedding processions, and to have been
                    used by them to deck the altar of Hymen. The supposition that the tree was the
                    source of Christ’s crown of thorns gave rise doubtless to the tradition current
                    among the French peasantry that it utters groans and cries on Good Friday, and
                    probably also to the old popular superstition in Great Britain and Ireland that
                    ill-luck attended the uprooting of hawthorns. Branches of the Glastonbury thorn,
                    <hi rend="italic">C. Oxyacantha,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">proecox,</hi> which
                    flowers both in December and in spring, were formerly highly valued in England,
                    on account of the legend that the tree was originally the staff of Joseph of
                    Arimathea (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Glastonbury,</hi> vol. x. pp. 674, 675).
