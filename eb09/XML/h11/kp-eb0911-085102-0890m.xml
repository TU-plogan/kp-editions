                    of the <hi rend="italic">History and Topography of the United States</hi> and
                    other works, was born at Reading in 1822. He was educated at his grandfather’s
                    school near Oxford, and at the Nonconformist school at Harpenden, and in 1838,
                    on his father’s removal to London, was apprenticed to a woollendraper in
                    Whitechapel, where he came into contact with a phase of human life in its
                    miserable and degraded forms which influenced powerfully the whole cast of his
                    after thought. After retaining this situation about a year he became clerk in an
                    insurance office. The most of his evenings were spent by him in intense study,
                    and this, joined to the ardour, amounting to morbidness, of his interest in
                    moral problems, so affected his health that in his nineteenth year he resolved
                    to seek refuge from his own thoughts by running away to sea. His intention
                    having, however, been discovered, he was sent, on the advice of the physician
                    who was consulted regarding his health, to St Bartholomew’s Hospital to study
                    for the medical profession. After receiving his diploma in 1847, he was for some
                    time assistant surgeon at Newport, Essex, but the same year he went out to
                    Sierra Leone to take medical charge of the free labourers on their voyage thence
                    to Jamaica, after which his interest in their welfare prompted him to remain a
                    year on the island. After his return to England in 1850, he entered into
                    partnership with a surgeon in London, where he soon had his interest awakened
                    specially in aural surgery, and gave also much of his attention to physiology
                    and to problems bearing on the relation between mind and body. In his practice
                    he became convinced that in the immense majority of cases of ill-health it was
                    the hope of cure rather than the drug that effected the remedy, a fact which
                    explained to him much of the success of homoeopathy, and induced him to lay the
                    principal stress on moral methods of cure. He made his first appearance as an
                    author in 1856 by contributing a series of papers on physiological and ethical
                    subjects to the <hi rend="italic">Christian Spectator</hi>; and the success of
                    his work <hi rend="italic">Man and his Dwelling Place,</hi> which appeared in
                    1858, determined him, notwithstanding that he had married in 1852, to give up
                    his medical practice in order to devote his whole attention to writing on those
                    practical moral problems which chiefly occupied his thoughts. A series of papers
                    entitled “Physiological Riddles,” which he contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cornhill Magazine,</hi> and afterwards published under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Life in Nature,</hi> as well as another series entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoughts on Health,</hi> written for the same periodical and
                    collected and published separately in 1871, gave evidence of great aptitude in
                    popular scientific exposition; but his interest in speculation was too absorbing
                    to permit him to apply himself with sufficient pertinacity to literary work, and
                    after a year’s trial of it he found it necessary to resume his profession. In
                    1863 he obtained the appointment of aural surgeon to Guy’s Hospital, after which
                    he speedily acquired a lucrative west-end practice, and the reputation of being
                    the most skilful aural surgeon of his day, a reputation fully borne out by his
                    works, <hi rend="italic">An Atlas of Diseases of the Memhrana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tympani</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Questions of Aural
                    Surgery,</hi> which are regarded as the chief authorities in this branch of
                    surgery. The skill he had now obtained in his profession seemed to justify him
                    in 1869 in resuming his philosophical studies, but the mental excitement thus
                    produced, added to his professional labours, appears to have inflicted permanent
                    injury on his brain; and, although by giving up his practice in 1874 he obtained
                    partial relief, he began to suffer from sleeplessness and depression, and died
                    of acute inflammation of the brain, 16th December 1875.</p>
                <p>In addition to the works already mentioned, Hinton was the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mystery of Man,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Place of the
                    Physician.</hi> On account of their fresh and vigorous discussion of many of the
                    important moral and social problems of the time, his writings have had a wide
                    circulation on both sides of the Atlantic. He contributed also several papers to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi> and other periodicals. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Letters,</hi> edited by Ellice Hopkins, with an
                    introduction by Sir W. W. Gull, appeared in 1878.</p>
