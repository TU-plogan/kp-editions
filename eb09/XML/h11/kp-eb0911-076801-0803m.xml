                    Bart</hi></label>. (1792-1871), the illustrious astronomer, the only son of Sir
                    F. William Herschel, was born at Slough, Bucks, in the year 1792. His early home
                    was a singular one, and eminently adapted to nurture into greatness any child
                    born, as he was, with natural gifts capable of wide development. The examples
                    about him were those of silent but ceaseless industry, busied about things
                    which, at the first view, seemed to have no apparent connexion with the world
                    outside the walls of his abode, but which, at a mature period of his life, he,
                    with rare eloquence, taught his countrymen to appreciate as foremost among those
                    influences which satisfy and exalt the nobler instincts of our nature.</p>
                <p>His scholastic education commenced at Eton, but maternal fears or prejudices soon
                    removed him to the house of a private tutor. Thence, at the early age of
                    seventeen, he was sent to St John’s College, Cambridge, and the form and method
                    of the mathematical instruction he there received exercised a material influence
                    on the whole complexion of his scientific career. In due time the young student
                    acquired the highest academical distinction of his year, graduating as senior
                    wrangler. It was during his undergraduateship that he and two of his
                    fellow-students who subsequently attained to very high eminence in their
                    respective careers of life, Dean Peacock and Mr Babbage, entered into a sort of
                    moral compact that they would “do their best to leave the world wiser than they
                    found it,”—a compact loyally and successfully carried out by all three to the
                    end. As a commencement of this laudable attempt we find Herschel associated with
                    these two friends in the production of a work on the differential calculus, and
                    on cognate branches of mathematical science, which changed the whole style and
                    aspect of mathematical learning in England, and brought it up to the level of
                    the Continental methods. Two or three memoirs communicated to the Royal Society
                    on new applications of mathematical analysis at once placed him in the front
                    rank of the cultivators of this branch of knowledge. Of these his father had the
                    gratification of introducing the first, but the others were presented in his own
                    right as a fellow.</p>
                <p>His first intention had been to study for the bar, and with this view he left the
                    university, and placed himself under the guidance of an eminent special pleader
                    of that day. Probably this -temporary choice of a profession arose from the
                    extraordinary success which for some time had attended the efforts of so many
                    eminent Cambridge mathematicians in legal pursuits. Be that as it may, an early
                    acquaintance with Dr Wollaston in London soon changed the direction of his
                    studies. In 1820, assisted by his father, he completed a mirror of 18 inches
                    diameter and 20 feet focal length, for a reflecting telescope. This,
                    subsequently improved by his own hands, became the instrument which enabled him
                    to effect the astronomical observations which, more than any other of his great
                    works, form the basis of his fame. In 1821-23 we find him associated with Mr
                    South in the re-examination of his father’s double stars, by the aid of an
                    achromatic telescope and other appliances, the like of which for excellence and
                    power had not hitherto been collected. For this work in 1826 he received the
                    recognition of the Astronomical Society by the award of their gold medal; the
                    French Institute also presented him with the Lalande medal for the same
                    contribution to astronomical science. It ought also to be mentioned that in 1821
                    the Royal Society had presented him with the Copley medal for his mathematical
                    contributions to their <hi rend="italic">Transactions.</hi> From 1824 to 1827 he
                    held the distinguished and responsible post of secretary to that society. In
                    1827 he was elected to the chair of the Astronomical Society, which office he
                    also filled on two subsequent occasions. In the course of the discharge of his
                    important offices in the last-named society he ennobled its literature by his
                    memorable presidential addresses and obituary notices of deceased fellows,
                    which, it is not too much to say, are, by their combination of eloquence and
                    wisdom, the chief adornments of their printed memoirs. In 1831 the honour of
                    knighthood was conferred on him by William IV., and two years later he again
                    received the recognition of the Royal Society by the award of one of their
                    medals for his memoir “On the Investigation of the Orbits of Revolving Double
                    Stars.” There is a significance in this award; the father had been the original
                    discoverer of the extension of gravitation to the remotest boundaries of the
                    visible universe, and the son had now put the crowning stone to this edifice of
                    discovery by the invention of a graphical method whereby the eye could as it w
                    ere see the two component stars of the binary system revolving before it, after
                    the regularity of the Newtonian law.</p>
                <p>Before the end of the year 1833, being then about forty years of age, Sir John
                    Herschel had re-examined all his father’s discoveries of double stars and
                    nebulae, and had added many similar bodies to his own list; this alone
                    constituted a gigantic work even for the lifetime of any astronomer in that day.
                    For it should be remembered that the astronomer was not as yet provided with
                    those curious and valuable automatic contrivances for observing and for
                    recording observations which at present most materially abridge the labour and
                    increase the accuracy of astronomical work such as that in which Sir John had
                    been engaged. And he had no assistant. Equatorial clocks for turning the
                    telescope, electrical chronographs for recording the times of the phenomena
                    observed, were at that date unknown.</p>
                <p>His scientific life now entered another and very characteristic phase. The bias
                    of his mind, as he subsequently was wont to declare, was towards chemistry and
                    the phenomena of light, rather than towards astronomy. Indeed, very shortly
                    after taking his academical degree at Cambridge, he proposed himself as a
                    candidate for the vacant <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0804-0769"/> chair of chemistry in that university; but, as he
                    said with some humour, the result of the election was that of the votes he had a
                    glorious minority of one. In fact Herschel had become an astronomer from a sense
                    of duty, just as his father had become one by fascination and fixed resolve;
                    hence it was by filial loyalty to his father’s memory that he was now impelled
                    to undertake the completion of that work which at Slough had been so grandly
                    commenced. William Herschel had explored the northern heavens; John Herschel
                    determined to explore the heavens of the south, as well as re-explore the north.
                    “I resolved,” he said, “to attempt the completion of a survey of the whole
                    surface of the heavens; and for this purpose to transport into the other
                    hemisphere the same instrument which had been employed in this, so as to give a
                    unity to the results of both portions of the survey, and to render them
                    comparable with each other.” In accordance with this resolution, he and his
                    family embarked for the Cape on the 13th November 1833; they arrived in Table
                    Bay on the 15th January 1834; and proceedings, he says, “were pushed forward
                    with such effect that on the 22d of February I was enabled to gratify my
                    curiosity by a view of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> Crucis, the nebula about <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> Argus, and some other remarkable objects in the 20-foot
                    reflector, and on the night of the 4th of March to commence a regular course of
                    sweeping.”</p>
                <p>To give an adequate description of the vast mass of labour completed during the
                    next four busy years of his life at Feldhausen would require the transcription
                    of a considerable portion of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Observations,</hi> a
                    volume which probably is not surpassed in varied interest or astronomical
                    importance by any scientific work in existence; although it might perhaps be
                    equalled by a judicious selection from Sir William’s “Memoirs,” now scattered in
                    some thirty volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> It
                    was published, at the sole expense of the late duke of Northumberland, but not
                    till 1847, nine years after the author’s return to England, for the very cogent
                    reasons assigned by himself :—‘ ‘ The whole of the observations, as well as the
                    entire work of reducing, arranging, and preparing them for the press, have been
                    executed by myself.” There are 164 pages of catalogues of southern nebulae and
                    clusters of stars. There are then careful and elaborate drawings of the southern
                    appearance of the great nebula in Orion, and of the region surrounding the
                    remarkable star of Argo. The labour and the thought bestowed upon some of these
                    objects are almost incredible; several months were well spent upon a minute spot
                    in the heavens containing 1216 stars, but which an ordinary spangle, held at a
                    distance of an arm’s length, would eclipse. These catalogues and charts being
                    completed, he proceeds to discuss their significance, wlιich in the eyes of
                    science possesses an absorbing interest. He confirms his father’s hypothesis
                    that these wonderful masses of glowing vapours are not irregularly scattered,
                    and without apparent law, hither and thither in the visible heavens, but are
                    collected in a sort of canopy, whose vertex is at the pole of that vast stratum
                    of stars in which our solar system finds its position,—buried in it, as he
                    supposes, at a depth not greater than that of the average distance from us of an
                    eleventh magnitude star. Then follows his catalogue of the relative positions
                    and magnitudes of the southern double stars. And he applies to one of them, γ
                    Virginis, that beautiful graphical method invented by himself, whereby he
                    determines the orbit of the two components round each other; and he had the
                    satisfaction of witnessing with his own eyes the fulfilment of a prediction he
                    had made some years before, viz., that the two stars would, in the course of
                    their orbital movements, appear to close up into a single star, inseparable by
                    any telescopic power. The double stars and their stately revolutions and
                    lustrous colours dismissed, in the next chapter he proceeds to describe the
                    observations which he had made on their varying and relative brightness. It has
                    been already detailed how his father commenced his scientific career by similar
                    observations on the varying magnitudes of many stars, and how his remarks
                    culminated years afterwards in the question whether the variation of the lustre
                    of our sun, by the presence or absence of sun spots, affected our harvests and
                    the price of corn. The son carries his speculations backwards to a still more
                    philosophical depth. The variation from time to time, he remarks, in the lustre
                    of our sun, to the extent of half a magnitude, would account for those strange
                    alternations of a semi-arctic and semi-tropical climate which geological
                    researches have disclosed as having occurred in various regions of our
                    globe.</p>
                <p>Herschel returned to his English home in the spring of 1838. As was natural and
                    honourable to all concerned, he was welcomed with an enthusiastic greeting. By
                    the queen at her coronation he was created a baronet; and, what to him was
                    better than all such rewards, other men caught the contagion of his example, and
                    laboured in fields similar to his own, with an adequate portion of his success.
                    In particular Mr Lassell transported a telescope as large as the celebrated
                    Herschelian telescope to Malta, where with excellent results he “minded the
                    heavens” for the space of four years. He was rewarded there, and at his own
                    English residence near Liverpool, by the discovery of new satellites of Saturn
                    and of Uranus, constituting what Sir John Herschel, animated by a fraternal
                    sympathy, well called an epoch in astronomy. Mr De La Rue also, at Islington and
                    at Cranford, followed zealously and successfully in the wake of the same
                    infectious enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>Herschel was a highly accomplished chemist. His discovery of the solvent power of
                    hyposulphite of soda on the otherwise insoluble salts of silver, in 1819,
                    exercised a most important influence on the practical applications of
                    photography twenty years afterwards; and in 1839, the natal era of that valuable
                    art, he, independently of Mr Fox Talbot, had discovered the means of taking and
                    multiplying photographic pictures, and early in the spring of that year
                    exhibited more than twenty photographic pictures to the Royal Society, including
                    one of the old 40-foot telescope. He was the first person to introduce the now
                    well-known terms <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative</hi> in photographic images, and to deposit upon glass a sensitized
                    film for the reception of the picture. He also paved the way for Professor
                    Stokes’s important discovery of the change which luminous waves may suffer in
                    their period of oscillation, by his addition of the lavender rays to the
                    spectrum, and by his announcement of “epipolic dispersion,” as exhibited by
                    sulphate of quinine. Several other important and successful researches of his,
                    connected with the undulatory theory of light, are scattered through the pages
                    of his treatise on “Light” published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia</hi><hi rend="italic">Metropolitana.</hi></p>
                <p>To the other varied accomplishments of his gifted mind we must add the graces of
                    a deep poetic feeling. Perhaps no man can become a truly great mathematician or
                    great philosopher, if unendowed with the versatile powers of the imagination.
                    John Herschel possessed this endowment to a large extent; and he had reserved
                    for himself as a solace and enjoyment in old age the translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> into verse. He had at an earlier period of life
                    translated in a similar manner Schiller’s <hi rend="italic">Walk.</hi> But the
                    main work of his declining years was the collection of all his father’s
                    catalogues, combined with his own observations and those of other astronomers of
                    nebulae and double stars, each into a single volume. He lived to complete the
                    former, and to present it to the Royal Society, who have published it in a
                    separate form in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> The
                    latter work he had not fully completed at his death; but he bequeathed as much
                    of it as was finished to the Astronomical Society. That society has printed a
                    portion of it, which serves as an index to the observations of various
                    astronomers on double stars up to the year 1866.</p>
                <p>A complete list of his various contributions to learned societies will be found
                    in the Royal Society’s great catalogue, and from them may be gathered most of
                    the records of his busy scientific life. Sir John Herschel met with an amount of
                    public recognition which was unusual in the time of his illustrious father.
                    Naturally he was a member of almost every important learned society in both
                    hemispheres. For five years he held the office of master of the mint, the same
                    appointment which, more than a century before, had been occupied by Sir Isaac
                    Newton; his friends also offered to propose him as president of the Royal
                    Society and again as a member of parliament for the university of Cambridge, but
                    neither office was withiu the scope of his own desires.</p>

                <p>Iu private life Sir John Herschel was a firm and most active friend; he had no
                    jealousies; he avoided all scientific feuds; he gladly accorded a helping hand
                    to those who consulted him in scientific difficulties; he never discouraged, and
                    still less disparaged, men younger than or inferior to himself; he was pleased
                    when his own work was appreciated, but that was never an object of his
                    solicitude: it was said of him by a discriminating critic, and without
                    extravagance, that “his was a life full of the serenity of the sage and the
                    docile innocence of a child.”</p>
                <p>He died at Collingwood, his residence near Hawkhurst in Kent, May 11, 1871, in
                    the seventy-ninth year of his age, and his remains are interred in Westminster
                    Abbey close to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
                <p>Sir John Herschel, independently of the labours connected with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cape Observations,</hi> was the author of several books, one of
                    which at least, <hi rend="italic">On the Study of Natural Philosophy</hi>
                    (1830), possesses an interest which no future advances of the subjects on which
                    he wrote can obliterate from the attention of thoughtful men in any age. In 1849
                    came the <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Astronomy,</hi> of which it is enough to
                    say that, notwithstanding the obvious disadvantage arising from the practice of
                    stereotyping text-books which relate to progressive sciences, there is no more
                    instructive volume extant on the subject of which it treats. His articles,
                    “Meteorology,” “Physical Geography,” and ‘ ‘ Telescope,” contributed to the 8th
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopoedia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannica,</hi> were afterwards published separately. There is also another
                    very valuable little book, which originated from a happy peculiarity of Sir John
                    Herschel’s dignified simplicity and truthfulness of mind. When he was at the
                    Cape he more than once assisted in the attempts there made to diffuse a love of
                    knowledge. among men not engaged in literary pursuits. In one of his addresses
                    he, with a kindly and far-seeing wisdom, told his audience that the advance of a
                    nation’s intelligence or a nation’s fame did not depend upon a few successful
                    philosophers toiling in their lonely studies, and gathering great reputations
                    for their learning or their discoveries, but that a nation’s progress rather lay
                    in the diffusion of their knowledge among the masses of the population. Acting
                    practically on this principle, he, on his return to England, published, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Good Words</hi> and elsewhere, a series of papers on interesting
                    points of natural philosophy, which have since been collected in a volume called
                    <hi rend="italic">Familiar Lectures on Scientific Subjects.</hi> None but a deep
                    thinking philosopher could have written this book; none but a clear thinking
                    master of his subjects could have made it what it is, enticingly intelligible.
                    Another volume of his, not so widely known to the public as any of the above
                    works, is his <hi rend="italic">Collected Addresses,</hi> in which he is seen in
                    his happiest and most instructive mood, walking, as it were, at liberty among
                    sympathizing associates, in his own fields, and enamoured of their beauties.
