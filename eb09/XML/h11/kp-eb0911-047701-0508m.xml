                    and received a bias to German literature which influenced his style and
                    sentiments throughout his whole career. On the death of his mother in 1806,
                    Julius was sent home to the Charterhouse in London, where he remained till 1812,
                    when he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. There he became fellow in 1818, and
                    after some time spent abroad he began to read law in London in the following
                    year. In 1822 he was appointed assistant-tutor at Trinity College, which
                    position he retained for ten years. Turning his attention from law to divinity,
                    Hare took priest’s orders in 1826; and, on the death of his uncle in 1832, he
                    succeeded to the rich family living of Hurstmonceaux in Sussex, where he
                    accumulated a library of some 12,000 volumes, especially rich in German
                    literature. Before taking up residence on his parish he once more went abroad,
                    and made in Rome the acquaintance of the Chevalier Bunsen, who afterwards
                    dedicated to him part of his work, <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and his Age.</hi> In 1840 Hare was appointed archdeacon of Lewes,
                    and in the same year preached a course of sermons at Cambridge <hi rend="italic"

                    great popularity. Archdeacon Hare married in 1844. In 1851 he was collated to a
                    prebend in Chichester; and in 1853 he became one of the queen’s chaplains. He
                    died January 23, 1855.</p>
                <p>Julius Hare belonged to what has been called the “Broad Church party,” though
                    some of his opinions approach very closely to those of the Evangelical Arminian
                    school, while others again seem vague and undecided. He was one of the first of
                    his countrymen to recognize and come under the influence of German thought and
                    speculation, and, amidst an exaggerated alarm of German heresy, did much to
                    vindicate the authority of the sounder German critics. His writings, which are
                    chiefly theological and controversial, are largely formed of charges to his
                    clergy, and sermons on different topics; but, though valuable and full of
                    thought, they lose some of their force by the cumbrous German structure of the
                    sentences, and by certain orthographical peculiarities in which the author
                    indulged. In 1827 <hi rend="italic">Guesses at Truth by Two Brothers</hi><note
