                <p><label type="entry">HARRIER, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hen-Harrier</hi></label>,
                    name given to certain birds of prey which were formerly very abundant in parts
                    of the British Islands, from their habit of harrying poultry. The first of these
                    names has now become used in a generic sense for all the species ranked under
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Circus</hi> of Lacépède, and the second confined to
                    the particular species which is the <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> of Linnaeus and the <hi rend="italic">Circus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> of modern ornithologists.</p>
                <p>On the wing Harriers have much resemblance to Buzzards, using the same flapping
                    stroke of the pinions, and wheeling or sailing aloft as they fly. One European
                    species indeed, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">oeruginosus,</hi>
                    though called in books the Marsh-Harrier, is far more commonly known in England
                    and Ireland as the Moor-Buzzard. But Harriers are not, like Buzzards, arboreal
                    in their habits, and always affect open country, generally, though not
                    invariably, preferring marshy or fenny districts, for snakes and frogs form a
                    great part of their ordinary food. On the ground their carriage is utterly
                    unlike that of a Buzzard, and their long wing3 and legs <pb break="no"

                    taken in the hand. All the species also have a more or less well-developed ruff
                    or frill of small thickset feathers surrounding the lower part of the head,
                    nearly like that seen in Owls, and accordingly many systematists consider that
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Circus,</hi> though undoubtedly belonging to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Falconidoe,</hi> connects that Family with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Striges.</hi> No osteological affinity, however, can be established between the
                    Harriers and any section of the Owls, and the superficial resemblance will have
                    to be explained in some other way. Harriers are found almost all over the
                    world,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The distribution
                    of the different species is rather curious, while the range of some is
                    exceedingly wide,—one, <hi rend="italic">C. rnαillαrdi,</hi> seems to be limited
                    to the island of Reunion (Bourbon).</p></note> and fifteen species are
                    recognized by Mr Sharpe <hi rend="italic">(Cat. Birds Brit. Museum,</hi> i. pp.
                    50-73). In most if not all the Harriers the sexes differ greatly in colour, so
                    much so that for a long while the miles and females of one of the commonest and
                    best known, the <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> above
                    mentioned, were thought to be distinct species, and were or still are called in
                    various European languages by different names. The error was maintained with the
                    greater persistency since the young males, far more abundant than the adults,
                    wear much the same plumage as their mother, and it was not until after Montagu’s
                    observations were published at the beginning of the present century that the
                    “Ringtail,” as she was called (the <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pygargus</hi> of Linnaeus), was generally admitted to be the female of the
                    “Hen-Harrier.” But this was not Montagu’s only good service as regards this
                    genus. He proved the hitherto unexpected existence of a second species,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A singular mistake, which has
                    lately been productive of further error, was made by Albin, who drew his figure
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Birds,</hi> ii., pl. 5) from a specimen of one species,
                    and coloured it from a specimen of the other.</p></note> subject to the same
                    diversity of plumage. This was called by him the Ash-coloured Falcon, but it now
                    generally bears his name, and is known as Montagu’s Harrier, <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">cineraceus.</hi> In habits it is very similar to the
                    Hen-Harrier, but it has longer wings, and its range is not so northerly, for
                    while the Hen-Harrier extends to Lapland, Montagu’s is but very rare in
                    Scotland, though in the south of England it is the most common species. Harriers
                    indeed in the British Islands are rapidly becoming things of the past. Their
                    nests are easily found, and the birds when nesting are easily destroyed. In the
                    south-east of Europe, reaching also to the Cape of Good Hope and to India, there
                    is a fourth species, the <hi rend="italic">C. swaiηsoηi</hi> of some writers,
                    the <hi rend="italic">C. pallidus</hi> of others. In North America <hi
                    rend="italic">C. cyaneus</hi> is represented by a kindred form, <hi
                    rend="italic">C. hudsοnius,</hi> usually regarded as a good species, the adult
                    male of which is always to be recognized by its rufous markings beneath, in
                    which character it rather resembles <hi rend="italic">C. cineraceus,</hi> but it
                    has not the long wing3 of that species. South America has in <hi rend="italic"
                    >C. cinereus</hi> another representative form, while China, India, and Australia
                    possess more of this type. Thus there is a section in which the males have a
                    strongly contrasted black and grey plumage, and finally there is a group of
                    larger forms allied to the European <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oerugïnosus,</hi> wherein a grey dress is less often attained, of which the
                    South African <hi rend="italic">C. ranivorus</hi> and the New’Zealand <hi
                    rend="italic">C. gouldi</hi> are examples. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
