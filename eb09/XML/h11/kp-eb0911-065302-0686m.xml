                    attending the grammar schools of Melton and Oakham, he in his seventeenth year
                    entered St John’s College, Cambridge, and while still an undergraduate he
                    addressed in February 1712, under the pseudonym of Peter de Quir, a letter to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> displaying no small wit and humour. After
                    graduating B. A, he became assistant and then head-master of the grammar school
                    of his native town, uniting to these duties those also of assistant curate. His
                    superabundant energy was not, however, fully consumed by this plurality of
                    offices, for besides publishing in 1714 a poem entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esther, Queen of Persia,</hi> containing many vigorous and eloquent passages,
                    he also devoted his attention to the compilation of a grammar of ten languages
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Complete Linguist</hi> (2 vols., London,
                    1719-21). In his school he is said to have introduced many new methods of study,
                    but whether it was that his innovations were not sufficiently appreciated, or
                    that he desired a wider sphere for the exercise of his exceptional abilities, he
                    resolved to place his services at the disposal of the metropolis, where he
                    arrived with thirty recommendatory letters from some of the most influential
                    persons of his native county. He succeeded in obtaining the appointment of
                    assistant preacher in the chapels of Ormond Street and Bloomsbury, and in 1723
                    was presented to the rectory of Chelmondiston in Suffolk; but residence being
                    insisted on, he resigned both his appointments, and on July 3, 1726, opened what
                    he called an “oratory” in Newport Market, which he licensed under the Toleration
                    Act. Into his services he introduced many peculiar alterations: he drew up a
                    “Primitive Liturgy,” in which he substituted for the Nicene and Athanasian
                    creeds two creeds taken from the apostolical constitutions; for his “Primitive
                    Eucharist” he made use of unleavened bread and mixed wine; he distributed at the
                    price of one shilling medals of admission to his oratory, with the device of a
                    sun rising to the meridian, with the motto <hi rend="italic">Ad summa,</hi> and
                    the words <hi rend="italic">Inveniam viam aut faciam</hi> below. But the most
                    original element in the services was Henley himself, who is described by Pope in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dundad</hi> as “Preacher at once and zany of his age.”</p>
                <p>He possessed some oratorical ability and adopted a very theatrical style of
                    elocution, “tuning his voice and balancing his hands;” and his addresses were a
                    strange medley of solemnity and buffoonery, of clever wit and the wildest
                    absurdity, of able and original disquisition and the worst artifices of the
                    oratorical charlatan. His services were much frequented by the “freethinkers,”
                    and he himself expressed his determination “to die a rational.” Besides his
                    sermons on Sunday he delivered on Wednesday lectures chiefly on social and
                    political subjects; and he also projected a scheme for connecting with the
                    “oratory” a university on quite a novel plan, and intended to be, in a sense too
                    utopian to be realized, the foster-mother of the arts and sciences. For some
                    time he edited the <hi rend="italic">Hyp Doctor,</hi> a weekly paper established
                    in opposition to the <hi rend="italic">Craftsman,</hi> and for this service he
                    enjoyed a pension of £100 a year from Sir Robert AValpole. At first the orations
                    of Henley drew great crowds, but, although he never discontinued his services,
                    his audience latterly dwindled almost entirely away. He died 13th October
                    1759.</p>
                <p>Henley is the subject of several of Hogarth’s prints. His life, professedly
                    written by A. Welstede, but in all probability by himself, was inserted by him
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Oratorical Transactions.</hi> See Nichol’s <hi
