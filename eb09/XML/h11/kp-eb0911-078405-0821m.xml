                    cosmography <hi rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi> geography) with such acceptance that
                    his associates made him fellow of Magdalen. The lectures, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Microcosmos,</hi> were published in 1621; and many editions of
                    this useful book, each somewhat enlarged, subsequently appeared, until scarcely
                    any scholar’s library was without a copy. In 1625 he published his observations
                    on a journey to France. This book—which was frequently reprinted— Southey termed
                    “one of our liveliest books of travel in its lighter parts, and one of the
                    wisest and most replete with information that was ever written by a young man.”
                    After obtaining the patronage of Laud, whose life he wrote, Heylin was made
                    chaplain to Charles I. His legendary and learned <hi rend="italic">History of St
                    George of Cappadocia</hi> procured for him the rectory of Hemmingford, Hunts;
                    his hearty attachment to the High-Anglican party brought many other preferments;
                    and his analysis of Prynne’s <hi rend="italic">Histriomastix</hi> was rewarded
                    by the rectory of Islip. He was also made a prebendary of Westminster (9th
                    November 1631), treasurer to the chapter (1637), and subsequently sub-dean. Here
                    he was the bitter opponent of the rule of Bishop Williams, the commendatory
                    dean. With great ardour Heylin entered into the religious controversies which
                    preceded the war, being equally hostile to the Puritan element within and
                    without the church. He was consequently singled out for punishment by the
                    committees of the Long Parliament, who deprived him of benefices worth £800, and
                    heavily fined him. An amusing anecdote he tells affords proof of his
                    unpopularity in London, and at the same time shows how his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cosmography</hi> was appreciated. As he passed along the street a fellow
                    “shouldered” him with the remark, “Geography is better than Divinity.” For seven
                    years, he says, Ins name was in almost every libel. He retired to his Hampshire
                    parsonage of Alresford until Waller’s army disturbed him. Robbed there of his
                    library, valued at £1000, and his property, he went to Oxford, where from 1st
                    June 1643 he edited <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Aulicus,</hi> a vivacious but
                    virulent news-sheet which greatly annoyed the Parliamentarians. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Extraneus Vapulans,</hi> written against L’Estrange (who wittily
                    retorted that a prelate should be “no striker”), refers to his sufferings and
                    hardships. The . necessary quiet for his literary pursuits was ultimately found
                    at Lacy’s Court, Abingdon, whence were dated several books and pamphlets against
                    those of his own communion whose opinions were not as unyielding as his, as also
                    against the Presbyterians and others, controversies in which Ussher, Fuller,
                    Baxter, and Harrington were concerned. His works, all more or less marred by
                    political or theological rancour, were upwards of fifty in number; and they
                    comprise histories of Episcopacy, of the Reformation, and of the Presbyterians,
                    with a useful <hi rend="italic">Help to English History.</hi> Some verses of
                    merit also came from his active pen; and his poetical memorial of Bishop
                    Waynflete was published by the Caxton Society in 1851. Heylin was a diligent
                    writer and investigator, a good ecclesiastical lawyer, and had his learning
                    always at command. His principles, to which he was honestly attached, were
                    defended with ability; but his efforts to uphold the church passed unrecognized
                    at the Restoration. His sight began to fail him; yet he rejoiced that his “old
                    bad eyes” had seen the king’s return. Upon that event he preached a jubilant
                    sermon in Westminster Abbey to a great audience, 29th May 1661. He died on 8th
                    May in the following year, and was buried two days after under his sub-dean’s
                    seat.</p>
                <p>Lives of Heylin were written by Dr John Barnard, his son-in-law, and by George
                    Vernon. Barnard’s work was very carefully reprinted, with notes, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Reformation,</hi> published, 1849, by the
                    Ecclesiastical History Society.</p>
