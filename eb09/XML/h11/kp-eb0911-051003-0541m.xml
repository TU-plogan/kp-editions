                    portions, the Malnâd or hill country, which includes some of the highest ranges
                    of the Western Ghâts, and the Maidân or plain country, sloping towards the
                    south. The Hemavati, which flows into the Cauvery in the extreme south, is the
                    great river of the district; its most important tributary is the Yagachi. The
                    upper slopes of the Western Ghàts are abundantly clothed with magnificent
                    forests, and wild animals of all sorts abound. Among the mineral product^ are
                    kaolin, felspar, and quartz. The soil of the valleys is a rich red alluvial
                    loam.</p>
                <p>The area extends to 3291 square miles. The census of 1871 returned the
                    inhabitants at 669,961—329,097 males and 340,864 females—the Hindus numbering
                    650,877, Mahometans 14,460, Jains 1954, Christians 2670. Hassan town and
                    Narsipur each contain more than 5000 inhabitants. The staple crops consist of
                    <hi rend="italic">rdgi,</hi> rice, tobacco, sugar-cane, the cocoa-nut and
                    areca-nut palms, plantain trees, and chillies. Coffee cultivation has been on
                    the increase of late years. The first plantation was opened in 1843, and now
                    there are 155 coffee estates owned by Europeans and 9500 native holdings. The
                    statistics of irrigation show a total of 6905 tanks in the district and 215
                    miles of canals. The exports are large, consisting chiefly of food-grains and
                    coffee. The imports are European piece-goods, hardware of all sorts, and spices.
                    The largest weekly fair is held at AIur. A great annual religious gathering and
                    fair, attended by about 10,000 persons, takes place every year at Melukot. The
                    gross revenue amounted in 1873-74 to £126,908, and the police force (1874)
                    numbered 470 men of all ranks, maintained at a cost of £3692. There were 243
                    schools in 1874 aided by Government, attended by 4379 pupils, and 147 unaided
                    with 1657 pupils. The average mean temperature of the district is 76°, and the
                    average rainfall at Hassan town during seven years was 36 inches. In the Ghats
                    as much as 100 inches sometimes fall in the year. Malarious fever prevails in
                    the Malnâd during the early rains.</p>
                <p>The real history of Hassan does not begin until the epoch of the Ballala dynasty,
                    which lasted from the 10th till the 14th century. Their capital was at
                    Dwarâvati-pura, the ruins of which are still to be seen scattered round the
                    village of Halebid in this district. The earlier kings professed the Jain faith,
                    but the finest temples were erected to Siva by the later monarchs of the line.
                    While they were at the zenith of their power the whole of southern India
                    acknowledged their sway. After the Mahometan invasion in the 14th century, the
                    district of Hassan ceased to exist as the seat of a metropolis, and became a
                    remote province known as Balam. Since 1832 the district, with the rest of
                    Mysore, has been under direct British administration.</p>
