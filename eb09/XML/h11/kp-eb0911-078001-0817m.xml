                    Oberhessen, and is completely surrounded by Prussia. The other, divided by the
                    Rhine into the provinces of Starkenburg and Rheinhessen, is bounded on the N. by
                    Hesse-Nassau, on the W. by the Rhine Palatinate and Rhenish Prussia, on the S.
                    by Baden, and on the E. by Baden and Bavaria. The extent of the duchy is about
                    2965 square miles. Oberhessen is mountainous, having the Vogelsberg in the east
                    with Taufstein (2579 feet) as the highest summit in the country, and the
                    Hausberg, a branch of the Taunus, in the south-west. In the south-east of
                    Starkenburg is the Odenwald. Rheinhessen is occupied by fertile hills. The chief
                    rivers are the Rhine, Main, Neckar, Lahn, and Fulda, with their tributaries.
                    There are no lakes, but mineral springs abound in all the provinces. The climate
                    is pleasant and mild in the river valleys and plains, but severe on the heights,
                    especially in Oberhessen. Besides the usual domestic animals, deer of various
                    kinds, wild swine, foxes, martens, and otters are found. Agriculture, including
                    the breeding of horses and cattle, is actively encouraged by Government, and is
                    the principal industry of the people. Forestry and vine-growing are also
                    important, the latter being practised almost exclusively in Rheinhessen. The
                    principal crops are millet, buckwheat, oats, and potatoes; but rape (for oil),
                    hemp, flax, tobacco, and fruit are also cultivated. The manufactures embrace
                    leather (enamelled and coloured), tobacco, cigars, shoes, furniture,
                    pocket-books and similar goods, chemicals, matches, machinery, and various
                    textile fabrics. Mining is carried on chiefly in Oberhessen. Iron, copper,
                    manganese, graphite, lignite, salt, marble, and clay are the principal minerals,
                    which are worked for home consumption. In 1878 there were produced in Hesse
                    45,300 tons of lignite, 91,724 tons of iron ore, and 13,200 tons of salt,
                    representing in value about £62,100. Trade is tolerably important in Hesse. The
                    following numbers of persons engaged in the various industries are taken from
                    the industrial census of 1875 :—Horticulturists, 292; fishermen, 65; miners,
                    1553; workers in stone, clay, glass, 4715; in metals, 8266; in machines,
                    instruments, &amp;c., 7202; in chemical industries, 2153; in lighting materials,
                    soap, resins, &amp;c., 1190; in textile industries, 8274; in paper and leather,
                    7600; in wood, 11,142; in food and drink, 19,923; in dress and washing, 21,629;
                    in building, 1291; iu polygraphic industries, 1291; in artistic industries, 412;
                    in mercantile business, 17,593; in conveyance, 2273; in lodging and boarding,
                    6016— total, 134,383. The people are well educated; of the recruits in 1878-79
                    only ’ 21 per cent, were unable either to read or write. There is a university
                    at Giessen, and the schools, ordinary, technical, and theological, throughout
                    the country are very numerous. The Protestant religion predominates, though the
                    Roman Catholic faith is also recognized by the state. Darmstadt is the capital;
                    Offenbach is the chief manufacturing town; Mainz has perhaps the most active
                    trade. The other chief towns are Alsfeld, Lauterbach, Friedberg, Bingen,
                    Bensheim, and Worms. The population in 1875 was 884,218. The government since
                    1820 has been a constitutional hereditary monarchy, assisted by two chambers,
                    modified iu 1856—the one of life members, mostly from among the nobility, the
                    other of popular representatives, elected indirectly. The chambers must meet at
                    least once every three years. The ministry of three is responsible to the
                    nation. Hesse is represented in the imperial federal council by 3 votes, and in
                    the reichstag by 9. The annual revenue for the finance-period 1876-78 was
                    £872,375, and the expenditure £872,481. The estimated annual revenue for the
                    period 1879-82 is £1,011,762, and the estimated expenditure £857,124. The public
                    debt in 1879 was £2,041,397, chiefly incurred for railways. For additional

                <p>George I., youngest son of Philip the Magnanimous, received on his father’s death
                    in 1567 the upper countship of Katzenelnbogen, and, selecting Darmstadt as his
                    residence, became the founder of the Hesse-Darmstadt line. Additions to the
                    territory were made both in his reign and in that of his son, Louis V. The
                    landgraviate, as it was at first styled, suffered severely from war and its
                    attendant famines and plagues. The Thirty Years’ War, a war of succession with
                    Hesse-Cassel, and the Seven Years’ War dealt heavy blows at its prosperity.
                    Louis X, who succeeded his father in 1790, involved it in further contests.
                    Joining at first the allies against France, he was compelled in 1793 by the
                    latter power to sign a treaty of neutrality. By the treaty of Lunéville he gave
                    up his possessions on the left bank of the Rhine, receiving as compensation a
                    very much larger district on the right bank. From 1805 till 1813 he was
                    compelled to supply Napoleon with a contingent of troops against the other
                    Germans. In 1806, as member of the Confederation of the Rhine, he assumed the
                    title of grand-duke Louis I. of Hesse. After the battle of Leipsic in 1813, when
                    Napoleon was defeated, Louis again joined the allies. By the decision of the
                    Vienna congress in 1815 considerable change in his dominions was made; but
                    though he was forced to recognize the independence of Hesse-Homburg, which since
                    the beginning of the century had been incorporated with Hesse-Darmstadt, his
                    title of grand-duke was confirmed. Within his country a growing desire for
                    political liberty had been making itself apparent, and in 1820 the grand-duke
                    promulgated a new constitution. This was rejected by the people, and attempts
                    were made in vain by successive diets to frame a constitution pleasing alike to
                    the ruler and the ruled. Louis II.</p>

                <p>succeeded his father in 1830. His policy in no degree lessened the popular
                    discontent. His son Louis III., who succeeded in 1848, alarmed by the events in
                    Paris of that year, and by commotions in his own country, gave way a little, but
                    under the reaction of 1850 he again restored matters to their old state. Since
                    that time, although no radical change has been effected, the liberal party in
                    the state has been steadily gaining ground. In 1866 Hesse-Darmstadt supported
                    Austria against Prussia, with the result that it had to pay a heavy indemnity
                    and cede certain provinces, including the lately acquired Hesse-Homburg, to
                    Prussia. In 1867 it entered the North German Confederation, and in 1870 the
                    German Confederation. Louis IV. succeeded his uncle in 1877.</p>
