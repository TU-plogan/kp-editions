                    conclusion is by no means stringent, and there are various indications in his
                    writings that he had passed some at least of his early years in Rome. On the
                    apparently trustworthy authority of Photius (cod. 121), he is believed to have
                    been while still a youth a personal disciple of Irenaeus, perhaps in Rome, but
                    most likely in Lyons. By inference from the vivid minuteness with which he
                    relates details of the personal history of Callistus in the 9th book of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Refutation</hi> he is believed to have been in Rome from the
                    beginning of the episcopate of Victor (189— 199). It is certain that in the
                    early years of the 3d century he was stationed in that city as a presbyter
                    conspicuous for energy, zeal, eloquence, and. learning. He was a prominent
                    defender of Victor’s view on the much vexed Paschal controversy, but came into
                    collision with Victor’s successors, Zephyrinus and Callistus, on several
                    questions of ecclesiastical dogma and discipline. As regarded the relation
                    between the Father and the Son in the Trinity, for example, Hippolytus defended
                    what is known as subordina-tianism against the patripassianism of the bishops,
                    he accusing them of Noetianism while they retorted upon him with a charge of
                    ditheism. Again, in the dispute as to whether the lapsed could ever be lawfully
                    restored to the fellowship of the church visible, Hippolytus took the severer
                    and Callistus the milder view. So also on the subject of clerical marriages.
                    From his own language in the 9th book of the <hi rend="italic">Refutatio,</hi>
                    combined with his designation of himself in the proem, it appears that
                    Hippolytus ultimately came to occupy in Rome the position of a bishop <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vi. 20), although
                    notin communion with the “Catholic” party; and the difficulty of reconciling
                    this with the strong evidence we have that Portus (t'.c., the Roman harbour
                    opposite Ostia, and not Portιis Romanorum or Aden, as Le Moyne and others
                    founding upon a misunderstanding of Eusebius, have conjectured) was the scene of
                    his activity is probably best got over if we assume that as dissenting bishop he
                    undertook the episcopal superintendence of his adherents in both places, but
                    took his title from the smaller. As regards the close of his life our most
                    trustworthy information is derived from the chronographer of 354 (Mommsen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic">den Chronographen vom Jahre</hi> 354,
                    Leipsic, 1850), according to whom “the presbyter” Hippolytus in the time of
                    Alexander Severus (235) was banished along with the Roman bishop Pontianus to
                    Sardinia, where, it seems to be suggested, he died.</p>
                <p>In 1551 a marble statue of Hippolytus “Portuensis,” of uncertain date but not
                    later than the 5th century, was dug up in Rome; it is now to be seen in the
                    Vatican. He is represented as seated upon an episcopal throne, Wearing the Greek
                    pallium, over which the Roman toga is thrown. On the sides of the throne is
                    inscribed in Greek the rude Easter Cycle of which he is known to have been the
                    author; behind is given an imperfect list of his numerous works. The catalogues
                    given by Eusebius, Jerome, and Nicephoros differ slightly in details; but all
                    bear witness to his diligence as a writer. The extant fragments were first
                    collected by Fabricius <hi rend="italic">{Hippolyti</hi><hi rend="italic">Opera

                    Scripture, a treatise “On Christ and Antichrist,” an “expository” (άποδίίκτίκή)
                    discourse “To the Jews,” a fragment “To the Greeks” or “On the Universe,” tracts
                    “Against Noetus,” “Against Beronand Helix,” and “On the Holy Theophany,”
                    fragments of homilies (in which kind of composition he particularly excelled),
                    and a few short quotations preserved by the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Paschale.</hi> The appendix in Fabricius,
                    containing doubtful or spurious pieces, includes “A Discourse on the End of the
                    World, and on Antichrist, and on the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus Cln·ist,”
                    also a short account of the twelve apostles, stating where each of them laboured
                    and where each of them died, a list of the seventy apostles, heads of the canons
                    of Abulides or Hippolytus as used b'y the ./Ethiopian Christians, and the canons
                    of the Church of Alexandria. Of the spuriousuess of the last mentioned at least
                    there can be no doubt. A new interest in Hippolytus as an ecclesiastical writer
                    was awakened among scholars about 1851 in connexion with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Omnium Hcεresium</hi><hi rend="italic">Refutatio,</hi> which has an interesting
                    history. As an anonymous MS. of the 14th century it had in 1842 been brought
                    among various other manuscripts from Mount Athos to Paris by Minoides Mynas, a
                    learned Greek who had been commissioned by the French Government to search for
                    such treasures, and had been deposited in the great national library where it
                    was registered as a work <hi rend="italic">On all Heresies.</hi> It failed for
                    some time to attract any special notice; but the attention of Μ. Emmanuel
                    Miller, an official of that institution, having been at length excited by some
                    fragments of Pindar and of an unknown lyric poet which it contained, he was led
                    to examine it more closely and to adopt the conclusion that it was the
                    continuation of the fragment entitled <hi rend="italic">Philosophumena,</hi>
                    printed in the Benedictine edition of Origen as the work of that author. Under
                    this persuasion he offered it for publication to the university of Oxford, from
                    whose press it appeared in 1851 under his editorship, bearing the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Originis</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophumena, siνe Omnium
                    Hcercsium</hi><hi rend="italic">Refutatio.</hi> It was at once welcomed by the
                    learned world as a literary treasure of singular value; but it was almost
                    immediately perceived that, though Miller had certainly judged rightly in
                    affirming it to be a continuation of the fragmentary <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophumena,</hi> hè had as certainly erred in attributing its composition
                    to Origen, whose authorship of the previously known portion had already been
                    disputed by Huet, Heumann, and Gale. By Jacobi and Duncker in 1851, who were
                    speedily followed by Gieseler, Bunsen, Wordsworth, and Dollinger, it was with
                    increasing confidence claimed for Hippolytus, to whom it is now attributed with
                    almost entire unanimity by critics,—the arguments of Baur (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Thcol. Jahrbb.,</hi> 1853) in favour of the presbyter Caius, and still more
                    those of Armellinus <hi rend="italic">{Be</hi><hi rend="italic">prisca

                    Novatian, having been found tobe quite unconvincing.</p>
                <p>Originally it consisted of ten books, of which, however, only eight survive,
                    namely, the first and the fourth to the tenth inclusive. Book i. gives an
                    account of the different schools of ancient philosophy—Greek, Indian, and
                    Druidical; books ii. and iii. appear to have dealt with the doctrines and
                    mysteries of the Egyptians and Chaldaeans respectively; book iv. (which is
                    slightly defective at the commeneemeut)treats of Chaldaean horoscopy andEgyptian
                    theurgy; books v.-ix. dispose of the various heresies which had asserted
                    themselves within the Christian Church. These are taken up in chronological
                    order and arranged in five main groups, the Ophite, Simonist, Basilidean,
                    Valentinian or Docetic, and Noetian. Whether they be regarded as attempts to
                    Christianize paganism, to conciliate Judaism, or to gnosticize Christianity,
                    their unscriptural character is invariably insisted on. The entire work is
                    summarized in book x. The value of the <hi rend="italic">Refutation</hi> as a
                    whole, in its bearing on the history of the apostolic and subapostolic ages, and
                    on the critical problems arising out of that history, can hardly be
                    overestimated.</p>
