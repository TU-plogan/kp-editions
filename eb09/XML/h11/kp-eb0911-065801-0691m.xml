                    ending with the fall of De Burg; that of government by favourites, which led to
                    the Mad Parliament; the period of the Barons’War; and the short period between
                    the close of the war and Henry’s death. At his accession the whole country was
                    in rebellion, and Louis with his Frenchmen held the east and south. In this
                    crisis it was fortunate that the government fell into the hands of such a man as
                    William Marshall, and that the pope gave him all the assistance in his power.
                    The acceptance of the charter at once recalled many to their allegiance, and the
                    defeat and retirement of Louis broke up the opposition. The charter was
                    confirmed (1217) and order rapidly restored. The legate Gualo aided the earl
                    marshal and Archbishop Langton in the work. On Marshall’s death (1219) Pandulf
                    took Gualo’s place, and asserted the papal authority in a way which obliged
                    Langton to make a personal protest at Rome. Pandulf was recalled, and Hubert de
                    Burg, the justiciar, ruled with Langton till the latter’s death (1228), and
                    alone afterwards. The influence of Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester, the
                    head of the foreign party and guardian of the king’s person, was successfully
                    resisted. Meanwhile a last outbreak of pure feudalism under Falkes de Breauté
                    was put down, and the charter again issued in its final shape (1227). But the
                    worst plague of the reign, the influence of foreign favourites, had already made
                    itself felt, while another great evil, the financial exactions of Rome, was
                    causing much discontent. An expedition to Poitou, opposed by De Burg, caused the
                    first quarrel between him and the king. Shortly afterwards Peter des Roches
                    returned from a temporary banishment, and gained such influence over Henry that
                    he dismissed De Burg with insult and ingratitude (1232). From this point his
                    real reign may be said to have begun.</p>
                <p>The bad promise of his youth was amply redeemed in the events of the next
                    twenty-six years. Under the influence of Peter des Roches, foreigners began to
                    flock to the court, and even foreign mercenaries were introduced into England.
                    Richard, earl marshal, who openly rebuked the king for this conduct, was
                    outlawed, but other barons took up his cause, and collisions between them and
                    the king’s troops took place. Civil war appeared imminent, when Archbishop
                    Edmund persuaded Henry to dismiss Peter des Roches, and the danger was avoided
                    for the time (1234). But the king’s partiality for foreigners was a constant
                    source of discontent. In 1236 he married Eleanor of Provence. Two uncles of the
                    queen, William, bishop of Valence, and Peter of Savoy, came over with her, and
                    were immediately placed in positions of honour and emolument. In 1238 Henry
                    married his sister Eleanor to Simon de Montfort, an event which nearly produced
                    an outbreak. Resistance already centred in the Great Council, which in 1236 had
                    declined “to change the laws of England,” and supported the bishop of Chichester
                    in his refusal to give up the great seal at the king’s demand. Henry’s personal
                    extravagance caused him much embarrassment, and the extortions of the papal see
                    pressed heavily on the church. In 1242 the barons refused to give the aid
                    demanded by the king for another expedition to Poitou, and when they met again
                    after his return, they joined with the clergy in a general protest against his
                    misgovernment (1244). In order to remedy this state of things, it was proposed
                    that the king’s advisers should be chosen by the parliament, as it now began to
                    be called, but Henry found means of evading the demand. Hitherto his brother
                    Richard, carl of Cornwall, had been the leader of the opposition, but Simon de
                    Montfort, earl of Leicester, was now becoming the centre of constitutional
                    resistance. In 1246 the king’s step-father, the count of La Marche, died, and
                    Henry’s half-brothers came to England, bringing with them a fresh crowd of
                    hungry followers. The demands made upon the great cities, especially London,
                    upon the Jews, and upon the clergy, to meet the expenses caused by the king’s
                    favourites, w ere constantly on the increase. Owing to the cessation of the
                    office of justiciar since the fall of De Burg, the judicial system was falling
                    into decay, and crime of all kinds was rampant. At the same time the pope,
                    engaged in his great struggle with Frederick II., regarded England as an
                    “inexhaustible spring of wealth,” and redoubled his demands. He won over most of
                    the bishops by supporting them in their claim to inspect the monastic houses in
                    their dioceses, and the church, deprived of its natural head,—for Boniface, an
                    uncle of the queen, was archbishop cf Canterbury,—was disunited and
                    helpless.</p>

                <p>Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, was almost alone in his efforts to follow in the
                    steps of Stephen Langton. He and De Montfort were at one in their desire for
                    reform, but the nation was not yet ready. Two mistakes on the part of Henry
                    brought matters to a crisis. He had conferred the government of Gascony on De
                    Montfort in 1248, and the latter had reduced the province to obedience. But
                    accusations made against him found ready audience with the king, who feared and
                    disliked his brother-in-law. The result was a bitter quarrel (1252), which Henry
                    followed up by superseding De Montfort in his government, and sending his eldest
                    son Edward to take his place. This had the effect of throwing the earl once for
                    all into the arms of the national party. A little later an event occurred which
                    forced that party to take active measures. The pope persuaded Henry to accept
                    the kingdom of Sicily for his second son Edmund, and to bind himself to pay the
                    expenses of its conquest, together with a large debt already incurred (1255).
                    This important scheme was entered into without the knowledge of the parliament,
                    and the nation suddenly found itself pledged to an undertaking which had purely
                    dynastic or papal objects. The coalition of pope and king produced a
                    corresponding union of the church and the baronage, and the troubles of the year
                    1257, Scotch and Welsh inroads, together with a failure of the harvest, united
                    the nation against the Government.</p>
                <p>A parliament which met at Westminster (April 1258) forced Henry to promise
                    reform, and elected a committee of twenty-four to act for the king till a
                    complete scheme could be drawn up. On June 11th the assembly, called afterwards
                    the Mad Parliament, met at Oxford. A council of fifteen, of whom two-thirds were
                    on the baronial side, was appointed, who, together with twelve representatives
                    of the “community,” were to take charge of the government and meet in parliament
                    thrice a year. Hugh Bigod was named justiciar, other offices were filled up, the
                    castles were entrusted to Englishmen, and four knights were summoned from each
                    county to declare grievances. These reforms, together with certain general
                    enactments, went by the name of the Provisions of Oxford. The king’s authority
                    was completely superseded, and the rule of a baronial oligarchy established.
                    Next year, owing to the demands of the knighthood, who felt themselves
                    neglected, a further series of Provisions was issued. The Sicilian project was
                    formally repudiated, and a final peace made with France, in which the claim on
                    Normandy and other districts was renounced. But beyond this the baronial
                    Government did nothing. The nation testified its disappointment, and a quarrel
                    took place between the earls of Leicester and Gloucester which divided the
                    baronial party. The king took advantage of this state of affairs, and in 1261
                    obtained absolution from the Provisions at the hands of the pope. He then
                    fortified the Tower, deposed the baronial justiciar, and soon began to rule as
                    before. In this crisis the baronial party made a bid for popular favour by
                    summoning representatives of the counties to a parliament, but the reaction was
                    for the time complete, and Henry had leisure to go to France in order to win
                    over Louis IX. to his side. In 1263 hostilities broke out on the Welsh border,
                    and the barons seized the opportunity to renew their attack on the king. After
                    some months of desultory warfare, it was agreed to submit to the arbitration of
                    Louis. That king, in the Mise of zlmiens, decided in favour of Henry, and
                    annulled the Provisions. Leicester at once appealed to arms. The battle of Lewes
                    (May 14, 1264) was a complete victory for him, and put the king and his eldest
                    son into his hands. For a time he was master of the country, but the party he
                    headed was not that which had been dominant six years before, and Henry now had
                    many adherents among the greater barons. Nevertheless, for more than a year he
                    remained practically a prisoner in the hands of De Montfort. At a parliament
                    which met in June 1264, and at which kniglits of the shire were certainly
                    present, a constitution was drawn up, which, while preserving to the king a high
                    position as head of the executive, placed supreme power in the hands of the
                    “community.” Early next year, in a parliament to which members from the boroughs
                    as well as from the counties were summoned, this constitution was confirmed, and
                    Henry swore to observe it. In accordance with the settlement made at Lewes,
                    Edward was now to be released. His father was already supposed to be at liberty,
                    but in reality both he and Edward were kept in restraint. Edward’s escape (May
                    1265) caused an immediate renewal of the war, and at the battle of Evesham
                    (August 4, 1265) De Montfort WuS killed and Henry set free. Two years later the
                    war was practically concluded by the capture of Kenilworth. Henry had little to
                    do with the conduct of the war, and acquiesced in the arrangements made by his
                    son for the pacification of the country. His triumph was,however, complete, and
                    for the rest cf his reign the kingdom was at peace. He died on November 16,
                    1272, leaving behind him the memory of one whose virtues were of the priestly
                    kind, and whose worst vices were those of indulgence, ill-temper, and
                    prodigality. As a subject he would have been harmless, and even perhaps
                    respectable; as a king he was weak, hasty, imprudent, equally incapable in the
                    position of a ruler, an administrator, or a general.</p>
