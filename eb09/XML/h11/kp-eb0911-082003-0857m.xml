                    Royal Academy School. He first exhibited in this institution in 1803, sending a
                    group of Banditti; and, though he could not be called a popular artist, he soon
                    established a reputation for choice of subject, and qualities of design and
                    colour superior to the great mass of his contemporaries. He made a tour in Italy
                    along with Thomas Phillips, the portrait-painter. In 1814, having exhibited
                    Miranda and Ferdinand with the Logs of Wood, he was elected an associate of the
                    Academy, and in 1820 a full academician, his diploma-picture representing
                    Ganymede. In 1823 he produced Christ crowned with Thorns, a large and important
                    work, which has lately been bought by the Academy out of the Chantrey Fund; this
                    may be regarded as his masterpiece, displaying all the qualities which go to
                    make up pictorial propriety and efficiency, though it does not entitle Hilton to
                    the praise of <pb break="no"

                    keeper of the Academy; and he died in London on 30th December 1839, a widower
                    without children. Some of his best pictures remained on his hands at his
                    decease,—such as the Angel releasing Peter from Prison (life-size), painted in
                    1831, Una with the Lion entering Corceca’s Cave (1832), the Murder of the
                    Innocents, his last exhibited work (1838), Cornus, and Amphitrite. The National
                    Gallery now contains Edith finding the Body of Harold (1834), Cupid Disarmed,
                    Rebecca and Abraham’s Servant (1829), and Sir Calepine rescuing Serena (from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Faerie Queen)</hi> (1831). Hilton’s excellence as an artist is
                    relative to the state of art in his country at the time. In a great school or
                    period he could certainly not count as more than a respectable subordinate; but
                    in the British school of the earlier part of this century he had sufficient
                    elevation of aim and width of attainment to stand conspicuous and praiseworthy,
                    and, comparatively speaking, above the level of mediocrity.</p>
