                <p>The hemp plant, like the hop, which is the other member of the same natural
                    order, <hi rend="italic">Cannabiηacece,</hi> is dioecious, that is, the male and
                    female flowers are borne on separate plants. The male plant is smaller than the
                    female, and ripens and dies earlier in the summer. The foliage of the female
                    plant is darker and more luxuriant than that of the male. The leaves of hemp are
                    constituted of 5 to 7 leaflets, the form of which is lanceolate-acuminate, and
                    sharply serrate. The loose panicles of male flowers and the short spikes of
                    female flowers arise from the axils of the upper leaves. The height of the plant
                    varies greatly with season, soil, and manuring; a variety <hi rend="italic">(C.

                    differences between Indian and European hemp.</p>
                <p>The original country of the hemp-plant was doubtless in some part of temperate
                    Asia, probably near the Caspian Sea. It spread westward throughout Europe, and
                    southward through the Indian peninsula.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Wild hemp still grows on the banks of the Lower Ural and the Volga, near the
                    Caspian Sea. It extends to Persia, the Altai range, and northern and western
                    China. It is found in Kashmir, and on the Himalaya, growing vigorously as far up
                    as 6000 or even 10,000 feet.</p>
                <p>Hemp is grown for three products—(1) the fibre of its stem; (2) the resinous
                    secretion which is developed in hot countries upon its leaves and flowering
                    heads; (3) its oily seeds.</p>
                <p>Hemp has been employed for its fibre from ancient times. Herodotus (iv. 74)
                    mentions the wild and cultivated hemp of Scythia, and describes the hempen
                    garments made by the Thracians as equal to linen in fineness. Hesychius says the
                    Thracian women made sheets of hemp. Moschion (about 200 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> records the use of hempen ropes for rigging the ship “Syracusia”
                    built for Hiero II. The hemp plant has been cultivated in northern India from a
                    considerable antiquity, not only as a drug but for its fibre. The Anglo-Saxons
                    were well acquainted with the mode of preparing hemp. Hempen cloth became common
                    in central and southern Europe in the 13th century.</p>
                <p>The medicinal and intoxicating properties of hemp have probably been known in
                    Oriental countries from a very early period. An ancient Chinese herbal, part of
                    which was written about the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> wdιile
                    the remainder is of still earlier date, notices the seed and flower-bearing
                    kinds of hemp. Other early writers refer to hemp as a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n681/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0681-0648"/> remedy. The medicinal and dietetic use of hemp
                    spread through India, Persia, and Arabia in the early Middle Ages. The use of
                    hemp (bhang) in India was noticed by Garcia d’Orta in 1563. Berlu in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Treasury of Drugs</hi> (1690) describes it as of “an infatuating
                    quality and pernicious use.” Attention was recalled to this drug, in consequence
                    of Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition, by De Sacy (1809) and Rouger (1810). Its
                    modern medicinal use is chiefly due to trials by Dr O’Shaughnessy in Calcutta
                    (1838-1842). The plant is grown partly and often mainly for the sake of its
                    resin in Persia, northern India, and Arabia, in many parts of Africa, and in
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>The hemp plant grown in some parts of the United States yields the active resin
                    so freely that less than 1 grain of the extract is a full dose. But it is as a
                    fibre-producer that the hemp is now being more extensively cultivated in the
                    United States. Hemp seeds were ordered for Plymouth colony as early as 1629, but
                    the greater profit derivable from tobacco has always opposed the development of
                    hemp-growing. The plant is chiefly grown in the States of Kentucky, Missouri,
                    Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The produce of Kentucky in 1877 was 6140
                    tons. According to the census of 1870 the total production of the United States
                    was 12,746 tons. In the northern part of the State of New York the crop is
                    valued chiefly for the seeds, which may be from 20 to 40 bushels or more per
                    acre. The produce per acre in the United States is from 700 to 1000 lb of fibre,
                    4 to 6 pecks of seed being usually sown.</p>
                <p>Although the hemp-plant is grown in India chiefly for the production of its
                    narcotic or intoxicating resin, yet a good deal of true hemp fibre is produced
                    there. It is imported into England, however, chiefly from Russia, the United
                    States, Italy, Holland, Germany, Hungary, and Turkey. It is grown in Ireland,
                    and in some parts (Suffolk and Lincolnshire) of England. It thrives well in
                    Algeria. It requires a rich deep soil and heavy manuring, and is an exhausting
                    crop. In Great Britain about 6 pecks of seed per acre are drilled, 18 inches
                    apart, in the middle of April. The male plants are pulled from the end of July
                    to the end of August, the female or seed-bearing plants being gathered in
                    September.</p>
                <p>The British imports of hemp cannot be ascertained with accuracy, as the official
                    returns include under that name the fibres of many hemp-substitutes. The
                    following statement of hemp imported into the United Kingdom must therefore be
                    taken with all necessary reserve :—</p>

                <p>There were sent out 11,790 cwts. dressed English-grown hemp, more than half of
                    this going to France. 14,676 cwts. of foreign and colonial dressed hemp were
                    re-exported to British America and other countries, with 133,516 cwts. rough
                    hemp, and 197 cwts. codilia.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the hemp imported into the United Kingdom is landed at Liverpool,
                    London, Hull, and Leith. Most of it is employed in the manufacture of cables,
                    ropes, cordage, twine, sacking, tar paulins, canvas, and sailcloth. The finest
                    hemp comes from Italy, but it is almost equalled by the higher qualities of the
                    Russian fibre. Russian hemp varies much in price, according to quality and
                    market fluctuations; its price in November 1879 was from £23 to £25 pel ton,
                    Italian or garden hemp fetching from £38 to £41.</p>
                <p>In order to free the fibre of the hemp plant from the soft and useless parenchyma
                    and the tissues of the bark, the stems are submitted to nearly the same
                    processes as those described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Flax.</hi> They
                    are dried, beaten, or crushed in a hemp mill, and fermented or <hi rend="italic"
                    >retted,</hi> preferably in soft water, after which they are again beaten with
                    wooden mallets or in a specially constructed machine called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >break.</hi> After breaking the stems are <hi rend="italic">scutched,</hi> and
                    thus the separation of the fibres furthered by the rubbing and striking to which
                    they are subjected. The fibres are then <hi rend="italic">hackled</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">combed.</hi></p>
                <p>According to Vetillart, the average length of European hemp fibres is ‘86 inch,
                    the extremes being <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 and 2 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> l inches. Dr M ’ Nab gives '0005 to <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 0007
                    inch as the diameter of fibres, the central cavity being <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 0001 in breadth. Under the microscope hemp fibres resemble those of flax,
                    both being bast-fibres, and differ widely from those of Manila hemp or New
                    Zealand flax; they are longitudinally striated cylinders, sometimes free and
                    sometimes associated in small bundles. A hemp cord of 1 square millimetre
                    section will bear, according to Haberlandt, an average weight of 34’5
                    kilogrammes without breaking—sometimes as much as 50 kilos.</p>
                <p>The chief constituent of the fibre of hemp is of course cellulose, but small
                    quantities of other substances are always present— the purest sorts, however,
                    being richest in cellulose. A fine sample of Italian hemp gave on analysis the
                    following percentages— water 8’9, wax 0'6, ash 0’8, matters soluble in water
                    3’5, lignose, albuminoids, &amp;c., 8 ’ 4, cellulose 77'8. An ordinary sample of
                    Russian hemp contained no less than 10 5 per cent, of moisture, and Γ5 of
                    mineral matter, with but 72 of pure cellulose. By boiling a portion of this
                    sample for four hours with water in a sealed tube at 150° C., a soluble extract
                    amounting to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of the original hemp was obtained,
                    Manila hemp giving 15'4 per cent., and Phormium fibre no less than 19 per cent.,
                    when similarly treated. Dilute solutions of iodine and sulphuric acid,
                    successively applied, give to hemp fibres a greenish hue. The ash of hemp is
                    rich in lime.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hemp-resin.—</hi> Hemp as a drug or intoxicant for smoking and
                    chewing occurs in the three forms of bhang, ganja, and charas.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Bhang,</hi> the Hindustani <hi rend="italic">siddhi</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">salzi,</hi> consists of the dried leaves and small stalks of
                    the hemp; a few fruits occur in it. It is of a dark brownish-green colour, and
                    has a faint peculiar odour and but a slight taste. It is smoked with or without
                    tobacco; or it is made into a sweatmeat with honey, sugar, and aromatic spices;
                    or it is powdered and infused in cold water, yielding a turbid drink, <hi
                    rend="italic">subdschi. Hashish</hi> is one of the Arabic names given to the
                    Syrian and Turkish preparations of the resinous hemp leaves. One of the
                    commonest of these preparations is made by heating the bhang with water and
                    butter, the butter becoming thus charged with the resinous and active substances
                    of the plant.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Ganja,</hi> the guaza of the London brokers, consists of
                    the flowering and fruiting heads of the female plant. It is brownish-green, and
                    otherwise resembles bhang, as in odour and taste. Some of the more esteemed
                    kinds of hashish are prepared from this ganja. Ganja is met with in the Indian
                    bazaars in dense bundles of 24 plants or heads apiece. The hashish in such
                    extensive use in Central Asia is often seen in the bazaars of large cities in
                    the form of cakes, 1 to 3 inches thick, 5 to 10 inches broad, and 10 to 15
                    inches long.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Charas,</hi> or churrus, is the resin itself collected, as
                    it exudes naturally from the plant, in different ways. The best sort is gathered
                    by the hand like opium; sometimes the resinous exudation of the plant is made to
                    stick first of all to cloths, or to the leather garments of men, or even to
                    their skin, and is then removed by scraping, and afterwards consolidated by
                    kneading, pressing, and rolling. It contains about one-third or one-fourth its
                    weight of the resin. But the churrus prepared by different methods and in
                    different countries differs greatly in appearance and purity. Sometimes it takes
                    the form of egg-like masses of greyish-brown colour, having when of high quality
                    a shining resinous <pb break="no"

                    irregular friable lumps, like pieces of impure linseed oil-cake.</p>
                <p>Hemp, however consumed, acts in a most strange way upon the nervous system, but
                    its effects differ greatly with races as well as with individuals. Generally the
                    first effect of a small dose is to produce increase of appetite and
                    cheerfulness. Larger doses produce hallucinations, delirium, sleep, and
                    sometimes catalepsy. During the dreamy state induced by an average dose of
                    hashish, the patient becomes the sport of rapidly shifting ideas. Errors of
                    perception as to time and place are a conspicuous characteristic of its effects
                    on the mind. For the connexion of the name assassin with hashish, see vol. ii.
                    p. 723.</p>
                <p>Extract of hemp has been repeatedly tried in modern European medical practice
                    without very consistent or satisfactory results. It has antispasmodic and
                    anodyne characters, and has been employed in tetanus, spasmodic cough,
                    hydrophobia, and some forms of mania. It is a quieter of the nervous system, but
                    does not cause constipation, check the appetite, nor diminish the secretions
                    like opium.</p>
                <p>Hemp is very largely used in Eastern countries as an intoxicant and
                    narcotic—probably by nearly 300 millions of the human race. The amount consumed
                    cannot be estimated. Of dried hemp and churrus there was sent in 1876 not less
                    than £86,000 worth through the Khyber Pass into British India.</p>
                <p>There are three substances in the hemp-drug to which its activity has been
                    attributed. Of these the resin, separated and investigated by Messrs T. &amp; H.
                    Smith, is the most abundant and probably the most important, and yet its
                    chemical nature and properties are by no means certain. It is soluble in
                    alcohol, and has a warm, bitter, acrid taste with a slight odour. It melts
                    between 70° and 90° C., and has a pale brown colour. It is called <hi
                    rend="italic">cannabin.</hi> Cannabene is the volatile oil of Indian hemp
                    obtained by distilling ganja or churrus with water. Its composition is
                    represented by C <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>;
                    it boils between 235° and 240°. Cannabene is accompanied by a crystalline
                    hydrocarbon containing 84 per cent, carbon and 16 per cent, hydrogen. The
                    supposed occurrence of nicotine in Indian hemp has not been confirmed, and would
                    not in any way suffice to explain the properties of the drug. Moreover, tobacco
                    is often added to hemp. That there is a volatile alkaloid in hemp, though in
                    small quantities, is, however, established beyond doubt. The proportion of pure
                    resin in ganja was found by Messrs T. &amp; H. Smith to be 6 or 7 per cent.
                    Gastinell gives 3 per cent, as obtainable from Egyptian hemp. The volatile oil
                    in fresh hemp probably does not exceed 3 parts in 1000. By treating the
                    commercial resinous extract of Indian hemp with strong nitric acid, Bolas and
                    Francis obtained <hi rend="italic">{Joum. Chem. Soc.,</hi> vol. vii., n. s., p.
                    417) an oxidation product, soluble in alcohol and crystallizing in long flat
                    prisms. The formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> has been assigned to this substance, which
                    is known as oxycannabin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hemp Seed, Cake, and Oil. —</hi> The ripe seeds, really fruits,
                    being nuts or achenes of the hemp plant, contain about 34 per cent, of oil and
                    16 of albuminoids. When the crushed seeds have been submitted to pressure, the
                    residual cake is found to retain about 7 per cent, of oil. The value of hemp
                    cake as a cattle-food is lessened by its purgative property. The seeds are much
                    used as a food for singing birds. A hundred parts of the seed yield from 70 to
                    75 of cake and 25 to 30 of oil. This oil has drying properties, though it is in
                    this respect much inferior to linseed oil. Its specific gravity is <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 9307. The seeds are roundish ovate, about ⅜ inch in
                    length, and of a dark grey colour, with a pale ash-coloured network of
