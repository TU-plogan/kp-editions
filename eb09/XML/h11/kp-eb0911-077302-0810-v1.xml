                    (1812-1870), was born at Moscow in 1812, a very short time before the occupation
                    of that city by the French. His father, Ivan Yakovlef, after a personal
                    interview with Napoleon, was allowed to leave, when the invaders arrived, as the
                    bearer of a letter from the French to the Russian emperor. His family attended
                    him to the Russian lines. Then the mother of the infant Alexander (a young
                    German Protestant of J ewish extraction from Stuttgart, according to A. von
                    Wurzbach), only seventeen years old, and quite unable to speak Russian, was
                    forced to seek shelter for some time in a peasant’s hut. A year later the family
                    returned to Moscow, where Hertzen passed his youth,—remaining there, after
                    completing his studies at the university, till 1834, when he was arrested and
                    tried on a charge of having assisted, with some other youths, at a festival
                    during which verses by Sokolovsky, of a nature uncomplimentary to the emperor,
                    were sung. The special commission appointed to try the youthful culprits found
                    him guilty, and in 1835 he was banished to Viatka. There he remained till the
                    visit to that city of the hereditary grand-duke (afterwards Alexander II.),
                    accompanied by the poet Joukofsky, led to his being allowed to quit Viatka for
                    Vladimir, where he was appointed editor of the official gazette of that city. In
                    1840 he obtained a post in the ministry of the interior at St Petersburg; but in
                    consequence of having spoken too frankly about a death due to a police officer’s
                    violence, he was sent to Novgorod, where he led an official life, with the title
                    of “state councillor,” till 1842. In 1846 bis father died, leaving him by his
                    will a very large property. Early in 1847 he left Russia, never to return. From
                    Italy, on hearing of the revolution of 1848, he hastened to Paris, whence he
                    afterwards went to Switzerland. In 1852 he quitted Geneva for London, where he
                    settled for some years. In 1864 he returned to Geneva, and after some time went
                    to Paris, where he died, January 21, 1870.</p>
                <p>His literary career began in 1842 with the publication of an essay, in Russian,
                    on <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism in Science,</hi> under the pseudonym of
                    “Iskander,” the Turkish form of his Christian name,—convicts, even when
                    pardoned, not being allowed in those days to publish under their own names. His
                    second work, also in Russian, was his <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Study of
                        Nature</hi> (1845-6). In 1847 appeared his novel <hi rend="italic">Kto
                        Vinovat?</hi> (Whose Fault?), and about the same time were published in
                    Russian periodicals the stories which were afterwards collected and printed in
                    London in 1854, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Prervannuie Razskazui</hi>
                    (Interrupted Tales). In 1850 two works appeared, translated from the Russian
                    manuscript, <hi rend="italic">Vom anderen Ufer</hi> (From another Shore) and <hi
                        rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de France</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >et d'Italie.</hi> In French appeared also his essay <hi rend="italic">Du
                        Développement des idées révolutionnaires en Russie,</hi> and his memoirs,
                    which, after being printed in Russian, were translated under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">Le Monde russe et la Révolution</hi> (3 vols. 1860-62), and
                    were in part translated into English as <hi rend="italic">My Exile to
                        Siberia</hi> (2 vols., 1855). From a literary point of view his most
                    important work is <hi rend="italic">Kto Vinovat?</hi> a story describing how the
                    domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of
                    a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant, and genial, is troubled by
                    a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous,
                    without there being any possibility of saying who is most to be blamed for the
                    tragic termination. But it was as a political writer that Hertzen gained the
                    vast reputation which he at one time enjoyed. Having founded in London his “Free
                    Russian Press,” of the fortunes of which, during ten years, he gave an
                    interesting account in a book published (in Russian<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n811/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0811-0774"/>) in 1863, he issued from it a great number of
                    Russian works, all levelled against the system of government prevailing in
                    Russia. Some of these were essays, such as his <hi rend="italic">Baptized
                        Property,</hi> an attack on serfdom; others were periodical publications,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Polyarnaya Zvyezda</hi> (or Polar Star), the <hi
                        rend="italic">Kolokol</hi> (or Bell), and the <hi rend="italic">Golosa iz
                        Rοssii</hi> (or Voices from Russia). The <hi rend="italic">Kolokol</hi> soon
                    obtained an immense circulation, and exercised an extraordinary influence. For
                    three years, it is true, the founders of the “Free Press” ⅛ent on printing, “not
                    only without selling a single copy, but scarcely being able to get a single copy
                    introduced into Russia ;” so that when at last a bookseller bought ten
                    shillings’ worth of <hi rend="italic">Baptized Property,</hi> the half sovereign
                    was set aside by the surprised editors in a special place of honour. But the
                    death of the emperor Nicholas in 1855 produced an entire change. Hertzen’s
                    writings, and the journals he edited, were smuggled wholesale into Russia, and
                    their words resounded throughout that country, as well as all over Europe. Their
                    influence became overwhelming. Evil deeds long hidden, evil-doers who had long
                    prospered, were suddenly dragged into light and disgrace. His bold and vigorous
                    language aptly expressed the thoughts which had long been secretly stirring
                    Russian minds, and were now beginning to find a timid utterance at home. For
                    some years his influence in Russia was a living force, the circulation of his
                    writings was a vocation zealously pursued. Stories tell how on one occasion a
                    merchant, who had bought several cases of sardines at Nijni-Novgorod, found that
                    they contained forbidden print instead of fish, and at another time a
                    supposititious copy of the <hi rend="italic">Kolokol</hi> was printed for the
                    emperor’s special use, in which a telling attack upon a leading statesman, which
                    had appeared in the genuine number, was omitted. At length the sweeping changes
                    introduced by Alexander II. greatly diminished the need for and appreciation of
                    Hertzen’s assistance'in the work of reform. The freedom he had demanded for the
                    serfs was granted, the law-courts he had so long denounced were remodelled,
                    trial by jury was established, liberty was to a great extent conceded to the
                    press. It became clear that Hertzen’s occupation was gone. When the Polish
                    insurrection of 1863 broke out, and he pleaded the insurgents’ cause, his
                    reputation in Russia received its death-blow. From that time it was only with
                    the revolutionary party that he was in full accord, and it is by that section of
                    Russian Liberals alone that his opinions are now considered of authority. For
                    the great reforms, however, which followed the Crimean War, Russia is much
                    indebted to the outspok-enrutterances of Alexander Hertzen, and will be so in
                    all probability for the constitutional changes which are likely to follow the
                    repressive measures of 1879.</p>
                <p>In 1873 a collection of his works in French was commenced in Paris. A volume of
                    posthumous works, in Russian, was published at Geneva in 1870. His <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> supply the principal information about his life,
                    a sketch of which appears also in A. von Wurzbach’s <hi rend="italic"
