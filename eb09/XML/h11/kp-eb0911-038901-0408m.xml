                    the appearance of a purely English word, it is none the less of foreign origin,
                    John Hall of Northall, in Shropshire, our author’s father, tracing his lineage
                    back to Frederick of Halle in Tyrol, natural son of Albert of Austria. From Eton
                    Edward Hall passed to Cambridge, and according to some accounts it would appear
                    that at a later date he was also a student at Oxford. Entering Gray’s Inn he was
                    duly called to the bar; and we find him afterwards filling the offices of common
                    sergeant, under-sheriff of the city of London, summer reader of Gray’s Inn
                    (1533), double reader in Lent (1540), and judge of the sheriff court. The date
                    of the first appearance of his chronicle has been matter of question; but it is
                    generally agreed that there was no such edition as that of 1542 assigned by the
                    older bibliographers to Berthelette. The real <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> is almost certainly that issued by Grafton in 1548, the year after
                    Hall’s death, with a continuation compiled mainly from the author’s MSS.; it is
                    remarkable, says Mr Hazlitt <hi rend="italic">{Collections and Notes'),</hi> as
                    having probably more variations in the copies than any book in the language. A
                    reprint was published in 1809 under the supervision of Sir Henry Ellis, who,
                    however, furnished neither introduction nor comment.</p>
                <p>Hall’s work deserves a higher title than that of chronicle; partly, perhaps, by a
                    happy accident, but partly also by the author’sjudicious management, it
                    possesses no small unity of theme and construction. Beginning with the famous
                    combat at Coventry between Henry of Hereford and Thomas Mowbray, it follows the
                    tragic progress of the strife between York and Lancaster till it is brought to a
                    close by the marriage of Henry VII. with Margaret of York, and then it shows
                    England united and at rest under Henry VIII. The policy of this monarch is
                    presented under a very favourable light, and in the religious question the
                    author sides emphatically and intolerantly with Protestantism. For all kinds of
                    ceremonial in utterance and action he has all a lawyer’s respect, and his pages
                    are often adorned and encumbered with the pageantry and material garniture of
                    his story. In his style he unites the redundant reduplication and painful
                    particularization of his profession with that evident effort after balance of
                    clauses and fanciful and forcible phraseology which not long afterwards resulted
                    in “Euphuism.” On the whole the work is not only valuable but attractive. To the
                    historian it furnishes what is evidently the testimony of an eye-witness on
                    several matters of interest which are neglected by other narrators; and to the
                    student of literature it has the exceptional charm of being one of the prime
                    sources of Shakespeare’s historical plays. Compare James Gairdner, <hi
