                <p><label type="entry">HAMBURG</label>, one of the most remarkable cities of Germany
                    and indeed of Europe, ranking as it does as the first of all the seats of
                    commerce on the Continent, is situated on the right bank of the northern arm of
                    the Elbe, about 93 miles from the mouth of that river, just where it is joined
                    by the Alster and the Bille. The latitude of the observatory in the western part
                    of the city is 53° 33' 55'' N. and the longitude 9° 58' 23 ’ 6'' E., the
                    latitude of the tower of St Michael’s 53° 32' 55∙7" N. and the longitude 9° 58'
                    41∙7" E. Were it not for political and municipal boundaries Hamburg might be
                    considered as forming one town with Altona and Ottensen, the three presenting to
                    the river a continuous frontage of nearly 4 miles; and long lines of suburbs
                    radiate inland in various directions. The city proper lies on both sides of the
                    Alster, which having been dammed up a short distance from its mouth now forms a
                    considerable lake, of which the southern portion within the line of the
                    fortifications bears the name of the Inner Alster <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Binnen</hi><hi rend="italic">Alster),</hi> and the other and larger portion
                    (2300 <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n424/mode/1up"

                    that of the Outer Alster <hi rend="italic">{Aussen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alster).</hi> The fortifications as such were removed in 1815, but they have
                    left their trace in a fine girdle of green round the city, though too many
                    inroads on its completeness have been made by railways and roadways. The oldest
                    portion of the city is that which lies to the east of the Alster; but, though it
                    still retains the name of Altstadt, nearly all trace of its antiquity has
                    disappeared, as it was rebuilt after the great fire of 1842. To the west lies
                    the new town, incorporated in 1678; beyond this and contiguous to Altona is the
                    quondam suburb of St Paul’s, incorporated in 1876, and towards the north-east is
                    the quondam suburb of St George, which arose in the 13th century, but was not
                    incorporated till 1868. The old town lies low, and it is traversed by a great
                    number of narrow canals or “fleets” (for the same word which has left its trace
                    in London nomenclature is used in the Low-German city), which add considerably
                    to the picturesqueness of the meaner quarters, and serve as convenient channels
                    for the transport of goods. They generally form what may be called the back
                    streets, and they are bordered by warehouses, cellars, and the lower class of
                    dwelling-houses. As they are subject to the ebb and flow of the Elbe, at certain
                    times they run quite dry, and afford a field of operations for the <hi

                    any articles of value, and at other times they are filled 15 to 20 feet above
                    their ordinary level.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                    and Cuxhaven. In 1872 their zeros were lowered respectively 9 <hi

                    Kiel.</p></note> As soon as the telegram at Cuxhaven announces high tide three
                    shots are fired from the Stintfang at the harbour to warn the inhabitants of the
                    “fleets”; and if the progress of the tide up the river gives indication of
                    danger, other three shots add emphasis to the warning. Then the dwellers on the
                    lower levels make a rapid escape with their property. At the time of the
                    equinoxes the inundation may be repeated for several days in succession; but
                    when all is over the people (the Lüd von de Waterkant) return like rats to their
                    oozy and dripping abodes. In fine contrast to the dull and dismal fleets is the
                    bright and handsome appearance of the Inner Alster, which is enclosed on three
                    sides by handsome rows of buildings, the Alsterdamm in the south-east, the Old
                    Jungfernstieg in the south-west, and the New Jungfernstieg on the northwest,
                    while it is separated from the Outer Alster by part of the rampart gardens
                    traversed by the railway which unites Hamburg with Altona. These streets and
                    especially the Old Jungfernstieg are fashionable promenades. The largest of the
                    public squares of Hamburg is the Hopfenmarkt, which contains the church of St
                    Nicholas, and is "the principal market for fish, meat, vegetables, and fruit;
                    others of importance are the Gänsemarkt or Goose Market, the Zeughausmarkt, and
                    the Great New Market. The churchyards, of which several are pleasantly laid out,
                    are all to be removed to Ohlsdorf, about 4 miles from the town.</p>
                <p>Of the churches actually existing in Hamburg (the old cathedral had to be taken
                    down in 1805), St Peter’s, St Nicholas, St Catharine’s, St James’s, and St
                    Michael's are those that give name to the five old city parishes. The church of
                    St Nicholas is remarkable more especially for its tower, which until the spire
                    of the Cologne cathedral reaches its projected elevation of 511 feet, will
                    probably continue to be the second highest building in the world, rising as it
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n425/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0425-0406"/> does to a height of 473 feet, about 19 feet lower
                    than St Ouen’s at Rouen. The actual church dates from 1845-1874, the former St
                    Nicholas having perished in the great fire. It was opened for public worship in
                    1863. The architect, the late Sir G. Gilbert Scott, selected the rich Gothic
                    style of the 13th century; and both the exterior and interior are elaborately
                    adorned with sculptures. Sandstone from Osterwald near Hildesheim was used for
                    the outside, and for the inner work a softer variety from Postelwitz near
                    Dresden. The roof is wholly constructed of wood. A large part of the cost, which
                    altogether amounted to £204,220, was defrayed by weekly shilling subscriptions.
                    St Michael’s has a tower which almost rivals that of St Nicholas, as with its
                    height of 428 feet it ranks ninth in the list of loftiest buildings in the
                    world. It was erected by Ernst G. Sonnin between 1750 and 1762, on the site of
                    the older building of the 17th century destroyed by lightning; and it not only
                    surpasses all the other churches of Hamburg in size, being 229 feet long and 179
                    feet broad, but produces a fine effect by the colossal proportions of its four
                    principal pillars. St Peter’s church, originally consecrated in 1352, fell a
                    prey to the great conflagration, but it was rebuilt by Chateauneuf in 1844-1849.
                    The ring on the door of the tower (which dates from 1342) is considered the
                    oldest artistic relic in Hamburg; and the granite columns of the old cathedral,
                    the stained glass windows by Kellner of Nuremberg, and Schubert’s Entombment of
                    Christ are worthy of notice. St Catharine’s and St James’s are the only churches
                    of Hamburg that have been preserved from the Middle Ages, but otherwise neither
                    is of special interest. Of the other churches it is sufficient to mention St
                    George’s, built in 1743, St Paul’s in the suburb of that name, the lesser St
                    Michael’s occupied by the Roman Catholics since 1824, and the English Episcopal
                    church dating from 1838. The new synagogue was built by Rosengarten between 1857
                    and 1859, and to the same architect is due the sepulchral chapel of John Henry
                    Schröder in the churchyard of St Peter’s. The beautiful Gertrude’s chapel was
                    unfortunately destroyed in 1842.</p>
                <p>Though Hamburg has comparatively few secular buildings that are of high
                    architectural interest, its list of public institutions is one of which any city
                    might be proud, and several of these are accommodated in spacious structures not
                    unworthy of their destination. The exchange is one of the most important. It was
                    erected on the site of the Mary Magdalen convent in 1836-41, and escaped the
                    catastrophe of 1842. At the business hours between 1 and 3 o’clock as many as
                    from 3000 to 5000 merchants and brokers congregate within its walls. The
                    commercial library in the new wing added in 1873 has upwards of 40,000 vols. In
                    the same neighbourhood are the Hamburg bank and the site of the old rathhaus,
                    which had to be blown up in the great fire. The town-house, built by Görtz,
                    minister of finance to Charles XII. of Sweden, was purchased by the town in
                    1722. The academic gymnasium, founded on 16th August 1610 as a preparatory
                    school for the universities, has since 1873 surrendered its teaching functions,
                    though it still maintains public lectures to which all have access, and is in
                    more or less close connexion with the botanic gardens, the natural history
                    museum, the observatory, the chemical laborStory, and the museum of <hi
                    rend="italic">Culturgesehichte.</hi> The present botanical gardens, which hal
                    been preceded by Veit Scharp’s (1547-1782) and Flugge’s (1810-1813), were laid
                    out by Dr Lehmann on the glacis of the fortifications, and contain about 11
                    acres. The natural history museum was founded in 1843, and in 1875 the sum of
                    1,200,000 marks from the Hamburg share of the French indemnity was assigned for
                    the purpose of supplying better accommodation for its valuable collections,
                    amongst which may be mentioned that from Heligoland and that of Griesbach from
                    South Africa. The observatory, dating from about 1826-1828, is a noteworthy
                    institution. It possesses a great equatorial telescope made by Repsold &amp;
                    Sons in I860, the object glass of which has an aperture of 9 '6 Paris inches,
                    with a focal distance of only 9 '6 feet; and among its contributions to science
                    are Helmert’s observations on the constellation of Sobieski’s Shield (1874), and
                    the determination of all the stars down to 9'5 magnitude in the zone between 80°
                    and 81° of N. declination. In connexion with the observatory a time-ball on the
                    tower of the Kaiserquai is caused to fall at 12 o’clock of Greenwich time: there
                    is a similar ball at Cuxhaven, and another at Bremerhaven. The chemical
                    laboratory was built in 1841. It was not till 1866 that the ethnographical
                    collections were put under special curators; and the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Culturgeschichtliche Museum</hi> only dates from 1872. The principal medical
                    institution in the city is the college of surgeons, founded in 1771 as a general
                    school for doctors and midwives; it received its present constitution in 1833,
                    and was furnished with new buildings in 1861. It was not till 1867, however,
                    that the guild of barbers, with its right of surgical practice, was abolished.
                    The medical union established by H. de Chaufepié about 1815-1816 has published
                    several periodical works, and possesses a library of 12,000 vois. A mathematical
                    society was founded by Heinrich Meissner as early as 1690, the Hamburg-Altona
                    Society for natural science dates from 1837, the Hamburg-Altona branch of the
                    German Anthropological Society from 1870, and the Hamburg branch of the German
                    and Austrian Alpine Club from 1875. A geographical society, which publishes
                    ajournai, wa3 founded in 1873; and the firm of Godeffroy, which trades so
                    extensively in the Pacific, has instituted a museum, and sent out scientific
                    explorers and collectors,—Dr E. G raffe, Amalie Dietrich, Johann Kubary, Andrew
                    Garrett, Franz Hübner, &amp;c.,— the results of whose labours are registered in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Museum Godeffroy</hi> (1871, &amp;c ).
                    Zoological gardens were founded in 1860 1 by a joint-stock company, and an
                    aquarium has since been added under the superintendence of Alfred Lloyd of the
                    Sydenham Crystal Palace. Two of the old monasteries of the town—the St
                    Johanniskloster and the St Maria Magdalenenkloster are still maintained as
                    foundations for the daughters and widows of Hamburg citizens, and the former has
                    funds beyond its requirements. The general infirmary <hi rend="italic"
                    >(allgemeine Krankenhaus)</hi> dates originally from 1606, but the present
                    building was erected in 1825-27, and has since received several additions. The
                    annual number of patients increased, between 1825 and 1875 from 2398 to 8206.
                    The subvention from the state rose in the same period from £8400 to £23,182, and
                    the average daily cost of each patient from 9d. to Is. 9d. A lunatic asylum
                    (Friedrichsberg) was founded in 1841 at Barmbeck at a cost of £2540 for the site
                    and £66,086 for the building. Its patients numbered 212 in 1865 and 492 in 1875.
                    Among minor establishments of a similar class are the sailors’ infirmary (1863),
                    the St Mary’s hospital founded by the Roman Catholic community on the occasion
                    of the Danish war in 1864, but open to patients of every creed, the infirmary of
                    the German Jews built by Solomon Heine in 1840, the infirmary of the freemasons,
                    the children’s hospital dating from 1846-7, the polyclinicum of the patriotic
                    association for the assistance of women (1872), the deaf and dumb institution
                    (1827), and the blind asylum (1830). The orphanage originated in 1600 by Gillis
                    de Greve and Simon von Petkum, admits about 64 children every year. In the
                    beginning of July the orphans, in their bright blue out-door dress, make a
                    procession through the city and the suburb of St George, and the day, known as
                    the Waisengriin, is considered a popular holiday. In the suburban village of
                    Horn is the famous Rauhe Haus, and at Alsterdorf there is a home founded in 1860
                    for idiots and children suffering from incurable diseases. It had 273 inmates in
                    1875. The workhouse, which dates from the beginning of the 17th century, has
                    been situated since 1853 in the village of Barmbeck, and since 1869 has had a
                    branch establishment at Fuhlsbüttel. In 1875 it had 1342 inmates, and its
                    revenues were £17,332, besides a state subvention of £20,417. The annual cost
                    per head is £14, 15s. About 200 free dwellingsand a number of pensions are
                    provided by the Schroder foundation for respectable families and individuals in
                    reduced circumstances.</p>
                <p>Hamburg is well supplied with places of amusements, especially of the more
                    popular kind. Its town theatre, rebuilt in 1874, has room for 1750 spectators;
                    the Thalia theatre dates from 1841, and contains 1700 to 1800; and there are
                    some 7 or 8 minor establishments. Theatrical performances were introduced into
                    the city in the 17th century, and 1678 is the date of the first opera, which was
                    played in a house in the Gänsemarkt. Under Schröder and Lessing the Hamburg
                    stage rose into importance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    highest rank to German literature, the city has been intimately associated with
                    the literary movement. Lappenberg and Hagedorn were born in Hamburg; and not

                <p>The oldest water-works of Hamburg were those of the Oberdamrn, constructed in
                    1531; the first of the modern system with steam power was the Bieber’sehe
                    Elbwasserkunst, openedjn 1822. In 1849 the city water-works belonging to the
                    state were set in operation, and they have since incorporated and systematized
                    the older waterworks. In 1875 they had 5 steam-engines with 850 horse-power, and
                    raised 876 millions cubic feet of water at a cost of about 8d. per 1000 cubic
                    feet. It was not till after the fire of 1842 that Hamburg began to be properly
                    drained; but it now possesses an extensive and elaborate system of sewers. In
                    1853 the upper Old Town, the New Town, and St George’s were supplied, and in
                    1859 the lower Old Town; and between 1871 and 1875 the system was extended to
                    the aristocratic suburban districts of Uhlenhorst and Eimsbüttel. In 1875 the
                    total length of sewers was 512,226 feet, which had cost £662,850. The largest
                    sewers, of which there were 10,499 feet, have a diameter of nearly 10 feet, and
                    can be traversed by boats; the second class (8330 feet) have a diameter of 7
                    feet, and the third class (19,853 feet) of 5⅜ feet. The mouths of the sewers are
                    protected by automatic doors which prevent the flooding of the lower districts
                    by the back-water from the river.</p>
                <p>The harbour of Hamburg as it now exists is a very modern creation. At first the
                    city was at some distance from the main-branch of the Elbe, and the mouth of the
                    Alster served as its port, but partly owing to natural changes in the bed of the
                    great river, and more to the vast engineering enterprises of the
                    inhabitants,—such as the cutting of the channels through the Grandeswerder
                    (1550), the Spadenland marshes (1570), and the Brook,—the principal current was
                    diverted into its present course. To trace the history of the successive labours
                    devoted to the rectification of the stream and the increase of shipping
                    accommodation would be a long aud intricate task. Suffice it to say that up to
                    the middle of the present century the vessels in the harbour of Hamburg used to
                    anchor in the open space and fasten themselves to piles called “dukes of Alba,”
                    and the goods were taken ashore in lighters; but since the introduction of the
                    railway it has been found necessary to build quays with hydraulic cranes and
                    other modern appliances. For this purpose the greater Grasbrook was first of all
                    selected. A portion of the Sandthor (Sandgate) quay was opened in 1872, and by
                    1876 the Kaiser or Imperial quay and the Dallmaun quay (so named after the
                    engineer) were available. The total length of the three quays was 10,646 feet,
                    and the area of ground covered in by the auxiliary buildings was upwards of 30
                    acres. Since that date the quays have been largely increased, so that they now
                    extend a distance of about 3 miles from Altona eastwards. The number of ships
                    which took advantage of the quays in 1866-67 was 665, with a burthen of 313,269
                    tons; by 1875 they had increased to 1425 ships with 837,568 tons, and by 878 to
                    1850, with 1,151,903 tons.</p>
                <p>Hamburg is emphatically a commercial city, and though within recent years greatly
                    developed, its manufacturing industries are in comparison unimportant; but only
                    in comparison, for, according to the official return of 1875, no fewer than 4931
                    persons were engaged in metallurgy, 5926 in the manufacture of machinery,
                    instruments, and tools, 940 iu chemical works, 1399 in the preparation of
                    heating and lighting materials, 1464 in textile industries, 2687 in the paper
                    and leather manufactures, and 9388 in the wood industries. Shipbuilding is
                    carried on pretty extensively, the greatest establishment in the department, the
                    Reiherstieg or Godeflioy’s yards, which was commenced about 1849, employing on
                    an average 700 workmen. There are several enormous distilleries, and two
                    establishments for the manufacture of artificial manures from the phosphates of
                    guano, each of which employs from 200 to 300 workmen; as well as breweries,
                    sugar-refineries, rice-mills, and factories for the preparation of saltpetre,
                    sulphuric acid, and other chemical products. The curing of beef and pork forms a
                    large trade. Pianofortes and cigars, railway carriages and artificial flowers,
                    sewing-machines and chocolate are all manufactured in the town, and tile-works
                    and glassworks exist in the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>In the extent of its commerce Hamburg ranks among European ports immediately
                    after London, Liverpool, and Glasgow. Its im-Sjrts and exports are more than
                    those of the whole of Holland, of elgium, or of Spain. From the year 1836, in
                    which it possessed 146 ships, with a total burthen of 25,722, its marine had
                    increased 770 per cent, by 1877.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1865 it reached the exceptionally high figures, 530 ships
                    of 178,605 tons burthen.</p></note> In 1875 it had 443 sea-vessels with 219,567
                    tons burthen; in 1876 it had 450 with 219,698 toils, and in 1877 468 with
                    223,910. Of the last number 264 were copper-plated, 6 were zinc-plated, and 147
                    were built of iron. The steam vessels were 102. The principal line of steamers
                    is that of the Hamburg-American Company, which on 1st January 1876 had 21
                    first-class British-built vessels, with a total burthen of 60,300 tons. Its
                    voyages are mainly madeto New York and the West Indies. On an average of the
                    three years 1874,1875, and 1876 it earned 31,930 passengers and 165,465 cubic
                    yards of goods. The Hamburg and South American Company at the same time had six
                    vessels, with a burthen of 8000 tons, trading with Brazil and the river Plate.
                    The German Steamship Company had 8 vessels with a burthen of 6,850 tons trading
                    with</p>
                <p>China and the Far East; and the Kosmos Company had 7 ships with a burthen of
                    10,897 tons trading with Chili and Peril. TheSlomanor Mediterranean line of six
                    vessels with a burthen of 5276 tons keeps up monthly communication with ports of
                    Spain and Italy.</p>
                <p>From the following table a general view of the movement of the port will be
                    obtained. It is to be observed that the increase shown is not so much in the
                    number of the ships as in their average capacity.</p>

                <p>Hamburg is an important outlet of emigration, no fewer than 870,000 persons
                    having left Germany by its vessels between 1836 and 1874, or on an average
                    30,000 every year. In 1874 the number was 42,952; in 1875, 31,787; in 1876,
                    28,733; in 1877, 22,143; and in 1878, 24,803.</p>
                <p>The monetary transactions of Hamburg have long been maintained on a very
                    extensive scale. As early as 1619 the great Hamburg giro-bank was founded on the
                    model of that of Amsterdam, and, in spite of the blow struck by the French in
                    1813, it continued to flourish till in 1876 it was replaced by a chief office of
                    the German Imperial Bank, which includes in its domain the province of
                    Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenburg, the three Hanseatic towns, and the two
                    grand-duchies of Mecklenburg. In 1876 there were, besides, the North German Bank
                    (1856) with a capital of £2,250,060; the Union Bank (1856), with £1,500,000
                    capital; the Commercial Bank (1870), with £1,500,000; the International Bank
                    (1870), with £750,000; the Anglo-German Bank (1870), with £1,050,000; the
                    Hypothec Bank (1871), with £375,000; the Exchauge (Wechsler) Bank (1872), with
                    £187,500; the Brokers’ Bank (1871), with £150,000; the Industrial Bank (1871),
                    with £150,000; the St Paul’s Credit Bank, with £150,000; and the People’s Bank
                    (1860). The Imperial Office in 1876 had a total turnover of £336,693,950; and in
                    1875 the North German Bank had 438 millions, the Union Bank 270 millions, and
                    the Commercial 170 millions. There are also 7 savings banks, the total deposits
                    in which rose from £846,070 in 1866 to £1,615,626 in 1874. Few departments are
                    of more extensive development than the marine insurance. In the ten years
                    1834-43 the average value insured was £17,534,487, at an average premium of l
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 50 per cent.; in the corresponding period 1844-53
                    it was £24,028,991 at 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 58 per cent.; and in the
                    next period, 1854-63, it reached £45,571,543.</p>

                <p>It is only ∙within recent years that Hamburg has obtained a fair amount of
                    railway communication. The proposal made about 1840 to construct a line from
                    Hamburg to Lübeck was frustrated by the opposition of the king of Denmark, who
                    feared it would injure the trade between his two towns of Altona and Kiel, which
                    scon afterwards (in 1844) he united by rail. The people of Hamburg were forced
                    to eontent themselves with a line to Bergedorf (1842), but this <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n427/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0427-0408"/> was afterwards extended to Schwerin and Berlin,
                    and a branch line was constructed to Lübeck. The Hamburg-Lübeck direct line was
                    opened in 1865, and in the following year a line was constructed between Altona
                    and Hamburg. Direct communication with Paris by way of Harburg, Bremen,
                    Osnabrück, andVenloo was obtained only in 1872. Though as early as 1862 a scheme
                    was set on foot for such a line, the projectors could not come to terms with the
                    Hanoverian Government, which objected to the duchy of Oldenburg obtaining a
                    share in the advantages of the scheme, and wished to keep to itself the whole
                    authority over the bridges on the Elbe .while leaving the cost of their
                    construction wholly to Hamburg. In 1866 the Hanoverian Government was swept away
                    by Prussia, and in 1867 the new rulers formed a treaty for the construction of
                    the line. The two main branches of the Elbe, the north and the south, are
                    crossed by two great bridges on the system named after Lohse, which had never
                    before been employed in Germany. As the soil is unstable, the pillars had to be
                    founded on a bed of concrete 17 or 18 feet thick resting on piles. The Hamburg
                    or north bridge has three spans each 334 feet wide, and the Harburg bridge has
                    four spans. The total weight of iron employed was 84,651 cwts. (36,152 for the
                    one and 48,499 for the other). Forinternal locomotion the city has a system of
                    tramway lines which run out to Wandsbeckand other neighbouring villages, and a
                    still more extensive omnibus system. Small steamers plying on the Outer Alster
                    give easy access to the places along its shores.</p>

                    in the whole Hamburg territory was 100 to 105, and in 1875 it was 100 to 103.
                    The number of females in proportion to the males is much greater among the
                    native than among the immigrant part of the population; and the proportion of
                    natives to immigrants is a steadily decreasing one,—76 per cent, in 1867, 68 per
                    cent, in 1871, and 65 in 1875. Most of the strangers are from the neighbouring

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Hamburg, or, as the older documents have it,
                    Hamma-burg, appears to have taken its rise as a frontier block-house or castle
                    on the Slavonic borders of Germany, which in the 9th century lay thus far to the
                    west. The block-house, which may have been preceded by some insignificant
                    hamlet, was founded by Charles the Great in 8Ô8; and he was just on the point of
                    making the newly erected church the seat of a bishopric when he died in 814. His
                    scheme was ultimately carried out by his son Louis the Pious in 831, and three
                    years later a charter was issued at Aix-la-Chapelle and confirmed by Gregory IV.
                    raising the bishopric to the rank of an archbishopric, which was to include not
                    only the surrounding district of Germany, but Iceland, Greenland, and the whole
                    Scandinavian territory. Ansgarius, the first occupant of the see, founded a
                    monastery and a school, but in 837 (or 839 according to other accounts) his
                    labours were πιdely interrupted by the Norman pirates, who laid the little
                    settlement in ashes. Other disasters followed: a large portion of the original
                    territory of the archbishopric fell away from its allegiance; and in 847 it was
                    decided at a synod at Mainz under the presidency of Hrabanus Maurus that Hamburg
                    should be attached to the bishopric of Bremen, and the seat of the archbishop be
                    in the latter city. The title of archbishop of Hamburg remained in use till
                    1223, though that of archbishop of Bremen appears as early as the 12th century.
                    All through the 10th century Hamburg continued to suffer from the inroads of the
                    Danes and the Slavonians, and the latter indeed were in possession from 983 to
                    987. In spite of all the settlement advanced: Archbishop Alebrand built a
                    cathedral in 1037, Archbishop Adalbert not long after a castle; and the havoc
                    wrought by Jarl Kruko of Denmark in 1072 was promptly repaired. In 1110the
                    counts of Schauenburg got possession of Holstein and Hamburg, an event which
                    bore in many ways fruit for centuries after. In return for a contribution to a
                    crusade, Adolf III. obtained for the town from the emperor Frederick I. in 1189
                    the right of a separate court and jurisdiction, freedom from toll to the mouth
                    of the Elbe, and right of fishing in the river. Merchants from Flanders now
                    began to visit the place, and its importance as a commercial centre was
                    increased by the destruction of the flourishing town of Bardewijk in 1189 by
                    Henry the Lion. After passing under the lordship of Waldemar of Schleswig (1201)
                    and Albert of Orlamünde (1216), it was recovered by the Schauenburg counts, who
                    erected a strong castle over against it (1231). The alliance with Lübeck,
                    commenced in 1241, and consummated by the treaty of 1255, practically laid the
                    basis of the great Hanseatic League, of which Hamburg continued to be one of the
                    principal members. While its foreign relations were thus improved, its internal
                    organization was also rendered more stable by the new constitution of 1270, and
                    the recognition of the municipal autonomy of the counts of Schauenburg in 1292.
                    The domain of the city was increased in the 14th century by the purchase of
                    Eppendorf, Ritzebüttel, &amp;c.; in the 15th the Frisian pirates who had
                    harassc&lt;l the merchants at the mouth of the Elbe were completely defeated.
                    The claims of the Danish crown to the homage of the city were rejected, and the
                    imperial diet of 1510 under Maximilian I. declared that it was a city of the
                    empire. Not long after two great changes took place. By the so-called “Long
                    Recess” of 1529 the Reformation was introduced, and disagreements with Lübeck
                    set the city free to follow her own path of progress. Through the troubles of
                    the Thirty Years’ War Hamburg escaped almost unscathed; but it suffered from the
                    effects of its own bigoted Lutheranism, which drove many of its dissentient
                    religionists forth to become the founders of the neighbouring Altona. In 1603 it
                    received a code of exchange, and in 1615 the first imperial post. Its population
                    was not long after increased and its commerce quickened by a number of the Jews
                    who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal. The course of the 17th century
                    was marked by discord and strife between the senate and the lower classes, which
                    ultimately brought about the interference of the empire and the publication of
                    the “Great Recess” of 1712. Though the courts of the empire had decided in 1618
                    against the claims of the Danish crown, and had confirmed this decision in 1630
                    and 1643, Christian V. of Denmark made another attempt to take Hamburg by threat
                    of arms; but he accepted a ransom of 280,000 rixdollars, and at length in 1768
                    by the treaty of Gottorp the Danish crown renounced all its claims, and in 1770
                    the delegates of the city took their place in the “Rhenish bench” of the
                    imperial diet. From the Seven Years’ War and the war of American independence
                    the commerce of Hamburg drew new life but it suffered terribly during the years
                    of the French ascendency. The town was not only obliged in 1803 to pay 2,125,000
                    francs to the Hanoverian estates, but in 1806 it had to admit a French garrison
                    within its walls, and to feel the effects of the British blockade of the Elbe.
                    In 1810 indeed it had the honour of being incorporated in the French empire as
                    the chief town of the department of the “Mouths of the Elbe;” but the retreat of
                    the French commandant Carra Saint-Cyr on 12th March 1813, and the subsequent
                    entrance of the Russian Tenterborn on the 18th, were welcomed by the citizens
                    with joy. But their joy was premature, for by the 30th of May the enemy was
                    again in possession. Davoust, the new general, not only demanded a contribution
                    of 48,000,000 francs, but confiscated the 7,506,956 marks banco (of about Is.
                    6d.) at that time in the bank, forced the inhabitants to work at the new
                    fortifications, and drove 20,000 or 30,000 of them out of the city amid the cold
                    of winter. In spite of the attacks of the Russians under Benningsen, Davoust
                    maintained his position till the close of the war. The whole loss of the city
                    from 1806 to 1814 is estimated at £10,500,000 sterling. In 1815 Hamburg became
                    an independent state of the German federation, and formed with Lübeck, Bremen,
                    and Frankfort the curia of the free cities. Its trade rapidly revived, and when
                    in 1842 the great fire destroyed 4219 buildings and rendered nearly 20,000
                    persons homeless, its credit was sufficient to secure a loan of 34 million marks
                    banco. The old oligarchical constitution had been restored after the recovery of
                    independence; and the internal history of the town from 1840 till 1860 is mainly
                    a protracted contest between the conservative and innovative parties. The year
                    1858 was remarkable for a great commercial crisis, and for the meeting in the
                    town of the commission of the navigation of the Elbe, and of the delegates
                    appointed by the principal German states to consider maritime law. By the new

                    introduced, possession of land permitted to strangers, the conditions of
                    settlement greatly modified, and various improvements made in the taxation and
                    duties. At the outbreak of the contest between Prussia and Austria in 1866,
                    Hamburg sided with the former, and in May 1867 it voted 136 to 1 for the
                    constitution of the North German Confederation. It was allowed to remain a free
                    port, but has to pay an aversum to the Zollverein.</p>
