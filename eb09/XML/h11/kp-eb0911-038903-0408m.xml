                    Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After being chosen for two years in succession to
                    read the rhetoric lectures in the public schools, l·Iall became a fellow of his
                    college in 1595, and in the following year received the degree of master of
                    arts. Having taken holy orders, he in 1601 became rector of Halstead in Suffolk,
                    near Bury St Edmunds. Two years later he married; and in 1605 he accompanied Sir
                    Edmund Bacon to the Spanish Netherlands. In 1612 Hall was presented to the
                    curacy of Waltham-Holy-Cross, in Essex, and about the same time received the
                    degree of doctor of divinity. Meanwhile his talent3 as a preacher, and the
                    ability shown in his controversial writings, had brought him into notice at
                    court. He was appointed chaplain to Prince Henry and prebendary of
                    Wolverhampton. The latter dignity he soon resigned. In 1616 Hall accompanied the
                    earl of Carlisle on his mission to France, but was compelled by illness to
                    return; in 1617 he went with James I. into Scotland, and in 1618 was appointed
                    by him one of the English deputies to the synod at Dort; but he was again forced
                    by sickness to return before the business, of the assembly was finished. The
                    year before (1617) he had been appointed dean of Worcester. In the years that
                    followed Hall preached frequently before the court and took an active part in
                    the controversies of the day, especially in that between the Arminian and
                    Calvinistic parties in the Church of England, to the latter of which he
                    belonged. In 1624 he refused the see of Gloucester, but in 1627 became bishop of
                    Exeter. In this position, by his toleration of lecturings and his Calvinistic
                    mode of preaching and administering his diocese, he incurred the suspicion of
                    disaffection to episcopacy, and on three occasions appeared on his knees before
                    the king, to answer for his puri-. tanical practices. Hall felt bitterly these
                    undeserved charges of Laud, and threatened to “cast up his rochet” rather than
                    be subject to them. No better proof of his attachment to the Church of England
                    is needed than his <hi rend="italic">Episcopacy by Divine Hight Asserted,</hi>
                    written in 1640 at the suggestion of Laud. In 1641 Hall was translated to the
                    see of Norwich. The same year he joined eleven other bishops in presenting to
                    parliament a protest against all laws passed in their enforced absence. Upon
                    this the bishops were accused of high treason and thrown into the Tower. Hall in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Hard Measure</hi> relates the trials he underwent both at
                    this time <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0409-0390"/> and afterwards. The accusation fell to the
                    ground, and in six months the bishops were released (June 1642), only,however,
                    on each finding security for £5000. Hall proceeded to Norwich, which he had not
                    yet visited, and set about his pastoral duties; but in April 1643 his revenues
                    and personal property were sequestrated by parliament, a nominal allowance of
                    £400 a year being made for his maintenance. Mrs Hall with great difficulty
                    obtained a fifth of her husband’s property. The bishop was next ejected from his
                    palace, and the cathedral was dismantled. Having retired to a small estate at
                    Higham near Norwich, which he had been able to buy, he there, with his books,
                    bought for him by a friend, spent the rest of his life, writing and preaching
                    “till he was first forbidden by men, and at last disabled by God.” He died 8th
                    September 1656, in his eighty-third year.</p>
                <p>The great bulk of Bishop Hall’s writings is controversial, and therefore of
                    comparatively ephemeral interest; but some of them continue to deserve
                    attention. His satires, published under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Virgidemiarum</hi><hi rend="italic">Sixe Bookes,</hi> consist of three bookes
                    of <hi rend="italic">Toothlesse Satyrs,</hi> subdivided into (1) Poetical, (2)
                    Academicall, and (3) Morall, published in 1597, and three bookes of <hi
                    rend="italic">Byting Satyrs,</hi> published in 1598. They appeared together in
                    1599. Hall claims to be the first English satirist, though Hallam disputes his
                    title, and at the same time rather disparages the satires, which have on the
                    other hand been very highly praised by Campbell and Wartom In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles</hi> (1608-11) Hall claims to be the introducer of that
                    style of prose composition also into English; but both Ascham and Howell
                    anticipated him. The <hi rend="italic">Contemplations upon the Principal
                    Passages of the History of the New Testament</hi> (1612-15), a devout and pious
                    work, one by which perhaps Hall is most generally known, are happily
                    distinguished from most compositions of the class to which they belong by a shy
                    and racy wit which not unfrequently puts the reader in mind of Thomas Fuller.

                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Idem,</hi> a species of allegorical romance, published
                    in 1643, was translated into English by John Healey, under the title of <hi

                    Seneca,” as Sir Henry Wotton called him, are <hi rend="italic">Explication of

                    London, in 10 vols., by the Rev. Josiah Pratt; and a later and better one, in 12
                    vols., at Oxford (1837-39), by the Rev. Peter Hall. A life of Bishop Hall by the
                    Rev. John Jones appeared in 1826.</p>
