                    gentleman there was added in his case what had even then become somewhat rare in
                    the West, some knowledge of Greek. After he had attained to manhood his
                    attention was directed to the Old and New Testament writings, with the result
                    that he became convinced of the truth of Christianity, and along with his wife
                    and his daughter received the sacrament of baptism. We have no means of knowing
                    the nature or duration of the services which he rendered the church during the
                    period which immediately<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0850-0813"/> followed his admission within its pale; but he
                    appears to have continued to reside in Poitiers, and so great was the respect in
                    which he came to be held by the citizens there that about 353, although still a
                    married man, he was by the unanimous voice elected bishop. At that time
                    Arianism, which under imperial protection had overspread the Eastern, was now
                    under similar auspices threatening also to overrun the Western Church; to resist
                    and repel the irruption was the great task which Hilary now set himself to
                    achieve. One of his first steps was to secure the excommunication, by those of
                    the Gallican hierarchy who still remained orthodox, of Saturninus, the Arian
                    bishop of Arles, along with Ursacius and Valens, two of the most prominent of
                    the supporters of that prelate. About the same time he wrote to the emperor
                    Constantius a remonstrance against the persecutions by which the Arians had
                    sought to crush their opponents <hi rend="italic">(Ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Constantium</hi><hi rend="italic">Augustum Liber Primus,</hi> of which the most
                    probable date is 355). His labours for the triumph of orthodoxy were not in the
                    first instance, however, crowned with success; for at the synod of Biterrae
                    (Beziers), summoned in 356 by Constantius with the professed purpose of settling
                    the long-standing disputes, Hilary was by an imperial rescript banished along
                    with Rhodanus of Toulouse to Phrygia, in which exile he spent nearly four years.
                    From this hostile region, however, he continued to govern his diocese without
                    undue difficulty, no successor having been nominated to the see; while at the
                    same time he found leisure for the preparation of two of the most important of
                    his contributions to dogmatic and polemical theology, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Synodis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">De Fide</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Orientalium,</hi> an epistle addressed in 358 to the bishops in
                    Gaul, Germany, and Britain, expounding the true views (sometimes veiled in
                    ambiguous words) of the Oriental bishops on the Trinitarian controversy, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Trinitate Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >XII.</hi>, composed in 359 and 360, in which, for the first time, it was
                    successfully attempted to express in the Latin tongue the theological subtleties
                    and refinements which had been elaborated with the aid of the more flexible
                    language of Greece. The former of these works was not entirely approved by some
                    of the.members of his own party, who thought he had shown too great forbearance
                    towards the Arians, and had expressed himself too hopefully as to the
                    possibilities of an ultimate reconciliation of the contending views; to their
                    criticisms he replied in the <hi rend="italic">Apologetica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Reprehensores Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Synodis Responsa.</hi> In 359 Hilary attended the convocation of
                    bishops at Seleucia in Isauria, where, along with the Egyptian Athanasians, he
                    joined tho Homoiousian majority against the Arianizing party headed by Acacius
                    of Caesarea; thence he betook himself to Constantinople, and, in a petition <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Constantium Augustum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Secundus')</hi> personally presented
                    to the emperor in 360, repudiated the personal calumnies of his enemies and
                    sought to vindicate his Trinitarian principles. His urgent and repeated request
                    to be permitted a public discussion with his opponents, especially with Ursacius
                    and Valens, proved at last so inconvenient that he was sent back to his diocese,
                    which, accordingly, he appears to have reached about 361, within a very short
                    time of the accession of Julian. Though he was received in his diocese with
                    every demonstration of joy, he yet found Arianism strong enough there to demand
                    his best energy and skill for the next two or three years; but in 364, extending
                    his efforts once more beyond Gaul, he impeached Auxentius, bishop of Milan, and
                    a man high in the imperial favour, as heterodox. Summoned to appear before the
                    emperor (Valentinian) at Milan and there maintain his charges in person, Hilary
                    had the mortification of hearing the supposed heretic give answers entirely
                    satisfactory to all the questions which were proposed; nor did his (doubtless
                    sincere) denunciation of the metropolitan as a hypocrite save himself from an
                    ignominious expulsion from Milan as a disturber of the peace of the church. In
                    365 he published the <hi rend="italic">Contra Ariaηos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vel</hi><hi rend="italic">Auxentium</hi><hi rend="italic">Mediolanensem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Liber,</hi> in connexion with the controversy; and also (but
                    perhaps at a somewhat earlier date) the <hi rend="italic">Contra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Constantium Augustum</hi><hi rend="italic">Liber,</hi> in which he
                    pronounced that lately deceased emperor to have been Antichrist, a rebel against
                    God, “a tyrant whose sole object had been to make a gift to the devil of that
                    world for which Christ had suffered.” The later years of Hilary’s life were
                    spent in comparative quiet and retirement, devoted in part to the preparation of
                    his expositions of the Psalms <hi rend="italic">(Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >super</hi><hi rend="italic">Psalmos)</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> for which he
                    was largely indebted to Origen; of his <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi><hi

                    treatise on the book of Job. He died 13th January 368. His great energy and
                    zeal, courage and perseverance, rendered him a very influential ecclesiastic
                    during his life; while, in virtue at once of the depth and acuteness of his
                    intellect and of the wide extent of his knowledge, he holds the very highest
                    rank among the Latin writers of his century. Designated already by Augustine as
                    “the illustrious doctor of the churches,” he by his works exerted an increasing
                    influence in later centuries; and by Pius IX. he was formally recognized as
                    “universae ecclesiae doctor” at the synod of Bordeaux in 1851. Hilary’s day in
                    the Roman calendar is January 14; the English “Hilary Term” begins on the 11th
                    and ends on the 31st.</p>
                <p>Of Hilary’s works, which include, besides those already mentioned, some minor
                    treatises, there have been several editions, of which the most worthy of mention
                    are that of Erasmus (Basel, 1523, 1526, 1528), the Benedictine by Coûtant
                    (Paris, 1693; reprinted by Maffei, Verona, 1730), and that of Migne in the <hi

                    biography by Fortunatus probably dates from about the middle of the 6th century;
                    other sources for the facts of the life of Hilary are the numerous incidental
                    notices to be met with in his own writingsand in those of Jerome, Sulpicius
                    Severus, and Gregory of Tours. See Reinkens, <hi rend="italic">Hilarius</hi><hi
