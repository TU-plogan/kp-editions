                    (1715-1771), was descended from a family of physicians, the first of whom, John
                    Frederick Schweitzer (Latinized into Helvetius), migrated from Germany to
                    Holland about the year 1649, and became physician to the prince of Orange. His
                    later years were spent in the study of alchemy. His son, John Adrien, also a
                    physician, went to Paris in the hope of establishing a sale for his father’s
                    drugs. He failed in this attempt, but was so fortunate as to introduce with the
                    greatest success the use of ipecacuanha, then an unknown drug. The duchess of
                    Chaulnes, whom he had treated successfully, introduced him to Colbert, who
                    recommended the young physician to the dauphin, after which his reputation was
                    firmly established. His son, John Claude Adrien, who embraced the same career
                    with even greater success, was appointed inspector-general of the military
                    hospitals of Flanders and first physician to the Queen Marie Leczinska. He was
                    remarkable for the generosity with which he received and visited poor patients
                    who could pay him nothing. His son, Claude Adrien, the future author of <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Esprit,</hi>
                    showed as a boy little aptitude for study, but was fond of desultory reading.
                    His father, who destined him for finance, placed him for a few years with his
                    maternal uncle, M. D’Arman-court, “directeur des fermes” at Caen. There he
                    learned all that was necessary for a profession so simple, and having plenty of
                    spare time amused himself with writing verses and cultivating social graces. He
                    was elected a member of the academy of Caen, and when he was only twenty-three
                    years of age he had the singular good fortune to be appointed, at the queen’s
                    request, to a place as farmer-general; in other words, while stilΓa very young
                    man he was put into a post of great responsibility and dignity which was worth a
                    hundred thousand crowns a year. Thus provided, young Helvetius proceeded to
                    enjoy life to the utmost. He had every advantage except one, that of noble
                    birth; he was the handsomest man of his time; he was possessed of a manner
                    singularly charming; he was able to hold his own among the scholars and
                    philosophers and poets; he was skilled in all those arts cultivated by
                    gentlemen; he was generous like his father, and his great fortune enabled him to
                    gratify his love of giving; he had an inclination to letters, and was a friend
                    of Fontenelle, Voltaire, and Montesquieu, besides being a patron of such writers
                    as Marivaux, Saurin, and Sabatier. Probably there was no young man in Paris in
                    the years 1740 and 1750 who occupied a more enviable position or was more
                    entirely contented with his lot than this spoiled child of fortune, on whose
                    name there rested but one blot, an almost morbid desire to excel. So far indeed
                    did he carry this passion for distinction that he once danced on the stage of
                    the opera under the mask and name of the public favourite Javillier.</p>
                <p>As he grew older, his social successes and <hi rend="italic">bonnes fortunes</hi>
                    naturally ceased; the splendour of his youth had vanished; he began to dream of
                    other and more lasting distinctions. Maupertuis, he observed, had put
                    mathematics in fashion; he himself would be a mathematician. Voltaire was
                    illustrious for poetry; he too would be a poet. Montesquieu had made so
                    brilliant a success with his <hi rend="italic">Esprit des Lois</hi> that he
                    himself would become a philosopher. The mathematical dream seems to have
                    produced nothing; his poetical ambitions resulted in his poem called <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Bonheur,</hi> in which he develops the idea that true happiness
                    is only to be found in making the interest of one that of all; his philosophical
                    studies ended in the production of his famous book <hi rend="italic">De
                    l'Esprit,</hi> the composition of which occupied him for more than seven years.
                    In the year 1751 he married, his wife being a niece of Madame de Graffigny, the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">Tune</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Péruvienne</hi>; and he spent eight months in the year at his
                    newly purchased estate of Voré in Le Perche; the remaining four months were
                    given up to Paris and his duties of <hi rend="italic">maître</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">T hot el</hi> to the queen. It was characteristic of the man that
                    as soon as he thought his fortune sufficient for his wants he gave up his post
                    of farmer-general. The history of his life in the country is full of anecdotes
                    which illustrate his generous and kindly disposition: he relieved the poor, sent
                    physicians to the sick, mediated between those who quarrelled, encouraged
                    agriculture, developed industries, and found happiness in the patriarchal life
                    of a French seigneur, being as great a stickler as any for his seigneurial
                    rights. It was in 1758 that his book <hi rend="italic">De VEsprit,</hi> which
                    was to be the rival of <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Esprit des
                    Lois,</hi> appeared. It was so far successful at the very outset as to attract
                    immediate attention and to arouse the most formidable opposition, at the head of
                    which was the dauphin, son of Louis XV. The Sorbonne condemned the book; the
                    priests persuaded the court that it was full of the most dangerous doctrines,
                    and the author, terrified at the storm he had raised, wrote three separate
                    retractations; yet, in spite of his protestations of orthodoxy, he had to give
                    up his office at the court, and the book was publicly burned by the hangman. The
                    virulence of the attacks upon the work, as much as its intrinsic merit, caused
                    the whole world to read it; it was translated into almost all the languages of
                    Europe; it was discussed in every literary circle. Yet the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esprit des Lois</hi> lives and is still studied with profit, while <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">VEsprit</hi> has long since been
                    forgotten. It is indeed difficult to understand that the work could ever have
                    had any serious influence upon the thought of the time. Voltaire said it was
                    full of commonplaces; Buffon maliciously said that “Helvétius aurait dû faire un
                    livre de moins et un bail de plus dans les fermes du roi;” Rousseau declared
                    that the very benevolence of the author gave the lie to his principles; Grimm
                    thought that all the ideas in the book were borrowed from Diderot; Madame du
                    Deffand said that Helvetius had raised such a storm by simply revealing the
                    “great secret”; Madame de Graffigny averred that all the good things in the book
                    had been picked up in her own salon.</p>
                <p>As for the philosophy of the book, it belongs to the selfish school; the four
                    discussions of which it consists have been thus summed up:—(1) all man’s
                    faculties may be reduced to physical sensation; memory, comparison, judgment,
                    are only feeling; our only difference from the lower animals lies in our
                    external organization; (2) our interest, founded on the love of pleasure and the
                    fear of pain, is the only spring of our judgments, our actions, our affections:
                    we have no liberty of choice between good and evil; there is no such thing as
                    absolute right—ideas of justice and injustice change according to customs; (3)
                    the inequalities of intellect do not depend on a more or less perfect
                    organization, but have their cause in the unequal desire for instruction, and
                    this desire springs from passions of which all men commonly well organized are
                    susceptible to the same degree; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0676-0643"/> we can therefore all love glory with the same
                    enthusiasm, and we owe all to education; (4) in this discourse the author treats
                    of the ideas which are attached to such words as <hi rend="italic">genius,
                    imagination, talent, taste, good sense,</hi> &amp;c. It is sufficient to add
                    that, although the book was reprinted after the author’s death, it ceased to
                    have any influence even during his own life.</p>
                <p>In 1764 Helvetius visited England, and the next year, on the invitation of
                    Frederick, he went to Berlin, where the king paid him marked attention. He then
                    returned to his country estate and passed the remainder of his life in perfect
                    tranquillity. He died in 1771 at the age of fifty-six, leaving behind him a
                    widow, who died in 1800, and two daughters.</p>
                <p>À sort of supplement to the <hi rend="italic">De VEsprit,</hi> called <hi
                    rend="italic">De THomme, de</hi><hi rend="italic">ses facultés intellectuelles
                    et de son éducation,</hi> was found among his manuscripts after his death, and
                    was published, but created little interest. Editions of the work, however,
                    appeared in 1772, 1773, and 1786. The complete works of Helvetius were published
                    in 1774, 1777, 1781, 1794, 1795, and 1818. The best estimate of his work and
                    place among the philosophers of the 18th century is that by Cousin <hi
