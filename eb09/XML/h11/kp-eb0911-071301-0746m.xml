                <p><label type="entry">HERAT</label> is a city of great interest both historically
                    and geographically, and is of even greater interest politically, its importance
                    at the present day being indicated by its popular designation of the “key of
                    India.” Its origin is lost in antiquity. The name first appears in the list of
                    primitive Zoroastrian settlements contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vendiddd</hi><hi rend="italic">Sadé,</hi> where, however, like most of the
                    names in the same list,—such as <hi rend="italic">Sughdu</hi> (Sogdia), <hi
                    rend="italic">Mouru</hi> (Merv or Mar-gπs), <hi rend="italic">Haraquiti</hi>
                    (Arachotus or Arghend-ab), <hi rend="italic">Haetumaηt</hi> (Etymander or
                    Helmand), and <hi rend="italic">Pagha</hi> (or Argha-stân),—it seems to apply to
                    the river or river-basin, which was the special centre of population. This name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Haroyu,</hi> as it is written in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vendiddd,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hariwa,</hi> as it appears in the
                    inscriptions of Darius, is a cognate form with the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sarayu,</hi> which signifies “a river,” and its resemblance to the ethnic title
                    of Aryan (Sans. <hi rend="italic">Aryα)</hi> is purely fortuitous; though from
                    the circumstance of the city being named “Aria Metropolis” by the Greeks, and
                    being also recognized as the capital of Ariana, “the country of the Arians,” the
                    two forms have been frequently confounded. Of the foundation of Herat (or Heri,
                    as it is still often called) nothing is known. We can only infer from the
                    colossal character of the earth-works which surround the modern town, that, like
                    the similar remains at Bost on the Helmand and at Ulân Robât of Arachosia, they
                    belong to that period of Central-Asian history which preceded the rise of
                    Achaemenian power, and which in Grecian romance is illustrated by the names of
                    Bacchus, of Hercules, and of Semiramis.</p>
                <p>The natural advantages of Herat are mainly due to its river, which, rising in the
                    high uplands 350 miles to the eastward, where the Koh-i-BàbA, the prolongation
                    of the Hindû-kush, bifurcates into the two parallel ranges of the Sufid-koh or
                    “white mountains” to the north and the Siyâh-koh or “black mountains” to the
                    south, passes in the upper part of its course through a succession of rolling
                    downs of the finest pasture-land, and lower down traverses a more contracted
                    valley, enlivened, however, throughout with smiling villages and orchards, till
                    it reaches the eastern limit of the alluvial plain of Herat. Here at the present
                    day nine large canals (in former times there were twenty) carry off the waters
                    of the Heri-rιid for the irrigation of the circumjacent plain, which on a rough
                    calculation may be said to contain nearly 400 square miles of land available for
                    cultivation. M. Khanikoff, who visited Herat in 1858, observes that nowhere in
                    the East,—not even at Samarcand or Bokhara or Ispahan, where the art of
                    canalization is supposed to be carried to perfection,—had he seen watercourses
                    constructed with so much skill, or maintained with so much care, as in the
                    valley of the Heri-rùd; and he adds that, although at the period of his visit
                    nine-tenths of the villages of the plain, which in ordinary times amount to
                    nearly 500, were partially in ruins and the adjoining fields laid waste, the
                    cereal produce of the remaining lands was still far in excess of the wants of
                    the settled inhabitants. The Heri rιid, passing between 3 and 4 miles to the
                    south of Herat, where it is spanned by a magnificent bridge of twenty-three
                    arches, called the <hi rend="italic">Pul-i-Malan,</hi> continues its course
                    westward to the extremity of this rich and fertile plain; it then turns north
                    through an arid country for some 200 miles to Sarakhs, receiving two small
                    streams from the west, the Ab-i-Jàm and Âb-i-Meshed, and forming the territorial
                    boundary between Persia and Afghanistan. As the Heri-rιid is formed of the
                    converging drainage of the Sufid-koh and Siyâh-koh ranges, and its volume thus
                    depends on the extent of snow that falls in the mountains, it is impossible to
                    define with any exactitude the limit of its northern course; but in ordinary
                    seasons water is rarely found in the river bed beyond Sarakhs, and never does
                    the stream penetrate to the northward of a line uniting Abiverd and Merv; and it
                    is of the more importance to note this geographical feature, as in many of our
                    modern maps the line of the Heri-rùd, or Tejend, as it is called in its lower
                    course, is prolonged through the desert 200 miles to the north-westward of
                    Sarakhs.</p>
                <p>The city of Herat is in 34° 22' N. lat. and 62° 9' E. long. It is very
                    centrically situated, great lines of communication radiating from it in all
                    directions—southward to Seistan (200 miles), south-eastward to Kandahar (370
                    miles), eastward to Cabul (550 miles), northward by Mymeneh to Bokhara (600
                    miles) and by Merv to Khiva (700 miles), while to the westward four routes lead
                    into Persia by Turbat to Meshed (215 miles), and by Birjend to Kermàn (400
                    miles), to Yezd (500 miles), or to Ispahan (600 miles). The city forms a
                    quadrangle of nearly a mile square (more accurately about 1600 yards by 1500
                    yards); on the western, southern, and eastern faces the line of defence is
                    almost straight, the only projecting points being the gateways, but on the
                    northern face the contour is broken by a double outwork, consisting of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arl·</hi> or citadel, which is built of sun-dried brick on a high
                    artificial mound within the enceinte, and a lower work at its foot, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ark-i-now,</hi> or “new citadel,” which extends 100 yards
                    beyond the line of the city wall. That which distinguishes Herat from all other
                    Oriental cities, and at the same time constitutes its main defence, is the
                    stupendous character of the earthwork upon which the city wall is built. This
                    earthwork averages 250 feet in width at the base and about 50 feet in height,
                    and as it is crowned by a wall 25 feet high and 14 feet thick at the base,
                    supported by about 150 semi-circular towers, and is further protected by a ditch
                    45 feet in width and 16 in depth, it presents an appearance of imposing
                    strength. Whether the place is really as strong as it looks has been differently
                    estimated. General Ferrier, who resided for some time in Herat in 1846, states
                    that the city is nothing more than an immense redoubt, and gives it as his
                    opinion that as the line of wall is entirely without flanking defences, the
                    place could not hold out for twenty days against a European army; and M.
                    Khanikoff, who, though not a professional soldier, was a very acute observer,
                    further remarks that the whole interior of the city is dominated from the rising
                    ground at the north-east angle, while the water supply both for the ditch and
                    the city would be at the mercy of an enemy holding the outside country, the
                    wells and reservoirs inside the wall, which would then be alone available, being
                    quite inadequate to the wants of the inhabitants; but on the other hand all
                    experience testifies to the defensibility of the position. Not to speak of the
                    sieges which Herat sustained at the hands of Jenghiz Khan, of Timur, and of
                    Ahmed Shah, we have only to remember that in 1837 the Afghans of Herat beat off
                    the continuous attack for nearly ten months of a Persian army of 35,000 regular
                    troops, supported by 50 pieces of artillery, and in many cases directed and even
                    commanded by Russian officers. The truth seems to be that Herat, though in its
                    present state quite unfit to resist a European army, possesses great
                    capabilities of defence, and might by a skilful adaptation of the resources of
                    modern science be made almost impregnable. A British engineer officer, Major
                    Sande⅛rs, calculated in 1840 that at an outlay of sixty or seventy thousand
                    pounds, which would include the expense of deepening the ditch, clearing the
                    glacis and esplanade, providing flanking defences and repairing the walls,
                    &lt;fcc., throughout, Herat might be rendered secure against any possible
                    renewal of the attack by Persia; but of course if an attack by a well-appointed
                    European army were anticipated, more extensive preparations for defence would be
                    required, including probably the erection of two independent forts on the high
                    ground at Mosallâ and Thaleh-bengi.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0747-0714"/>
                <p>The city possesses five gates, two on the northern face, the Kutab-chak near the
                    north-east angle of the wall, and the Malik at the re-entering angle of the
                    Ark-i-now; and three others in the centres of the remaining faces, the Irâk gate
                    on the west, the Kandahar gate on the south, and the Khushk gate on the east
                    face. Four streets called the <hi rend="italic">Chaharsiik,</hi> and running
                    from the centre of each face, meet in the centre of the town in a small domed
                    quadrangle. The principal street runs from the south or Kandahar gate to the
                    market in front of the citadel, and is covered in with a vaulted roof through
                    its entire length, the shops and buildings of this bazaar being much superior to
                    those of the other streets, and the merchants’ caravanserais, several of which
                    are spacious and well built, all opening out on this great thoroughfare. Near
                    the central quadrangle of the city is a vast reservoir of water, the dome of
                    which is of bold and excellent proportions. It is stated by General Ferrier to
                    have been constructed by command of Shah Abbas, and to be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >chef</hi><hi rend="italic">d?</hi><hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi> of its kind. It
                    is supposed to contain above a twelve months’ supply of water for the entire
                    city, but, as M. Khanikoff observes, it is within easy mortar range of the high
                    ground at the north-east angle of the city, and might thus be destroyed by a few
                    well-directed shells, in which case the ruins of the dome would fill up the
                    basin and the water supply would be lost. The only other public building of any
                    consequence in Herat is. the great mosque or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mesjid-i-Jumα,</hi> which comprises an area of 800 yards square, and must have
                    been a most magnificent structure. It was erected towards the close of the 15th
                    century, during the reign of Shah Sultan Hussein of the family of Timur, and is
                    said when perfect to have been 465 feet long by 275 feet wide, to have had 408
                    cupolas, 130 windows, 444 pillars, and 6 entrances, and to have been adorned in
                    the most magnificent manner with gilding, carving, precious mosaics, and other
                    elaborate and costly embellishments. Now, however, it is falling rapidly into
                    ruin, the ever-changing provincial governors who administer Herat having neither
                    the means nor the inclination to undertake the necessary repairs. Neither the
                    palace of the Chxrbagh within the city wall, which was the residence of the
                    British mission in 1840-41, nor the royal quarters in the citadel deserve any
                    special notice. At the present day, with the exception of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chalvar-stik,</hi> where there is always a certain amount of. traffic, and
                    where the great diversity Of race and costume imparts much liveliness to the
                    scene, Herat presents a very melancholy and desolate appearance. The mud houses
                    in rear of the bazaars are for the most part uninhabited and in ruins, and even
                    the burnt brick buildings are becoming everywhere dilapidated. The city is
                    besides one of the filthiest in the East, as there are no means of drainage or
                    sewerage, and garbage of every description lies in heaps in the. open
                    streets.</p>
                <p>With regard to the population, it fluctuates so rapidly, according to the
                    circumstances of the period, that it is impossible to give any estimate of its
                    normal strength. When Christie visited the city in 1809 it was in a very
                    prosperous condition, having been undisturbed for fifty years, and was supposed
                    to contain 100,000 inhabitants. A. Conolly in 1828 reduced the numbers to
                    45,000. Before the Persian siege in 1837 the population was estimated at 70,000,
                    but at the close of the war 6000 or 7000 were all that remained. In 1845, at the
                    time of General Ferrier’s visit, the numbers had increased again to 22,000, and
                    continued to increase to the time of the capture of the place by Dost Mahomed
                    Khan in 1863, when there were at least 50,000 inhabitants within the walls.
                    Since that time Herat has been a mere provincial city governed from Cabul, and
                    its average population has ranged between 20,000 and 30,000, within which,
                    limits must be confined its present estimate.</p>
                <p>The maximum population of which the enceiute would seem to be capable may be put
                    at Christie’s estimate of 100,000, and it is manifest therefore that when Herat
                    contained a population of a million and a half, as is testified by so many
                    contemporary authorities, the present city could have been only the citadel of
                    this vast metropolis, the great mass of buildings lying along the slopes of the
                    northern hills, where for a space of some 4 miles in length by 3 miles in
                    breadth the surface of the plain, strewed over its whole extent with pieces of
                    pottery and crumbling bricks, is also broken here and there by earthen mounds
                    and rained walls, the debris of palatial structures λvhich at one time were the
                    glory and wonder of the East. Of these structures indeed some have survived to
                    the present day in a sufficiently perfect state to bear witness to the grandeur
                    and beauty of the old architecture of Herat. The mosque of the Mosella, for
                    instance, originally built in the 12th century, but restored or rather rebuilt
                    at the end of the 15th century, and intended for the reception of the body of
                    the Imam Reza which Shah Sultan Hussein wished to remove from Meshed to Herat,
                    is, even in its present state of rain and decay, one of the most imposing and
                    elegant structures to be seen in Asia. “The mosque,” says General Ferrier, “is
                    completely covered with a mosaic of glazed bricks in varied and beautiful
                    patterns, and the cupola is of amazing dimensions. Several arcades supported by
                    pillars in brick equal the proportions of the arch of Ctesiphon, and the seven
                    magnificent minarets that surround it may be said to be intact, for the upper
                    part of them only is slightly injured.” Scarcely inferior in beauty of design
                    and execution, though of more moderate dimensions, is the tomb of the saint
                    Abdullah Ansari, in the same neighbourhood. This building, which was erected by
                    Shah Rokh Mirza, the grandson of Timur, nearly 500 years ago, contains some
                    exquisite specimens of sculpture in the best style of Oriental art. Adjoining
                    the tomb also are numerous marble mausoleums, the sepulchres of princes of the
                    house of Timur; and especially deserving of notice is a royal building
                    tastefully decorated by an Italian artist named Geraldi, who was in the service
                    of Shah Abbas the Great. The locality, which is further enlivened by gardens and
                    running streams, is named <hi rend="italic">Gαzir-gdh,</hi> and is a favourite
                    resort of the Herâtis. It is held indeed in high veneration by all classes, and
                    the famous Dost Mahomed Khan is himself buried at the foot of the tomb of the
                    saint.. Two other royal palaces named respectively <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bagh-i-Shah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Takht-i-Sefer,</hi> are situated on the
                    same rising ground somewhat further to the west. The buildings are now in ruins,
                    but the view from the pavilions, shaded by splendid plane trees on the terraced
                    gardens formed on the slope of the mountain, is said to be very beautiful.</p>
                <p>The population of Herat and the neighbourhood is of a very mixed character. The
                    original inhabitants of Ariana were no doubt of the Aryan family, and
                    immediately cognate with the Persian race, but they were probably intermixed at
                    a very early period with the Sacae and Massagetae, who seem to have held the
                    mountains from Cabul to Herat from the first dawn of history, and to whom must·
                    be ascribed—rather than to an infusion of Turco-Tartaric blood introduced by the
                    armies of Jenghiz and Timur—the peculiar broad features and flatfish countenance
                    which distinguish the inhabitants of Herat, Seistan, and the eastern provinces
                    of Persia from their countrymen further to the west. Under the government of
                    Herat, however, there are a very large number of tribes, ruled over by separate
                    and semi-independent chiefs, and belonging probably to different nationalities.
                    The principal group of tribes is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chahar-Ainidk,</hi> or “four races,” the constituent parts of which, however,
                    are variously stated by different authorities both as to strength and
                    nomenclature. Mountstuart Elphins.tone, by far the best general authority on
                    Afghan questions, gives the original four tribes as the Taimenis, the Hazarehs,
                    the Taiιnuris, and Zûris; Khanikoff, on the other hand, whose forte was
                    ethnography, and who made his inquiries on the spot, describes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chahar-ALmâk</hi> as the Kipchaks (100,000 families), the
                    Jamshidis (12,000), the Taimenis (60,000), and the Firoz-kohis (10,000 to
                    12,000); while Pöttinger substitutes the Sooni Hazarehs of Kileh-now for the
                    Kipchaks of Khanikoff, and raises the Firoz-kohi Aimaks to 30,000 families.
                    These tribes all dwell in the mountains to the north-east, the east, and the
                    south-east of Herat, and number in the aggregate perhaps a million souls. Major
                    Taylor, who made special inquiries on the subject in 1856, found that the
                    governor of Herat could raise for fighting purposes from these tribes and the
                    allied Turcomans of Merv 47,000 horse and 23,000 foot, but matters have very
                    much changed since Herat came under the government of Cabul in 1863, the recent
                    policy being to lower the fighting force of the semi-independent chiefs, and to
                    substitute infantry regiments raised and paid by the central authority. At
                    present there arc perhaps ten such regiments, which can be supplemented by about
                    10,000 horse and 10,000 irregular foot.</p>
                <p>The trade of Herat is also subject to great fluctuation. From its central
                    geographical position it must naturally be an emporium of commerce between
                    Persia, Turkestan, Afghanistan, and India, while owing to the richness of the
                    valley, which can usually furnish supplies for 150,000 men over and above the
                    consumption of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0748-0715"/> the fixed inhabitants, as well as to the mineral
                    wealth of the adjoining mountains and the industrial activity of the city
                    population, especially in regard to silk and woollen manufactures (the carpets
                    of Herat being famous throughout the East), the country rapidly recovers from
                    the effects of war, and its normal condition may be said to be that of
                    prosperity and abundance.</p>
                <p>In actual territory Herat extends east and west from near the sources of the
                    Heri-rud about 300 miles to the Persian frontier beyond Ghoriân, and north and
                    south from the Merv boundary, in about 36° lat., 200 miles to the northern limit
                    of Seistan. The inhabitants of the city of Herat are for the most part Shiahs,
                    and in regard to language and habits, as well as religion, are Persians rather
                    than Afghans. There are, however, both in the town and in the neighbouring
                    villages a certain number of Afghan colonists, who have been settled there—the
                    greater part by Nadir Shah—during the last 150 years, as well as Hazarehs,
                    Jamshidis, and Taimenis, with a fair sprinkling of Hindus and some forty
                    families of Jews. The net revenue of the valley and its immediate dependencies
                    in ordinary times is under £100,000 per annum, but the vizier Yar Mahomed Khan
                    is supposed in the plenitude of his power, and when he had for a time brought a
                    great part of Seistan under his sway, to have realized double that amount from
                    the entire province.</p>
                <p>To trace in any detail the fortunes of Herat would be to write the modern history
                    of the East, for there has hardly been a dynastic revolution, or a foreign
                    invasion, or a great civil war in Central Asia since the time of the Prophet, in
                    which Herat has not played a conspicuous part and suffered accordingly. Under
                    the Tahirides of Khorassan, the Soffarians of Seistan, and the Samanides of
                    Bokhara, it flourished for some centuries in peace and progressive prosperity;
                    but during the succeeding rule of the Ghaznevide kings its metropolitan
                    character was for a time obscured by the celebrity of the neighbouring capital
                    of Ghazni, until finally in the reign of Sultan Sanjar of Merv about 1157 the
                    city was entirely destroyed by an irruption of the Ghoz, the predecessors, in
                    race as well as in habitat, of the modern Turcomans. Herat gradually recovered
                    under the enlightened Ghoride kings, who were indeed natives of the province,
                    though they preferred to hold their court amid their ancestral fortresses in the
                    mountains of Ghor, so that at the time of Jenghiz Khan’s invasion it equalled or
                    even exceeded in populousness and wealth its sister capitals of Balkh, Merv, and
                    Nishapoor, the united strength of the four cities being estimated at three
                    millions of inhabitants. But this Moghul visitation was most calamitous; forty
                    persons, indeed, are stated to have alone survived the general massacre. of
                    1232, and as a similar catastrophe overtook the city at the hands of Timur in
                    1398, when the local dynasty of Kurt which had succeeded the Ghorides in eastern
                    Khorassan was put an end to, it is astonishing to find that early in the 15th
                    century Herat was again flourishing and populous, and the favoured seat of the
                    art and literature of the East. It was indeed under the princes of thehouse of
                    Timur that most of the noble buildings were erected, of which the remains still
                    excite our admiration at Herat, while all the great historical works relative to
                    Asia, such as the <hi rend="italic">Rozet-es-Sefci,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Habib·esseir, II't,fiz Abru s Tarikh,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matld'a-es∙Sa</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">adin,</hi> &amp;e., date from the same
                    place and the same age. Four times was Herat sacked by Turcomans and Uzbegs
                    during the centuries which intervened between the Timuride princes and the rise
                    of the Afghan power, and it has never in modern times attained to anything like
                    its old importance. Afghan tribes, who had originally dwelt far to the east,
                    were first settled at Herat by Nadir Shah, and from that time they have
                    monopolized the government and formed the dominant element in the population. It
                    will be needless to trace the revolutions and counter-revolutions which have
                    followed each other in quick succession at Herat since Ahmed Shah Durâni founded
                    the Afghan monarchy about the middle of the last century. Let it suffice to say
                    that Herat has been throughout the seat of an Afghan government, sometimes in
                    subordination to Cabul and sometimes independent. Persia indeed for many years
                    showed à strong disposition to reassert the supremacy oyer Herat which was
                    exercised by the Suffavean kings, but Great Britain, disapproving of the advance
                    of Persia towards the Indian frontier, steadily resisted the encroachment; and,
                    indeed, after helping the Herâtis to beat off the attack of the Persian army in
                    1838, the British at length compelled the shah in 1857at the close of his war
                    with them to sign a treaty recognizing the future independence of the place, and
                    pledging Persia against any further interference with the Afghans. In 1863
                    Herat, which for fifty years previously had been independent of Cabul, was
                    incorporated by Dost Mahomed Khan in the Afghan monarchy, and such is the
                    present condition of the principality, the actual Governor Ayub Khan
                    beingtheuterinebrother and deputy of Yacιib Khan, who recently signed with the
                    Government of India the famous treaty of Gandamak. (H. O. R.)</p>
