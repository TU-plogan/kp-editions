                    Sτιdhamton-sire,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sudenhamptοnsire),</hi> a maritime
                    county in the south of England, is situated between 50° 34' and 51° 22' N. lat.
                    and 0° 43' and 1° 54' W. long., and is bounded on the N. by Berkshire, on the E.
                    by the counties of Surrey and Sussex, on the S. by the English Channel, and on
                    the W. by Wiltshire and Dorsetshire. It is of an irregular quadrilateral form,
                    and its greatest breadth from north to south, not including the Isle of Wight,
                    is 46 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west 41 miles. The total area
                    comprises 1,032,105 imperial aεres (mainland portion 938,764 acres, Isle of
                    Wight 93,341), or nearly 1613 square miles. Hampshire in its general aspect
                    presents a beautiful variety of gently rising hills and fruitful valleys,
                    adorned with numerous mansions and pleasant villages, and interspersed with
                    extensive woodland. Two ranges of low chalk hills, known as the North and South
                    Downs, enter the county from Surrey and Sussex respectively, and traverse it in
                    a north-westerly direction into Wiltshire and Berkshire, forming in the
                    north-western corner of the county several picturesque eminences, from which
                    some fine views are obtained. The highest of these summits is Siddown Hill,
                    Highclere, 940 feet. The northern and north-eastern portion of the county,
                    comprising more than 100,000 acres, is in the basin of the Thames; a large
                    portion of the southern district is in the Southampton or Isle of Wight basin;
                    and a portion to the west is in the basin of Wilts and Dorset. The south-western
                    corner from Southhampton Water is almost wholly occupied by the New Forest. The
                    coast on the whole is low and irregular. The most easterly part forms a large
                    bay containing Hay· ling Island and Portsea Island, which divide it into
                    Chichester harbour, Langston harbour, and Portsmouth harbour. From the
                    south-western extremity of Portsmouth harbour it runs about 18 miles inland in a
                    north-west direction, and forms Southampton Water, which has a western shore
                    about 10 miles in length, and an average breadth of nearly 2 miles at high
                    water. From Southampton Water its line is continued irregularly in a
                    south-western direction —for nearly one half of its extent fronting the Isle of
                    Wight, and in its western half forming Christchurch Bay and part of Poole
                    Bay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers and Canals.—</hi> The principal rivers are the Avon, the
                    Boldre, the Exe, the Test with its tributary the Anton, the Itching, and the
                    Hamble. The Avon in the south-west of the county has its source in Wiltshire,
                    and passing Fordingbridge and Ringwood empties itself into Christ Church Bay,
                    where it is joined by the Stour, which rising in Dorset crosses the south-west
                    corner of Hampshire. The Boldre takes its rise in the New Forest, and after
                    collecting the water of several brooks falls into Lymington creek. The Exe near
                    the eastern extremity of the New Forest falls into the Solent at Beaulieu. The
                    Test rises near Overton, and after its junction with the Anton at Fullerton
                    passes Stockbridge and R0m3ey, and forms the head of Southampton Water. The
                    Itching rises near Alresford, and flowing by Kingsworthy, Winchester, and
                    Twyford falls into the Southampton Water to the north of Southampton. The Hamble
                    rises near Bishop’s Waltham, and after a course of about 10 miles falls into the
                    Southampton Water. The Wey, the Enbourne, the Loddon, and the Blackwater have
                    their rise in the north part of the county, but soon pass into Berkshire.</p>
                <p>There is one canal, Basingstoke, begun in 1778 and completed in 1794 at a cost of
                    £100,000. It is 37 miles in length and terminates in the river Wey, in Surrey,
                    near its junction with the Thames. Andover canal, begun in 1789, was filled up
                    in 1858 and converted into a railway, forming a junction with the London and
                    Exeter at Andover.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Soil.—</hi> With the exception of the northern and
                    north-eastern corner occupied by the basin of the Thames, another portion about
                    8 miles in breadth extending along the eastern side, and the New Forest in the
                    southwest, with a small portion to the north of it, Hampshire is occupied by the
                    Chalk formation which runs from Sussex and Surrey north-east into Wilts and
                    Berks. This middle district has a length from north to south of about 22 miles
                    and a breadth from east to west of between 20 and 30 miles. Its soil is in some
                    places of considerable depth, and produces good crops of all kinds, but a great
                    part of it is so thin as to be unfitted for the plough, and is used as sheep
                    pasture. The basin of the Thames to the north of this district is principally
                    strong brown and grey loam, with a considerable number of marshes. The eastern
                    portion forming the Vale of Petersfield, and comprising only about 50,000 acre3,
                    rests on the Wealdean formation, and is a grey sandy loam provincially called
                    “malmy” land, lying on a soft sand rock. The southern portion, which includes
                    the ancient Forest of Bare, Waltham Chase, and the New Forest, consists
                    principally of light sandy and gravelly loams intermixed with clay and brick
                    earth, resting chiefly on argillaceous and calcareous marl.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> According to the Agricultural Statistics for
                    1879, the total area of arable laud was 706,927 imperial acres, of which 247,958
                    were under corn crops, 135,982 under green crop, 112,813 under rotation grasses,
                    184,141 permanent pasture, and 22,967 fallow. The acreage under woods was
                    87,229. The principal grain crop is wheat, for which Hampshire enjoys a great
                    celebrity. Its acreage has been gradually increasing, and in 1879 was 100,090.
                    The acreage of barley and oats was 66,228, and 64,957 respectively. Barley is
                    usually sown after turnips, and is more grown in the uplands than in the lower
                    levels. Beans and pease are only grown to a small extent, the acreage in 1879
                    being respectively' 4633 and 10,092. On account of the number of sheep pastured
                    on the uplands a large breadth of turnips is grown, their acreage in 1879 being
                    81,472. Potatoes are not cultivated beyond what is necessary for home supplies,
                    and had an acreage of only 5039. Rotation grasses are grown chiefly in the
                    uplands, and their acreage is greater than in any other of the southern counties
                    of England. Sanfoin is the grass most largely grown, as it is best adapted to
                    land with a calcareous subsoil. In the lower levels no sanfoin and scarcely any
                    clover is grown, the hay being supplied from the rich water meadows, which are
                    managed with great skill and attention, and give the best money return of any
                    lands in the county. Where a rapid stream of water can be passed over them
                    during the winter it seldom becomes frozen, and the grasses grow during the cold
                    weather so as to be fit for pasture before any traces of vegetation appear in
                    the surrounding fields. Hops are extensively grown in the eastern part of the
                    county bordering on Surrey. Their acreage in 1879 was 3064. Farming is generally
                    conducted on the best modern principles, but owing to the varieties of soil
                    there is perhaps no county in England in which the rotation observed is more
                    diversified, or the processes and methods more varied. Most of the farms are
                    large, and there is a considerable number of model farms. The waste land has
                    been mostly brought under tillage, but a very large acreage of the ancient
                    forests is still occupied by wood. New Forest has 60,000 acres under wood, in
                    addition to which there are in the east Woolmer Forest (5949) and Alice Holt
                    (2744), in the south-east the Forest of Bere (11,000) and Waltham Chase (2000),
                    and in the Isle of Wight Parkhurst Forest (3000). The New Forest was originally
                    formed by William the Conqueror in 1079 after the battle of Hastings, and the
                    greater part of it belongs to the crown. The trees of the forest are principally
                    beech and oak. The oaks, many of which are some hundred years old, do not grow
                    to a great height, but shoot out strong crooked branches which give them a very
                    picturesque appearance. Formerly they were chiefly used for the ships of the
                    royal navy. Herds of small ponies similar to those of Shetland and the Hebrides
                    are still reared in the Forest. It also contains abundance of deer, <pb

                    honey of the county enjoys a special celebrity.</p>
                <p>The number of cattle has increased with the improved facilities for railway
                    transport, and in 1879 was 66,059, or an average of 9'3 to every 100 acres under
                    cultivation, as compared with 16’9 for England and 21Ό for the United Kingdom.
                    Of these the number of cows and heifers in milk or in calf was 35,128. The
                    cattle are of no distinctive breed. The number of horses, to the breeding and
                    rearing of which much attention is paid, was 29,247 in 1879, or an average of 4T
                    to every 100 acres under cultivation, as compared with 45 for England and 4 1
                    for the United Kingdom. The number of sheep in 1879 was 552,041, or an average
                    of 78’2 to every 100 acres under cultivation, as compared with 75'3 for England
                    and 68 ’ 0 for the United Kingdom. The original breed was white-faced with
                    horns, but most of the flocks now are of a Southdown variety which have acquired
                    certain distinct peculiarities, and are known as “short wools” or “Hampshire
                    downs.” The number of pigs in 1879 was 57,122, or an average of 8 ’ 0 to every
                    100 acres, as compared with 7'2 for England and 6’7 for the United Kingdom. The
                    breeding and fattening of pigs has long been a most important part of Hampshire
                    industry. The original breed of pigs has been improved by crossing with
                    Berkshire, Essex, and Chinese pigs. In the vicinity of the forests the pigs are
                    fed on acorns and beechmast, and the pork of those so cured is considered the
                    best, although the reputation of the Hampshire bacon depends chiefly on the
                    skilful manner in which it is cured.</p>
                <p>According to the Landowners’ Return of 1872-73, the land was divided between
                    27,472 proprietors, holding land the gross annual value of which was £
                    2,469,124. Of the owners 77 per cent, possessed less than one acre, and the
                    average all over was £2, 10s. 2⅛d. There were no fewer than 35 proprietors
                    holding upwards of 5000 acres, viz :—Earl of Portsmouth, 16,401; Duke of
                    Wellington, 15,847; Lord Ashburton, 15,330; Sir William Heathcote, Bart.,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> The manufactures are unimportant
                    except those carried on at Portsmouth and Gosport in connexion with the royal
                    navy. There are large steam docks and an extensive shipping trade at
                    Southampton. In many of the towns there are breweries and tanneries, and paper
                    is manufactured at several places. Fancy pottery and terra cotta are made at
                    Fareham and Bishop’s Waltham; and Ringwood is celebrated for its knitted gloves.
                    At most of the coast towns fishing is prosecuted, and there are oyster beds at
                    Hayling Island. Cowes in the Isle of Wight is the station of the royal yacht
                    squadron and has building yards for yachts and lar&lt;re steamers. The principal
                    bathing-places, besides those in the Isle of Wight, are Southsea, Southhayling,
                    Bournemouth, and Anglesea, a suburb of Gosport. At Portsmouth there is a convict
                    pnson, at Parkhurst a prison for convict boys, and at lldershott a large
                    military camp.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The London and South-Western Railway enters the
                    county at Farnborough, passing by Winchester and from thence to Southampton, a
                    branch diverging from Bishopstoke to Gosport, and again to Portsmouth, Havant,
                    and Emsworth, via the South Coast Railway, by a branch from Fareham. A branch of
                    the Great Western from Reading joins the South-Western at Basingstoke, about a
                    mile south-west from which a line diverges to Whitchurch, Andover, and
                    Salisbury. The Guildford and Reigate branch of the South Coast Railway
                    communicates with Alton and New Alresford, 6 miles west of which it joins the
                    South-Western. Southampton communicates with Dorchester by the Dorchester
                    Railway which, after branching to Lymington, passes Ringwood, from which there
                    is another branch to Christchurch and Bournemouth. Another line connects
                    Southampton with Salisbury, and from this line a branch 4 miles north of Romsey
                    communicates with Andover.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Hampshire, including the Isle of Wight,
                    comprises 38 “hundreds,” 10 “liberties,” 1 city, that of Winchester (16,366),
                    which is also a municipal and parliamentary borough; 5 other boroughs which are
                    both municipal and parliamentary, viz., Andover (5744), Lymington (5356),
                    Newport (8522), Portsmouth (113,569), and Southampton (53,741); 2 parliamentary
                    boroughs, viz., Christchurch (15,415) and Petersfield (6104); and 3 municipal
                    boroughs—Basingstoke (5574), Romsey (2056), and Ryde (11,260).</p>
                <p>For parliamentary purposes Hants is formed into three divisions, viz., North
                    Hants, South Hants, and the Isle of Wight. Winchester which returns 2 members,
                    and Andover and Petersfield which return 1 member each are in the northern
                    division, which returns in all 6 members; in the southern division are included
                    the boroughs of Christchurch and Lymington returning 1 member each, and the
                    boroughs of Portsmouth and Southampton returning 2 each, and it returns in all 8
                    members; the Isle of Wight returns 1 member, and also contains the borough of
                    Newport returning 1 member. The total representation of the county is thus 16
                    members.</p>
                <p>The county has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 14 petty
                    sessional divisions. The city of Winchester, and the boroughs of Andover,
                    Portsmouth, and Southampton (a county of itself), have commissioners of the
                    peace and separate courts of quarter sessions; and the boroughs of Basingstoke,
                    Newport, Romsey, and Ryde have commissions of the peace. In the borough of
                    Lymington the mayor and ex-mayor are magistrates, and the county justices have
                    concurrent jurisdiction. The county is included in the western circuit, and
                    ecclesiastically is almost entirely in the diocese of Winchester.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The total population of the county amounted
                    in 1841 to 354,682, in 1851 to 405,370, in 1861 to 481,815, and in 1871 to
                    544,684 (males, 275,393; females, 269,291). The increase in 30 years from 1841
                    has been 54 percent., and since 1801 it has been 97 per cent. The excess of
                    males over females is accounted for by the naval and military establishments
                    situated in the county. In 1871 the mainland portion contained a population of
                    478,465, and the Isle of Wight 66,219.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Before the Roman invasion the
                    Welsh Celts of Hampshire had been driven out or subdued by incursions of Gauls,
                    who first took possession of the country round Winchester to the west of the
                    great forest of Andresweald, stretching into Hampshire from Sussex, and
                    gradually occupied the greater part of the southern shires from Surrey and
                    Sussex to Devon. It was probably during this prolonged contest that the
                    intrenched camps were formed at Beacon Hill, Bury Hill, Danebury, Quarley Mount,
                    and Worldbury Mount. The Gauls whom the Romans found in South Britain were
                    divided into three tribes—the <hi rend="italic">Regni</hi> on the coast, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Belgae</hi> in the middle, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atrebates</hi> in the north. Their chief town occupied the site of the modern
                    Winchester, and was known as <hi rend="italic">Venta Belgarum</hi> by the
                    Romans, who made it one of their principal stations. From it roads, traces of
                    which may yet be seen, were constructed to Sorbiodunum (Old Sarum), Silchester,
                    and Southampton, and to Porchester (Portsmouth) and Chichester. Next to <hi
                    rend="italic">Venta Belgarum</hi> the most important Roman station in Hampshire
                    was <hi rend="italic">Calleva</hi> (probably Silchester), where there are yet
                    very extensive remains; traces of a large station <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Clausentian)</hi> are still to be seen at Southampton; at Portsmouth portions
                    of an old Roman fort are incorporated in the castle of Porchester; at Broughton,
                    near Stockbridge, slight traces of a station are still visible; and an
                    intrenchment at Egbury Hill, near Whitchurch, is regarded by some as the remains
                    of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Vindomis,</hi> although others place the site
                    of that town at Silchester. Even before the Roman conquest of Britain the
                    southern shores of England had been frequently attacked by Saxon pirates, and
                    afterwards, in 475, the warriors Hengist and Horsa had succeeded ultimately and
                    with great difficulty in establishing themselves in Kent; but the real conquest
                    of southern Britain was accomplished by a Saxon tribe called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gervissa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gervissi,</hi> who about the year 495, under
                    Cerdic and his son Cynric, landed from five ships on the shores of Southampton
                    Water, and concluded a stubborn contest by defeating the Britons at Charford in
                    519, from which period is generally dated the origin of the kingdom of Wessex,
                    which had for its capital Winchester, then known as Wintanceaster or
                    Winteceaster. The establishment of the bishop’s see at Winchester, after the
                    conversion of King Kynegils of Wessex about 635, falls more appropriately to be
                    noticed in the article on that city. In 755, according to the Saxon chronicle,
                    Sigebert, king of Wessex, was deprived by the witan of the whole of his kingdom,
                    with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Hamtanscire,</hi> the first time that
                    the name occurs. Hampshire played a prominent part in the contest with the Danes
                    or Northmen, who about 860 stormed Winchester, but were afterwards worsted, in
                    871 defeated Ethelbert at Basing, and in 878’compelled King Alfred to retreat to
                    the woods and fastnesses. The devastation of the Isle of Wight by the Danes in
                    the reign of Ethelred II., and the other historical events connected with that
                    island, will be noticed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Wight, Isle of.</hi>
                    Under Edward the Confessor and Harold II. the seat of government had been
                    transferred from Winchester to Westminster, but the honour was again restored to
                    Hampshire by William the Conqueror, who made Winchester his principal residence,
                    and for the purposes of sport devastated a large part of the county to form the
                    New Forest. The superstitious fancies of the time traced a necessary connexion
                    between this violent exercise of his prerogatives and the sudden death of his
                    sons and grandson within the boundaries of the scene of his ruthless
                    devastations: his son Richard was smitten with sudden death in the New Forest
                    while hunting; a second Richard, a natural son of Robert his eldest son, met his
                    death there accidentally; and William Rufus, his eldest son and his successor,
                    while hunting within it was shot by an arrow in 1100. The loss which the shire
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0453-0432"/> sustained by the final transference of the seat
                    of government to London was partially compensated for by the rise of the ports
                    of Southampton and Portsmouth, which have been an important element in its
                    prosperity down to the present time. The principal other historical events of
                    the shire are connected either with these two towns or with Winchester or the
                    Isle of Wight, the only exception of importance being the siege and capture of
                    Basing House by the troops of Cromwell in 1645.</p>
                <p>The principal monastic institutions in Hampshire, dissolved by Henry VIII., were
                    the priory of St Swithin, who was bishop of Winchester from 852 to 862; the
                    monastery of Hyde, outside the walls of Winchester, founded by King Alfred; the
                    nunnery of St Mary’s, Winchester; St Elizabeth’s College, Winchester; the
                    nunnery of Wherwell, founded by Elfrida; the Augustinian priory of Southwick,
                    founded by William of Wykeham; the Praemonstratensian abbey of Tichfield,
                    founded in the time of Henry III.; the Augustinian priory of Twyneham,
                    Christchurch, founded according to some authorities by King Athelstan; the
                    Augustinian priory of Breamore, founded by Baldwin de Redvers; the nunnery of
                    Romsey, founded by Edward the Elder about 910; the Augustinian priory of
                    Mottisfont, endowed soon after the Conquest, but by whom is uncertain; the
                    Cistercian abbey of Beaulieu, founded by King John about 1204; the Cistercian
                    abbey of Netley, founded in the time of Henry III.; the Augustinian priory of St
                    Denis, near Southampton, founded by Henry I.; the abbey of Quarr, Isle of Wight;
                    and the preceptory of Baddesley. The most important monastic remains are those
                    at Winchester; the priory church at Christchurch in the Norman and Perpendicular
                    style; the Norman church at Romsey; the remains of Netley Abbey, with a church
                    in the Early English style; the ruins of Beaulieu Abbey, of which a gateway is
                    in good preservation (the abbot’s house has been converted into a private
                    residence, and the great hall or refectory, in the plain Early English style, is
                    now used as a parish church); the ruins of the priory of St Denis, and the
                    Norman church at Porchester, near Portsmouth. Corhampton church, near Exton, is
                    the only Saxon church in Hampshire which is entire, but Saxon masonry is found
                    in Headbourne Worthy church, which also contains an old brass of the 15th
                    century. The principal other old churches not mentioned under Winchester,
                    Southampton, and other towns, nor already referred to in connexion with monastic
                    remains, are—in the Norman style, Chilcombe, Hamble, Kingsclere, and Tichbourue;
                    in the Norman style, with Early English additions, Alton, Basing, Bishop's
                    Sutton, Brockenhurst, Clatford, Hambledon, Milford, and Warnford; in the Early
                    English, Boldre, Cheriton, Grately, Sυpley, which is partly Perpendicular, and
                    Thruxton, which contains a brass to Sir John Lisle (died 1407), affording the
                    earliest example of complete plate armour in England; and in the Perpendicular,
                    Basingstoke, Fordingbridge, which is also partly Decorated, Tichfield, Selboπιe,
                    and Warblington.</p>
                <p>The principal old castles are Calshot Castle, built in the time of Henry VIII.,
                    and used by the coast-guard; Carisbrook Castle (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wight,
                    Isle of);</hi> Hurst Castle, near Southampton, where Charles I. was for a short
                    time imprisoned, now transformed into a fortress; and Porchester Castle (see <hi

                    than usually numerous.</p>
