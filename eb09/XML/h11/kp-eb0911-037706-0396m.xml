                    century of the Christian era, and after passing the earlier part of his life in
                    military service, studied under Cadhizâdeh Effendi, a learned doctor at the
                    Ottoman capital, and made great progress in Arabic literary and linguistic
                    studies. In June 1633 he again accompanied the army to Syria, but while the
                    troops were in winter quarters at Aleppo, he himself performed the pilgrimage to
                    Mecca, whence he took the cognomen of Hajji, “Pilgrim.” Returning in 1635 to
                    Constantinople, he resumed his literary studies, and occupied himself with
                    visiting all the libraries and book shops, and compiling an inventory of their
                    contents, together with notices of the authors of the various works. In 1638 he
                    attended the lectures of Sheikh A’raj Mustafazadah, whom he proposed to himself
                    as an example to imitate in his future literary career. Besides his purely
                    literary studies he also devoted himself assiduously to the sciences, and became
                    well versed in logic, geometry, geography, astronomy, and the like. Nor were
                    medicine and the occult sciences neglected by him, so that there were few of the
                    subjects treated of in the works which he delighted to describe with which he
                    was not more or less technically acquainted. About 1648 he was appointed
                    assessor (khalifa) to the principal of the imperial college, whence he took the
                    title of Khalfa, by which, with the prefix of Hajji (Pilgrim), he is commonly
                    designated. He died in September 1658.</p>
                <p>Besides his great <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical Lexicon,</hi> he composed
                    several other works, chiefly geographical and historical; of these the best
                    known are <hi rend="italic">Τakιcimuιtawdrikh</hi> or “Chronological Tables,”

                    “Mirror of the World,” and one or two treatises on miscellaneous literary
                    subjects. The language in which he wrote is Arabic, and the style is that which
                    the nature of his studies would <pb break="no"

                    classical, and abounding in technical terms and phraseology. Of the amount of
                    his learning and of his indefatigable application to study his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lexicon</hi> is a lasting memorial. There is scarcely a work in the whole range
                    of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literature, no matter on what subject or
                    science, but it will be found described in this vast encyclopaedia, with every
                    piece of collateral information which it was possible to procure or useful to
                    mention. When we remember that it is the Oriental habit to give fancy titles to
                    books that often in no way indicate the nature of their contents, and that one
                    is often obliged to read through pages of irrelevant matter before arriving
                    either at the author’s name or the subject of the work, the labour expended on
                    the production of Hajji Khalfa’s book appears absolutely incredible. The work
                    has always enjoyed a well-deserved reputation in the East, and has attracted the
                    attention of many European scholars, but we need only mention here the
                    magnificent edition in seven thick 8vo volumes by the eminent Arabic scholar
                    Gustavus Fluegel published at Leipsic in 1835- 1858 for the Oriental Translation
                    Fund of Great Britain and Ireland. This edition is accompanied by a Latin
                    page-for-page translation, indices, and notes, and is an indispensable adjunct
                    to every library in which a collection of Oriental books is found. The Arabic
                    title of the lexicon is <hi rend="italic">Kashfu zzunιin 'an Asdmt 'l Kutub
                    wa</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">lfundn,</hi><hi rend="superscript"> ,f</hi> The
                    removal of doubts concerning the names of books and concerning sciences,” and
                    the Latin title adopted by Fluegel is <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
                    Bibliographicum</hi><hi rend="italic">et Encyclopoedicum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Haji</hi><hi rend="italic">Khalfae.</hi> After a short preface and an
                    introduction of five chapters comes the encyclopaedia proper, the articles in
                    which are arranged in the alphabetical order of the names of the works
                    described. The title of each work is given, a concise account of its contents,
                    the name of the author, and the date, when this could be ascertained; and in
                    many cases the initial phrase is also added to facilitate its identification.
                    Besides the general bibliography, Fluegel’s edition contains several appendices
                    of great value to Oriental scholars and librarians. Copious notes and indices
                    complete this splendid edition, one of the finest monuments of Oriental learning
                    which Europe has produced.</p>
