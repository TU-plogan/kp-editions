                    Paul speaking to Agrippa says, “After the straitest heresy of our religion I
                    lived a Pharisee” (κατά <hi rend="italic">την</hi><hi rend="italic">aκpιβeστaτηv
                    aιpeσιv</hi><hi rend="italic">της</hi><hi rend="italic">ημerepaς</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">θρησκείας,</hi> &amp;c., Acts xxvi. 5). Christianity itself was in
                    the beginning looked upon as one of those sects or schools of Jewish opinion,
                    and the “heresy” of the Nazarenes (Acts xxiv. 5) is spoken of as well as the
                    heresy of the Pharisees <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Acts ∑xiv. 14, Acts xxviii.
                    22). This use of the term is plainly borrowed from classical Greek, where
                    αιpcσις frequently means a school of Roman jurists or a school of philosophy <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Cic., <hi rend="italic">Epis,</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                    Fam.</hi> ∑v. 16; Diog. Laert., <hi rend="italic">Procem.,</hi> 13). In the New
                    Testament the word is used in another sense which is purely ecclesiastical. Thus
                    in Titus iii. 10 the apostle says: “A man who is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >heretic</hi> after the first and second admonition reject”; in 2 Pet. ii. 1 the
                    church is warned against fake teachers, “who privily shall bring in damnable <hi
                    rend="italic">heresies,</hi> even denying the Lord that bought them,” and these
                    heretics and false teachers are evidently the same as those of whom Paul, in the
                    Epistle to the Galatians, says that they are to be anathematized. They are men
                    who in the name of Christ preach such doctrines as tend to frustrate the grace
                    of Christ, who preach “another gospel” (Gal. i. 8, 9); they are compared to the
                    false prophets of the Old Testament Scriptures; they cause divisions and schisms
                    in the church (1 Cor. xi. 18, 19); and the heresies they are guilty of are
                    classed along with grave moral offences (Gal. v. 20). It is this second New
                    Testament use of the word which was taken over into ecclesiastical terminology,
                    and it is in this sense that the early Christian writers speak of heresy and
                    heretics. This early ecclesiastical use has continued down to the present, save
                    that in earlier times schism was generally included under heresy, the names and
                    the things not being separated by definition. It is interesting, however, to
                    notice that the earlier New Testament use of the word seems to have lingered on.
                    Tertullian <hi rend="italic">(Apolog.,</hi> c. 1) calls the church a <hi
                    rend="italic">sect,</hi> which is the Latin equivalent for <hi rend="italic"
                    >heresy,</hi> and in the same way Constantine called the church (Eusebius, <hi
                    rend="italic">H.E.,</hi> x. 5, §§ 21-22) <hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">αΐρεσις η καθολική,</hi><hi rend="italic">η ayιωτaτη
                    aιpeσις.</hi></p>
                <p>Heresy means a grave error in matters of faith, but it is much more than a
                    theological or ecclesiastical term. From the days of the emperor Theodosius at
                    the latest, the Christian religion has been intimately connected with law, and
                    heresy is a legal term, with a definite meaning attaching <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n768/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0768-0733"/> to it; a heresy was a crime with punishment
                    annexed,and therefore was capable of legal definition. It was an offence in
                    canon law, and it was also for long an offence according to civil law. The
                    theological meaning, and the definitions according to canon law and according to
                    civil law respectively, are all different from each other and must be separately
                    explained.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Theological Sense of the Term.—</hi> The early Christian
                    writers say a great deal about heresy, but commonly refrain from telling what it
                    is. They describe heresies, but they only denounce heresy. It is vain to look
                    for a definition of it in Irenaeus’s <hi rend="italic">Against Heresies,</hi> in
                    Hippolytus’s <hi rend="italic">Refutation of all Heresies,</hi> in Tertullian’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Prescription against Heretics.</hi> It is possible, indeed, to
                    collect from these one or two leading tests of heresy, but no definition is to
                    be found. The common features of heresy are too well known to call for specific
                    enumeration. We can gather from Irenaeus that heretics are those who reject
                    Scripture, who refuse to accept the “doctrina tradita,” who deny the authority
                    of the clergy who have come in regular succession from the apostles, who keep
                    aloof from the Catholic Church, the sole depositary of apostolic doctrine <hi
                    rend="italic">(Against Heresies,</hi> iii. 2-4). Tertullian, in his usual
                    succinct manner, calls every man a heretic who does not at once accept the
                    “Regula Fidei,” and he refuses to argue with such a man even though the heretic
                    proceeds to adduce arguments from Scripture. “A controversy over Scripture with
                    heretics can clearly produce no other effect than to help to upset either the
                    stomach or the brain” <hi rend="italic">(Prcescr. adv. Hοer.,</hi> 16). In the
                    Eastern Church, after the period of the oecumenical councils, Tertullian’s test
                    was the touchstone of heresy. The church had her rule of faith expanded into the
                    Nicaeo-Constantinopolitan creed, with the various explanations added in the
                    symbols of the remaining oecumenical councils, and a heretic was one who denied
                    this creed in whole or in part. In the Western Church, on the other hand,
                    theologians were accustomed to define heresy in a vague way. Thus Jerome calls
                    heresy “perversum dogma”; a heretic, with him, is one who interprets Scripture
                    in other fashion than according to the witness of the Spirit of God; and
                    Augustine summarily defines heresy to be the invention or retention of new and
                    false opinions. But whatever the definition, the rough and ready test was always
                    nonconformity to the “formula fidei praescripta ab ecclesia Romana.” Instead of
                    definition the Eastern Church simply points to the creed and the oecumenical
                    councils, the Western Church to the rule of faith enjoined by Rome.</p>
                <p>These meagre definitions, extracted from the writings of early theologians, all
                    of them going back in the last resort to the recognized creed of the church for
                    the time being, imply, in spite of their vagueness, that there is a certain
                    essential kernel of doctrine in Christianity, which cannot be denied or
                    challenged without involving the destruction of Christianity itself, and they
                    all point the way to a fuller description of what is meant by heresy in the
                    theological sense of the word. Heresy is a doctrine which, with the appearance
                    of Christian doctrine, is really contradictory to the essential nature of
                    Christianity, and, if persisted in, would in the end make Christianity something
                    very different from what it really is. In order, therefore, to say what heresy
                    is, it is necessary to know what the essential nature of Christianity is, and
                    therefore heresy is generally described by reference to the fundamental nature
                    of Christianity, while the real nature of Christian doctrine is commonly brought
                    out by contrasting it with heresy.</p>
                <p>When we look at the matter historically we see that Christianity has always taken
                    the shape of a community thinking and acting for the most part together, and
                    that it has always implied a common life, common work, common ideas.
                    Christianity appears in history as a community whose common work is to confess
                    and to adore God because of what He has done for His people in salvation. This
                    twofold work of confession and worship has manifested itself in a double
                    organization,—an organization of thought and an organization of work,—doctrine
                    and polity. There may be the church without a creed, and the heart-church
                    without the <hi rend="italic">congregatio</hi>; but that is not the way in which
                    Christianity has taken actual historical shape. It is possible to conceive the
                    entrance of a heterogeneous element into this organization on either side. A
                    heterogeneous element, something really foreign to it, may become organized with
                    the church’s doctrine, or may have become incorporated in the church’s polity,
                    and whenever this happens there is a doctrine, apparently Christian, which is
                    really subversive of Christianity, there is a polity which, apparently
                    Christian, is really opposed to the real life of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >congregatio.</hi> This possibility is the historical root of the origin both of
                    heresy and of schism; for heresy is just a heterogeneous element imbedded in the
                    organized dogmatic of the church, and schism is a foreign element which has
                    found its way into church polity. This description, however, is somewhat
                    misleading, because it may happen that an element which seems heterogeneous is
                    not really so, but is on the contrary a true part of the organization. Heresy is
                    not only apparently but really foreign to the system in which it has become
                    incorporated. Its nature is different, and its source is different. Mere
                    apparent incongruity, therefore, does not prove heresy. A doctrine must be seen
                    to be really contradictory to the fundamental facts of Christianity, and to have
                    come from a different source, before it can be called a heresy. It has
                    frequently happened, accordingly, that doctrines have been judged heretical
                    which a better acquaintance with the nature of Christianity would have
                    pronounced orthodox.</p>
                <p>Christianity, under the many forms which it assumes, has always implied the
                    reconciliation of God and man through the person and work of Christ. It implies
                    that Jesus Christ the Saviour has so brought it about that He has established a
                    new kingdom of God which will last, in which men have communion with God through
                    His Spirit. Christianity is complete when the kingdom of God is fully
                    established. “Thy kingdom come” is its aspiration. It therefore implies a moral
                    separation between God and man—a separation which is overcome by the work of
                    Christ the Mediator. The idea of reconciliation is the central thing in
                    Christianity, the essential part in its description. God, man unable to approach
                    God until reconciliation has been made, Christ the Mediator who reconciles, and
                    His people brought again into communion with God,—all Christian doctrine rings
                    the changes on these four fundamental ideas. Whatever contradicts or tends to
                    destroy these, or their relations to each other, is incompatible with
                    Christianity. Whenever any of these four ideas—God, man, Christ, and the kingdom
                    of God —are so misread as to introduce notions incompatible with the relations
                    in which they stand to each other in Christianity, then heresy enters. Theology
                    therefore (and Protestant theology only carries the idea somewhat further) has
                    usually recognized four kinds of heresy, corresponding to the four fundamental
                    ideas on which Christian doctrine rests. The nature and character of God and of
                    His relation to the universe and to man may be so misread as to make
                    reconciliation an impossible thing, and so also may the nature of Christ, the
                    nature of man, and the nature of the results of Christ’s work among men. Hence
                    arise heresies about God, about the person of Christ, about the nature of man,
                    and about the results of Christ’s work— all of them being doctrines which are
                    incompatible with the idea of reconciliation.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0769-0734"/>
                <p>I. Reconciliation implies that man has been separated by sin from God, and that
                    God can overcome this separation. All descriptions of God, of His nature,
                    character, and works, which contradict this fact may give rise to heresies. Thus
                    God cannot overcome the separation if it be impossible for Him to project
                    Himself beyond Himself for salvation. The nature of the Godhead may be so
                    described as to contradict the idea of reconciliation, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in the Arian heresy. Again, all descriptions of God’s relations to
                    the universe which imply that the universe and all things are not absolutely
                    dependent on Him, which imply that His gracious purpose can be thwarted,
                    contradict the idea of reconciliation, and so may give rise to heresies, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Gnostic doctrine that matter is independent of God.
                    Misstatements about God’s relation to Himself and about His relation to the
                    universe give rise to two different kinds of heresy.</p>
                <p>II. Reconciliation implies a real mediator who can accomplish the reconciliation
                    on both its sides, and so heresies may arise about the nature of Christ The
                    Saviour may be so described that there is no real mediation, and no real
                    reconciliation. These errors may arise in two ways, as one or other side of the
                    mediator is described. The Saviour may be represented so that He has no real
                    relation to God on the one hand or to man on the other. He may be describgd in
                    such a way that there is no solidarity between Him and God, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in the Ebionite heresy; or He maybe described in such a way that
                    there is no solidarity between Him and man, as in the Docetist heresy.
                    Misstatements about the relation of Christ to God and the relation of Christ to
                    man give rise to two different kinds of heresy.</p>
                <p>III. Reconciliation implies that man is so separated from God by sin that there
                    is real need for salvation, and yet not so separated that he cannot be brought
                    into communion with God again; and the nature of man, and especially the
                    presence of sin in man, may be so described as to set aside these requirements.
                    The fact of sin and its presence in man may be so explained away as to leave
                    little ground for the necessity of reconciliation, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    in the Pelagian heresy. Again, on the other hand, the fact and presence of sin
                    may be so described that there is no capacity in man for salvation; it may be
                    alleged that sin belongs to the essential nature of man and cannot be removed,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, in the Manichaean heresy. These two misstatements
                    about the connexion between man and sin give rise to two kinds of heresy.</p>
                <p>IV. The results of the reconciliation effected by Christ may also be
                    misrepresented in two ways. The separation between man and God, which is the
                    formal occasion of the reconciliation, was caused by sin; and the distance
                    between God and man is a moral one. It is not such a separation as might arise
                    from the difference between the divine and the human nature, or from the
                    inevitable distance between Creator and creature. And so reconciliation has for
                    its effect, not mere absorption into God, but the restoration of moral communion
                    between God and His people. The intercourse was broken by sin, and the result of
                    reconciliation must be moral; it must take effect in a change of will, in the
                    creation of a life of new obedience. False ideas arise when this is
                    misrepresented, and these misrepresentations can arise in two ways :—when it is
                    said that the action of divine grace impregnates the nature in a magical way,
                    instead of taking effect on the will in a moral fashion, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the magical idea of sacramental efficacy; or when it is said that
                    the result of the reconciliation is to raise man above the necessity of living a
                    moral life and of conforming to the laws of morality, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the Antinomian heresy.</p>
                <p>Thus theology finds at least eight separate kinds of heresy, arising from the
                    entrance of foreign elements into the four fundamental ideas of Christianity.
                    All heresies may be reduced to one or other of these eight classes. In point of
                    fact, however, most heresies which have actually arisen cannot be said to belong
                    purely to any one of them. The class only denotes the type; for one error is apt
                    to bring others in its train, and so most heresies are mixed, and do not in all
                    respects conform to their type.</p>
                <p>Theologians, however, have not rested content with the mere theoretical or
                    genetic description of heresy and heretics, and have commonly borrowed
                    distinctions first laid down by jurists in canon law to distinguish more
                    narrowly the characteristic marks of heresy. Thus a false doctrine to be a
                    heresy must be an <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> error, it' must be held

                    the legal aspect of heresy, and must be referred to again.</p>
                <p>Many theologians, Schleierrfiacher among others, have attempted to describe the
                    actual origin of heresies, and a common mode of explanation is as follows.
                    Heresies arise in that province of theology called dogmatic, and commonly appear
                    during the definition of some important part of dogmatic theology. Dogmatic
                    theology is the rationale of the spiritual events and forces which have called
                    Christianity into being. In the attempt made by the church to understand these
                    events and forces which have called it into being, its attention has commonly
                    been confined to the more outstanding portions. The history of dogmatic shows us
                    that from time to time the church has endeavoured to master one doctrine, not
                    the whole round of doctrines; it has endeavoured to make distinct single points,
                    instead of working at the various relations of all the doctrines to each other.
                    This very natural mode of work has the one disadvantage that it concentrates
                    attention on isolated portions of doctrine rather than on the whole mass, and
                    between the consecutive portions there are gaps. The mind of man, however, like
                    nature, abhors a vacuum, and summarily fills these vacua up with material
                    usually drawn from the prevailing philosophical or scientific theories of the
                    day. These summary explanations or theories may or may not be in accordance with
                    the spirit of Christianity, and when they are not they become a fruitful source
                    of heresies. One of the best illustrations of this is the introduction into
                    theology of the Aristotelian doctrine of το εκούσιον, which gave the church the
                    Pelagian heresy along with some others.</p>
                <p>So much for the general theological conception of heresy, of its nature,
                    divisions, and sources; but before proceeding to describe the use of the term in
                    canon law, it should be observed that the theological does not always correspond
                    with the ecclesiastical meaning of the word. It is generally acknowledged that
                    Holy Scripture is the source of doctrine, and that for the due understanding
                    thereof the enlightening guidance of the Holy Spirit is required; though, of
                    course, the precise meaning of this statement varies in different systems of
                    theology. Holy Scripture and the witness of the Spirit of God are thus the
                    touchstone of heresy. In the Roman Catholic and Greek Churches, however, it is
                    held that the enlightening guidance of the Holy Spirit in this respect is
                    restrained within the limits of certain ecclesiastical machinery (the
                    oecumenical council, the pope <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra,</hi> &amp;c.),
                    which are the only channels through which the Spirit comes to the church, and
                    hence the creed of the church rather than Scripture is the real touchstone of
                    heresy. Protestant theologians, on the other hand, do not believe either that
                    the guidance of the Spirit is always present within this ecclesiastical
                    machinery or that it is given in this way only, and so they make a distinction
                    between mere ecclesiastical and real theological heresies. Ecclesiastical
                    heresies arise when a fundamental statement made in the creed or confession is
                    contradicted. But it may happen, since creeds and councils may err, that the
                    error is not in the contradiction but in the creed, and therefore there is
                    always an appeal from the creed to the Scripture. The ecclesiastical idea of
                    heresy has always the theological idea behind it, and may at any time be
                    corrected by it. Roman Catholic and Greek theologians, on the other hand, do not
                    admit any going behind the record; they do not allow any appeal from the creed
                    to Scripture. According to their ideas the creed is the infallible digest of
                    Scripture, and therefore heresy is to be tested by the creed and not by
                    Scripture—that is, the ecclesiastical and theological ideas of heresy are
                    exactly the same.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Heresy according to Canon Law.—</hi> Canon law was the
                    ecclesiastical law of mediaeval Europe, and is still the law of the Roman
                    Catholic Church, and its description of heresy and of heretics is almost more
                    important than the theological in the investigation of the matter from the
                    historical side. Canon law regards heresy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n770/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0770-0735"/> from the practical side of ecclesiastical
                    procedure and legal enactment. Its view is much narrower than the theological,
                    but much more precise. Orthodoxy is the doctrine maintained by the infallible
                    Roman Church and assented to by all its faithful members; heresy is dissent from
                    the articles of faith established by the Roman pontiffs and by the councils of
                    the Roman Church. Canon law also is mιinly concerned with heresy in order to
                    punish it, and therefore is obliged to treat the whole subject with severe legal
                    accuracy of statement. It proceeds from strict definitions. Perhaps the
                    commonest definition is the following :—heresy is “error intellectus voluntarius
                    contra aliquam propositionem catholicam cum pertinacia assertus ab eo qui
                    baptismum accepit.” Jurists are accustomed to expand this general definition in
                    a variety of qualifying statements, (a) All heresy is error, but every error is
                    not a heresy. It is an error according to canon law to take usury; it is heresy
                    to say that to take usury is not a sin, but taking usury is no heresy. Heresy is
                    intellectual error. It is intellectual error believed to be truth, and that in
                    spite of predominant opinion. Canonists distinguish between members of the Roman
                    Church who refuse, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to accept the “filioque” clause
                    in the creed, and members of the Greek Church who make the same refusal. The
                    refusal is in both cases an error, but it is a heresy only in the Roman Chureh,
                    for there only the predominant opinion is against the error, (δ) An error also
                    only becomes heresy when it is held voluntarily. To be a heretic a man must
                    stick to his error, although he knows that it has been condemned by the church.
                    A heretic not only errs, but knows that he errs, and wishes to err. (c) Nor is
                    every voluntary error a heresy; the heretic must contradict a doctrine which has
                    been clearly stated in the creed and has become part of the defined faith of the
                    church. (tZ) Nor is an erroneous opinion voluntarily professed in opposition to
                    the creed of the church heresy, unless the heretic persists in it. Pertinacity,
                    all canonists insist, is an essential element in heresy, and unless it is
                    present no process for heresy can legally proceed, (e) And lastly, a heretic
                    must be a member of the church. He must have been baptized. Neither a Jew, a
                    Mahometan, nor a heathen can be a heretic. They may be unbelievers, they may
                    hold erroneous opinions, but their opinions are not heresies.</p>
                <p>From the first qualification, that heresy is an intellectual error, canonists
                    deduce the ground of their enactments against the suspicion of heresy and
                    against those suspected. Canon law uniformly proceeds on the idea that heresy is
                    not merely an error but a crime. It is a crime, however, which belongs to the
                    invisible part of man, to his intellect. It is not something done with his hands
                    or his feet which witnesses can see, and they argue that direct proof is
                    therefore almost impossible, and that the commission of the crime must almost
                    always be proved from suspicions. This suspicion of heresy occupies a very large
                    space in the dissertations of canonists, and the weakness of their position has
                    made them bring in a very great number of reasons which they seem to think
                    strengthen it (see especially Dandinus, <hi rend="italic">De suspect,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">h&lt;xresibus').</hi> They carefully
                    define the degrees of suspicion with the conduct appropriate to each: where the
                    suspicion is only “light,” the suspected are simply to be watched; where it is
                    “vehement,” they are to be denounced; where it is “violent,” they are to be
                    treated as heretics. Canonists have carefully analysed and arranged what are
                    reasonable grounds of suspicion. Pope Innocent III. declared that to lead a
                    solitary life, to refuse to accommodate one’s self to the prevailing manners of
                    society, and to frequent unauthorized religious meetings were abundant grounds
                    of suspicion; while later canonists were accustomed to give lists of deeds which
                    made the doers suspect a priest who did not celebrate mass, a layman who was
                    seen in clerical robes, those who favoured heretics, received them as guests,
                    gave them safe conduct, tolerated them, trusted them, defended them, fought
                    under them, or read their books, were all to be suspect. The canonist rules for
                    suspicion became a sort of inquisitor’s <hi rend="italic">vade mecum,</hi> and
                    when really practised produced a reign of terror.</p>
                <p>Since canon law regarded heresy with such horror and detestation, it is not
                    surprising that it gives many directions, which have the force of legal
                    enactments, whereby men may avoid the dangers of heresy. Pope Alexander IV.
                    prohibited laymen from arguing about matters of faith. The council of Toledo
                    (1129), anxious to put down the Albigenses, ordained that every man above
                    fourteen and every woman above twelve years of age should solemnly swear to
                    abjure every heresy and to maintain in its completeness the Catholic faith. Pope
                    Pius IV. ordered the laity to abstain from reading the Scriptures in the vulgar
                    tongue. The promiscuous reading of books was forbidden, and an index of
                    prohibited books believed to be dangerous to faith or morals was formed.</p>
                <p>Canon law regards heresy as a crime, and while it recognizes that the power of
                    the church is spiritual, and that the church visits offences with spiritual
                    punishments such as excommunication, it proceeds on the idea that the state
                    should assist the church in suppressing heresy, and visit heretics with civil
                    pains and penalties, including torture and capital punishment; but this side of
                    the history of heresy belongs as much to civil as to canon law. The church,
                    however, did what it could against heretics. The council of Laodicea (can. 6-9)
                    prohibited them from attending service, though from subsequent acts this could
                    not have been enforced. They were not allowed to give evidence in an
                    ecclesiastical court; a father was prohibited from allowing his son or daughter
                    to marry a heretic; social intercourse with them was prohibited, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Heresy according to Civil Law.—</hi> Civil law treats heresy
                    in a still simpler fashion. The legal idea seems to have been that, since the
                    state approved of one creed and gave it public recognition, to profess any other
                    creed was in some sense civil disaffection or a kind of treason, and manifested
                    lack of loyalty. This notion, however, was supplemented by another and much
                    deeper one in the public law of the mediaeval empire. According to the ideas of
                    the earlier mediaeval jurists, civil government and ecclesiastical government
                    were equally and in the same sense ordinances of God; and this thought found
                    expression in the twin conceptions of world-king and worldpriest, emperor and
                    pope, who were God’s vicars, and ruled in His name over church and state. God
                    was the king of the world; the emperor was His vicar, and treason, therefore,
                    included treason against God, or heresy, as well as treason against the emperor.
                    This idea lingered long, and indeed still lingers, and complicates the simpler
                    civil notion of heresy. For all practical purposes, however, the deeper thought
                    may be discarded. In civil law, heresy is pertinacious dissent from the creed
                    approved of for the time being. For example, the Lutheran creed, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessio Augustana,</hi> was heresy in all parts of Germany up to
                    the peace of Augsburg, when it was recognized as a creed which might be
                    professed. It then became orthodox in the civil sense of the term, in the same
                    way that the Roman Catholic creed was orthodox, while the Calvinist creed, still
                    unrecognized, was heresy.</p>
                <p>Civil punishment followed religious offences as early as the time of Constantine,
                    who enacted severe penalties against the Donatists, and ordained that all
                    possessing Arian books should burn them on the pain of death. Laws against the
                    reading of heretical books became very frequent during and after the 4th
                    century. Arcadius made the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n771/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0771-0736"/> reading of books written by the Eunomians a
                    capital offence. Theodosius and Valentinian proscribed Nestorian books, and
                    Valentinian and Marcian the books of Eutyches and Nestorius. The custom became
                    so common that the condemnation of any heresy by the church was followed by the
                    proscription of the writings of members of the sect. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Theodosianus,</hi> bk. xvi. tit. 5, “De
                    haereticis,” enumerates a great variety of laws against heresy with penalties
                    more or less severe. They had the practical effect of declaring heretics
                    outlaws, who could not hold offices of dignity or value, receive or bequeath
                    money, enforce contracts, Ac. In some cases death was the punishment for heresy.
                    Justinian made it impossible for any heretic to bear witness in the civil courts
                    of the land. This legislation may all be traced back to the action of
                    Theodosius, who imposed the Nicene creed upon all his subjects, and made it a
                    law of the land. It continued in force during the Middle Ages, and in
                    consequence heretics who could not accept the Nicene creed were outlaws also.
                    This perhaps explains the curious fact that almost all the mediaeval heretics
                    were also revolutionists. During the Middle Ages, especially from the time of
                    Innocent III. onwards, civil interference in cases of heresy was much increased.
                    In the early church the power of discipline belonged to the presbytery, and was
                    afterwards usurped by the bishops, who continued to exercise it in matters of
                    heresy until Innocent III. appointed the Inquisition to deal with heretics. So
                    long as the empire was not Christian, the civil law had nothing to do with the
                    punishment of erroneous opinions, but as soon as Christianity became the
                    authorized religion of the state, the old pagan idea that the state has power to
                    punish <hi rend="italic">religiones</hi><hi rend="italic">novas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et illicitas</hi> was revived. The state, either instructed by the
                    church or, as in the Theodosian code, without instruction, visited with civil
                    pains and penalties all such opinions. This came to a height when the
                    Inquisition was established; and civil courts and national assemblies one after
                    another decreed that whatever penalties were imposed by the Inquisition should
                    be imposed by the state, or else handed over all cases of heresy to the
                    Inquisition to be dealt with as matters deserving the infliction of civil
                    penalties, fines, imprisonment, torture, and death. There is no sadder page in
                    the history of the church than her alliance with the state for the purpose of
                    torturing men out of opinions different from her own. Since the Reformation the
                    persecuting spirit, although tenacious of life, has been gradually dying
                    out.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Principal Heresies.—</hi> Early Christian theologians wrote a
                    great many books against heretics in which they enumerated the various heresies
                    which had sprung up in the church up to their own time. St Augustine tells us
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 222) that Philastrius, bishop of Brescia, had
                    discovered 28 heresies among the Jews before the coming of Christ, and 128 in
                    the Christian Church afterwards; and many other orthodox writers have given very
                    long lists of these erroneous opinions. It was natural that the early centuries
                    of the Christian era, especially the first five, should be somewhat prolific in
                    heresies, because that was the very period when the church was occupied in
                    defining the principal doctrines of Christianity. A history of heresies must
                    spend most time upon the early centuries. The first dogmatic work of the church
                    was to define the nature of Christ, who occupied the central place in its
                    thought, and it had to steer its way between two opposite views, both of which
                    interfered with the full dogmatic expression of the nature of the Mediator. On
                    the one hand, many of the Jewish converts never rose to the height of the
                    Christian idea of the person of Christ, and it is evident that these must have
                    been very numerous from the emphasis with which it is insisted that Christians
                    should <hi rend="italic">θeολοyiiν τοv</hi><hi rend="italic">υιόν.</hi> These
                    Jewish converts preferred to regard the Saviour as the last of the prophets, one
                    who bore the same relation to God and to man as the prophets did. They shrank
                    from the idea of the incarnation; they seemed to feel no need for the divine
                    Saviour. This theory was of course accompanied by other views about the nature
                    of Christianity, but the main element was opposition to the Christian doctrine
                    of the real divinity of Christ, God who has become man. This Ebionite heresy has
                    been maintained by men who wish to call themselves Christians since these early
                    days, and has taken a great variety of shapes; but whether it is held by Jew or
                    Unitarian, there is the same outline of opinion and the same steadfast
                    repugnance to the doctrine of the incarnation. On the other hand, the
                    philosophic doctrine of the repugnance between matterand spirit, the idea, which
                    runs through all Greek philosophy, that matter is the source of evil, induced
                    many of the early Gentile converts to Christianity to think of the incarnation
                    as a metaphor rather than as a fact. Christ, they thought, did not take, but
                    only seemed to take, a human body. These Docetists, as they were called, had a
                    whole series of successors in the early church. When Christian theology advanced
                    step by step in the definition of the doctrine of the person of Christ, it was
                    this old idea of the repugnance between the divine spirit and human nature
                    embodied that lay at the root of the Apollinarian, Eutychian, and Monophysite
                    heresies. Apollinaris denied that the Theanthropos had a “reasonable” soul; he
                    denied the full humanity of the Saviour. Eutyches denied that the Theanthropos
                    had a human nature; and the Monophysites, in their various theories, held
                    strongly by the same idea. All these theories, however different in form and
                    expression,’denied the full and true humanity of Christ, and so contradicted the
                    church’s yearning for a Saviour truly man as well as truly God. These heresies,
                    along with the Nestorian, were all finally condemned at the council of Chalcedon
                    (the fourth oecumenical).</p>
                <p>But long before the church had definitely set forth the doctrine of the person of
                    Christ, its attention was turned to the doctrine of the essential nature of the
                    Godhead. At first this doctrine was scarcely considered apart from Christology.
                    It is impossible to separate the history of the doctrine of the Trinity from the
                    doctrine of the person of Christ; for long the two separate problems were
                    inextricably mixed. At length it became evident to the mind of the church that
                    there were two doctrines, and Christian theology turned aside to discuss, and if
                    possible settle, the doctrine of the essential nature of the Godhead before it
                    proceeded to exhaust the doctrine of the person of Christ. For the real problem
                    in the Arian controversy was not the divinity of the Mediator but the nature of
                    God. Is God to be thought of as a Trinity or as a Unity? what is the relation of
                    the Second Person in the Trinity to the First Person? The real gain to Christian
                    theology which came from the discussions in the Arian controversy was to thrust
                    out the Greek conception of Deity as the Absolute who cannot be described save
                    by negations, and to put in its stead a Christian conception which shows that
                    there are motions within the Deity which, however incomprehensible, enable us to
                    know that God may be in sympathy with men, and that all things may live, move,
                    and have their being in Him.</p>
                <p>The philosophical idea that matter is the source of evil, that matter has always
                    some stubborn element in it by which it can defy the ideal, gave rise to a whole
                    series of ancient and mediaeval heresies. The Gnostics in all their various
                    sects distinguished between God and the Creator. The good God, they held, could
                    not defile Himself by contact with matter, and therefore could not be the God of
                    creation and providence. Christian theology, on the other hand, has always
                    confessed God to be the Almighty Maker <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0772-0737"/> of heaven and earth, and all things seen and
                    unseen, and the necessity for such a doctrine of creation consists in the fact
                    that the Christian consciousness demands the absence of any thing that might
                    come in between God and the furtherance of His plan of salvation. It demands
                    that all things be thought of as dependent on God, in order that He may be able
                    to make all things work together for the good of His people; and so it has
                    strenuously asserted the doctrines of creation and providence in opposition to
                    an independent matter and the reign of fate. The Gnostic ideas were repeated by
                    the Manichaeans and by several mediaeval sects, such as the Paulicians and
                    Messalians, and, in the Eastern Church, by the Bogomili.</p>
                <p>The Pelagian and Manichaean heresies principally concern the Christian doctrine
                    of man and of the presence of sin in man, and contradict the church’s creed,
                    because they do away with the Christian doctrine of reconciliation. Pelagianism,
                    it was held, denied the need of God’s grace by insisting th it man was free from
                    indwelling sin at the beginning of his career, and followed good, when he did
                    follow it, by the power of his own will; while Manichaeism, by asserting that
                    sin belonged to the essential nature of man, seemed to paralyse the whole divine
                    action in reconciliation. It was held by the orthodox opponents of Pelagius that
                    his opinions really implied that there was no real need for the Saviour and the
                    salvation which Christianity describes, and that semi-Pelagianism, although much
                    nearer orthodox doctrine, very inadequately comprehended tiιat sinfulness in man
                    which rendered reconciliation indispensable ere there could be a restoration of
                    communion with God.</p>
                <p>The Antinomian and various kinds of mystical theories about the Christian life
                    all proceed upon a view of the effects of Christ’s work which is at variance
                    with fundamental Christian ideas. Christian doctrine teaches that men reconciled
                    to God will strive to live a life of new obedience to Him, and it holds that
                    this life of new obedience comes under the same moral laws as the ordinary life
                    of man. But many Christian sects have professed theories about this life of new
                    obedience which seem to imply that it is not under the laws of ordinary
                    morality, that Christian freedom means licence to do what ordinary morals
                    forbid. The Epistles to the Corinthians seem to say that such theories were held
                    in the apostolic church, and were denounced by the apostles; many of the Gnostic
                    and Manichaean sects undoubtedly professed them. The same views occur again and
                    again in mediaeval heresy, and were held by many of the enthusiastic sectaries
                    in Reformation times and later. The Brethren of the Free Spirit in the 13th and
                    14th century, the Anabaptists during the Reformation period, and some of the
                    followers of Molinos are examples. The mystical theories which so largely
                    entered into the mediaeval church, and which have continually clung to the
                    skirts of Christianity, have in many instances proceeded on the principle that
                    the new life is implanted in man in a physical way, and magical ideas of the
                    means of grace have been very destructive to the moral theory of the Christian
                    life.</p>
                <p>The history of the mediaeval heretical sects is by far too complicated to be
                    entered on here. Many of them did no more than protest against the hierarchical
                    constitution of the church of the Middle Ages. Most of them only sought room to
                    carry out to the full their ideas of a true “Imitatio Christi,” but it is also
                    certain that a good many Gnostic and Antinomian tenets were held. The Friends of
                    God, the Fratricelli, the Beghards, were all mystics, but their mysticism was of
                    a very harmless description; while the Brethren of the Common Life were worthy
                    forerunners of the pietists of the 18th century (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mystics).</hi></p>
                <p>The heretics of the Reformation Church scarcely call for separate remark. The
                    Zwickau prophets and the Anabaptists held opinions at variance with the ordinary
                    notions of what is meant by the Christian life. Schwenkfeld, the Quietists, the
                    followers of Madame Bourignon, all revived types of mysticism which had appeared
                    long before; and the Quakers had their forerunners in mediaeval times. Many of
                    these sects, though called heretical, seem to have arisen simply from the desire
                    to live purer and more spiritual lives than the church organization of their
                    times permitted, and in order to do so were led to lay stress upon the idea of
                    personal guidance by the Spirit of God, and on the necessity of the “house and
                    heart church” in opposition to the external church life of their time, on the
                    need of personal as opposed to official religion.</p>
                <p>In this article Christian heresy alone has been described. Heresy, however,
                    arises wherever there is doctrine, and there are Mahometan and Buddhist heresies
                    and sects as well as Christian.</p>
                <p>The best history of sects and heresies from the sympathetic side is Gottfried

                    1699-1700 (best ed. that of Schaffhausen, 1740). A very good list of writers on

                    Act of Henry IV. enabled the diocesan alone, without the cooperation of a synod,
                    to pronounce sentence of heresy, and required the sheriff to execute it by
                    burning the offender, without waiting for the consent of the crown.<note

                    >Commentaries,</hi> bk. iv. c. 7.</p></note> A large number of penal statutes
                    were enacted in the following reigns, and the statute 1 Eliz. c. 1 is regarded
                    by lawyers as limiting for the first time the description of heresy to tenets
                    declared heretical either by the canonical Scripture or by the first four
                    general councils, or such as should thereafter be so declared by parliament with
                    the assent of convocation. The writ was abolished by 29 Car. II. c. 9, which
                    reserved to the ecclesiastical courts their jurisdiction over heresy and similar
                    offences, and their power of awarding punishments not extending to death. Heresy
                    became henceforward a purely ecclesiastical offence, although disabling laws of
                    various kinds continued to be enforced against Jews, Catholics, and other
                    dissenters. The temporal courts have no knowledge of any offence known as
                    heresy, although incidentally <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in questions of
                    copyright) they have refused protection to persons promulgating irreligious or
                    blasphemous opinions. As an ecclesiastical offence it would at this mornent be
                    almost impossible to say what opinion, in the case of a layman at least, would
                    be deemed heretical. Apparently, if a proper case could be made out, an
                    ecclesiastical court might still sentence a layman to excommunication for
                    heresy, but by no other means could his opinions be brought under censure. The
                    last case on the subject (Jenkins <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Cook, <hi
                    rend="italic">Law Reports,</hi> 1 Probate Division 80) leaves the matter in the
                    same uncertainty. In that case a clergyman refused the communion to a
                    parishioner who denied the personality of the devil. The judicial committee held
                    that the rights of the parishioners are expressly defined in the statute of 1
                    Edw. VI. c. 1, and, without admitting that the canons of the church, which are
                    not binding on the laity, could specify a lawful cause for rejection, held that
                    no lawful cause within the meaning of either the canons or the rubric had been
                    shown. It was maintained at the bar that the denial of the most fundamental
                    doctrines of Christianity would not be a lawful cause for such rejection, but
                    the judgment only queries whether a denial of the personality of <pb break="no"

                    with membership of the church. The right of every layman to the offices of the
                    church is established by statute without reference to opinions, and it is not
                    possible to say what opinions, if any, would operate to disqualify him.</p>
                <p>The case of clergymen is entirely different. The statute 13 Eliz. c. 12, § 2,
                    enacts that “if any person ecclesiastical, or which shall have an ecclesiastical
                    living, shall advisedly maintain or affirm any doctrine directly contrary or
                    repugnant to any of the said articles, and by conventicle before the‘bishop of
                    the diocese, or the ordinary, or before the queen’s highness’s commissioners in
                    matters ecclesiastical, shall persist therein or not revoke his error, or after
                    such revocation eftsoons affirm such untrue doctrine,” he shall be deprived of
                    his ecclesiastical promotions. The Act it will be observed applies only to
                    clergymen, and the punishment is strictly limited to deprivation of benefice.
                    The judicial committee of the privy council, as the last court of appeal, has on
                    several occasions pronounced judgments by which the scope of the Act has been
                    confined to its narrowest legal effect. The court will construe the Articles of
                    Religion and formularies according to the <hi rend="italic">legal rules for the
                    interpretation of statutes and written instruments.</hi> No rule of doctrine is
                    to be ascribed to the church which is not distinctly and expressly stated or

                    where there is no rule, a clergyman may express his opinion without fear of
                    penal consequences. In the <hi rend="italic">Essays and Reviews</hi> cases
                    (Williams <hi rend="italic">ν.</hi> the Bishop of Salisbury, and Wilson <hi

                    speak of merit by transfer as a “fiction,” or to express a hope of the ultimate
                    pardon of the wicked, or to affirm that any part of the Old or New Testament,
                    however unconnected with religious faith or moral duty, was not written under
                    the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. In the case of Noble <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Voysey in 1871, the committee held that it was not bound to affix a
                    meaning to articles of really dubious import, as it would have been in cases
                    affecting property. At the same time any manifest contradiction of the Articles,
                    or any obvious evasion of them, would subject the offender to the penalties of
                    deprivation. In some of the cases the question has been raised how far the
                    doctrine of the church could be ascertained by reference to the opinions
                    generally expressed by divines belonging to its communion, Such opinions, it
                    would seem, might be taken into account as showing the extent of liberty which
                    had been in practice, claimed and exercised on the interpretation of the
                    articles, but would certainly not be allowed to increase their stringency. It is
                    not the business of the court to pronounce upon the absolute tnιth or falsehood
                    of any given opinion, but simply to say whether it is formally consistent with
                    the legal doctrines of the Church of England. Whether convocation has any
                    jurisdiction in cases of heresy is a question which has occasioned some
                    difference of opinion among lawyers. Hale, as quoted by Phillimore, says that
                    before the time of Richard II., that is, before any Acts of Parliament were made
                    about heretics, it is without question that in a convocation of the clergy or
                    provincial synod “they might and frequently did here in England proceed to the
                    sentencing of heretics.” But later writers, while adhering to the statement that
                    convocation might declare opinions to be heretical, doubted whether it could
                    proceed to punish the offender, even when he was a clerk in orders. Phillimore
                    states that there is no longer any doubt, even apart from the effect of the
                    Clergy Discipline Act, 3 and 4 Vict. c. 86, that convocation has no power to
                    condemn clergymen for heresy. The supposed right of convocation to stamp
                    heretical opinions with its disapproval was recently exercised on a somewhat
                    memorable occasion. In 1864 the convocation of the province of Canterbury,
                    having taken the opinion of two of the most eminent lawyers of the day (Sir Hugh
                    Cairns and Mr Rolt), passed judgment upon the volume entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essays and Reviews.</hi> The judgment purported to “synodically condemn the
                    said volume as containing teaching contrary to the doctrine received by the
                    United Church of England and Ireland, in common with the whole Catholic Church
                    of Christ.” These proceedings were challenged in the House of Lords by Lord
                    Houghton, and the lord chancellor (Westbury), speaking on behalf of the
                    Government, stated that if there was any “synodical judgment” it would be a
                    violation of the law, subjecting those concerned in it to the penalties of a <hi
                    rend="italic">prce&gt;mmire,</hi> but that the sentence in question was “simply
                    nothing, literally no sentence at all.” It is thus at least doubtful whether
                    convocation has a right even to express an opinion unless specially authorized
                    to do so by the crown, and it is certain that it cannot do anything more. Heresy
                    or no heresy, in the last resort, like all other ecclesiastical questions, is
                    decided by the judicial committee of the council.</p>
                <p>The English lawyers, following the Roman law, distinguish between heresy and
                    apostasy. The latter offence is dealt with by an Act which still stands on the
                    statute book, although it has long been virtually obsolete—the 9 and 10 Will.
                    III. c. 35. If any person <hi rend="italic">who has been educated in or has
                    professed the Christian religion</hi> shall, by writing, printing, teaching, or
                    advised speaking, assert or maintain that there are more Gods than one, or shall
                    deny any of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be God, or shall deny the
                    Christian religion to be true or the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
                    Testament to be of divine authority, he shall for the first offence be declared
                    incapable of holding any ecclesiastical, civil, or military office or
                    employment, and for the second incapable of bringing any action, or of being
                    guardian, executor, legatee, or grantee, and shall suffer three years’
                    imprisonment without bail. Unitarians were saved from these atrocious penalties
                    by a later Act (53 Geo. III. c. 160), which permits Christians to deny any of
                    the persons in the Trinity without penal consequences. (E. R. )</p>
