                    The New Testament writing usually known under this name, or less correctly as
                    the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews, bears in the oldest MSS. no
                    other title than the words ∏pos ‘Εβραίους, “To the Hebrews.” This brief heading
                    embraces the whole information as to the origin of the epistle on which
                    Christian tradition is unanimous. Everything else—the authorship, the address,
                    the date—was unknown or disputed in the early church, and continues to form
                    matter of dispute in the present day. But as far back as the latter part of the
                    2d century the destination of the epistle “to the Hebrews” was acknowledged
                    alike in Alexandria, where it was ascribed to Paul, and in Carthage, where it
                    passed by the name of Barnabas, and no indication exists that it ever circulated
                    under another title.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    sometimes been done, that the author prefixed these words to his original
                    manuscript. The title says no more than that the readers addressed were
                    Christians of Jewish extraction, and this would be no sufficient address for an
                    epistolary writing (xiii. 22) directed to a definite circle of readers, a local
                    church or group of churches to whose history repeated reference is made, and to
                    which the author had personal relations (xiii. 19, 23). The original address,
                    which according to custom must have stood on the outside of the folded letter,
                    was probably never copied, and the early and universal prevalence of the present
                    title, which tells no more than can be readily gathered from the epistle itself,
                    seems to indicate that when the book first passed from local into general
                    circulation its history had already been forgotten. With this it agrees that the
                    early Roman Church, where the epistle was known about the end of the 1st
                    century, and where indeed the first traces of the use of it occur (Clement, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Shepherd of Hernias'),</hi> had nothing to contribute to the
                    question of authorship and origin except the negative opinion that the book is
                    not by Paul. Caius and the Muratorian fragment reckon but thirteen epistles of
                    Paul; Hippolytus (like his master Trenaeus of Lyons) knew our book and declared
                    that it was not Pauline. These facts can hardly be explained by supposing that
                    at Rome during the 2d century the book had dropped out of notice, and its
                    history had been forgotten. Clement, Hermas, Hippolytus form a tolerably
                    continuous chain, and the central Church of Rome was in constant connexion with
                    provincial churches where, as we shall presently see, the epistle had currency
                    and reputation. Under these circumstances an original trustworthy tradition
                    could hardly have been lost, and it must appear highly questionable whether the
                    author and address of the book were known at Rome even in the time of Clement.
                    The earliest positive traditions of authorship to which we can point belong to
                    Africa and Egypt, where, as we have already seen, divergent views were current
                    by the end of the 2d century. The African tradition preserved by Tertullian <hi
                    rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pudicitia,</hi> c. 20), but certainly
                    not invented by him, ascribes the epistle to Barnabas. Direct apostolic
                    authority is not therefore claimed for it; but it has the weight due to one who
                    “learned from and taught with the apostles,” and we are told that it had more
                    currency among the churches than <pb break="no"

                    of the adulterers” (the Shepherd of Hermas). This tradition of the African
                    Church holds a singularly isolated position. Later writers appear to know it
                    only from. Tertu∏ian, and it soon became obsolete, to be revived for a moment
                    after the Reformation by the Scottish theologiau Cameron, and then again in our
                    own century by the German critics, among whom at presentit is the favourite
                    view. Very different is thé history of the Egyptian tradition, which can be
                    traced back as far as a teacher of the Alexandrian Clement, presumably Pantaenus
                    (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">Hist. Hccl.,</hi> vi. 14). This “blessed presbyter,”
                    as Clement-calls him, sought to explain why Paul did not name himself as usual
                    at the head of the epistle, and found the reason in the modesty of the author,
                    who, in addressing the Hebrews, was going beyond his commission as apostle to
                    the Gentiles. Clement himself takes it for granted that an epistle to the
                    Hebrews must have been written in Hebrew, and supposes that Luke translated it
                    for the Greeks. Thus far there is no sign that the Pauline authorship was ever
                    questioned in Alexandria. Origen rests on the same tradition, which he refers to
                    “the ancient men.” But he knows that the tradition is not common to all
                    churches. He feels that the language is un-Pauline, though the admirable
                    thoughts are not second to those of the unquestioned apostolic writings. And
                    thus he is led to the view that the ideas were orally set forth by Paul, but
                    that the language, arrangement, and some features of the exposition are the work
                    of a disciple. According to some this disciple was Clement of Rome; others named
                    Luke; but the truth, says Origen, is known to God alone (Euseb., vi. 25, <hi
                    rend="italic">cf.</hi> iii. 38). It is not surprising that these limitations of
                    the tradition had less influence than the broad fact that Origen accepted the
                    book as of Pauline authority. From the time of Origen the opinion that Paul
                    wrote the epistle became more and more prevalent in the East. · In the West this
                    view was still far from established in the 4th century. But it gained ground
                    steadily; even those who, like Jerome and Augustine, knew the variations of
                    tradition were unwilling to press an opposite view; and in the 5th century the
                    Pauline authorship was accepted at Rome, and practically throughout Christendom,
                    not to be again disputed till the revival of letters and the rise of a more
                    critical spirit.</p>
                <p>That the received view called for revision could not indeed be questioned when
                    men began to look at the facts of the case. The vacillation of tradition and the
                    dissimilarity of the epistle from the style and thoughts of Paul were brought
                    out with great force by Erasmus in his concluding annotation on the book, where
                    he ventures the conjecture based on a passage of his favourite Jerome, that
                    Clement of Rome was the real author. Luther (who suggests Apollos) and Calvin
                    (who thinks of Luke or Clement) followed with the decisive argument that Paul,
                    who lays such stress on the fact that his gospel was not taught to him by man
                    but by direct revelation (Gal. i.), could not have written Heb. ii. 3, 4, where
                    the author classes him3elf among those who received the message of salvation
                    from the personal disciples of the Lord on the evidence of the miracles with
                    which God confirmed their word. The force of tradition seemed already broken,
                    but the wave of reaction which so soon overwhelmed the freer tendencies of the
                    first reformers brought back the old view. Protestant orthodoxy again accepted
                    Paul as the author, and dissentient voices were seldom heard till the revival of
                    free Biblical criticism in last century. As criticism strengthened its
                    arguments, theologians began to learn that the denial of tradition involves no
                    danger to faith, and at the present moment, in spite of the ingenious special
                    pleading of Hofmann (Z)∕'e <hi rend="italic">Heilige Schrift</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">N. Ts.,</hi> vol. v., Nordlingen, 18/ 3), scarcely any sound
                    scholar will be found to accept Paul as the direct author of the epistle, though
                    such a modified view as was suggested by Origen still claims adherents among the
                    lovers of compromise with tradition.</p>
                <p>The arguments against the Alexandrian tradition are in fact conclusive. It is
                    probably unfair to hamper that tradition with Clement’s notion that the book is
                    a translation from the Hebrew, a monstrous hypothesis which has received its <hi
                    rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad absurdum</hi> in the recent
                    attempt of J. H. R. Biesenthal to reconstruct the Hebrew text <hi rend="italic"

                    The un-Fauline character of the style, alike in the words used and in the
                    structure of the sentences, strikes every scholar as it struck Origen and
                    Erasmus. The type of thought is quite unique. The theological ideas are cast in
                    a different mould; and the leading conception of the high priesthood of Christ,
                    which is no mere occasional thought but a central point in the author’s
                    conception of Christianity, finds its nearest analogy not in the Pauline
                    epistles but in John xvii. 19. The Old Testament is cited after the Alexandrian
                    translation more exactly and exclusively than is the custom of Paul, and that
                    even where the Hebrew original is divergent. Nor is this an accidental
                    circumstance. There is every appearance that the author was a Hellenist whose
                    learning did not embrace a knowledge of the Hebrew text, and who derived his
                    metaphysic and allegorical method from the Alexandrian rather than the
                    Palestinian schools.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For
                    the Alexandrian elements in the epistle consult the list of passages in

                <p>The force of these arguments can be brought out only by the accumulation of a
                    multitude of details too tedious for this place, but the evidence from the few
                    personal indications contained in the epistle is easily grasped and not less
                    powerful. The argument from ii. 3, 4, which appeared decisive to Luther and
                    Calvin, has already been referred to. Again, we read in xiii. 19 that the writer
                    is absent from the church which he addresses, but hopes to be speedily restored
                    to them. This expression is not to be understood as im. plying that the epistle
                    was written in prison, for xiii. 23 shows that the author is master of his own
                    movements.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In X. 34 the
                    true reading is not “of me in my bonds,” but “on them that were in bonds,” τo7s
                    <hi rend="italic">btσμloιs συveτraθhσaτe.</hi> The false reading, which was that
                    of Clement of Alexandria, is probably connected with the tradition that Paul is
                    author.</p></note> The plain sense is that his home is with them, but that he is
                    at present absent, and begs their prayers for a speedy return. But Paul, if he
                    could say that he had a home at all, had it not in a community of Jewish
                    Christians. The external authority of the Alexandrian tradition can have no
                    weight against such difficulties. If that tradition was original and continuous,
                    the long ignorance of the Roman Church and the opposite tradition of Africa are
                    inexplicable. But no tradition was more likely to arise in circles where the
                    epistle was valued and its origin forgotten. In spite of its divergencies from
                    the standard of Pauline authorship,, the book has manifest Pauline affinities,
                    and can hardly have originated beyond the Pauline circle, to which it is
                    referred, not only by the author’s friendship with Timothy (xiii. 23), but by
                    many unquestionable echoes of the Pauline theology, and even by distinct
                    allusions to passages in Paul’s epistles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An unambiguous proof that our author had read the epistle to
                    the Romans seems to lie in x. 30. This is the one Old Testament citation of the
                    epistle which does not follow the Septuagint (Deut, xxxii. 35); but it is word
                    for word from Rom. xii. 19. Further signs of dependence on Romans and
                    Corinthians (which require sifting) have been collected by Holtzmann in

                    to the so-called second epistle of Clement to the Corinthians.</p>
                <p>When we see that the tradition which names Paul as author does not possess an
                    authentic historical basis, we are necessarily carried on to deny historical
                    authority to the subsidiary conjectures or traditions which speak of Luke and
                    Clement of Rome. The history of the Alexandrian tradition shows that these names
                    were brought in merely to lessen the difficulties attaching to the view that
                    Paul wrote the book exactly as we have it. The name of Luke seems to be a
                    conjecture of the Alexandrian Clement, for it has no place in the tradition
                    received from his master. And Origen attaches no importance to either name. Some
                    hal mentioned one, and some the other, but God alone knows the truth. We have no
                    reason to think more highly of these suggestions than Origen did. Indeed, no
                    Protestant scholar now proposes the name of Clement, whose extant epistle to the
                    Corinthians shows his familiarity with the epistle to the Hebrews, and at the
                    same time excludes the idea thιt he composed it. The name of Luke has still
                    partisans—most notably Delitzsch, who has carefully collected linguistic
                    parallels between our epistle and the Lucan writings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Commentar</hi><hi rend="italic">zum Hebräerbrief</hi> Leipsic, 1857; English
                    translation, Edinburgh, 1868-70). The arguments of Delitzsch are generally met
                    with the objection that our author must have been a born Jew, which from his
                    standpoint and culture is in the highest degree probable, though not perhaps
                    absolutely certain. In any case we cannot suppose that Luke wrote the epistle on
                    Paul’s commission, or that the work is substantially the apostle’s; for such a
                    theory takes no account of the strongly-marked individuality of the book in
                    thought and method as well as expression. And the theory that Luke was the
                    independent author of the epistle (Grotius and others) has no right to appeal to
                    antiquity, and must stand entirely on the very inadequate grounds of internal
                    probability afforded by language and style.</p>
                <p>If Alexandria fails us, can we suppose that Africa preserved the original
                    tradition? This is a difficult question. The intrinsic objections to authorship
                    by Barnabas are not important. The so-called Epistle to Barnabas was not written
                    by our author, but then it is admittedly not by Barnabas. The superior elegance
                    of the style of our epistle a3 compared with that of Paul is not inconsistent
                    with Acts xiv. 12; nor is there, as we shall see presently, any real force in
                    the once favourite objection that the ordinances of the temple are described
                    with less accuracy than might be looked for in Barnabas, a Levite and one who
                    had resided in Jerusalem. On the other hand it is hard to believe that the
                    correct account of the authorship of our book was preserved only in Africa, and
                    in a tradition so isolated that Tertullian seems to be its only independent
                    witness. How could Africa know this thing and Rome be ignorant? Zahn, who is the
                    latest exponent of the Barnabas hypo thesis, argues that in the West, where the
                    so-called epistle of Barnabas was long unknown, there was nothing to suggest the
                    i lea of Barnabas as an author; that the true tradition might perish the more
                    readily in other parts of the church after the name of Barnabas had been falsely
                    attached to another epistle dealing with the typology of the ceremonial law; and
                    finally, that the false epistle of</p>
                <p>Barnabas, which was first so named in Alexandria, may there have carried off the
                    true title of the epistle to the Hebrews after the latter was ascribed to Paul.
                    That is not plausible, and it is more likely that an epistle which calls itself
                    λόγος 7rα∕3ακλτ)σ∙∈ως (Heb. xiii. 22) w as ascribed to the υioς 7rαpακλτ)σeως
                    (Acts iv. 36) in the same way as Ps. cxxvii. was ascribed to Solomon, “the
                    beloved of the Lord” (2 Sam. xii. 24, 25), from the allusion cxxvii. 2, than
                    that this coincidence of expression affords a confirmation of the Barnabas
                    hypothesis. In short, the whole tradition as to the epistle is too uncertain to
                    offer much support to any theory of authorship, and if the name of Barnabas is
                    accepted it must stand mainly on internal evidence.</p>
                <p>Being thus thrown back on w hat the epistle itself can tell us, we must look at
                    the first readers, with whom, as we have already seen, the author stood in very
                    close relations. It is generally agreed that the church addressed was composed
                    of Hebrew's or Christians of Jewish birth. We are not entitled to take this
                    simply on the authority of the title, which is hardly more than a reflexion of
                    the impression produced on an early copyist. But it is plain that the writer is
                    at one with his readers in approaching all Christian truth through the Old
                    Testament. He and they alike are accustomed to regard Christianity as a
                    continuous development of Judaism, in which the benefits of Christ’s death
                    belong to the ancient people of God and supply the shortcomings of the old
                    dispensation (iv. 9; ix. 15; xiii. 12). With all the weight that is laid on the
                    superiority of Christianity, the religion of finality, over Mosaism, the
                    dispensation which brought nothing to its goal, the sphere of the two
                    dispensations is throughout treated as identical, without any allusion, such as
                    could hardly have been avoided in addressing a Gentile church, to the way in
                    which strangers and foreigners (Eph. ii. 19) had been incorporated with the
                    people of God. Schürer indeed <hi rend="italic">(Stud. u. Krit.,</hi> 1876, p.
                    776) has sought such an allusion in vi. 1, 2, where faith in God and belief in
                    the resurrection and the judgment, points common to Judaism and Christianity,
                    are reckoned to the elementary doctrine of Christ; and he concludes that the
                    readers addressed were Gentile converts of a Judaizing type. But taken with the
                    context these verses imply only that the Hebrews required to be warned against
                    losing hold even of these first principles of revealed truth which lie in the
                    Old Testament (v. 12). From all this we are not perhaps entitled to conclude
                    that the church addressed contained no Gentile members, but it is plain that
                    they were not sufficiently numerous and independent in their way of thought to
                    affect the general type of Christianity in the community. To some writers the
                    emphatic “all” in xiii. 24, the admonitions x. 25, xiii. 17, have suggested the
                    possibility that the Hebrews addressed were but part, and a somewhat
                    discontented part, of a larger community in which Gentile elements has a
                    considerable place. . But this appears a strained conclusion (Phil, iv. 21; 1
                    Th. v. 26) distinctly contrary to the general tone of the epistle, which moves
                    altogether outside of the antithesis between Jewish and Gentile Christianity. We
                    must think not of a party but of a church, and such a church can be sought only
                    in Palestine or in one of the great centres of the Jewish dispersion. That the
                    epistle was addressed to Palestine, or more specifically to Jerusalem, has been
                    a prevalent opinion from the time of Clement of Alexandria, mainly because it
                    was assumed that the word Hebrews must naturally mean Jews, whose mother-tongue
                    was Aramaic. But the term has this restricted sense only when put in contrast to
                    Hellenists. In itself, according to ordinary usage, it simply denotes Jews by
                    race, and in Christian writings especially Jewish Christians. And there are
                    several things in the epistle that seem to exclude Palestine, and above all
                    Jerusalem. The Hellenistic cul-</p>

                    of our Bible is that of the Latin Church, the oldest Greek codices placing it
                    before the pastoral epistles. But the Latin order, which expresses the original
                    uncertainty of the Pauline tradition, was formerly current even in the East.</p>

                <p>ture of the writer and the language in which he writes furnish one argument. Then
                    the most marked proof of Christian love and zeal in the church addressed was
                    that they had ever been assiduous in ministering to the saints (vi. 10). This
                    expression may conceivably have a general sense (1 Cor. xvi. 151), but it is far
                    more likely that it haβ the specific meaning which it generally bears in the New
                    Testament, viz., the collection of alms for the church in Jerusalem. At any rate
                    it was clearly understood in the first age of Christianity that the Judaean
                    Church took alms and did not give them, receiving in temporal things an
                    acknowledgment for the spiritual things they had imparted (Rom. XV. 27). In fact
                    the great weight laid in the epistles of Paul on this—the only manifestation of
                    the catholicity of the church then possible (Gal. ii. 10)—alone explains the
                    emphasis with which our author cites this one proof of Christian feeling. Again,
                    the expressions in ii. 3 already referred to imply that the readers did not
                    include in their number direct disciples of Jesus, but had been brought to
                    Christ by the words and miracles of apostolic missionaries now dead (xiii. 7).
                    This conversion, as it appears from x. 32, was a thing of precise date
                    immediately followed by persecution (note the aorists <hi rend="italic"
                    >φωτcσBivτeς—υπεμ,εivarε);</hi> so that we cannot think of a second generation
                    in the Palestinian Church, but are referred to some part of the Diaspora.
                    Against these difficulties, which have led some of the latest defenders of the
                    Palestinian address, as Grimm (who, in Hilgenfeld’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeitschr.</hi> 1870, proposes Jamnia) and Moulton <hi rend="italic">{Hew
                    Testament Commentary for English Readers,</hi> vol. iii., 1879), to give up
                    Jerusalem altogether, while others, as Riehm, suppose that the Hellenists of
                    Jerusalem (Acts vi. 1) are primarily addressed, it is commonly urged that the
                    readers are exposed to peculiar danger from the persecutions and solicitations
                    of unbelieving Jews, that they are in danger of relapsing into participation in
                    the Jewish sacrifices, or even that they appear to have never ceased to follow
                    the ceremonial observances that had their centre in the temple ritual. The
                    capital argument for this Î3 drawn from xiii. 13, where the exhortation to go
                    forth to Jesus without the camp is taken as an injunction to renounce fellowship
                    with the synagogue and with the ceremonies and ritual of Judaism. But this
                    exegesis rests on a false view of the context, which does not include ver3e 9,
                    and expresses by a figure that Christians (as the priests of the new covenant)
                    have no temporal advantage to expect by their participation in the sacrifice of
                    Christ, but must be content to share his reproach, renouncing this earthly
                    country for the heavenly kingdom (c∕. xi. 16, 25-27 with xiii. 14; Phil. iii.
                    20). Altogether, this view of the situation of the first readers of the epistle
                    appears distorted or exaggerated. It is obvious that our Hebrews were familiar
                    with the law, and had a high regard for the ordinances of temple worship. In
                    particular it appears that they had not fully understood how the mediatorial
                    functions of the Old Testament were superseded by the mediatorship of Christ.
                    But their ritualism seems to have been rather theoretical than practical. Had
                    they been actually entangled in the daily practice of superseded ordinances, the
                    author, whose insight into the true worth of these ordinances is clear, and
                    whose personal relations to the Pauline circle are obvious, could hardly have
                    been so nearly one of themselves as appears in xiii, 19, and at any rate could
                    not have failed to give an express precept on the subject. But, on the contrary,
                    he is in thorough sympathy with the type of doctrine on which their church was
                    formed (xiii. 7); the easy way in which he touches on the “meats and drinks and
                    divers washings” of Judaism seems to show that on this head he could count on
                    carrying hi3 readers along with him; and xiii. 9 hardly refers to sacrifices or
                    to Levitical laws of clean and unclean, but rather to some such form of
                    asceticism (c∕. ver. 4) as is spoken of in Rom. xiv. Nowhere does our author
                    speak a warning against participation in sacrifices; nowhere does he touch on
                    the burning questions that divided the Pharisaic Christians of Jerusalem from
                    the converts of Paul. The practical lesson which he draws from his doctrine is
                    that his readers ought to use with diligence the specifically Christian way of
                    access to God (x. 19 <hi rend="italic">seq.) ∙,</hi> and the only positive fault
                    which he mentions in this connexion is a disposition to neglect the privilege of
                    social worship (x. 25). This again is plainly connected, not with an inclination
                    to return to the synagogue, but with a relaxation of the zeal and patience of
                    the first days of their Christian profession (vi. 4 <hi rend="italic"
                    >seq.∙,</hi> x. 32 <hi rend="italic">seq.∙,</hi> xii. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >seqj),</hi> associated with a less firm hold than they once had of the
                    essentials of Christian faith, a less clear vision of the heavenly hope of their
                    calling (iii. 12; iv. 11; v. 12). The apostle fears lest they fall away not
                    merely from the higher standpoint of Christianity into Judaizing practices, but
                    from all faith in God and judgment and immortality (iii. 12; vi. 1 <hi

                    ingenious historical romance in which he has enveloped the whole origin of the
                    epistle.</p></note></p>
                <p>For the solution of the problem of the epistle it is of the highest importance to
                    form an exacter conception of the causes and nature of this unhealthy condition
                    of the church. Their first conversion had been followed by direct persecution,
                    which their faith had triumphantly overcome. But these days were long gone by
                    (x. 32). It does not appear that a like severity of trial had again fallen upon
                    them. But there were persecutions at least in other parts of the church (xiii.
                    3, 23). The times were troubled, and from day to day there were many trials and
                    many reproaches to sustain. The dull and long-continued strain of conflict with
                    surrounding wickedness was harder to bear than a sharp onslaught of the enemy
                    (ch. xii.). They were weary of enduring, weary of hope deferred, and so the
                    bonds of their Christian unity were loosened, their brotherly love weakened
                    (xiii. 1 <hi rend="italic">seq.~),</hi> and they began to doubt the verity of
                    those heavenly good things which their first faith had so vividly realized. In
                    such circumstances it was natural that the writer should lay stress on the
                    contrast between the eternal and the transitory, the things of faith and the
                    things of sight, the heavenly Zion and the earthly pilgrimage. But the
                    remarkable feature of the epistle is that this contrast is drawn out in the form
                    of a threefold argument to show the superiority of Christianity over the old
                    dispensation, inasmuch as Christ is superior (1) to the angels, (2) to Moses,
                    (3) and chiefly to the Levitical priesthood and its mediatorship. In each of
                    these relations, it is argued, the old covenant, which is earthly, temporal, and
                    without finality, contains within itself the evidence of its own imperfection,
                    and points to the time when it shall be superseded by a new covenant in which
                    every reality and every hope is heavenly, eternal, or, as we should say, ideal.
                    It is the form of this argument which mainly gives force to the common
                    impression that the Hebrews addressed were in danger of seeking access to God by
                    the superseded methods of the old dispensation·—in short, that the epistle is a
                    warning against an Ebionite tendency to Christian Pharisaism. But to such a
                    tendency, as we have seen, the practical admonitions of the epistle by no means
                    point. To some scholars accordingly, and particularly to Reuss <hi rend="italic"

                    the book has seemed disproportionate to the practical and personal conclusion,
                    and it has been proposed to regard the whole as a theological system with an
                    epistolary appendix. Doubtless this view contains an element of truth. In a <pb

                    in a sense which thoroughly well agrees with the position of the author as no
                    apostle but an apostolic convert, the book presents the marks of theological
                    reflexion on the established data of the faith. Yet it is impossible to ignore
                    the fact that a special and practical motive runs through the whole book. The
                    author never loses sight of a definite circle of readers, and the vast scope of
                    his argument, which is at once felt in the dignity of the opening verses, so
                    unlike the commencement of an ordinary letter, appears to be directly suggested
                    by some historical circumstance affecting his readers and himself, but nowhere
                    explicitly set forth in the epistle, which brought the trial of their faith into
                    close connexion with the question of the permanence of the temple and its
                    ritual. Now we have seen reason to believe that these Jewish Christians were not
                    Palestinians of an Ebionite type but men of the Hellenistic dispersion, with a
                    possible tendency to ascetic mysticism, and almost certainly of such a habit of
                    thought as enabled them readily to sympathize with the typological method of our
                    author. Among men of this type there was no great danger of a relapse into
                    practical ceremonialism. They would rather be akin to the school of Judaism
                    characterized by Philo <hi rend="italic">(Ds Migr. Abr.,</hi> c. xvi.; ed.
                    Mangey, i. 450), who neglected the observance of the ceremonial laws because
                    they took them as symbols of ideal things. Occupying this position before their
                    conversion, their adoption of the Christian faith would not have forced upon
                    them any close examination of the relation of the new dispensation to the old
                    law. But it appears from Philo that the men who spiritualized away the Sabbath,
                    the great feists, even circumcision itself, were not prepared to think lightly
                    of the sacred ritual of the temple. The holy hill of God, the meeting-place of
                    heaven and earth, with its stately service and its ancient memories, had too
                    central a place in the religion of the old covenant to seem indifferent to the
                    freest thinker. And so our Hebrews, whose acceptance of Christ had not shaken
                    their sense of the continuity of the people of God and their Old Testament
                    privileges, might readily retain the feeling that the ritual of the temple was
                    still what it was of old— a visible and necessary pledge of God’s approach to
                    His people and His acceptance of their worship. So long as things ran their old
                    course such a feeling would hardly affect the even tenor of their Christian
                    life. But when the death struggle of Judea against Rome drew the sympathy of
                    every Hebrew heart, when the abomination of desolation stood in the holy place,
                    when the holy and beautiful house was burned up with fire, and when, with all
                    this, terror and distress filled the whole Roman empire and still the Lord
                    delayed His coming, it was not strange that something like despair of God’s help
                    should assail our Hebrews, and that all the hopes of the people of God should
                    seem threatened in the overthrow of the ancient pledge of Jehovah’s nearness to
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>Now it has generally been argued that the epistle to the Hebrews, which describes
                    the temple services in the present tense, must necessarily have been written
                    before they ceased to be performed. But it has been shown in the most conclusive
                    manner, from the use of similar presents in Rabbinical writers as well as in
                    Josephus and elsewhere, that this argument goes for nothing; and the most recent
                    writers, since Holtzmann’s discussion of the subject in SchenkeΓs <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibel-Lexilcon,</hi> ii. G23 <hi rend="italic">seq.,</hi>
                    generally admit that the epistle may have been written after the fall of the
                    temple. And if this be so it can hardly be questioned that the most natural view
                    of the apostle’s argument, as it comes to a point in such passages as viii. 13,
                    ix. 9, is that the disappearance of the obsolete ritual of the old covenant is
                    no blow to Christian faith, because in Christ ascended into glory the church
                    possesses in heavenly verity all that the old ritual presented in mere earthly
                    symbol. It was the ruin of the Jewish state and worship which compelled
                    Christianity to find what is offered in our epistle—a theory of the
                    disappearance -of the old dispensation in the new.</p>
                <p>Many attempts have been made to determine which of the centres of the Diaspora
                    was the seat of our Hebrews. Hofmann suggests Antioch; Ewald, Ravenna j<note

                    Alexandria are the places for and against which most has been said. One argument
                    for Alexandria on which great stress has been laid must certainly be dismissed.
                    Wieseler <hi rend="italic">(Untersuchung über den Hebräerbrief</hi> ii <hi
                    rend="superscript"> te</hi> Hälfte, Kiel, 1861), combining the arguments against
                    a Palestinian address with the impression, which we have seen to be without
                    sufficient foundation, that the readers lived in the neighbourhood of a Jewish
                    temple, seeks them among the Egyptian Jews who frequented the schismatical
                    temple of Leontopolis (Tel-el-Yahûdîa) in the upper Delta. And he tries to show
                    that in his description of the temple and the functions of the high priests our
                    author diverges from the Judaean pattern and follows peculiarities of the
                    Egyptian temple. But this argument rests on a series of improbable assumptions.
                    The supposed peculiarities of Onias’s temple are proved by arbitrary exegesis
                    from passages of Philo, who apparently never thought of that temple at all. Nor
                    can it be shown that it had ever such a reputation as to play the part which
                    Wieseler assigns to it. And our author’s supposed ignorance of the Jerusalem
                    ritual is not made out. In the true text of x. 11 the high priest is not
                    mentioned, and in vii. 27 what is asserted of the high priest is, not that he
                    offered daily sacrifice, but that he was in daily need of atonement. It is more
                    difficult to understand why in ix. 4 the golden <hi rend="italic"

                    argument with Alexandrian thought, the apparent analogy between our Hebrews and
                    the free-thinking Jews of whom Philo speaks, are all in favour of this address,
                    though we do not know enough about the early history of the Egyptian Church to
                    speak with positiveness either for or against this view of the epistle. Among
                    Continental scholars the disposition at present is to favour the Roman address;
                    upon which view, since that church was a mixed one, we must suppose that the
                    letter was originally directed to a Jewish section of the Roman Christians, This
                    is not quite plausible, especially since we find in the epistle no trace of the
                    division of parties alluded to by Paul in his epistle from Rome to the
                    Philippians. It is argued, however, that there is an analogy between the way of
                    thinking of our Hebrews and the disposition of the majority of the Roman Church
                    as it appears in Rom. ix. <hi rend="italic">seq.</hi> The persecution x. 32 is

                    opinion; thus Renan will have it that the epistle was written from Ephesus in
                    the year 65, while Harnack <hi rend="italic">{Patr. Ap.,</hi> I. p. lxxxii.)
                    thinks he finds traces of two distinct persecutions (I), and dates the book from
                    the time of Domitian. The early currency of the epistle at Rome is urged in
                    favour of the Roman address, but the ignorance of the Roman Church as to the
                    author’s name seems to go rather in the opposite direction. Ch. xiii. 24 gives
                    us no help, for they of Italy (οί <hi rend="italic">άπο</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >τη&lt;s</hi><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Iταλcαs) may in the epistolary style
                    be Italians either at home or abroad. It is most natural to infer from X. 32 <hi
                    rend="italic">seq.,</hi> compared with xii. 4, that the church spoken of had not
                    yet produced martyrs, but had suffered only by bonds and the loss of goods. This
                    would exclude Rome, but perhaps the inference is not quite stringent.</p>
                <p>Returning from this survey we bring little with us that can throw light on the
                    authorship of the epistle. We can only say that the writer was a man of the
                    first intellectual mark and of Alexandrian culture, whose home and work lay
                    mainly among Jewish Christians, but who was at the same time associated with the
                    Pauline circle. Of the names offered to us in other New Testament writings,
                    Barnabas and Apollos seem the most likely, and Barnabas will claim the
                    preference if we are entitled to give any weight to tradition. Either name would
                    go well with the Alexandrian address. Apollos was an Alexandrian Jew. Barnabas
                    was of Cyprus, always closely connected with Egypt; and the tradition which
                    connects his relative and associate Mark with the Church of Alexandria is as old
                    as the 2d century.</p>

                    on the exposition of the book may be gathered from the briefer posthumous work

                    (3d ed., Gottingen, 1867). For the doctrine of the epistle the most elaborate
