                    market-town of Scotland, county of Lanark, is situated about a mile from the
                    junction of the Avon with the Clyde and 10 miles S.E. of Glasgow. It occupies a
                    rising ground commanding fine views of a rich and highly picturesque country,
                    and consists of several streets of well-built houses <pb break="no"

                    surrounded by a number of villas belonging chiefly to persons engaged in
                    business in Glasgow. The principal buildings are the town-hall, the county
                    buildings in the Grecian style of architecture, the academy, the St John’s
                    grammar school, and the infantry barracks. Among the subjects of antiquarian
                    interest are Queenzie Neuk, the spot where Queen Mary rested on her journey to
                    Langside; the old steeple and pillory built in the reign of Charles I.; the Moat
                    Hill, the old Runic cross, and the carved gateway in the palace park. In the
                    churchyard there is a monument, with four heads in basso-rilievo, to four
                    covenanters who suffered at Edinburgh, December 7, 1600, their heads being
                    interred below. Among the industries of the town are weaving and the tambouring
                    of muslin; and there are also large market gardens, the district being famed
                    especially for its apples; but the prosperity of the town depends chiefly upon
                    the coal and iron-stone which are extensively worked in the neighbourhood.
                    Hamilton originated in the 15th century under the protecting influence of the
                    lords of Hamilton. It unites with Airdrie, Falkirk, Lanark, and Linlithgow to
                    form the Falkirk district of boroughs, which returns one member to parliament.
                    The population in 1871 was 11,498.</p>
                <p>Immediately east of the town is Hamilton palace, the seat of the duke of Hamilton
                    and Brandon, premier peer of Scotland. The present palace was commenced in 1822.
                    Its front is a specimen of the enriched Corinthian architecture, with a
                    projecting pillared portico after the style of the temple of Jupiter Stator at
                    Rome, 264 feet in length and 60 feet in height. The interior is richly decorated
                    and contains one of the most valuable collections of paintings in Scotland.
                    Within the grounds, which comprise nearly 1500 acres, is the mausoleum erected
                    by the tenth duke, a structure resembling in general design that of the emperor
                    Hadrian at Rome, being a circular building springing from a square basement, and
                    enclosing a decorated octagonal chapel. About 2 miles south-east of Hamilton, on
                    the summit of a precipitous rock 200 feet in height, the foot of which is washed
                    by the Avon, stand the ruins of Cadzow Castle, the original seat of the Hamilton
                    family, conferred on the chief of that family immediately after the battle of
                    Bannockburn, having been previously a royal residence for at least two
                    centuries. The castle has been made the subject of a spirited ballad by Sir
                    Walter Scott. Near it is the noble chase with its ancient oaks, the remains of
                    the Caledonian Forest, where are still preserved some of the old Scotch breed of
                    wild cattle. Opposite Cadzow Castle on the other side of the Avon is
                    Chatelherault, consisting of stables and offices, and imitating in outline the
                    palace of that name in France. A magnificent double avenue stretches between it
                    and Hamilton palace.</p>
