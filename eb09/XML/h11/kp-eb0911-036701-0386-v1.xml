                <p><label type="entry">HÀFIZ</label>. Muhammed Shamsuddin, better known by his <hi
                        rend="italic">takhallus</hi> or “nom de plume” of Hâfiz, was one of the most
                    celebrated writers of Persian lyrical poetry. He was born at Shiraz, the capital
                    of Fars, in the early part of the 8th century of the Mahometan era, that is to
                    say, in the 14th of our own. The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but he is
                    known to have attained a ripe old age and to have died in 791 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1388 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> This is
                    the date given in the chronogram which is engraved on his tomb, although several
                    Persian biographers give a different year. Very little is actually known about
                    his life, which appears to have been passed in quiet retirement and literary
                    ease in his native city of Shiraz, of which he always speaks in terms of
                    affectionate admiration. He was a subject of the Muzaffar princes, who ruled in
                    Shiraz, Yazd, Kirman, and Ispahan, until the dynasty was overthrown by
                    Timur-lang (Tamerlane). Of these princes his especial patrons were Shah Shujâ'
                    and Shah Mansùr. He early devoted himself to the study of poetry and theology,
                    and also became learned in mystic philosophy, which he studied under Shaikh
                    Mahmùd 'Attâr, chief of an order of dervishes. Hâfiz afterwards enrolled himself
                    in the same order and became a professor of Koranic exegesis in a college which
                    his friend and patron Haji Kiwam-uddin, the vizier, specially founded for him.
                    This was probably the reason of his adopting the <hi rend="italic"
                        >sobriquet</hi> of .Hâfiz, which means “one who remembers,” and is
                    technically applied to any person who has learned the Koran by heart. The
                    restraints of an ascetic life seem to have been very little to Hâfiz’s taste,
                    and his loose conduct and wine-bibbing propensities drew upon him the severe
                    censure of his monastic colleagues. In revenge he satirizes them unmercifully in
                    his verses, and seldom loses an opportunity of alluding to their hypocrisy and
                    religious pretensions. Hâfiz’s fame as a poet was soon rapidly spread throughout
                    the Mahometan world, and several powerful monarchs sent him presents and
                    pressing invitations to visit them. Amongst others he was invited by Mahmùd Shah
                    Bahmani, who reigned in the south of India, and set off with the intention of
                    sojourning at the court of that sovereign. After crossing the Indus and passing
                    through Lahore he reached Hurmuz, and embarked on board a vessel sent for him by
                    the Indian prince. He seems, however, to have been a bad sailor, and, having
                    invented an excuse for being put ashore, made the best of his way back to
                    Shiraz. Some biographies narrate a story of an interview between Hâfiz and the
                    invader Timur. The latter sent for him and asked angrily, “Art thou he who was
                    so bold as to offer my two great cities Samarcand and Bokhara for the black mole
                    on thy mistress’s cheek,” alluding to a well-known verse in one of his odes.
                    “Yes, sire,” replied Hâfiz, “and it is by such acts of generosity that I have
                    brought myself to such a state of destitution that I have now to solicit your
                    bounty.” Timur was so pleased at the ready wit displayed in this answer that he
                    dismissed the poet with a handsome present. Unfortunately for the truth of this
                    story Timur did not capture Shiraz till 1393 A.D., while the latest date that
                    can be assigned to Hâfiz’s death is 1391. Of his private life little or nothing
                    is known. One of his poems is said to record the death of his wife, another that
                    of a favourite unmarried son, and several others speak of his love for a girl
                    called <hi rend="italic">Shäkh</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Nabat,</hi> “Sugar-cane branch,” and this is almost all of his personal
                    history that can be gathered from his writings. He was, like most Persians, a
                    Shiah by religion, believing in the transmission of the office of Imâm, or head
                    of the Muslim Church in the family of Ali, cousin of the prophet, and rejecting
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hadith,</hi> or traditional sayings of Mahomet, which form
                    the Sunneh or supplementary code of Mahometan ceremonial law. One of his odes
                    which contains a verse in praise of Ali is engraved on the poet’s tomb, but is
                    omitted by Sudi, the Turkish editor and commentator, who was himself a rigid
                    Sunni. The same sectarian bigotry has influenced many other editors, and it is
                    no unusual thing to find an Indian edition of the <hi rend="italic">Divan</hi>
                    emasculated by the excision of all the passages which can be construed as having
                    the slightest allusion to the objects of Shiah veneration. That his tendencies
                    were towards a rather extravagant and heretical form of theosophy may be deduced
                    from his writings, and in one verse he even goes so far as to speak in terms of
                    admiration of one Mansùr of Hallâj who was hanged, after being put to the most
                    horrible tortures, on a charge of blasphemy, 309 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>
                    This person professed a creed nearly approaching pure pantheism, and went about
                    asserting that he was himself an incarnation of the omnipresent divinity,
                    saying, <hi rend="italic">Ana</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">l Hakk,</hi> “I am the
                    Truth !” Hâfiz in allusion to this says that his only fault was that he revealed
                    the mystery. These heretical opinions and the dissipated life of the poet caused
                    difficulties to be raised by the ecclesiastical authorities on his death as to
                    his interment in consecrated ground. The question was at length settled by
                    Hâfiz’s own works, which had then already begun to be used as they are now
                    throughout the East for the purposes of divination, in the same manner as Virgil
                    was employed in the Middle Ages for the divination called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sortes Virgilianoe.</hi> Opening the book at random after pronouncing the
                    customary formula asking for inspiration, the objectors hit upon the following
                    verse—“Turn not away thy foot from the bier of Hâfiz, for though immersed in
                    sin, he will be admitted into Paradise.” He was accordingly buried in the centre
                    of a small cemetery at Shiraz, now included in an enclosure called the
                    Hâfiziyeh.</p>
                <p>His principal work is the <hi rend="italic">Divdn,</hi> that is, a collection of
                    short odes or sonnets called <hi rend="italic">ghazals,</hi> and consisting of
                    from five to sixteen <hi rend="italic">baits</hi> or couplets each, all the
                    couplets in each ode having the same rhyme in the last hemistich, and the last
                    couplet always introducing the poet’s own <hi rend="italic">nom</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de plume.</hi> The whole of these are arranged in alphabetical
                    order, an arrangement which certainly facilitates reference but makes it
                    absolutely impossible to ascertain their chronological order, and therefore
                    deteriorates from their value as a means of throwing light upon the growth and
                    develop·</p>

                <p>ment of his genius or the incidents of his career. These “orient pearls at random
                    strung,” as a version of a passage from Hâfiz in Sir William Jones’s grammar
                    calls them, are often held together by a very slender thread of continuous
                    thought, and very few editions agree exactly in the order of the couplets which
                    form the individual ghazals. Still, although they often appear at first sight
                    extremely disconnected, a careful study of them, especially from the point of
                    view indicated by the Sufiistic system of philosophy, will always show that a
                    single idea does run throughout the whole. The nature of these poems has been
                    the subject of much discussion in the West, some scholars seeing in their
                    anacreontic utterances nothing but sensuality and materialism, while others,
                    following the Oriental school, maintain that they are wholly and entirely mystic
                    and philosophic. Something between the two would probably be nearer the truth.
                    It must be remembered that Hâfiz was a professed dervish and Sùfi, and that his
                    ghazals were in all probability published from a <hi rend="italic">takia,</hi>
                    and arranged with at least a view to Sufiistic interpretation. At the same time
                    it is ridiculous to suppose that the glowing imagery, the gorgeous and often
                    tender descriptions of natural beauties, the fervent love passages, and the
                    roystering drinking songs were composed in cool blood or with deliberate ascetic
                    purpose. The beauty of Hâfiz’s poetry is that it is natural. It is the outcome
                    of a fervent soul and a lofty genius delighting in nature and enjoying life; and
                    it is the poet’s misfortune that he lived in an age and amongst a people where
                    rigid conventionality demanded that his free and spontaneous thoughts should be
                    recast into an artificial mould.</p>
                <p>The system of philosophy professed by Persian poets and dervishes, and in
                    accordance with which the poems of Hafiz are allegorically interpreted, is
                    called Sufiism <hi rend="italic">(Tasau&gt;ιvuf).</hi> It is derived usually
                    from the word <hi rend="italic">suf,</hi> which in Arabic means wool, and is
                    supposed to refer to the woollen robes worn by the dervishes, although it is in
                    all probability connected with the Greek <hi rend="italic">σοφός.</hi> It is the
                    ultimate outcome of the protest of the conquered Aryan nations against the laws,
                    ceremonials, and ideas of their Semitic conquerors, which first found expression
                    in the schism of the Shiahs, that is, of the Persian party who sided with the
                    family of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, cousin and son-in-law of Mahomet, against the
                    claims of Moawiyeh, who at the head of the Arab party claimed and held the
                    caliphate. Forced by events to accept el Islam, and compelled to forsake the
                    Magian and Zoroastrian faiths, the Persian Shiahs rapidly developed a system
                    which, while teaching openly the unity of God according to Moslem doctrine,
                    secretly theorized and refined it away, until Pantheism became the esoteric
                    religion of the sect. It teaches that God is the only real existence and that
                    all other existences are hypothetical, that God existed alone and created the
                    universe merely by His Will and by the utterance of the word “Be.” The “Will” or
                    “Order” and the “Be” are closely allied to the “Spirit” and “Word” of Christian
                    theology. Man, the highest purpose of this creation, is therefore part and
                    parcel of the Deity, and when sufficiently purified from the lower and grosser
                    elements returns to his source again. The circle of existence thus imagined is
                    looked upon as a road which all must travel, and this image is kept up
                    throughout the terminology of the sect. Thus the doctrine is <hi rend="italic"
                        >tarikat</hi> (the road), the student or disciple is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >sdlik</hi> (wayfarer), and the different stages of perfection are <hi
                        rend="italic">mamilhd</hi> (road-side stations or inns). And since all
                    differences in sect and religion are as nothing to the illuminated philosopher
                    who is initiated into this mystery, and as the contemplation of the divinity of
                    his own existence and of his ultimate resumption of his place as part and parcel
                    of the Deity produces ecstacy and mental exaltation, and inasmuch as everything
                    that is beautiful, lovable, and pure is a purer and clearer manifestation of the
                    Deity that runs through all,—therefore the Sufis speak of their real worship as
                    paganism, their real devotion as love and drunkenness, and see a divine mystery
                    in every phase of beauty in humanity or inanimate nature.</p>
                <p>Besides the <hi rend="italic">Divdn,</hi> Hafiz wrote a number of other poems;
                    the Leipsic edition of his works contains 573 <hi rend="italic">ghαzαls</hi>
                    (forming the <hi rend="italic">Divan), 42</hi><hi rend="italic">kitähs</hi> or
                    fragments, 69 <hi rend="italic">rubâiyât</hi> or tetrnstics, 6 <hi rend="italic"
                        >masna-</hi><hi rend="italic">viyât</hi> or poems in rhyming couplets, 2 <hi
                        rend="italic">kasaid,</hi> idylls, or panegyrics, and one <hi rend="italic"
                        >mukhammcs</hi> or poem in five-line strophes. Other editions contain
                    several <hi rend="italic">tarji-band</hi> or poems with a refrain. His works
                    have never been completely translated into English; a few rhyming versions of
                    single poems by Sir William Jones, Nott, Hindley, Falconer, &amp;c., are to be
                    found scattered through the pages of the Orientai <hi rend="italic"
                        >Miscellany</hi> and other periodicals, and a fine edition containing a
                    verse rendering of the principal poems by the late H. Bicknell is published by
                    Triibner and Co. (London, 1875). A prose version of a huudred selected odes was
                    also published anonymously by Williams &amp; Norgate (London, 1875). On the
                    Continent the principal versions are by Von Hammer Burgstall; a rhyming and
                    rhythmical translation of a large portion of Hafiz’s works by Von Bosenzweig of
                    Vienna (3 vols. 8vo, Vienna, 1858), which contains also the Persian text and
                    notes; <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Divan des Schems-eddin
