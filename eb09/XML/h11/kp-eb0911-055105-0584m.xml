                    purpose to learn the Latin tongue.” This gentleman in 1695 took him into bis
                    house, and his education waβ continued at Bray till the Easter of 1696, when he
                    was sent to study at Edmund Hall, Oxford. There his diligence and scholarship
                    attracted the attention of Dr John Mill, the editor of the Greek Testament with
                    various readings, who employed him to compare several MSS. Hearne took the
                    degree of B.A. in 1699, and on account of the reputation he had acquired for his
                    knowledge of books he was in 1701 appointed assistant-keeper of the Bodleian
                    Library. There at his own option lie set himself diligently to correct the
                    catalogue, and prepared an appendix which was afterwards incorporated in the new
                    catalogue without acknowledgment. His interest in the antiquarian treasures of
                    the library induced him to refuse many valuable preferments, and in 1712 he was
                    appointed second keeper, with the stipulation made by himself that he should
                    also be janitor, so as to obtain access to the library at any time he pleased.
                    In 1714 or 1715 he was elected archi-typographus and esquire beadle of civil law
                    in the university, but, an objection being taken to his holding this office
                    along with that of second librarian, he resigned it in the November following.
                    In January 1716 he was compelled, on account of his refusal to take the oaths to
                    the Government, to resign also his appointment of librarian, but he continued to
                    reside principally at Oxford, where he occupied himself chiefly in preparing for
                    publication the works of old English authors. His injudicious and inappropriate
                    insertion of Jacobite sentiments in his prefaces awakened, however, the
                    hostility of the university magnates, and subjected him to several prosecutions.
                    He died 10th June 1735. Though Hearne was somewhat indiscriminate in his
                    antiquarian taste, and rambling and desultory in his style of composition, his
                    persevering diligence and minute accuracy enabled him to do valuable service in
                    bibliography.</p>
