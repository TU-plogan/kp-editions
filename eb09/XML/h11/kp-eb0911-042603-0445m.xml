                    inherited the estates of the countess of Purgstall (in Styria), that he received
                    the title Baron von Hammer-Purgstall, by which he is generally known. His youth
                    and early manhood were passed in the Levant, where he bent all his energies to
                    the task of improving his acquaintance with Oriental literature, in which as
                    early as 1796 he proved his interest by the translation of a Turkish poem. He
                    did not again come forward as an author till 1804, when his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia of Oriental Learning</hi> appeared, a work whose ambitious
                    character was so diffidently felt by its author that he feared to put his name
                    to it. From that time there was little pause in his literary productiveness. For
                    fifty years he wrote incessantly on the most diverse subjects, and his works
                    were composed in most of the languages of Europe. He published numerous texts
                    and translations of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish authors; compiled histories of
                    Persian poetry, Turkish poetry, and Arabic literature; brought the poems of
                    Hâfiz, Mutanebbi, Baki, and Ibn-el-Fâridh within the reach of European readers;
                    published travels in Turkey and Austria; wrote the history of the Tatar races,
                    the Krim Khans, the Golden Horde, the Russians, and the Ottoman Turks; formed a
                    biographical gallery of Eastern celebrities; put forth theories about every
                    possible subject in the wide range of Oriental learning, discussing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabian Hights,</hi> Arab music, Mahometan theology, Egyptian
                    papyri, gnostic coffrets, Arabic grammar, Eastern antiquities, the sect of the
                    Assassins, the sieges of Vienna, the Knights Templars, and Spenser’s sonnets,
                    which he translated into German. Von Hammer did for Germany the same work that
                    Sir William <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n446/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0446-0427"/> Jones did for England. He showed that Oriental
                    subjects were not to be studied merely so far as they were connected with
                    biblical theology, but were a worthy object of research for their own sake. For
                    more than fifty years he persisted in introducing Eastern authors and Eastern
                    topics to the general reader, and there was a time when no Orientalist was more
                    widely known and admired. As Jules Mohl said—“C’était le doyen de la littérature
                    orientale, le premier associé que la Société (Asiatique de Paris) ait tenu à
                    l’honneur d’inscrire sur sa liste, et le plus zélé, le plus fertile, et le plus
                    célèbre des hommes qui se sont voués, de nôtres temps, à la culture des lettres
                    orientales.”</p>
                <p>It was natural that a scholar who traversed so large a field and wrote so rapidly
                    should lay himself open to the criticism of specialists, and no man was more
                    severely handled by his critics than Von Hammer, to whom Diez, for example (in
                    <hi rend="italic">Unfug und Betrug,</hi> 1815), devotes nearly 600 pages of
                    heavy abuse. Von Hammer was undoubtedly inaccurate and superficial at times; he
                    attempted more than he could possibly achieve with thoroughness, and was in the
                    habit of giving his own whimsical view of matters about which he knew next to
                    nothing; and he used to offend his critics as much by his Oriental florid style
                    and want of method as by the occasional inaccuracy of his facts and the
                    inconsequence of his deductions. But in spite of his faults he did more for
                    Oriental studies than most of his critics put together.</p>
                <p>When he was seventy-six years of age he planned a second edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia of Oriental Learning</hi>, and designed a
                    “preliminary” series of twelve volumes which should clear the ground by
                    expounding the history of Arabic literature, aud for the last seven years of his
                    life he regularly put forth his annual volume. Jules Mohl, going to see him,
                    found the old man hard at work, helped by no colleague, and disdaining the aid
                    of an amanuensis. His early travels in the Levant, and then bis busy life at
                    Vienna, where he held the post of court-interpreter, saved him from the crushing
                    influence of solitary study; and to the last he maintained his singular buoyancy
                    of mind. “C’était un homme généreux, franc jusqu’à l’imprudence, hardi,
                    bouillonnant d’esprit, aimable jusqu’à la coquetterie, doué d’une faculté de
                    travail rare, ambitieux dans les grandes et les petites choses, et d’une
                    vivacité inconcevable—vivacité qui fut la source de sa bonne et do sa mauvaise
                    fortune.” So Mohl pictured him in his address to the Société Asiatique in 1857,
                    when he recorded the death of Von Hammer on November 23, 1856, at the age of
                    eighty-two, a hard worker to the last, like his younger but greater English
                    contemporary Lane, with whom he came into collision in a friendly way on the
                    subject of the origin of <hi rend="italic">The Thousand and One Hights.</hi></p>
