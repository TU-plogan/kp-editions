                    Henry I. Tn 995 he succeeded to the duchy of Bavaria, and six years afterwards
                    went to Rome with the young emperor Otto</p>
                <p>111., to whom he rendered important services. When Otto III. died, Henry, as the
                    chief surviving representative of the house of Saxony, took possession of the
                    insignia of the empire, and was crowned German king at Mainz on the 7th of June
                    1002. Encouraged by disturbances in Germany, a rebellious party of nobles in
                    northern Italy raised Margrave Harduin of Ivrea to the throne of Lombardy; but
                    Henry advanced against them, and, like his immediate predecessors, made himself
                    master of the iron crown. His most determined enemy during the greater part of
                    his reign was Boleslaus II. of Poland. This ambitious and strong-willed prince
                    annexed Bohemia, and during the king’s absence in Italy broke into Lusatia and
                    Meissen. Henry hurried back, defeated Boleslaus in 1005, and granted Bohemia· in
                    fief to Jaromir, son of the previous duke. Boleslaus, however, continued the
                    war, which was not ended till 1018, when Henry was obliged to conclude peace on
                    terms that were much more favourable to the Poles than he would have voluntarily
                    granted. Tn the midst of this struggle he had to make war on Adalbero, his
                    wife’s brother, who seized the archbishopric of Trêves, and was protected in his
                    claim by another brother of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0700-0667"/> empress, the duke of Bavaria. Both were overcome
                    and deprived of their dignities, although Bavaria was ultimately restored to the
                    elder of the two brothers. Henry also put down rebellions in Flanders and
                    Meissen, and he concluded an important treaty with Rudolf III. of Burgundy,
                    whereby after Rudolf’s death the country was to be united to Germany. In 1013
                    Henry went for the second time to Italy, where Harduin had again raised himself
                    to the throne. The usurper was displaced, and in 1014 Henry was crowned emperor
                    at Rome by Benedict VIII., whom he had confirmed in the papal see in opposition
                    to the antipope Gregory. At the request of Benedict the emperor returned to
                    Italy in 1022 in order to drive back the Greeks, who were steadily pressing
                    northwards. In this enterprise he associated himself with the Normans, who thus
                    became one of the most important factors in the political life of Italy. Henry’s
                    health, which was always feeble, rapidly declined after this third visit to his
                    southern dominions, and in 1024 he died. He was canonized by Pope Eugenius III.,
                    and at a later time his wife, Cunigunde, was also ranked among the saints. It
                    was natural that they should be thus honoured, not only because of their fervent
                    piety, but because the church has rarely had a more splendid benefactor than
                    Henry 11., whose ruling policy was to balance the power of the great nobles by
                    increasing that of the spiritual princes. He also founded the bishopric of
                    Bamberg, which was placed under the immediate jurisdiction of the pope, and to
                    which he left by will all his treasures and his magnificent allodial
                    possessions.</p>
