                    to the east of his native duchy. Otto, who died in 912, appointed Henry his
                    successor, not only as duke of Saxony but as lord of Thuringia and part of
                    Franconia. Conrad I., stimulated by certain ecclesiastical advisers whom Henry’s
                    independent bearing towards the church had deeply offended, resisted the claims
                    of the young duke; but lie was ultimately left in possession of all the lands
                    his father had ruled. After Conrad’s death Henry was chosen king by the
                    Franconian and Saxon nobles, and he had not much difficulty in securing the
                    acquiescence of the rest of Germany. For some years Lotharingia or Lorraine had
                    held an uncertain position between the kingdoms of the East and the West Franks,
                    as Germany and France were then called; but at this time Duke Giselbert, who was
                    an old friend of Henry, quarrelled with Charles the Simple, and transferred his
                    allegiance to the German king. For eight centuries afterwards Lorraine remained
                    a part of Germany. From the time of Louis the Child, Germany had been tormented
                    by the Hungarians, who were still a savage race, and who had the advantage of
                    fighting on horseback while the Germans resisted them on foot. In 922 an
                    Hungarian chief was captured, and bis people were compelled to purchase his
                    release by agreeing to a nine years' truce, on condition that Henry should
                    during this time pay an annual tribute. In the northern districts the Germans
                    had hitherto lived for the most part in small villages or on separate
                    settlements, after the fashion described in the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>
                    of Tacitus. Henry, perceiving that so long as they continued thus exposed to
                    attack they could never be safe, began the building of cities throughout Saxony
                    and Thuringia, and in the other duchies his example was extensively followed. He
                    also trained his vassals to meet the enemy on horseback, thus giving a strong
                    impetus to the movement which resulted in the institutions of chivalry. When his
                    arrangements were complete he tried his new force in a contest with the Danes
                    and with some Slavonic tribes, whom he utterly defeated. In 933 the Hungarians
                    demanded as usual the tribute which had till then been punctually paid, and when
                    it was refused invaded Thuringia with a great army. Henry twice defeated them,
                    and they were so overwhelmed by this misfortune that they did not enter Germany
                    for some years, and were never again seen in the northern duchies. Having thus
                    broken the power of all the chief enemies of his country, Henry took precautions
                    for the future by establishing the marches of Schleswig, of Meissen, and perhaps
                    of Brandenburg. In his home government he acted with great caution and judgment.
                    The dukes had become so powerful that there was some danger of their altogether
                    overshadowing the throne. Instead of directly meeting this peril by forcing them
                    into submission, as was afterwards done by his son Otto, he attached them to his
                    interests by confirming them in many of their rights and by acting as a mediator
                    in their disputes. Towards the close of his life his position was so secure that
                    he resolved to go to Rome and claim the imperial crown. In the midst of his
                    preparations he died in 936 at Memleben, and was buried in St Peter’s church at
                    Quedlinburg. He was one of the wisest and most energetic of the German kings,
                    and through his encouragement of municipal life, and his powerful defence of
                    Germany against her foreign enemies, his reign marks an epoch of the highest
                    importance in early mediaeval history. By his first wife, Hatburg, he had a son
                    Thankmar, who gave Otto</p>
                <p>1., his successor, much trouble. After she was put away he married Matilda, the
                    daughter of a Saxon count; and the gentle and noble character of this lady, who
                    was universally beloved, was of essential service to him in his rule.</p>
