                    maculatum</hi> of botanists, a biennial umbelliferous plant, found wild in many
                    parts of Great Britain and Ireland, where it occurs in waste places, on
                    hedge-banks, and by the borders of fields, and which is also widely spread over
                    Europe and temperate Asia, and naturalized in the cultivated districts of North
                    and South America. It is an erect branching plant, growing from 3 to 6 feet
                    high, and emitting a disagreeable smell, like that of mice. The stems are
                    hollow, smooth, somewhat glaucous, green, spotted with dull dark purple, as
                    alluded to in the specific name, <hi rend="italic">maculatum.</hi> The
                    root-leaves have long furrowed footstalks, sheathing the stem at the base, and
                    are large, triangular in outline, and repeatedly divided or compound, the
                    ultimate and very numerous segments being small, ovate, and deeply incised at
                    the edge. These leaves generally perish after the growth of the flowering stem,
                    which takes place in the second year, while the leaves produced on the stem
                    become gradually smaller upwards. The branches are all terminated by compound

                    general involucres consisting of several, the partial ones of about three short
                    lanceolate bracts, the latter being usually turned towards the outside of the
                    umbel. The flowers are succeeded by broadly ovate fruits, the mericarps
                    (half-fruits) having five ribs which, when mature, are waved or crenated; there
                    are no vitt'ae or oil-cysts; and when cut across the albumen is seen to be
                    deeply furrowed on the inner face, so as to exhibit in section a reniform
                    outline. The fruits when triturated with a solution of caustic potash evolve a
                    most unpleasant odour.</p>
                <p>Hemlock is a virulent poison, but it varies much in potency according to the
                    conditions under which it has grown, and the season or stage of growth at which
                    it is gathered. In the first year the leaves have little power, nor in the
                    second are their properties developed until the flowering period, at which time,
                    or later on when the fruits are fully grown, the plant should be gathered. The
                    wild plant growing in exposed situations is to be preferred to garden-grown
                    samples, and is more potent in dry warm summers than in those which are dull and
                    moist.</p>
                <p>The poisonous property of hemlock resides chiefly in the alkaloid <hi
                    rend="italic">conine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">conia</hi> which is found in both
                    the fruits anl the leaves, though in exceedingly small proportions in the
                    latter. Conine resembles nicotine in its deleterious action, but is much less
                    powerful. No chemical antidote for it is known. The plant also yields a second
                    less poisonous crystallizable base called <hi rend="italic">conhydrine,</hi>
                    which may be converted into conine by the abstraction of the elements of
                    water.</p>
                <p>When collected for medicinal purposes, for which both leaves and fruits are used,
                    the former should be gathered at the time the plant is in full blossom, while
                    the latter are said to possess the greatest degree of energy just before they
                    ripen. The fruits are the chief source whence conine is prepared. The principal
                    forms in which hemlock is employed are the extract and juice of hemlock, hemlock
                    poultice, anl the tincture of hemlock fruits. Large doses produce vertigo,
                    nauseι, and paralysis; but in smaller quantities, administered by skilful hands,
                    it has a sedative action on the nerves. It has also some reputation as an
                    alterative and resolvent, and as an anodyne.</p>
                <p>The acrid narcotic properties of the plant render it of some importance that one
                    should be able to identify it, the more so as some of the compound-leaved
                    umbellifers, which have a general similarity of appearance to it, form wholesome
                    food for man and animals. Not only is this knowledge desirable to prevent the
                    poisonous plant being detrimentdly used in place of the wholesome one; it is
                    equally important in the opposite case, namely, to prevent the inert being
                    substituted for the remedial agent. The plant with which hemlock is most likely
                    to be confounded is the <hi rend="italic">Anthriscus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sylvestris,</hi> or cow-parsley, the leaves of which are freely eaten by cattle
                    and rabbits; this plant, like the hemlock, has spotted stems but they are hairy,
                    not hairless; it has much-divided leaves of the same general form, but they are
                    downy and aromatic, not smooth and nauseous when bruised; the fruit of the
                    Mni7ir⅛sct(s, besides, is linear-oblong and not ovate.</p>
