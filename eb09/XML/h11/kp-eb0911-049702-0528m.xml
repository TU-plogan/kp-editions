                    practically forming portions of one town. By railway Hartlepool is 10 miles and
                    West Hartlepool 12 miles N.N.E. of Stockton-on-Tees. The principal buildings of
                    Hartlepool are the parish church, in the Early English style, dedicated to St
                    Hilda; the borough hall, in the Italian style, erected in 1866, behind which
                    there is a large market; the Durham militia artillery depot, erected in 1861;
                    the temperance hall, the mechanics’ institute, and the theatre. New schools for
                    boys, girls, and infants have been erected by the school board; and Prissick’s
                    schools, founded in 1826, have been constituted elementary schools under the
                    Education Act of 1870. Among the other schools are Crook’s endowed school,
                    founded in 1755, and the school in connexion with Henry Smith’s charity. The
                    town was originally surrounded by walls, of which considerable remains may yet
                    be seen. It is well supplied with water. The principal buildings of West
                    Hartlepool are the athenaeum<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0529-0498"/>, the town-hall, the exchange, in the Gothic
                    style, erected in 1875 at a cost of £10,000, the mechanics’ institute, and the
                    theatre. A Government school of art was established in 1874. The manufactures of
                    the two towns are very much alike: they possess iron-works, puddling furnaces,
                    brass and iron foundries, engine and boiler works, sawmills, cement works, tile
                    works, and breweriee. With the addition of the new docks, completed in 1879, the
                    dock area between the towns is 86 acres, besides which there are ponds with an
                    area of about 80 acres. Considerable difficulty has been found in maintaining a
                    sufficient depth of water at the harbour bar of Hartlepool, and although the use
                    of a powerful dredge has been so far effectual, it is probable that the only
                    adequate remedy will be the extension of the breakwater. A large lighthouse for
                    guiding the entrance of vessels was erected in 1846-47 at a cost of nearly
                    £6000. In the shipping returns Hartlepool and West Hartlepool are classed
                    together as one port; in 1878 the number of vessels that entered the port,
                    including those in ballast, was 4640, with a tonnage of 885,762; the number that
                    cleared 4662, with a tonnage of 992,370. For the five years ending 1878 the
                    average number of vessels that entered was 5371, with a tonnage of 975,039,
                    while 5447 cleared, with a tonnage of 1,005,740. The principal exports are coal,
                    coke, machines, and cotton, linen and woollen goods, and the principal imports,
                    timber, cattle, corn, provisions, and wool. The fisheries are considerable. The
                    town is much resorted to in summer for sea-bathing. Several caverns, which may
                    be explored for nearly fifty yards, have been excavated by the sea out of the
                    rocks on the shore of the peninsula. The parliamentary borough of the
                    Hartlepools has an area of 7267 acres, and besides Hartlepool includes Stranton
                    (in which parish West Hartlepool is situated), Seaton Carew, and Throston. Its
                    population in 1861 was 27,475, and in 1871, 38,203. The population of the
                    municipal borough of Hartlepool in 1861 was 12,245, and in 1871, 13,166; and the
                    population of Stranton in 1861 was 13,601, and in 1871, 22,166.</p>
                <p>The name Hartlepool means the pool or lake of Hart. The town grew up round a
                    monastery which had St Hilda as its abbess, and the harbour was of some
                    consequence as early as 1171. In the 13th century Hartlepool belonged to the
                    Bruces of Annandale in Scotland, the progenitors of the royal family of that
                    name. The town was erected into a borough about 1200. After Bruce ascended the
                    Scottish throne his English possessions were forfeited, and Hartlepool was
                    granted to the Cliffords. It suffered severely from the Scots in 1312, and again
                    in 1315 after the battle of Bannockburn. During the great northern rebellion in
                    the reign of Elizabeth it was seized by the insurgents. In 1644 it was taken by
                    the Scottish army, and it remained in the possession of Scotland till 1647. West
                    Hartlepool was founded in 1844 by Mr R. W. Jackson, the first M.P. for the
                    borough of the Hartlepools. Its first dock was constructed in 1847, after which
                    it increased with great rapidity.</p>
