                    suppose that under him the powers of the princes would be exposed to no great
                    danger. When he came to the throne Bohemia was subject to Henry of Carinthia,
                    whom the people extremely disliked. The king at once displaced him, and enriched
                    his own family by granting Bohemia, at the request of the Bohemians themselves,
                    to his son John, whose claims were rendered secure by his marriage with
                    Elizabeth, the daughter of Wenceslaus II. For some time no German king had
                    sought the imperial crown; but Henry, who was of an imaginative temperament,
                    could not forget the splendid dignities to which the wearer of the crown of
                    Germany was entitled. He therefore resolved to revive the traditions which had
                    begun to die out, and with a view to this result did what he could to compose
                    the differences of the nobles and to gain their allegiance. At this time there
                    were signs of rapid progress among the cities, and had a strong king devoted
                    himself to their interests, he might have established his throne on a solid
                    basis. Unfortunately the easiest way in which Henry could obtain immediate power
                    for his plans in Italy was to ally himself with the princes against the cities;
                    and this was in most instances the course which he adopted. His visit to Italy
                    was looked forward to with eagerness by the Ghibellins, whose hopes were
                    expressed in words of glowing eloquence by Dante. He held aloof at first from
                    both the great parties in the state, and was in consequence liked by neither. In
                    1312 he was crowned emperor in Rome, having previously received the iron crown
                    in Milan. But while he was in Rome, Robert of Naples was there also with a
                    strong army, and in order to obtain adequate support it was necessary for Henry
                    to declare himself on the side of the Ghibellins. He then resolved to conquer
                    Naples, but while advancing on this expedition he died at Buonconvento, on the
                    24th of August 1313. It was generally believed at the time that he had been
                    poisoned by a Dominican monk, but this is not proved by satisfactory
                    evidence.</p>
