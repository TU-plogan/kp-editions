                    travelled in France, Holland, and England. He was made privy chamber councillor
                    (Geheim-Kammerrath) and raised to the rank of count in 1778; but a private
                    quarrel with the prince of Wales compelled him four years afterwards to give up
                    his appointments in Hanover and seek a new career. In 1787 he received the
                    office of president of the board of domains (Kammercollegium) in Brunswick; and
                    he was entrusted with the duty of delivering to Frederick William II. of Prussia
                    the will of Frederick the Great, who had deposited it with the duke of
                    Brunswick. Frederick William II. was so impressed by Hardenberg’s appearance and
                    character that in 1790 he recommended him as a minister to the margrave of
                    Anspach and Baireuth. These principalities being united to Prussia in 1791,
                    Hardenberg was appointed a Prussian cabinet minister, but continued to perform
                    his duties as chief administrator of the new province. In the war with the
                    French republic he acted as minister of war, and in- 1795 signed on behalf of
                    Prussia the treaty of peace concluded at Basel. When Frederick William III.
                    mounted the throne in 1797, Hardenberg was transferred from Anspach-Baireuth to
                    Berlin, where he received high offices in the cabinet, being also soon
                    afterwards nominated chief of the departments for Magdeburg and Halberstadt, for
                    Westphalia, and for Neuchâtel. At this time the foreign policy of Prussia was
                    determined by Haugwitz, who was on all occasions subservient to Napoleon. When
                    in 1803 Prussian interests seemed to be threatened by the French occupation of
                    Hanover, Haugwitz fell into disrepute, and in the following year his place at
                    the head of the cabinet was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0504-0473"/> taken by Hardenberg. The latter was anxious to
                    maintain peace, but when in 1805 Napoleon’s troops marched through Anspach he
                    strongly protested, and entered into a convention with Russia. The victory of
                    the French at Austerlitz, however, made it difficult for Prussia to proceed to
                    hostilities; and on the 15th December 1805 Haugwitz signed a convention with
                    Napoleon, whereby in return for Hanover Prussia conceded Anspach, Cleves, and
                    Neuchâtel to the French. Hardenberg then retired, and Haugwitz returned to
                    power. The policy of Haugwitz was exceedingly unpopular, and led to the war in
                    which his country was prostrated at the feet of Napoleon. After the battle of
                    Jena Hardenberg undertook the office of foreign minister; but when the treaty of
                    Tilsit was signed he withdrew and watched from a distance the vigorous and
                    enlightened efforts of Stein to restore new life to the fallen and humiliated
                    state. Stein being compelled to retire in 1810, Hardenberg was recognized as the
                    only possible successor of the great minister; and he amply justified the
                    confidence with which he was honoured. The circumstances of the time did not
                    admit of his pursuing an independent foreign policy; but he steadily prepared
                    for the inevitable struggle with France by carrying out Stein’s far-reaching
                    schemes of social and political reorganization. The military system was
                    completely reformed, serfdom was abolished, municipal institutions were
                    fostered, the civil service was thrown open to all classes, and great attention
                    was devoted to the educational needs of every section of the community. In the
                    war of liberation Hardenberg was one of those who did most to stimulate the
                    patriotic enthusiasm not only of the Prussians but of all Germans; and so
                    important were his services that on the 3d June 1814, after he had signed the
                    first treaty of Paris, he was raised to the rank of a Fürst or Prince. He
                    accompanied the allied sovereigns to London, was one of the chief
                    plenipotentiaries at the congress of Vienna, and took a leading part in the
                    negotiations which led to the second treaty of Paris. After the restoration of
                    peace he retained his place at the head of the Prussian cabinet, but his conduct
                    of affairs was no longer marked by energy and foresight. He was accused of being
                    too submissive to the papacy, and, although a man of liberal sentiments, he had
                    not the courage to resist his royal master’s dislike of constitutional
                    government. He died at Genoa, November 26, 1822.</p>
                <p>Hardenberg wrote memoirs of the time between 1801 and the conclusion of the
                    treaty of Tilsit, and entrusted them before his death to his friend Scholl, a
                    councillor of state. They were sealed by Frederick William III. and placed in
                    the state archives, with directions that they should not be published until
                    after the lapse of fifty years. At the end of this time they were entrusted by
                    Prince Bismarck to Leopold von Ranke, who issued them accompanied by a biography
                    of the author <hi rend="italic">(Denkwürdigkeiten des Staatskanzlers Fürsten von
