                    ruins of the latter city, not only because they are smaller in extent and of
                    less obvious interest, but also because they are more difficult of access. The
                    history of their discovery and exploration, aud the artistic and literary relics
                    which they have yielded, are worthy, however, of particular notice. The small
                    part of the city which has been restored to the light of day in the spot called
                    <hi rend="italic">Cli scavi nuovi</hi> (the new excavations) was discovered in
                    the present century. But the more important works were executed in the last
                    century; and of the buildings then explored at a great depth, by means of
                    tunnels, none are visible except the theatre, the orchestra of which lies 85
                    feet below the surface of the soil.</p>
                <p>The brief notices of the classical writers inform us that Herculaneum <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> was a small city of Campania between Neapolis and
                    Pompeii, that it was situated between two streams at the foot of Vesuvius on a
                    hill overlooking the sea, and that its harbour was at all seasons safe. With
                    regard to its earlier history nothing is known. The account given by Dionysius
                    repeats a tradition which was most natural for a city bearing the name of
                    Hercules. Strabo follows up the topographical data with a few brief historical
                    statements— <hi rend="italic">*OσκoL ειχov κai τaυτηv</hi><hi rend="italic">καί

                    that of the domination of the Etruscans in Campania, <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> as well as the other questions recently discussed in regard to the origin
                    of Pompeii, which might have an intimate relation with our subject, it is
                    sufficient here to say that the first historical record about Herculaneum has
                    been handed down by Livy (viii. 25), where he relates in what manner the city
                    fell under the power of Rome during the Samnite wars. It remained faithful to
                    Rome for a long time, but it joined the Italian allies in the Social War. Having
                    submitted anew in June of the year 665 (88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), it
                    appears to have been less severely treated than Pompeii, and to have escaped the
                    imposition of a colony of Sulla’s veterans, although Zumpt has suspected the
                    contrary <hi rend="italic">(Comm. Epigr.,</hi> i. 259). It afterwards became a
                    municipium, and enjoyed great prosperity towards the close of the republic and
                    in the earlier times of the empire, since many noble families of Rome selected
                    this pleasant spot for the construction of splendid villas, one of which indeed
                    belonged to the imperial house (Seneca, <hi rend="italic">De Ira,</hi> iii.). By
                    means of the Via Campana it had easy communication northwestward with Neapolis,
                    Puteoli, and Capua, and thence by the Via Appia with Rome; and southwards with
                    Pompeii and Nuceria, and thence with Lucania and the Bruttii. In the year 63 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it suffered terribly from the earthquake which,
                    according to Seneca, “Campaniam nunquam securam hujus mali, indemnem tamen, et
                    toties defunctam metu magna strage vastavit. Nam et Herculanensis oppidi pars
                    ruit dubieque stant etiam quae relicta sunt” <hi rend="italic">(Nat.
                    Qucest.,</hi> vi. I). Hardly had Herculaneum completed the restoration of some
                    of its principal buildings (c∕. Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">I. N.,</hi> n. 2384;
                    <hi rend="italic">Catalogo</hi><hi rend="italic">del</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Museo</hi><hi rend="italic">Nazionale di Napoli,</hi> n. 1151) when it fell
                    beneath the great eruption of the year 79, described by Pliny the younger <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> vi. 16, 20), in which Pompeii also was destroyed with
                    other flourishing cities of Campania. According to the commonest account, on the
                    23d August of that year Pliny the elder, who had command of the Roman fleet at
                    Misenum, set out to render assistance to the soldiers stationed at Retina, near
                    Herculaneum, as there was no escape except by sea, but, the little harbour
                    having been on a sudden filled up so as to be inaccessible, he was obliged to
                    abandon to their fate those people of Herculaneum and Retina who had managed to
                    flee from their houses, overwhelmed in a moment by the material poured forth by
                    Vesuvius. But the text of Pliny the younger, where this account is given, has
                    been subjected to various interpretations; and from the comparison of other
                    classical testimonies and the study of the excavations it has been concluded
                    that it is impossible to determine the date of the catastrophe, though there are
                    satisfactory arguments to justify the statement that the event took place in the
                    autumn. The opinion that immediately after the first outbreak of Vesuvius a
                    torrent of lava was ejected over Herculaneum was refuted by the scholars of the
                    last century, and their refutation has been recently confirmed by Beulé <hi
                    rend="italic">(Le Drame du Vésuve,</hi> p. 240 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> And if
                    the last recensions of the passage quoted from Pliny are to be accepted, Retina
                    is not the name of the harbour described by Beulé <hi rend="italic">(ib.,</hi>
                    p. 122, 247), but the name of a lady who had implored succour, the wife of

                    shore, moreover, according to the new and accurate studies of the engineer
                    Michele Ruggiero, director of the excavations, was not altered by the causes
                    adduced by Beulé (p. 125), but by a simpler event. “It is certain,” he says <hi

                    districts between the south and west, and those between the south and east, were
                    overwhelmed in two quite different modes. From Torre Annunziata (which is
                    believed to be the site of the ancient Oplontii) to San Giovanni a Teduccio, for
                    a distance of about 9 miles, there flowed a muddy eruption which in Herculaneum
                    and the neighbouring places, where it was most abundant, raised the level of the
                    country more than 65 feet. The matter transported consisted of soil of various
                    kinds,— sand, ashes, fragments of lava, pozzolana, and whitish pumice, enclosing
                    grains of uncalcined lime, similar in every respect to those of Pompeii. In the
                    part of Herculaneum already excavated, the corridors in the upper portions of
                    the theatre are compactly filled, up to the head of the arches, with pozzolana
                    and pumice transformed into tuff (which proves that the formation of this stone
                    may take place in a comparatively short time). Tuff is also <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> A fragment of L. Sisenna calls it “Oppidum tumulo in
                    excelso loco propter mare, parvis moenibus, inter duas fluvias, infra Vesuvium
                    collocatum” (lib. iv., fragm. 53, Peters). Of one of these rivers this historian
                    again makes mention in the passage where probably he related the capture of
                    Herculaneum by Minatius Magius and T. Didius (Velleius Paterculus, ii. 16).

                <p>found in the lowest part of the city towards the sea in front of the few houses
                    that have been discovered; and in the very high banks that surround them, as
                    also in the lowest part of the theatre, there are plainly to be seen earth,
                    sand, ashes, fragments of lava and pumice, with little distinction of strata,
                    almost always confused and mingled together, and varying from spot to spot in
                    degree of compactness. It is clear that this immense congeries of earth and
                    stones could not flow in a dry state over those 5 miles of country (in the
                    beginning very steep, and at intervals almost level), where certainly it would
                    have been arrested and all accumulated in a mound; but it must have been borne
                    along by a great quantity of water, the effects of which may be distinctly
                    recognized, not only in the filling and choking up even of the most narrow,
                    intricate, and remote parts of the buildings, but also in the formation of the
                    tuff, in which water has so great a share; for it cannot be supposed that enough
                    of it has filtered through so great a depth of earth. The torrent ran in a few
                    hours to the sea, and formed that shallow or lagoon called by Pliny <hi
                    rend="italic">Suδitum</hi><hi rend="italic">Vadum,</hi> which prevented the
                    ships approaching the shores.” Hence it is that, while many made their escape
                    from Pompeii (which was overwhelmed by the fall of the small stones and
                    afterwards by the rain of ashes), comparatively few can have managed to escape
                    from Herculaneum, and these, according to the interpretation given to the
                    inscription preserved in the National Museum (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">I.
                    H.,</hi> n. 2455), found shelter in the neighbouring city of Neapolis, where
                    they inhabited a quarter called that of the buried city (Suetonius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Titus,</hi> 8). The name of Herculaneum, which for some time
                    remained attached to the site of the disaster, is mentioned in the later
                    itineraries; but in the course of the Middle Ages all recollection of it
                    perished.</p>
                <p>In 1709, while Prince EIbeuf of the house of Lorraine, in command of the armies
                    of Charles VI., was seeking crashed marble to make plaster for his new villa
                    near Portici, he learned from the peasants that there were in the vicinity some
                    pits from which they not only quarried excellent marble, but had extracted many
                    statues in the course of years (see Jorio, <hi rend="italic">Notiziα degli scavi
                    d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ercolano,</hi> Naples, 1827). In 1738, while Colonel
                    D. Rocco de Alcubierre was directing the works for the construction of the
                    “Reali Delizie” at Portici, he received orders from Charles III. to begin
                    excavations on the spot where it had been reported to the king that the Elbeuf
                    statues had been found. At first it was believed that a temple was being
                    explored, but afterwards the inscriptions proved that the building was a
                    theatre. This discovery excited the greatest commotion among the scholars of all
                    nations; and many of them hastened to Naples to see the marvellous statues of
                    the Balbi and the paintings on the walls. But everything was kept private, as
                    the Government wished to reserve to itself the right of illustrating the
                    monuments. First of all Monsignor Bayardi was brought from Rome and commissioned
                    to write about the antiquities which were being collected in the museum at
                    Portici under the care of Camillo Paderni, and when it was recognized that the
                    prelate had not sufficient learning, and by the progress of the excavations
                    other most abundant material was accumulated, about which at once scholars and
                    courtiers were anxious to be informed, Bernardo Tanucci, having become secretary
                    of state in 1755, founded the Accademia Ercolanese, which published the
                    principal works on Herculaneum <hi rend="italic">(Le Bitture</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cd i Bronzi d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ercolano,</hi> 8 vols.,

                    was far from being worthy of unqualified praise, and consequently their work did
                    not always meet the approval of the best scholars who had the opportunity of
                    seeing the monuments. Among these was Winckelmann, who in his letters gave ample
                    notices of the excavations and the antiquities which he was able to visit on
                    several occasions. Other notices were furnished by Gori, <hi rend="italic"

                    continued for more than forty years (1738- 1780), were executed at first under
                    the immediate direction of Alcubierre (1738-1741), and then with the assistance
                    of the engineers Rorro and Bardet (1741-1745), Carl Weber (1750-1764), and
                    Francesco La Vega. After the death of Alcubierre (1780), the last-named was
                    appointed director-in-chief of the excavations; but from that time the
                    investigations at Herculaneum were intermitted, and the researches at Pompeii
                    were vigorously carried on. Resumed in 1827, the excavations at Herculaneum were
                    shortly after suspended, nor were the new attempts made in 1866 with the money
                    bestowed by King Victor Emmanuel attended with success, being impeded by the
                    many dangers arising from the houses built overhead. The meagreness of the
                    results obtained by the occasional works executed in the present century, and
                    the fact that the investigators were unfortunate enough to strike upon places
                    already explored, gave rise to the opinion that the whole area of the city had
                    been crossed by tunnels in the time of Charles III. and in the. beginning of the
                    reign of Ferdinand IV. And although it is recognized that the works had not been
                    prosecuted with the caution, that they required, yet in view of the serious
                    difficulties that would attend the collection of the little that had been left
                    by the first excavators, every proposal for new investigations has been
                    abandoned. But in a memoir which Professor Barnabei read in the Reale Accademia
                    dei Lincei <hi rend="italic">(Attidella R. Ac.,</hi> series iii., vol. ii. p.
                    751), he undertook to prove that the researches made by the Government in the
                    last century did not cover any great area. The antiquities excavated at
                    Herculaneum in the last century form a collection of the highest scientific and
                    artistic value. There are marble statues of astonishing art and perfect
                    preservation, of which it is sufficient to mention the two equestrian statues of

                    ii. pl. xxxviii.-ix.) and the so-called statue of Aristides. With the exception
                    of a few pieces, nearly all the great bronzes of the museum belong to
                    Herculaneum. It is thence that we have obtained the reposing Hennes, the drunken
                    Silenus, the sleeping Faunus, the dancing girls, the bust called Plato’s, that
                    believed to be Seneca’s, the two quoit-throwers or discoboli, and so many
                    master-pieces more, figured by the academicians in their volume on the bronzes.
                    Mural paintings of extraordinary beauty were also discovered, such as those that
                    represent Theseus after the slaughter of the Minotaur (Helbig, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wandgemälde,</hi> Leipsic, 1878, No. 1214) and Chiron teaching Achilles the art
                    of playing on the lyre <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> No. 1291). Notwithstanding
                    the recent discoveries of the stupendous paintings in the gardens of the Villa
                    Farnesina on the banks of the Tiber, the monochromes of Herculaneum remain among
                    our finest specimens of the exquisite taste and consummate skill displayed by
                    the ancient artists. Among the best preserved is Leto and Niobe, which has been
                    the subject of so many studies and so many publications <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.</hi>, No. 1706). There is also a considerable number of lapidary
                    inscriptions edited in vol. ii. of the epigraphic collection of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cat. del</hi><hi rend="italic">Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">Naz. di
                    Napoli.</hi></p>
                <p>But all these antiquities do not seem to afford adequate support for the opinion
                    of those who, pointing out that those marvels were found for the most part in
                    two or three buildings, conclude that similar riches would be found in other
                    houses if the excavations were resumed. For their contention is that Herculaneum
                    was not only a much greater city than Pompeii, but had attained a more exquisite
                    Greek culture, because a large body of the Greek colonists expelled from the
                    cities of Southern Italy had settled there either through their own numerical
                    strength or through the favour of the Samnite confederation, whose conquests had
                    placed it above all alarm at the advance of a·n already vanquished race. But in
                    support of these assertions, more proof seems to be required than the fact that
                    only two Samnite inscriptions have been found in Herculaneum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Fabretti, <hi rend="italic">Glossarium Italicum,</hi> No. 2784, 2784
                    <hi rend="italic">bis),</hi> whilst at Pompeii they have been met with in great
                    numbers; since, if it is borne in mind that in a later age Herculaneum was a
                    municipium as well as Pompeii, and had the same political life, we must seek
                    another explanation of the circumstance that in Pompeii there are so many
                    inscriptions relative to municipal affairs, while in Herculaneum there are none.
                    On the other hand, the classical tradition does not force us to believe that the
                    city was so small as the academicians held it to be. The plan published in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio Isagogica</hi> represents nine <hi rend="italic"
                    >insulae</hi> or blocks, each having the proportions of the sides of the Villa
                    Suburbana or Villa Ercolanese discovered in the place called the wood of St
                    Agostino. It was believed that this place was in the suburb, because it was
                    divided from the rest of the inhabited area by a narrow valley formed by the
                    washing of the rain <hi rend="italic">(Diss. Isag.,</hi> p. 30). If this was
                    correctly determined, the same cannot be said of the circuit of the city, as the
                    walls have not been discovered. Nor are the investigations sufficient to fix
                    precisely the ancient shore line. The discovery of the Villa Suburbana
                    contributed to magnify the greatness of Herculaneum; within its walls were
                    collected statues of marble and of bronze, and the famous library, of which,
                    counting both entire and fragmentary volumes, 1803 papyri have been preserved.
                    Among the nations which took the greatest interest in the discovery of the
                    Herculaneum library, the most honourable rank belongs to England, which sent
                    Bishop Hayter and other scholars to Naples to solicit the publication of the
                    volumes. Of the 341 papyri which have been unrolled, 195 have been published <hi

                    Colotes, Chrysippus, Carniscus, and Philodemus. The names of the authors <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"

                    library belonged to a person whose principal study was the Epicurean philosophy.
                    But of the great master of this school only a few works have been found. Of his
                    treatise ∏epl <hi rend="italic">φυσeωs,</hi> divided into 37 books, it is known
                    that there were three copies in the library <hi rend="italic">{Coll,
                    alt.,'vi.).</hi> Quite recently Professor Comparetti, studying the first
                    fasciculus of volume xi. of the same new collection, recognized most important
                    fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> of Epicunis, and these he
                    published in 1879 in Nos. ix. and xi. of the <hi rend="italic">Ri vista di
                    Filologia ed Istru∙ zione</hi><hi rend="italic">classica,</hi> Turin. Even the
                    otherauthors above mentioned are but poor! y represented, with the exception of
                    Philodemus, of whom 26 different treatises have been recognized. But all these
                    philosophic discussions, belonging for the most part to an author less than
                    secondary among the Epicureans, fall short of the high expectations excited by
                    the first discovery of the library. Among the many volumes unrolled only a few
                    are of historical importance,—that edited by Bücheier, which treats of the
                    philosophers of the academy <hi rend="italic">{Acad, phil. index Hercul.,</hi>
                    Greifswald, 1859), and that edited by Comparetti, which deals with the Stoics
                    (“Papiro ercolanese inedito,” in <hi rend="italic">Rivista di Fil. cd, 1st.
                    class,</hi> anno iii., fasc. x.-xii.). To appreciate the value of the volumes
                    unrolled but not yet published (for 146 vols, were only copied and not printed),
                    the student must await the appearance of Comparetti’s paper, “Relazione sui
                    papiri ercolanesi, read in the Reale Accad. dei Lincei, which will appear in the
                    “Proceedings” of the academy for 1879. Contributions of some value have been
                    made to the study of Herculaneum fragments by Spengel (“Die Hercul. Rollen,” in
                    <hi rend="italic">Philologus,</hi> 1863, suppl. vol.), and Gompertz <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hercul.</hi><hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi> Leipsic, 1865-66, <hi

                    rend="italic">Gymn.,</hi> 1867-1872). There are in the library some volumes
                    written in Latin, which, according to Boot <hi rend="italic">{Notice</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur les manuscrits trouvés à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Herculaneum,</hi> Amsterdam, 1845), were found tied up in a bundle apart. Of
                    these we know 18, but they are all so damaged that hardly any of them can be
                    deciphered. One with verses relating to the battle of Actium is believed to
                    belong to a poem of Rabirius. The numerical preponderance of the works of
                    Philodemus led some people to believe that this had been the library of that
                    philosopher. But quite recently Professor Comparetti has come to the conclusion
                    that the library was collected by Lucius Piso Caesoninus (see <hi rend="italic"

                    Comparetti is furnished by the epigraphic fragment edited by De Petra <hi
                    rend="italic">{ib.,</hi> p. 251 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>); but Dr Mau takes up
                    a counter position,—he is the first to do so,—and shows that the fragment must
                    have another interpretation <hi rend="italic">{Bull. Inst, di Corr. Arch.,</hi>
                    1880). Professor De Petra has also published the official notices upon the
                    antiquities unearthed in the sumptuous villa, giving the plan executed by Weber
                    and recovered by chance by the director of excavations, Michele Ruggiero. This
                    plan, which is here reproduced from De Petra’s monograph,<note anchored="true"

                    executed in 1747, when the excavations were not completed. And even for the

                    >Suburbana</hi> the necessity for further studies makes itself felt, since there

                    (London, vol. x. ) by Camillo Paderni, conservator of the Portici Museum. It is
                    hoped, therefore, that among the papers recovered by Ruggiero there may be
                    others which will shed light on what remains dark in the topography of the
                    buried city.</p>
