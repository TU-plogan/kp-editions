                    at the northern end of the Ceramic Gulf or Gulf of Cos. It originally occupied
                    only the small island of Zephyria, close to the shore, but in course of time
                    this island was united to the mainland and the city extended so as to
                    incorporate Salmacis, an older town of the Leleges and Carians. * About the
                    foundation of Halicarnassus various traditions were current; but they agree in
                    the main point as to its being a Dorian colony, and the figures on its coins,
                    such as the head of Medusa or Minerva, the head of Neptune, or the trident, give
                    support to the statement that the mother cities were Troezen and Argos. The
                    inhabitants appear to have accepted as the legendary founder Anthes, mentioned
                    by Strabo, and were proud of the title of Antheadae. At an early period
                    Halicarnassus was a member of the Doric Hexapolis, which included Cos, Cnidus,
                    Lindus, Camirus, and Ialysus; but one of the citizens, Agasicles, having taken
                    home the prize tripod which he had won in the Triopian games instead of
                    dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo, the city was cut off
                    from the league. In the time of Xerxes we find Halicarnassus under the sway of a
                    certain Artemisia, who made herself famous by the assistance she rendered to the
                    great Persian invader. Pigres, her brother or son, was the reputed author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Batrachomyomachia.</hi> Of Pisindalis, her son and successor
                    in the sovereignty, little is known; but Lygdamis, who next attained to power,
                    is notorious for having put to death the poet Panyasis and caused Herodotus, the
                    greatest of the Halicarnassians, to leave his native city (c. 457 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> About the close of the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the power of Athens became predominant over
                    Halicarnassus and other Dorian cities of Asia, but the peace of Antalcidas in
                    387 made them subservient to Persia; and it was under Mausolus, a Persian satrap
                    of almost independent authority, that Halicarnassus attained its highest
                    prosperity. Struck by the natural strength and beauty of its position, Mausolus
                    removed thither from Mylasa, and increasing its population by the inhabitants of
                    six towns of the Leleges, devoted himself to its embellishment and defence. On
                    his death he was succeeded by his widow and sister, Artemisia, whose military
                    ability was shown by the stratagem by -which she captured the Rhodian vessels
                    attacking her city, and whose magnificence and taste have been perpetuated to
                    all time by the “Mausoleum,” the monument she erected to her husband’s memory.
                    In the execution of this wonderful enterprise she employed the architects
                    Satyrus and Pythius, <pb break="no"

                    Timotheus; and though she died before its completion, they continued it with all
                    the enthusiasm of artists. In the history of Halicarnassus the next important
                    events were connected with the conquests of Alexander the Great. Memnon, satrap
                    of the west coast, having taken refuge within its walls after the battle of
                    Granicus, it was besieged by the Macedonians, captured, and plundered. Not long
                    afterwards we find the citizens receiving the present of a gymnasium from
                    Ptolemy, and building in his honour a stoa or portico; but the city never
                    recovered altogether from the disasters of the siege, and Cicero describes it as
                    almost deserted. The site is now occupied by the town of Budrun, but the ancient
                    walls can still be traced in nearly all their circuit, and the position of
                    several of the temples and public buildings can be fixed with considerable
                    certainty.</p>
                <p>From the rains of file Mausoleum sufficient has been recovered by the excavations
                    carried out in 1867 by C. T. Newton to enable a fairly complete restoration of
                    its design. According to Mr Pιιllan, Mr Newton’s collaborator, the building
                    consisted of five parts—a basement or podium, a pteron or enclosure of columns,
                    a pyramid and pedestal, and a chariot group. The basement, probably 51 feet in
                    height, and covering an area of 114 feet by 92, was built of blocks of
                    greenstone and cased with marble, the monotony of the plain-courses being
                    possibly broken by one or more belts of frieze. The pteron, 374 feθt in height,
                    consisted (according to Pliny) of thirty-six columns of the Ionic order,
                    enclosing a square <hi rend="italic">cella,</hi> the walls of which were
                    relieved by friezes. From the portions that have been recovered it appears that
                    the principal frieze of the pteron represented combats of Greeks and Amazons.
                    “Throughout,” says Mr Newton, “there is a skilful opposition of nude and draped
                    male and female forms; but the groups and figures are much less intermixed than
                    in the Parthenon and Phigalian friezes. The whole surface was coloured, the
                    ground of the relief being ultramarine and the flesh a dim red, while the
                    drapery and armour were picked out with various hues.” Fragments have been found
                    of two other friezes of doubtful position in the monument, one representing a
                    chariot race and the other a centaur fight. Above the pteron rose the pyramid,
                    approximately 108 feet long and 86 feet wide at the base, and mounting by 24
                    steps to an apex or pedestal, which possibly had a length of 25 feet 6 inches
                    and a breadth of 20 feet. On this apex stood the quadriga or chariot with the
                    figure of Mausolus himself and an attendant deity acting as his charioteer. The
                    height of the statue of Mausolus—it has happily been preserved and forms part of
                    the treasures of the British Museum —is 9 feet 9⅛ inches without the plinth. The
                    hair rising from the forehead falls in thick waves on each side of the face and
                    descends nearly to the shoulder; the beard is short and close,the face square
                    and massive, the eyes deep set under overhanging brows, the mouth well formed
                    with settled calm about the lips. The drapery, consisting of a chiton and
                    mantle, is grandly composed. Such are the main features of the great Mausoleum
                    which deservedly ranked among the wonders of the world. The minor edifices and
                    sculptural remains of Halicarnassus are of secondary moment. Of well-preserved
                    inscriptions the number is comparatively few; but one or two (such as that
                    containing the names of Lygdamis and Panyasis) are of no small interest to the
                    arcliaeologist.</p>
