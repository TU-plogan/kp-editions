                    youth whose life was remarkable from the circumstances of apparently
                    inexplicable mystery in which it was involved. He appeared on May 20, 1828, in
                    the streets of Nuremberg, dressed in the garb of a peasant, and with such a
                    helpless and bewildered air that lie attracted the attention of the passers-by.
                    In his possession was found a letter purporting to be written by a poor
                    labourer, stating that the boy was given into his custody on the 7th October
                    1812, and that according to agreement he had instructed him in reading, writing,
                    and the Christian religion, but that up to the time fixed for relinquishing his
                    custody he had kept him in close confinement. Along with this letter was
                    enclosed another purporting to be written by the boy’s mother, stating that he
                    was born on the 30th April 1812, that his name was Kaspar, and that his father,
                    formerly a cavalry officer in the 6th regiment at Nuremberg, wa3 dead. The
                    appearance, bearing, and professions of the youth corresponded closely with
                    these credentials. He showed a repugnance to all nourishment except bread and
                    water, was seemingly ignorant of outward objects, wrote his name as Kaspar
                    Hauser, and said that he wished to be a cavalry officer like his father. For
                    some time he was detained in prison at Nuremberg as a vagrant, but on July 18,
                    1828, he was delivered over to the care of Professor Daumer, who undertook to be
                    his guardian and to take the charge of his education. On October 17, 1829, he
                    was found to have received a wound in the forehead, which according to his own
                    statement had been inflicted on him by a man with a blackened face. Having on
                    this account been removed to the house of a magistrate and placed under close
                    surveillance, he was visited by Earl Stanhope, who became so interested in his
                    history that he sent him to Ansbach to be educated. After this he became clerk
                    in the office of Feuerbach, president of the court of appeal, and his strange
                    history was almost forgotten by the public when the interest in it was suddenly
                    revived by his death on the 14th December 1833 from a deep wound on his left
                    breast. He affirmed that the wound was inflicted by a stranger, but many
                    believed it to be the work of his own hand, and that he did not intend it to be
                    fatal, but only so severe as to give a sufficient colouring of truth to his
                    story.</p>
                <p>In 1830 a pamphlet was published at Berlin, entitled <hi rend="italic">Kaspar
                    Hauser</hi><hi rend="italic">nicht unwahrscheinlich ein Betrüger·,</hi> but the
                    truthfulness of his statements was defended by Daumer, who published <hi
                    rend="italic">Mitthcilungen uber Kaspar Hauser</hi> (Nuremberg, 1832), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Enthüllungen</hi><hi rend="italic">uber Kaspar Hauser</hi>
                    (Frankfort, 1859); as well as <hi rend="italic">Kaspar Hauser,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sein Wesen, seine Unschuld,</hi> &amp;c. (Regensburg, 1873), in
                    answer to Meyers <hi rend="italic">Authentische Mittheilungen über Kaspar</hi>
                    7Za«sc7»(Ansbach, 1872). Feuerbach awakened considerable psychological interest
                    in the case by his pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Kaspar Hauser,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Beispiel eines Verbrechens</hi><hi rend="italic">am</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Seelenleben</hi> (Ansbach, 1832), and Earl Stanhope also took part
                    in the discussion by publishing <hi rend="italic">Materialien zur
                    Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">K.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hausers</hi>
                    (Heidelberg, 1836). The theory of Daumer and Feuerbach was that the youth was
                    the son of the grand-duke Charles of Baden, and that he had been kidnapped by
                    the countess of Hochberg in order to secure the succession to the children of
                    the grandduke Charles Frederick; but this theory was set aside in 1875 by the
                    publication in the Augsburg <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi> of the
                    official record of the baptism, post-mortem examination, and burial of the heir
                    supposed to have been kidnapped. See <hi rend="italic">Kaspar Hauser</hi><hi
