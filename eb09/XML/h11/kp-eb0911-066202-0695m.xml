                    1491, being the second son of Henry VII. and of his wife Elizabeth of York. On
                    the death of his elder brother Arthur in 1502, he became heir apparent to the
                    throne. As younger son Henry had been educated for the church, and it is said
                    that his interest in theology was due to those early studies; but as he was only
                    eleven when his brother died, they could not have been either extensive or
                    profound. His training under the severe and methodical Henry VII. must have been
                    a very careful one; he was deeply interested in the new learning, and was a most
                    accomplished scholar. During his father’s lifetime we hear nothing of the young
                    king except as the destined husband of Catherine of Aragon, the widow of his
                    brother Arthur, a lady six years older than himself. It suited the plans of the
                    old monarchs, their parents, that Catherine should be wedded to Henry, and so
                    she remained in England during the seven years of her widowhood. Henry was only
                    eighteen when the death of his father (1509) left the throne of England vacant,
                    as well as set him free to shape his own career. His first important act was to
                    fulfil the contract imposed upon him by his father to marry Catherine. His
                    ministers, almost without exception, were in favour of the marriage. Henry
                    expressed himself highly delighted with his wife. Catherine was fond of him to
                    excess. The disparity of years was not so marked at that early period; Catherine
                    was amiable, accomplished, of the bluest blood in Europe, closely connected with
                    the most powerful dynasties, a queen of whom England with her then diminished
                    prestige might well be proud. For the time all went well, and no one saw in such
                    a simple event the seeds of a great revolution.</p>
                <p>Englishmen were not in the mood to anticipate evil at the accession of Henry. In
                    the young king all the conditions requisite for a prosperous reign seemed to be
                    combined in a rare degree. To the dull monotony, varied only by Yorkist
                    rebellions, to the greed, suspicion, and jealousy which made the shady side of
                    the previous reign, succeeded an era of splendour and enjoyment in which every
                    free and generous impulse should have free scope. As Henry united in his own
                    person the lines of the White Rose and the Red, there was no likelihood of a
                    revival of the old broils. Those who grudged to see his Lancastrian father on
                    the throne were well pleased to see it occupied by a son of Elizabeth of York.
                    The hated avarice of Henry VII. had <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0696-0663"/> provided means for the popularity of his
                    successor; and to Henry VIII. fell the easy and generous rôle of squandering the
                    treasure which his father had amassed. Nor was this the only respect in which
                    the young Henry entered on the fruit of other men’s labours. In the Wars of the
                    Roses, and by the policy of Edward IV. and Henry VII., the old feudal nobility
                    had been brought very low. When nothing more was to be feared from that quarter,
                    it was Henry VIII.’s easy task to gather round him the broken remnants, to
                    attach them to his person, and to make them the ready instruments of his will,
                    in short, to convert the representatives of a haughty feudal baronage into
                    submissive courtiers. In character the young Henry was a king according to the
                    people’s heart; even in his faults he was exceptionally fortunate. He was
                    handsome, frank, extravagant, of vast muscular strength, accomplished in all the
                    manly exercises of the time andin the new learning; he was vain, thirsting for
                    popularity, eager to retrieve the old renown of England, the enemy of France,
                    and dreamt always of renewing the conquests of the Henrys and Edwards. It is not
                    surprising that Henry excited the highest expectations in all classes of his
                    subjects, for his varied character offered an attractive side to all of them.
                    The men of the new learning were charmed by his love of letters. Ecclesiastics
                    saw with pleasure his punctual performance of the duties of religion. All good
                    men were delighted with the excellence and purity of his private life. Statesmen
                    were struck by his capacity for business; his gaiety and frankness captivated
                    the courtiers; the prospect of French conquest inspired the warlike and the
                    ambitious. From the description of Henry by the Venetian ambassador,
                    Giustiniani, in 1519, we can easily perceive what impression he must have made
                    on England at his accession :—“His Majesty is twenty-nine years old, and
                    extremely handsome. Nature could not have done more for him. He is much
                    handsomer than any other sovereign of Christendom,—a good deal handsomer than
                    the king of France,—very fair, and his whole frame admirably proportioned. On
                    hearing that Francis I. wore a red beard, he allowed his own to grow; and as it
                    is reddish, he has now got a beard that looks like gold. He is very
                    accomplished, a good musician, composes well, is a most capital horseman, a fine
                    jouster, speaks good French, Latin, and Spanish, is very religious, hears three
                    masses daily when he hunts, and sometimes five on other days. He hears the
                    office every day in the queen’s chamber,—that is to say, vesper and compline. He
                    is very fond of hunting, and never takes his diversion without tiring eight or
                    ten horses, which he causes to be stationed beforehand along the line of country
                    he means to take; and when one is tired he mounts another, and before he gets
                    home they are all exhausted. He is extremely fond of tennis, at which game it is
                    the prettiest thing in the world to see him play, his fair skin glowing through
                    a shirt of the finest texture.” When w e take all these facts into
                    consideration, when we remember also that erelong he had raised England from a
                    third-rate position to a level with the greatest powers of Europe, and that for
                    twenty years nothing serious occurred to break the harmony of his reign, we
                    cannot be surprised that Henry was a most popular king.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry falls naturally into two periods, separated by the question of
                    the divorce. During the first period Henry is the splendid and jovial king at
                    home, abroad a figure of the first magnitude in the wars and international
                    diplomacies of the time. Both in home and foreign affairs, but particularly the
                    latter, Wolsey was the right hand man of the king, ready, as occasion served,
                    either to transact the whole business of the government, or to be the humble
                    instrument of the king, when the royal hand did actively interfere. In point of
                    fact Henry always was master, and took a keen interest in business. The events
                    of the first period were concerned chiefly with the foreign wars. At home, with
                    the exception of the execution of Empson and Dudley, the instruments of his
                    father’s extortion, who suffered, however, on a trumped-up charge of treason,
                    nothing important occurred. There were Christmas revels, May festivals, tilting
                    matches, in which Henry always shone victorious, and in which he squandered the
                    treasures of his father. But the serious endeavours of the time were directed
                    abroad; Henry joined his relatives Ferdinand and Maximilian in a league against
                    France. Though Henry took a personal share in the campaign in France of 1513,
                    and won the easy Battle of Spurs, and though Surrey, his general, gained the
                    great victory of Flodden, no substantial result was attained by the war. Henry
                    was duped and then abandoned by his allies. When he was undeceived, he made
                    peace (1514) with France, which was cemented by the marriage of his youthful
                    sister Mary to the old and worn-out Louis XII. Soon after, when Louis was
                    succeeded by Francis I. (1515), and Charles V. entered on the government of his
                    hereditary dominions (1516), the three monarchs who figure so conspicuously as
                    the contemporaries of the Reformation, and whose doings constitute so much of
                    the history of the 16th century, found themselves faceto face. With these two
                    and with the successive popes Henry had to do during the rest of his life. Their
                    relations at first were chivalrous and even friendly. Henry never had any chance
                    of success in his canvass for the imperial crown. When it fell to Charles, it
                    made him beyond a doubt the first monarch of the age; his success placed him in
                    open rivalry to France; but to Henry, fortunate again, it gave the desirable
                    prospect of being courted by the two rivals, and even of acting as arbiter in
                    their disputes. Henry, however, descended from this lofty position to engage in
                    quarrels which had no concern with the true interests of England. The chimera of
                    French conquest again fascinated him and his people, so that when the false
                    chivalry of the Cloth of Gold had degenerated into war, Henry took the side of
                    Charles. In the campaign of 1523 the English forces advanced to within eleven
                    leagues of Paris, but the war led to no durable and satisfactory result as far
                    as Henry was concerned. The people grew sick of the heavy contributions they
                    were called upon to make, and threatened revolt. After the battle of Pavia
                    (1525), where the French were completely overthrown and their king made prisoner
                    by the armies of Charles, the policy of Henry was completely disturbed. Till
                    that event it had been clear enough. The commercial interests of the country,
                    which were bound up with the Flemish dominions of Charles; the ambition of
                    Wolsey, who founded his hope of the papal crown on the good-will of the emperor;
                    the hereditary enmities and warlike instincts of the people, as well as the
                    inclination of the king, coincided conveniently in requiring the imperial
                    alliance. But now France was down, and the balance of power, already a working
                    conception in politics, was destroyed, while Charles in his triumph ignored the
                    claims of Henry, and had more than once disappointed the ambition of Wolsey.
                    Under these circumstances English policy was forced out of its old groove, and
                    an alliance was made with France. In a short time, moreover, interests and
                    passions of a far more momentous nature emerged. The dilettante politics of
                    Henry’s early career were to he superseded by occupations of a tragically
                    earnest nature. Adventurous enterprises abroad were to give place to real
                    interests at home, and the jovial young king was to be transformed into the
                    stein, self-willed, and often cruel revolutionary. The serious and important
                    part of Henry’s life therefore is still to come: but before leaving the earlier
                    period it is well to remark that it lasted twenty years, or more than half of
                    his reign; that during these years Henry was popular in the highest degree; and
                    especially that he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0697-0664"/> had gratified the national pride of his subjects
                    by restoring England to a leading position in Europe. This should not be
                    forgotten during the troubled and more questionable events that were to
                    follow.</p>
                <p>The year 1528 may justly be fixed as the turning-point of Henry’s life. By that
                    time the divorce had become a national and even a European question, and Henry
                    had decisively committed himself to the course which was to result in the
                    separation from Rome. It is not clear when ihe plan of a divorce began to take
                    shape in Henry’s mind; it was the slow result of a variety of causes which were
                    not clear to the king himself. We know, however, that Anne Boleyn returned to
                    the court of England in 1522; that she made quite a sensation there as soon as
                    she appeared; and that among other admirers, married and unmarried, Henry soon
                    expressed a decided preference for her. On the other hand, he seems to have been
                    alienated from Catherine long ere the question of divorce became public; if we
                    may trust a statement of his own, he had abstained from her bed since 1524, and
                    his coldness for her increased with his love for Anne. That his scruples
                    regarding his marriage awoke about the same time was certainly a very convenient
                    coincidence. The danger, however, of a disputed succession in the absence of
                    male heirs was a real one. The situation probably justified such an
                    extraordinary measure as a divorce, though we must recollect that the raising of
                    a second family, rival to Mary the daughter of Catherine, might precipitate the
                    very crisis which men feared. Still we must admit on the whole that the national
                    interest and the inclination of Henry coincided, and that concern for his
                    kingdom probably had a large part in the mixed motives which urged him to seek a
                    divorce.</p>
                <p>When the demand for a divorce was first formally laid before the pope in 1527, no
                    one anticipated that it would encounter so many difficulties. The great opponent
                    of it was Charles V., who loyally supported his aunt, and who, as the event
                    proved, had the pope entirely in his power. But for the emperor, Clement would
                    soon have arranged everything to the satisfaction of· the English court. As it
                    was, he sought safety in delay. Thus he declined giving any decisive answer
                    himself, and when he delegated the case to Wolsey and Campeggio, he managed
                    still further to defer the question and then to revoke it to Rome (1529). By
                    that time Henry’s patience was exhausted. As early as 1528, and as if sure of a
                    speedy decision in their favour, the king and Anne were living familiarly
                    together under the same roof. Their disappointment was natural, and Henry soon
                    began to take more active measures. He appealed from the pope to the
                    universities. Notwithstanding his life-long services Wolsey was discarded,
                    because he was supposed not to have been sufficiently earnest about the divorce.
                    The same year (1529) a parliament was called, which proved to be the ready
                    auxiliary of the king in his new policy. This parliament, which sat at intervals
                    from 1529 to 1536, had little independent or substantive power; it was made up
                    largely of the nominees and creatures of the court, and seldom moved but at the
                    royal initiative. Still it was well that the old forms should be recognized in
                    the great changes that were coming, anl significant that the strong-willed Tudor
                    felt it safe to have the nation at his back. The changes themselve3 were
                    gradual, and were by no means disagreeable to the advanced and influential part
                    of the nation. Only a very small minority had any sympathy with the Lutheran
                    movement; but many wished to see the church reformed, to have her power
                    curtailed, and that England should take up a more independent attitude towards
                    the pope. Under these circumstances Henry found it eaβy to carry the majority,
                    especially the active and progressive part, of the nation with him. In no case
                    was the parliament of 1529 conscious of its destiny; what it contemplated was
                    not a revolution but only some necessary reform; it, as well as Henry, would
                    have been astonished to hear that they were working on the side of Luther. Vet
                    the parliament soon proceeded to take some very decisive steps. In 1529 the
                    probate duties and mortuaries (or burial fees) exacted by the church were
                    curtailed; the clergy were prohibited from following secular employments;
                    residence was enforced, and pluralities forbidden. In 1531 the clergy were laid
                    under the charge of praemunire, which they bought off by the payment of £
                    118,000, and the acknowledgment that the king was supreme head of the church. In
                    1532 the abuses of “Benefit of Clergy” were reformed, annates abolished
                    conditionally, and the independent legislative power given up by convocation.
                    Soon after the king took a step which precipitated the crisis; he married Anne
                    Boleyn, an event which was quickly followed by the publication in Flanders of a
                    threat of excommunication from Rome. After this the Act of Appeals was passed,
                    forbidding appeals from the English ecclesiastical courts to Rome, and Cranmer,
                    in a court at Dunstable, declared the marriage with Catherine null and void. In
                    the following year (1534) the papal authority in England was annulled, and by
                    the Act of Supremacy Henry was declared supreme head of the English Church. The
                    next step was a sad one; but it convinced the world that the king was in
                    earnest. Sir Thomas More and Fisher, bishop of Winchester, the noblest champions
                    of the old faith, two of the best and noblest Englishmen of the time, were
                    executed for refusing to accept the Supremacy Act (1535). Such an event produced
                    a deep sensation in Europe, but it was decisive; when the pope drew up the Bull
                    of Deposition in 1536, which, however, was not published till 1538, the rupture
                    with Rome was complete. In the same year (1536) the first Articles of religion,
                    ten in number, were drawn up; in effect they were a great simplification of the
                    old creed, though they gave little encouragement to Lutheranism. At the same
                    time the Act for the dissolution of the smaller monasteries, which was based
                    upon the report of a commission of inquiry, was passed, being the final
                    important measure of the first Reformation parliament. With such events as the
                    abolition of the papal power in England and the dissolution of the monasteries
                    modern England begins; they inaugurate a fundamental change in the national
                    policy and in the structure and habits of society. While the purpose, real or
                    ostensible, of Henry had been merely to marry a younger woman and provide for
                    the succession, he had effected the greatest revolution which England has
                    undergone.</p>
                <p>Henry had indeed succeeded in the task to which he had applied himself nine years
                    before; but the enemies he had raised were formidable, and he was destined to
                    many a bitter disappointment. He had excited the hostility of the pope and the
                    emperor; worst of all, he had seriously hurt the feelings and prejudices of a
                    large class of his subjects. The danger of foreign invasion was greatly
                    increased by the discontent both in the north and west of England, where the
                    love of use and wont in the church and in the national habits was strongest. The
                    death of Catherine had indeed greatly relieved him, as it made reconciliation
                    with the emperor practicable, and deprived the English opposition of a common
                    centre. The rising in Ireland was suppressed without much difficulty, but the
                    discontent in the north which broke out in the Pilgrimage of Grace was a
                    formidable danger (1536). It was averted more by skilful statesmanship on
                    Henry’s part than by open show of force. The opposition in the west was nipped
                    in the bud by the execution of its leaders, the marquis of Exeter and Lord
                    Montague (1538). These measures of the king and of his minister Cromwell
                    sometimes appeared cruel and unjustifiable, but they kept the country united;
                    Charles was convinced<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0698-0665"/> of the futility of an invasion; and the
                    thunderbolts of the pope fell harmless to the ground. In all this crisis, when a
                    wrong step or the appearance of vacillation might have occasioned a religious
                    war, in which the conservatism at home would have been seconded by the armies of
                    Spain, the energy and the commanding sagacity of Henry did more than aught else
                    to save the country. To him the praise is chiefly due that this great revolution
                    was comparatively free from blood and havoc.</p>
                <p>Henry had defied the emperor and the pope, and he had suppressed the conservative
                    Catholic discontent at home with a high hand; but he was never disposed to be a
                    Protestant. Instead of following the lead of the advanced Reformers he impressed
                    upon the English Church his own moderate and substantially Catholic theology. At
                    thirty he had defended the seven sacraments against Luther; he was thirty-six
                    when he took up the question of divorce, and he was forty ere his relations to
                    the pope had hardened into alienation and hostility. All his life he was
                    orthodox from conviction as well as from traditional assent. Such a man could
                    not be a revolutionary in theology. He repressed with a firm hand all excess in
                    innovation, showing equal aversion to the iconoclastic mob and to iconoclastic
                    preachers. The bill of the Six Articles, passed in the same year that saw the
                    final dissolution of the monastic system of England, was the most remarkable
                    exemplification of this spirit of Henry. It also proves that innovation in
                    theology was a new thing to the mass of the English nation, and its penalties
                    too clearly illustrate the fact that religion was not considered an individual
                    and private matter, but a national interest, the violation of which was a
                    capital offence. It is to the honour of Henry that the victims of the Bloody
                    Statute were so few. Five hundred arrests were made by the eager Catholic party
                    in a single fortnight after the passing of the bill; but the king interposed in
                    time, and only twenty-eight suffered under the statute during the whole
                    reign.</p>
                <p>In the meantime Henry had been less fortunate in the matrimonial scheme which hid
                    been the occasion of all the changes and dangers we have noted. A few months
                    after the deιth of Catherine, Anne Boleyn was sent to the scaffold. Anne inιy
                    have been guilty of the crimes laid to her charge, but Henry himself had taught
                    her to cast aside all feminine reserve and self-respect, and his fickle heart
                    had been captivated by another, long before the disclosures which were the
                    ground of her death. Henry married his new love, Jane Seymour, the day after the
                    execution of Anne (1536). The birth of Edward in the following year gratified
                    the king’s desire for a mile heir; but the early death of Jane left him again
                    without a queen. After an interval of more than two years Cromwell undertook to
                    procure a suitable wife at the Protestant courts of Germany; but his ruin was
                    not less complete than that of his patron Wolsey on a similar occasion ten years
                    before. Anne of Cleves found no favour in the king’s eyes; she was divorced and
                    pensioned off, while the enemies of Cromwell succeeded in sending him to the
                    scaffold. Anne’s place was occupied by Catherine Howard, till she, really
                    guilty, was also executed (1512). For his sixth and last queen Henry married
                    (1543) Catherine Parr, who proved a patient wife and an excellent nurse. During
                    the last few years of Henry’s reign home affairs and the question of the
                    religious revolution ceased to.be the exclusive subject of interest. England and
                    the neighbouring powers were constrained to acquiesce for the time being in
                    Henry’s arrangement of things. Even the emperor cultivated his alliance. His
                    foreign politics ended very much as they began—with a war against Scotland and
                    France. The former arose out of certain border quarrels; the Scots were beaten
                    at Solway Moss, but defeated an English force at Ancrum Moor. After the death of
                    James V.</p>
                <p>Henry’s course was to arrange a marriage of the infant queen of Scots with his
                    own son Edward. The plan failed through Henry’s self-will, and Scotland was
                    ravaged to no purpose. The war with France (1543-46) was equally fruitless. Its
                    chief feature was a threatened invasion by a formidable French fleet, which for
                    some time was master of the Channel.</p>
                <p>At home the most important point of interest was the struggle between the two
                    factions, Protestant and Conservative, which had now for some years confronted
                    each other—Norfolk and Bishop Gardiner of Winchester being the leaders of the
                    latter, while the queen, Cranmer, and the earl of Hertford, uncle of young
                    Edward, were at the head of the former. Cromwell had already fallen under the
                    machinations of the Conservative party. Cranmer and even the queen were not
                    quite safe from its attacks. The heads of that party now suffered at the close
                    of the reign. Surrey •was executed, and Norfolk was saved only by the death of
                    the king. The effect of such measures was to make the prospects of Edward secure
                    by confirming the power of his uncle Hertford.</p>
                <p>Henry was anxious to arrange affairs for the accession of his son, as he felt his
                    own life waning away. Though only in his fifty-sixth year he was unwieldy with
                    disease and corpulency, and required to be wheeled from room to room; an ulcer
                    in the leg had troubled him for many years. In this as in so many other respects
                    the contrast between the beginning and end of his career is striking: the young
                    athlete is transformed into a helpless invalid; the joviality, the enthusiasm,
                    and the unanimity of his earlier reign gave place to a long period of gloom and
                    contention, repressed only by the savage and imperious hand of the king. He died
                    on the 28th of January 1547.</p>
                <p>The character of Henry has long been a stumbling-block to historians, and will
                    always be a puzzle to such as classify mankind under the two heads of good and
                    bad without recognizing the intermediate gradations to which the vast majority
                    belong. To many it is all the more inexplicable, because the contrast between
                    his youth and declining manhood is so apparently complete. Yet it was a
                    perfectly consistent, though a mixed character, and the later phases of it are
                    only a natural development of the earlier. He was always strong-willed to
                    excess, capricious, and fickle, with the sensuous part of his nature
                    predominating. In his youth his baser tendencies were controlled by his love of
                    popularity, his regard for his excellent wife, his own sense of duty, and the
                    vigorous animal spirits which found congenial play in physical exercise and in
                    foreign war. In his maturer years he was more self-reliant and therefore less
                    dependent on popularity; after losing his regard for Catherine he fell into
                    baser companionship; as his health began to fail, his boisterous spirits
                    declined. Worst of all, his constitutional fickleness took the form of
                    disloyalty to his successive wives, and to his friends and ministers. In the
                    time of Henry there was no acuter man than Sir Thomas More. His verdict may be
                    accepted as final on this aspect of the king’s character. In the height of his
                    favour with the king, after walking an hour with him in the garden at Chelsea,
                    the king holding his arm about his neck, More confessed that he had “no cause to
                    be proud thereof, for if my head would win him a castle in France it should not
                    fail to go.” Such may have been the repulsive side of Henry. Much more
                    important, however, than the consideration of his personal character is the
                    question as to the nature and tendency of the historic work in which he took the
                    initiative. Was that the outcome merely of misguided self-will concealing itself
                    under the guise of duty, or was it the true and durable expression of the claims
                    and aspirations of the time? The passions of Henry had certainly too much to do
                    with it; the work he did was, like his character, mixed with baser elements. But
                    the best answer to such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n699/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0699-0666"/> a question is to be found in the modern history
                    of England. That history in its progressive spirit, in its gradual approximation
                    to a sounder and better state of society, and in its liberal openness to the
                    influence of truth, is only the continuation and development of the work of
                    Henry. In his rupture with the pope, in his abolition of an idle and antiquated
                    monasticism, and in his endeavour to establish a purified and simplified
                    Catholicism as the permanent creed of England, he was fighting on the side of
                    truth and light and progress. The English Reformation was too much alloyed with
                    baser elements to serve as an ideal example of a great historic change; yet it
                    succeeded better than any other in appropriating the good both of the old and
                    the new, in avoiding a violent rupture with the past, in keeping the nation
                    unanimous, and in escaping those fatal religious wars which desolated Europe for
                    nearly a century and in Germany delayed the progress of civilization for a
                    century more. This desirable consummation was due first of all to Henry, whose
                    sagacity and unfaltering resolution baffled the enemies of reform both at home
                    and abroad, who repressed the hasty movements of either fanatical extreme in
                    England, and who, with his real reverence for the teaching of the past, had a
                    hearty contempt for its abuses. He was no hero, no ideal man or king; he shared
                    fully in the coarseness and indelicacy of the age; he was fickle in his personal
                    attachments, and did not shrink from destroying those who crossed his plans; but
                    he had a real and lofty sense of his duty as a king; he had a true insight into
                    the men and things he had to deal with, and helped to lead the country into a
                    new era.</p>
