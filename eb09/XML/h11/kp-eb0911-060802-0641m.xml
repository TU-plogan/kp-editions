                    travelling. He lived some time in Egypt (Herod., ii. 143); he was well
                    acquainted with the resources and power of the Persian empire (Herod., v. 34);
                    and the extant fragments of his writings seem to imply personal acquaintance
                    with Libya, Spain, and Italy, as well as with the countries bordering on the
                    Aegean and Euxine seas. After middle life he seems to have settled in Miletus,
                    where he occupied a position of great honour, and to have devoted his time to
                    the composition of geographical and historical works. When Aristagoras held a
                    council of the leading Ionians at Miletus, to organize a revolt against the
                    Persian rule, Hecataeus tried to dissuade his countrymen from the undertaking.
                    Being overruled, he then advised them to equip a strong fleet, using for the
                    emergency the treasures of the temple at Branchidae, which might be repaid after
                    the war. But both then and at a later period of the war (Herod., v. 124) his
                    skilful and prudent advice was given in vain. When the remainder of the revolted
                    Ionians sued for terms, he was one of the ambassadors sent to the Persian satrap
                    Artaphernes. He w rote a work on geography entitled ∏∈pιτrλoυς or Π∈pojγ7jσtς
                    τi}ς Γτ)ς, in which lie w ent over the countries of the known world, told their
                    inhabitants, enumerated the towns, and described their situation and history. He
                    improved the map of the world which Anaximander had made. He also wrote a work
                    called Γ∈v∈αλoγiαι or Tστopiaι, describing systematically the traditions and
                    mythology of the Greeks. According to Arrian, he was the first to employ
                    critical method to distinguish myth from historical fact; though he accepts
                    Homer and the other poets as trustworthy authority. Herodotus, though obviously
                    regarding him with respect, often controverts his statements.</p>
