                    brother of James, second earl of Abercorn and head of the family of Hamilton in
                    the peerage of Scotland, and sixth duke of Châtellerault in the peerage of
                    France; and his mother was Mary Butler, sister of the duke of Ormonde. He was
                    born in 1646, but the place of his birth has not been ascertained. According to
                    some authorities it was Drogheda, but according to the London edition of his
                    works in 1811 it was Roscrea in Tipperary county. From the age of four till he
                    was fourteen the boy was brought up in France, whither his family had removed
                    after the execution of Charles I. The fact that, like his father, he was a Roman
                    Catholic, prevented his receiving the political promotion he might otherwise
                    have expected on the Restoration, but he became a distinguished member of that
                    brilliant band of courtiers whose most fitting portraiture was destined to be
                    the product of his pen. His connexion with France was always maintained, and the
                    marriaere of his sister to the Comte de Gramont rendered it more intimate if
                    possible than before. On the accession of James he found his religious
                    disabilities transformed into advantages. He obtained an infantry regiment in
                    Ireland, and was appointed governor of Limerick. But the battle of the Boyne, at
                    which he was present, brought disaster on all who were attached to the cause of
                    the Stewarts, and before long he was again in France—an exile, but at home. The
                    rest of his life was spent for the most part in the châteaux of his friends.
                    With the duchess Ludovise of Maine he became an especial favourite, and it was
                    at her seat at Sceaux that he wrote the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> that
                    made him famous. The ill-advised expedition of 1708 was the last political
                    enterprise in which he shared, and he died at St Germain-en-Laye, August 6,
                    1720.</p>
                <p>It is mainly, as has already been indicated, by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">du Comte de Grammont</hi> that Hamilton takes
                    rank with the most classical writers of France. The work was first published
                    anonymously in 1713 under the rubric of Cologne, but it was really printed in
                    Holland, at that ti'-Je the great patroness of all questionable authors. An
                    English translation by Boyer appeared in 1714. Upwards of thirty editions have
                    since appeared, the best of the French being Renouard’s (1812) and Gustave
                    Brunet’s (1859), and the best of the English Edward’s (1793), with 78
                    engravings, and Malleville’s (1811), with 64 portraits by Scriven and others.
                    The original edition was reprinted by Pifteau in 1876. In imitation and satiric
                    parody of the romantic tales which Galland’s translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Thousand and One NightshaA</hi> brought into favour in France, Hamilton
                    wrote <hi rend="italic">Le Bélin, Fleur</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Épine, Zénéyde,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Les Quatre
                    Facardins,</hi> which are characterized by the graceful ease of their style and
                    the successful extravagance of their incidents. The first three tales appeared
                    at Paris in 1730, ten years after the death of the author, and a collection of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi><hi rend="italic">Diverses</hi> in 1731
                    contained the unfinished “Zénéyde.” A collected edition of Hamilton’s works was
                    published in six volumes in 1749, and was reprinted in 1762, 1770, 1776, and
                    1777. A translation of Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism,</hi> which
                    procured the author a complimentary acknowledgment from the poet, is still in
                    MSS., with the exception of a fragment printed in the 1812 edition of the works.
                    In the name of his niece, the countess of Stafford, Hamilton maintained a witty
                    correspondence with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. See Notices of Hamilton in the
                    1862 edition of his works, and in Lescure’s edition of the <hi rend="italic"
