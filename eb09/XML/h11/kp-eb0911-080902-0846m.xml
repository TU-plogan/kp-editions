                    was a Benedictine monk of the monastery of St Werberg in Chester, in which he
                    lived, it is said, for sixty-four years, and died “in a good old age,” probably
                    in the year 1363. He was buried, we are told in a note prefixed in the 16th
                    century to the MS. of his work belonging to the library of Christ Church,
                    Oxford, “in St Werberg’s Church (now Chester Cathedral), on the south side of
                    the church near the choir, not far from the door which leads into the
                    churchyard; an arch was made for him in the wall, and on the wall is the
                    inscription, ‘Non his sub muro, sed subter marmore duro.’” This monument, extant
                    in the 16th century, seems now to have entirely disappeared. Higdon was the
                    author of a long chronicle, one of several such works based on a plan taken from
                    Scripture, and written for the amusement and instruction of the society to which
                    the compiler belonged. Its chief interest perhaps lies in the fact that it
                    closes the long series of general chronicles, which were soon put completely out
                    of date by the invention of printing. It is commonly styled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polychronicon,</hi> from the longer title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ranulphi</hi><hi rend="italic">Castrensis, cognomine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Higdon, Polychronicon {sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">septem libros dispositum.</hi> The work is divided into seven
                    books, in humble imitation of the seven days of Genesis, and, with exception of
                    the last book, is a summary of general history, a compilation made with
                    considerable style and taste. It seems to have enjoyed no little popularity in
                    the fifteenth century. The Christ Church MS. says that Higdon wrote it down to
                    the year 1342; the fine MS. at Christ’s College, Cambridge, states that he wrote
                    to the year 1344, after which date, with the omission of two years, John of
                    Malvern, a monk of Worcester, carried the history on to 1357, at which date it
                    ends. According, however, to its latest editor, Higdon’s part of the work goes
                    no further than 1326 or 1327 at latest, after which time it was carried on by
                    two continuators to the end. Gale in his <hi rend="italic">Quindecim
                    Scriptores</hi> published that portion of it, in the original Latin, which comes
                    down to 1066; an English translation of the whole was made by John of Trevisa,
                    and printed by Caxton at his press in Westminster in 1482, with the addition of
                    an eighth book. There is also an anonymous English translation of the work. The
                    whole is being at this time carefully edited by Professor Lumby, B.D., under the
                    authority of the Master of the Rolls; six volumes have appeared, 1865-1876.</p>
