                    extraction, not Dutch as has been supposed. They appear to have settled in
                    Herefordshire as early as the 13th century. The family seat was at Eaton, 2
                    miles S. E. of Leominster. Hugo Hakelute was returned Μ. P. for that borough in
                    the 32d parliament of Edward I. ,1304-5. See <hi rend="italic">Return of Members

                    was elected “one of her Maiesties scholars at Westminster,” and it was while
                    there that the bent of his future studies was determined by a visit to his
                    cousin and namesake, Richard Hakluyt of the Middle Temple. His cousin’s
                    discourse, illustrated by “certain bookes of cosmographie, an universali mappe,
                    and the Bible,” had such an effect upon Hakluyt’s mind that he resolved, if
                    opportunity offered, to “prosecute that knowledge and kind of literature.”
                    Entering Christ Church, Oxford, in 1570, “his exercises of duty first
                    performed,” he fell to his intended course of reading, and by degrees perused
                    all the printed or written voyages and discoveries that he could find. He took
                    his degree of</p>
                <p>B. A. in 1573-74, and we learn from the Towneley MSS. that two years later he was
                    selected twice in the same year to receive gifts of money.<note anchored="true"

                    his degree of M.A. (1577), he commenced at Oxford the first public lectures in
                    geography that “shewed both the old imperfectly composed and the new lately
                    reformed mappes, globes, spheares, and other instruments of this art.”<note

                    is certain, as we know that the first lecture of the kind was delivered in the

                <p>Hakluyt’s first published work was his <hi rend="italic">Divers Voyages touching
                    the Discoverie of America</hi> (London, 1582, 4to). By reason of his great
                    knowledge of these matters and his acquaintance with “the chiefest captaines at
                    sea, the greatest merchants, and the best mariners of our nation,” he was
                    selected in 1583, at the age of thirty, to accompany Sir Edward Stafford, the
                    English ambassador, to Paris in the capacity of chaplain. In accordance with the
                    instructions of Secretary Walsingham, he occupied himself chiefly in collecting
                    information of the Spanish and French movements, and “making diligent inquirie
                    of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoverie in
                    America.” The first fruits of Hakluyt’s labours in Paris are embodied in the
                    most important production of his that has seen the light in modern times; it is
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">A particuler discourse concerning Westerne

                    object of the <hi rend="italic">Discourse</hi> was to recommend the enterprise
                    of planting the English race in the unsettled parts of North America. Hakluyt’s
                    other works consist mainly of translations and compilations, relieved by his
                    dedications and prefaces, which last, with a few letters, are the only material
                    we possess out of which a biography of him can be framed.</p>
                <p>Hakluyt returned to England in 1584, and during his short stay he had the honour
                    of laying before Queen Elizabeth a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Discourse</hi>
                    “along with one in Latin upon Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Politicks,”</hi>
                    which won for him, two days before his departure again for Paris, the grant of
                    the next vacant prebend at Bristol. In the spring of the following year, feeling
                    anxious about the reversion of the prebend, he again visited England, and
                    exhibited in person, on the 24th May 1585, before the chapter of Bristol
                    cathedral, the queen’s mandate for the coveted vacancy already signed and
                    sealed. Before the close of the year the reversion of it fell to him, and in
                    1586 he was admitted to the prebend, which he held, with his other preferments,
                    till the time of his death.</p>
                <p>While in .Paris Hakluyt caused to be published the MS. journal of Laudonnière or

                    edited by M. Bassanier (Paris, 1586, 8vo). This was translated by Hakluyt and
                    published in London under the title of <hi rend="italic">A notable</hi><hi

                    which the name of “Virginia” appears.</p>
                <p>In 1588 Hakluyt finally returned to England with Lady Stafford, after a residence
                    in France of nearly five years. In 1589 he published <hi rend="italic"

                    but little read, has been truly called the “prose epic of the modern English
                    nation.” It is an invaluable treasure of material for the history of
                    geographical discovery and colonization, which has secured for its author a

                    of the chaplains of the Savoy, and his will contains a reference to chambers

                    Virginia, of which Hakluyt was so zealous a promoter, “to whom England is more
                    indebted for its American possession than to any man of that age.”<note

                <p>A number of Hakluyt’s MSS., sufficient to form a fourth volume of his collections
                    of 1599-1600, fell into the hands of Samuel Purchas, who inserted them in an
                    abridged form in his <hi rend="italic">Pilgrimes</hi> (1625-26, fol.). Others
                    are preserved at Oxford (Bib. Bod. MS., Seid. B. 8), which consist chiefly of
                    notes gathered from contemporary authors. Hakluyt died in 1616, and was buried
                    in Westminster Abbey (November 26); by an error in the abbey register it stands
                    under the year 1626. His best monument is the society that flourishes under his
                    name. Founded in 1846 for the purpose of printing rare and unpublished voyages
                    and travels, “it aims at opening by this means an easier access to sources of a
                    branch of knowledge which yields to none in importance, and is superior to most
                    in agreeable variety.” The fifty-seven volumes that have been published by the
                    society since its formation have been edited with great discrimination and care,
                    and have come to be regarded as the standard text-books upon their respective
                    subjects. Some are out of print, and others have passed through two editions.
                    The latest volume published is a reissue in a new form of <hi rend="italic">The
