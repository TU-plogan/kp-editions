                <p><label type="entry">HINDUSTANI LITERATURE</label>.—Hindustani literature falls
                    into two great divisions, of which the first is comprehensively styled Hindi,
                    the second Urdii. Both of these forms of speech are, in their application to
                    literary purposes, at first intruders upon the ground already occupied by the
                    learned languages, Sanskrit and Persian. At no time during modern Indian history
                    has Sanskrit altogether ceased to be used for composition by the class who
                    regard culture and literature as their special heritage, although during the
                    last two centuries it has much fallen from its former estate; and Persian has
                    been still less neglected by learned Muhammadans and their Hindu imitators in
                    India. But there is this difference between them that, whereas Hindi has been
                    raised to the dignity of a literary language chiefly by impulses of revolt
                    against the monopoly of the Brahmans, Urdu has been cultivated with good will by
                    authors who have themselves highly valued and dexterously used the polished
                    Persian. Both, however, represent the popular side of the national culture, and
                    in the present day they are almost in sole possession of the field. The subject
                    may be conveniently divided as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Early Hindi, of the period during which the language was being fashioned as a
                    literary medium, represented by the old heroic poems of Räjpütänä and the
                    literature of the <hi rend="italic">Bhagats</hi> or Vaishnava reformers, and
                    extending from about 1200 to 1570 A.D.</p>
                <p>2. Middle Hindi, representing the best age of Hindi poetry, and reaching from
                    about 1570 to 1750 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>3. The rise and development of literary Urdü, beginning about the end of the 16th
                    century and reaching its height during the 18 th.</p>
                <p>4. The modern period, marked by the growth of a prose literature in both
                    dialects, and dating from the beginning of the present century.</p>
                <p>1. Early Hindi literature has as yet been very insufficiently explored.· Chand’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Prithwïrâj</hi><hi rend="italic">Räsau</hi> is the only
                    specimen of the heroic ballads of which any portion has been published, other
                    ancient metrical chronicles of the same character being known to us only from
                    the use made of them by such writers as Colonel Tod in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annals of Rajasthan,</hi> and Major Pogson in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    the Boondelas.</hi> Chand was the bard of Prithwiräj, the last Hindu king of
                    Dehli, whose life and death he has related. He was himself a native of Lahore,
                    which had for nearly 200 years (since 1023) been under Musulman domination at
                    the time when the poem may be supposed to have been written. His language
                    exhibits a considerable proportion of Persian words, but little of the
                    distinctive features of what is now Panjabi. His work is probably, with the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n883/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0883-0844"/> exception of a fragment by Jaideo (the author of
                    the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">Gita·Govinda),</hi> preserved in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ädi-Granth,</hi> the oldest specimen of Hindi which we possess:
                    but it is impossible to suppose that he was the first to attempt poetical
                    composition in that language. The metrical perfection of his verse alone shows
                    that he must have had many predecessors; and rude and rough though his utterance
                    is, it abounds in poetic conventionalisms which must have been the common stock
                    of many singers of his class. The story is told in sixty-nine books, of which
                    some are interludes and digressions, but most are occupied with the exploits of
                    the hero and his warriors. Considering the early date of the poem, and the
                    opportunities of knowing the truth which the author (if he was really
                    Prithwiräj’s bard) possessed, it is remarkable how much legend and fiction is
                    mixed up with history in the chronicle. The repeated conflicts between the räjä
                    and Sultan Shihâbuddîn of Ghor, in which the latter always, except in the last
                    great battle, comes off the worst, and is released on payment of a ransom, seem
                    to be entirely unhistoric, our authorities knowing only one encounter (that of
                    Tirauri near Thänesar, fought in 1191) in which the sultan was defeated, and
                    there even he escaped uncaptured to Lahore. The Mughals (Book xv.) are brought
                    on the stage more than thirty years before they actually set foot iu India
                    (1222), and are related to have been vanquished by the redoubtable Prithwïrâj.
                    These and other points make it questionable whether we have here, at least in
                    its entirety, a genuine contemporary work; but we may concede, as indeed we are
                    justified in doing by the language of the poem, that it is one of our earliest
                    documents in Hindi.</p>
                <p>It is very difficult for us now to form a just estimate of Chand’s poem: the
                    language, essentially transitional in character, abounds in strange forms which
                    have long since died out of the vernacular speech; few if any Hindus, even the
                    most learned, are able to interpret him; and his meaning must be sought by
                    investigating the processes by which Sanskrit and Prakrit words have been
                    transfigured in their progress into Hindi. But upon the whole he may be said to
                    exhibit both the merits and defects of ballad-chroniclers in general. There is
                    much that is lively and spirited in his descriptions of fight or council; and
                    the characters of the Räjpüt warriors who surround his.hero are not unfrequently
                    sketched in their own words with skill and animation. The sound, however, too
                    often predominates over the sense, and we find abundantly exemplified in his
                    poem the wearisome iteration, uninventive sameness of machinery, and tedious
                    unfolding of familiar themes and images which distinguish nearly the whole of
                    Indian narrative poetry. His value, for us at least, is linguistic rather than
                    literary.</p>
                <p>The other class of composition which is characteristic of the period of Old
                    Hindi, the literature of the <hi rend="italic">Bhagats,</hi> both possesses more
                    intrinsic interest and has exercised a more important influence on subsequent
                    literary endeavour. The heroic chronicles, with perhaps the single exception of
                    a famous saga relating the history of Padmävati, wife of Ratan Sen Räjä of
                    Chitor, who in 1303 at the taking of that fortress by Sultan *Ala-ud-din burnt
                    herself and (so says the tale) 13,000 other women rather than fall into the
                    hands of the conqueror, which has been several times handled by poets outside
                    the pale of Rajput traditions, and especially in a still highly esteemed work by
                    Jaisi under Sher Shäh (1540), had only a local currency, and contributed but
                    little to the furtherance of literature outside the limits of Râjpûtânâ. The
                    Vaishnava reformers, on the other hand, exercised the most powerful influence
                    both upon the national speech and upon the themes chosen for poetic treatment.
                    Nearly the whole of subsequent Hindi literature is impressed with one or other
                    form of Vaishnava doctrine; a very large proportion of the poets whose works are
                    still current among the people were Vaishnava saints or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bhagats</hi>; and to their initiative is due the almost exclusive use as a
                    poetic dialect of that form of archaic Hindi known as Braj-bhäkhä. Vaishnavism
                    was essentially a reaction against Brahmanical influence and the chains of
                    caste, a claim for the rights of humanity against the monopoly which the
                    “twice-born ’’ asserted of learning, of worship, of righteousness. As Siva was
                    the peculiar deity of the Brahmans, so was Vishnu of the people; and while the
                    literature of the Sai vas and éâktas is almost entirely in Sanskrit, and
                    exercised little or no influence on the popular mind, that of the Vaishnavas is
                    mainly in Hindi, and in itself constitutes the great bulk of what has been
                    written in that language.</p>
                <p>The Vaishnava doctrine is commonly carried back to Ramanuja, whose appearance is
                    placed by Wilson about the middle of the 12th century. He was a native of
                    Southern India, and had few immediate followers in the north. In the latter
                    region the new opinions were spread by Rämänand, whom the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhaktamälä</hi> makes the fourth head of the sect, and other authorities the
                    fifth; both Wilson and Trumpp place him about 1400 of our era. Nothing in Hindi
                    by Ramanuja has come down to us; of Rämänand we have one short poem in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grαηth</hi> (Introduction, p. cxxiv.). Between Ramanuja and
                    Rämänand (though not in the line of teachers descending direct from the former)
                    we may place Jaideo (about 1250) and Nämdeo (about 1300), of the first of whom
                    we have a fragment in the <hi rend="italic">Granth,</hi> and of the second six
                    pieces have been similarly preserved. Jaideo was a Brahman, and well acquainted
                    with Sanskrit; but Nämdeo (or Nämä) was a <hi rend="italic">chhïpï</hi> or
                    calico-printer, a very despised class, and was perhaps the first to proclaim
                    among the followers of the new doctrine the essential unity of mankind as
                    worshippers of Hari. Kabir comes next, and is incomparably the greatest, in the
                    order of Vaishnava teachers. He was a weaver by caste, and in all probability
                    originally a Musalmän. He is counted among the twelve disciples of Rämänand; but
                    he seems himself to trace his spiritual paternity rather to Jaideo and
                    Nämä.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This may be
                    concluded from a short poem in the <hi rend="italic">Grαnth</hi> (p. 469), where
                    Kabir says (verses 4, 5):—“Let each one seek this Mind, O brother: when the body
                    falls away, where shall the Mind be absorbed? By the favour of the Guru Jaideo
                    and Nämä through the love of Faith attained to knowledge of Him.” (The <hi
                    rend="italic">Mind</hi> is the indwelling Râma, <hi rend="italic"
                    >divinae</hi><hi rend="italic">particula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >auroe.)</hi></p></note> He dwelt first at Benares and afterwards at Magahar, in
                    the present district of Gorakhpur, during the reign of Sikandar Shäh Lodi
                    (1488-1517), and was probably dead before the end of the 15th century. Nänak,
                    the first Guru of the Sikhs, whose <hi rend="italic">Granth</hi> is little more
                    than a paraphrase of Kabir’s writings, was born in 1469 and died in 1538; and
                    from the relation between the two it seems necessary to suppose that Kabir was
                    several years the senior.</p>
                <p>The works attributed to Kabir are very numerous; they are preserved complete at
                    the headquarters of the sect, the <hi rend="italic">Kabir chaura</hi> at
                    Benares, and many portions of them have been separately printed and lithographed
                    in India. The best known are those entitled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sakhis,Sabds,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rekhtas,</hi> which have a wide
                    popularity even among those who are not professed disciples of the saint.
                    Several of the compositions enumerated under the name of Kabir are, however, not
                    by him, but by his disciples: as the lesser <hi rend="italic">Bïjak,</hi> by
                    Bhago-Däs, the <hi rend="italic">Sukh-Nidhän,</hi> by Srut-Gopäl, &amp;c.; it
                    was the custom (as also that of Kabir’s religious heirs, the Sikh Gurus) for the
                    successors in the guruship to speak in the name of him whose successors they
                    were. The doctrine of Kabir<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>was philosophically a form of pantheism, accounting for the existence of
                    phenomena (the reality of which was denied) by the agency of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maya,</hi> or illusion, emanating from the Supreme. The varied lot of men in
                    life, their differences of faith and aim, their desires, fears, hopes, loves,
                    are all the work of this <hi rend="italic">Mäyä,</hi> to know which, and to
                    recognize beneath all the Supreme, is the only means of emancipation from the
                    chains of illusion. Neither austerities, ritual, nor works of any kind are
                    necessary to obtain the highest end; this is only to be gained by <hi
                    rend="italic">bhakti,</hi><hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> faith,” and perpetual
                    meditation on the Supreme—His names, <hi rend="italic">Hari, Ram, Govind,</hi>
                    being ever on the lips and in the heart. The highest end is absorption in the
                    Supreme, reunion with Him from whom all proceeded and who exists in all. Little
                    place is left in this somewhat barren doctrine for a social code, since works
                    are naught; but negatively, at least, it.is inoffensive, commanding respect for
                    all forms of life, and quiet performance of duty without self-seeking or desire
                    for gain.</p>
                <p>Of the spiritual followers of Kabir many have left memorials in literature; one
                    of the most eminent of these was Dädü, founder of a sect very prevalent in
                    Räjpütänä. A translation of two chapters from the <hi rend="italic">Granth</hi>
                    or scripture of this <hi rend="italic">Bhagat</hi> will be found in a note to
                    Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">Religious Sects of the Hindus,</hi> pp. 106-113, and
                    will repay perusal. But those whose compositions, if not most excellent from a
                    literary point of view, have at any rate wrought most in history, were the Gurus
                    or spiritual heads of the Sikhs of the Panjâb. The <hi rend="italic">Adi
                    Granth,</hi> or Book of the first five Gurus (from Nänak, who died in 1538, to
                    Arjun, who died in 1601), is described by its translator as “perhaps the most
                    shallow and empty book that exists, in proportion to its size;” and certainly
                    the translation is not attractive reading. But the doctrines, reiterated with
                    the most painful diffuseness, are essentially those of Kabir, much of whose
                    writings has been incorporated in the volume. The language is rather Old Hindi
                    than Old Panjabi, and thus the work falls within the scope of this article;
                    though Panjabi words and idioms frequently occur, the grammar is Hindi; and the
                    authors evidently aimed at propagating their tenets rather among the
                    Hindi-speaking races of Hindustan proper than (as actually happened) among the
                    Panjabi-speaking tribes of the West and South-West. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Granth</hi> consists of six parts: I., the <hi rend="italic">Japfi,</hi> the
                    only portion as yet published in Europe in the original Hindi; II., III., and
                    IV., arrangements for devotional purposes of extracts from Part V., the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rägs</hi> or body of the <hi rend="italic">Granth;</hi> of these
                    <hi rend="italic">Rags</hi> there are thirty-one, but only four, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sm Rag, Majh, Gauri,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Asa,</hi> have
                    been rendered by Trumpp; the remaining twenty-seven are described as “a second
                    gathering or gleaning, as materials offered themselves, no attention being paid
                    to the contents, but only to the bulky size of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Granthf</hi> VI., the <hi rend="italic">Bhog</hi> or conclusion, containing
                    verses by various authors, among them Kabir and Shekh Farid of Pâkpattan, a
                    famous Indian <hi rend="italic">Sufi,</hi> and panegyrics of the five Gurus by
                    fifteen <hi rend="italic">bhαtts</hi> or bards. At the end of each Räg is a
                    collection of sayings of the <hi rend="italic">Bhagats,</hi> chiefly of Kabir,
                    in confirmation of the doctrines set forth by the Gurus; and it is in these
                    additions that the literary importance of the work, as a treasure of specimens
                    of early Hindi, mainly consists.</p>
                <p>Another of the following of Rämänand, though consider ably later in time than
                    Kabir, was Sür-Däs. Of his life little is known: as some of his verses are
                    included in the <hi rend="italic">Granth,</hi> he must have lived before its
                    redaction (about 1600); if he be the same as a saint of that name mentioned in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamalä,</hi> as is probable, he was a Brahman, <hi
                    rend="italic">amvn</hi> or revenue collector of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >parganah</hi> of Sandilä in Oudh during the reign of Akbar, who is related to
                    have appropriated the collections of his district for the service of the temple
                    of Madan-Mohan at Brindäban, sending to the treasury instead chests filled with
                    stones. When his delinquency was discovered, he was pardoned by Akbar, but
                    thenceforth abandoned the world, and, becoming blind, led a wandering life as a
                    singer of the praises of Vishnu. His stanzas, generally of four lines <hi
                    rend="italic">(padas),</hi> are said to number no less than 125,000; they are
                    collected in a huge volume entitled the <hi rend="italic">Sür-Sägar,</hi> and
                    are extremely popular.</p>
                <p>While the sects of which Rämänand may be considered the spiritual father adore
                    the Deity chiefly under the names of <hi rend="italic">Rama, Hari, Goviηd,</hi>
                    and dwell but little on the <hi rend="italic">avatars</hi> or human incarnations
                    of the Hindu god whom they have selected as the type of the Supreme, there is
                    another division of the λ <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> aishnavas which is not
                    less important in Hindi authorship, and counts its adherents by millions, whose
                    worship is of a different character. The sects belonging to this division take
                    Krishna as their favourite type of the godhead, and, accepting the whole mass of
                    legends (most of them probably of comparatively late origin) relating to this
                    incarnation, inspire themselves with fervour by the contemplation chiefly of
                    Krishna’s childhood and his youth in the society of the herd-maidens of Braj. As
                    the doctrine and object of worship are, so also is the mode of life. The
                    Rämänandis are for the most part men of ascetic and unworldly life, not indeed
                    given to self-torture or needless rigour, but caring nothing for the wealth of
                    the world, and living quietly and soberly in the possession of what they deem
                    the truth. The worshippers of Krishna and his mistress Rädhä, or of the infant
                    Bäl-Gopäl, on the other hand, are no ascetics, but persons of luxurious and
                    often opulent lives; among women especially this form of devotion is widespread.
                    The chief sect of this denomination is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vallabhächäris,</hi> or the following of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gokulastha</hi><hi rend="italic">Gosaïhs.</hi> Their founder was one Vallabha
                    Swâmï, a Brahman from the south, wffio settled at Gokul near Mathurä, probably
                    about the beginning of the 16th century. The best known works of this sect are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Braj-biläs,</hi> a description of Krishna’s sports with
                    the maidens of Brindâban, by Brajbäsi-Däs, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Värttä,</hi> a 'collection of legends regarding eighty-four teachers of the
                    following, resembling the <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamälä,</hi> which deals chiefly
                    with the other division of Vaishnavas. The popularity of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brαj-</hi><hi rend="italic">biläs</hi> is immense, and it is to be found in a
                    lithographed form for sale in every bazaar. Its contents (as indeed many other
                    productions of the worshippers of Krishna) have been condemned by Europeans as
                    indecent; but although containing much that seems at least outwardly licentious
                    and prurient, it is a work the study of which is indispensable to one who w ould
                    understand the religious temper of the Hindus. The mystic dwelling on the amours
                    of Krishna and the <hi rend="italic">Gοpιt</hi> of Braj has been often compared
                    to the mystical interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">Song of Solomon;</hi>
                    and in most religions we shall perhaps find at least one phase in which the
                    sensual is curiously mingled with the spiritual, and faith and love towards the
                    heavenly stimulated by thoughts and phrases drawn from earthly scenes of
                    passion. Of the <hi rend="italic">Värttä</hi> we shall speak under the next
                    division of our subject.</p>
                <p>2. Middle Hindi reaches from about 1570 to 1750. To this age belong the best
                    poets of Hindi literature, Kesav-Däs, Bihäri-Läl, and Tulsi-Däs, whose writings
                    are no less remarkable for skill and subtlety of language than for perfection of
                    metrical form. The labours of their predecessors had wrought the language of
                    western Hindustan into a medium worthy of being put to the highest poetic use;
                    and we accordingly find in the poets of this period large borrowings from Braj,
                    even where (as with Tulsi-Däs) that idiom is not the dialect of their own
                    region. From their day onward Braj-bhäkhä has been esteemed (in the words of
                    Lallü-Läl) “the standard language of sentiment <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n885/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0885-0846"/><hi rend="italic">(mahärasa-mül),</hi> and equal
                    to the speech of the gods” (ie., Sanskrit).</p>
                <p>Kesav-Däs was a Brahman who lived under Jahangir and Shähjahän. He was the author
                    of a poem on Räma, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Rämachandrikä,</hi> written in
                    1602; the <hi rend="italic">Kavi-priya,</hi> written in the same year, a
                    treatise on the poetic art of much celebrity; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rasik-prvyα,</hi> on rhetoric, written in 1592: the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhakta-lllämmta,</hi> an exposition of the doctrine of Rämänandi Vaishnavism;
                    and several other works. Kesav-Däs’s compositions are widely popular, and have
                    been frequently lithographed in Northern India.</p>
                <p>Bihäri-Läl is renowned as the author of the <hi rend="italic">Sat-sai,</hi> a
                    collection of 700 distichs, which is perhaps the most celebrated work of Hindi
                    poetic <hi rend="italic">art,</hi> as distinguished from narrative and simpler
                    styles. They are inspired by the Krishna side of Vishnu-worship, and take the
                    form of amorous dialogues between Rädhä and the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gopns</hi> and their lover. The author was a native of Goäliyär, and lived at
                    Amber during the early part of the 17th century. Editions of this work, one of
                    the most difficult in Hindi and abounding in subtle conceits, are very numerous.
                    It has been commented on by a crowd of scholars, among them, strange to say,
                    more than one Musalmän,—a sufficient proof of the value set by natives of India,
                    irrespective of their creed, on its perfection of language. It has even been
                    translated into Sanskrit.</p>
                <p>Tulsi-Däs, though perhaps inferior in poetic skill to the two last mentioned, is
                    undoubtedly the most popular Hindi poet. His <hi rend="italic">Rämäyan</hi>
                    (originally named by the author <hi rend="italic">Räm-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >charit-manas,</hi> or “the Lake of Räma’s deeds ”) is perhaps better known
                    among Hindus in Upper India than the Bible among the rustic population of
                    England. He was a Kanauji Brahman, and probably (from his language) a native of
                    Oudh. The greater part of his life he spent at Benares; he died in 1624. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Rämäyan</hi> was commenced at Ayodhyä in 1573. Besides this great
                    work, he is the author of six other poems, all bearing more or less on the
                    history and worship of Räma, called the <hi rend="italic">Räm-gitävali,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dohävali,</hi> thè <hi rend="italic">Kabit-sambandh,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Binay-patrikä,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Pad-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rämäyan,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ghhandavali.</hi> Seven
                    other minor works are attributed to him, but their authenticity is doubtful.</p>
                <p>Tulsi’s <hi rend="italic">Rämäyan</hi> is a rehandling of the great theme of
                    Välmiki, but in no sense a translation of the Sanskrit poem; real translations
                    are scarcely to be found in original Hindi literature, the vernacular authors
                    permitting themselves great liberty of excision, adaptation, and addition. It
                    consists of seven books, of which the first two, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bäl-känd</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ayodhyä-känd,</hi> make up more than half
                    the work, and relates the birth and boyhood of Räma and his brethren, his
                    marriage with Sitä, their dwelling together in the forest, her abduction by
                    Rävan, the expedition to Lankä and the overthrow of the ravisher, and the life
                    at Ayodhyä after the return of the reunited pair. It is written chiefly in <hi
                    rend="italic">dohäs, sorathäs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chaupäns,</hi> with
                    here and there a <hi rend="italic">clihand</hi> interspersed; the style is very
                    even and well sustained, and the language, while fundamentally the Old Pürbi of
                    eastern Hindustan, borrows largely from Braj. The most admired portion of the
                    work is the second book, <hi rend="italic">Ayodhyä,</hi> which tells of the
                    mischief wrought by Kaikeyι, one of the queens of Dasaratb, Räma’s father, who
                    had bound himself by a vow to grant her what boon she should . ask, and whom by
                    this bond she compelled to command Räma and Sitä to go into exile in the great
                    forest south of the Jumna, and to give the throne to her own son Bharat. In this
                    trouble Dasarath dies, and his son obediently goes forth with his wife and his
                    brother Lachhman to the southern wilderness. The sorrow of Dasarath, the sweet
                    filial piety and perfect manhood of the divine Räma, the valour and prompt
                    affection of Lachhman, the sincerity and humility of Bharat, the purity and
                    wifely obedience of Sitä, are themes which a Hindu reader is never tired of
                    dwelling upon in Tulsi’s pages. And unlike though the treatment be to our own
                    standards of taste, overgrown with theological digressions and explanations, and
                    stocked with conventional images and stereotyped phrases as the poem is, even a
                    European may find in it something of literary achievement which appeals to him,
                    however distantly, as the work of a master of the heart. The first two books of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rämäyan</hi> have been admirably rendered into English
                    prose by Mr F. S. Growse (Allahabad, 1877-78).</p>
                <p>Tulsi, though essentially a Hindu and a Brahman in religious feeling, yet belongs
                    to the class of Vaishnavas who count among them Rämänand and Kabir. He has
                    little or nothing of the sensual passion of the devotees of Krishna and Rädhä;
                    and in the commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamälä</hi> it is related
                    that, when in his old age he paid a visit to Brindäban, the centre of the
                    Krishna-cult, he refused to render homage to any other form of the god than
                    Räma. According to the legend, he was beguiled into a temple of Krishna, and
                    bidden there to worship Räma; he answered that he would only bow his head before
                    one who should bear in his hand the bow and arrows of the king of Ayodhyä;
                    hearing his speech, the image-of the god, standing till then as Krishna with the
                    flute <hi rend="italic">lfBansidhaf),</hi> suddenly changed to the similitude of
                    Räma with the bow.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamälä,</hi> or “Roll of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhagatsf</hi> is a celebrated work of this period, and is ascribed to Näbhäji,
                    a Vaishnava of the despised caste called <hi rend="italic">Doms</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Dompäs,</hi> who lived during the reign of Jahängir, and was a
                    contemporary of Tulsi-Däs. The <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamälä,</hi> in the form in
                    which it is commonly met with, consists of a <hi rend="italic">mül,</hi> or
                    original text, ascribed to Näbhäji, and a <hi rend="italic">ffkä,</hi> or
                    commentary, of which there are two, due respectively to Krishna Däs and
                    Priya-Däs, both stated to have been written in 1713, in verse, and many more in
                    prose. The <hi rend="italic">mül</hi> is a short stanza <hi rend="italic"
                    >(chhappαι)</hi> for each saint, the first line of which is repeated again at
                    the end, stating, in the briefest and most obscure language, his
                    characteristics. The original work of Näbhäji was amplified and added to by
                    Näräyan-Däs, who lived during the reign of Shähjahän. Mr Growse justly says of
                    it:—“The style (of the <hi rend="italic">mül)</hi> might be described as of
                    unparalleled obscurity, were it not that each separate portion of the text is
                    followed by a <hi rend="italic">fikä,</hi> or gloss, in which confusion is still
                    worse confounded by a series of the most disjointed and inexplicit allusions to
                    different legendary events in the saint’s life.” A considerable portion of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamälä</hi> was printed in 1817 in Major Price’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hindi and Hindustani Selections,</hi> and it has been largely
                    drawn upon by Wilson in his account of the religious sects of the Hindus. The
                    saints treated in it are chiefly of the class of Vaishnavas addicted to the
                    worship of Räma; and the anecdotes of them contained in the work are generally
                    insipid and extravagant in the extreme. “Such as it is, however, it exercises a
                    powerful influence in Upper India on popular belief, and bolds a similar place
                    in the superstitions of this country to that which was occupied, in the darkest
                    ages of the Roman Catholic faith, by the <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Acts of the Saints</hi>” (Wilson).</p>
                <p>The other side of Vaishnavism, that devoted to the cult of the infant or youthful
                    Krishna, with or without his mistress Rädhä, is represented by a work similar in
                    character to the <hi rend="italic">Bhaktamälä,</hi> called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Värttä,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chauräsi Värttä,</hi> already mentioned.
                    Specimens of its contents will be found in Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">Religious
                    Sects of the Hindus,</hi> p. 132. Its legends are of the most trivial and
                    childish description; but, with the tenth chapter of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhägavata Puräna,</hi> rendered into Braj-bhäkhä by Chaturbhuj Misr, and into
                    modern Hindi in 1804-10 by Lallü Läl, they are nevertheless the inspirera of the
                    greater part of the popular worship throughout the whole of Northern India. The
                    universality <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n886/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0886-0847"/> of the cult of the infant Krishna may be judged
                    by the enormous number of Hindu proper names which end in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lal,</hi> meaning “child,” all of which embody some reference to this deity in
                    his youthful form. In Bengal especially the sect is extremely numerous, having
                    there arisen out of the teaching of Chaitanya, who is said to have married a
                    daughter of Vallabhächärya, and is believed by his followers to have been
                    himself an incarnation of Krishna.</p>
                <p>Such, in the briefest outline, is the character of Hindi literature during the
                    period when it grew and flourished through its own original forces. Founded by a
                    popular impulse in many respects similar to that which gave rise to Buddhism
                    nearly 2000 years before, and cultivated chiefly (though by no means
                    exclusively) by authors not belonging to the Brahmanical order, it was the
                    legitimate descendant in spirit, as Hindi is the legitimate descendant in
                    speech, of the Prakrit literature which preceded it. Entirely in verse, it
                    adopted and elaborated the Prakrit metrical forms, and carried them to a pitch
                    of perfection which is too often overlooked by those who concern themselves
                    rather with the substance than with the form of the works they study. The
                    language of these.compositions strikes us often as rude, abrupt, and ambiguous;
                    undoubtedly in its earlier specimens it is wanting in clearness and definiteness
                    of grammatical form ∙, but the shackles of metre are frequently the explanation
                    of uncouth forms of speech, and the necessity of filling out a metrical scheme
                    led in too many cases to irregularities and amplifications which had perhaps no
                    representatives in the uncompelled utterances of the vernacular tongue.
                    Interesting when regarded in the mass, its attractions in detail are few. As in
                    all Oriental literature, repetition and shallowness of idea overcome it, and
                    render an extensive course of reading intolerable to a European. Conventional
                    images, platitudes exhausted to the utmost degree of tenuity, barren
                    philosophical and theological themes which in their wideness entirely overlook
                    the study of detail,—such are, with few exceptions, its leading features; and
                    one who has read two or three books has in truth made himself master of the
                    whole secret of original Hindi literature.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">origines</hi> of Urdu as a literary language are
                    extremely obscure. The popular account refers its rise to the time of Timur
                    (1398). Some authors even claim for it a higher antiquity, asserting that a <hi
                    rend="italic">diwan,</hi> or collection of poems, was composed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rekhtαh</hi> by Mas'üd, son of Sa*d, in the last half of the 11th
                    and beginning of the 12th century, and that Sa'di of Shiraz and his friend Amir
                    Khusrau of Dehli likewise made verses in that dialect before the end of the 13th
                    century. This, however, is very questionable; and the better opinion appears to
                    be that these ancient compositions, if they existed at all, were written in
                    Hindi according to the metrical forms of that language, rather than in what is
                    properly called Urdu. That Muhammadans composed in Hindi, and used that language
                    as their vernacular, is certain; and in many passages of Kabir, which are
                    nevertheless pure Hindi compositions, Persian words are used almost as freely as
                    in the modern dialect. Much of the confusion which besets the subject is due to
                    the want of a clear definition of what Urdû, as opposed to Hindi, really is.</p>
                <p>Urdü, as a literary language, differs from Hindi rather in its form than in its
                    substance. The really vital point of difference, that in which Hindi and Urdu
                    are incommensurable, is the prosody. Hardly one of the metres taken over by Urdu
                    poets from Persian agrees with those used in Hindi; in the latter language, it
                    is the rule to give the short <hi rend="italic">a</hi> inherent in every
                    consonant or group of consonants its full value in scansion, except occasionally
                    at the metrical pause: in Urdu this is never done, the only somewhat analogous
                    rule providing for the enunciation of a short <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (the <hi
                    rend="italic">nτm-fathaK)</hi> after a nexus of consonants which would otherwise
                    be pronounced without it; the great majority of Hindi metres are counted by the
                    number of syllabic instants or <hi rend="italic">mäträs</hi> (the value in time
                    of a short syllable): in Urdu the metres follow a special order of longs and
                    shorts.</p>
                <p>The question, then, is not—When did Persian first become intermixed with Hindi in
                    the literary speech ?—for this process began with the first entry of Muslim
                    conquerors into India, and continued for centuries before a line of Urdu was
                    composed;—nor, When was the Persian character first employed to write Hindi <hi
                    rend="italic">1—</hi> for the written form is but a subordinate matter. We must
                    ask—When was the first verse composed in Hindi, whether with or without foreign
                    admixture, according to the forms of Persian prosody and not in those of the
                    indigenous metrical system? Then, and not till then, did Urdu come into being.
                    If, then, it is really the case that poems were so composed as early as the 11th
                    or the 13th century, the origin of Urdu literature must be carried back to that
                    period. But Hindi itself was at that date, and for many decades later (as we see
                    from Chand and our other earliest specimens of the language), in an unsettled
                    and transition stage. Neither in its caseinflexions nor in its verbal forms did
                    it resemble the language which we know as Urdü. It abounded in short vowels and
                    hiatuses, which could not accommodate themselves either to the Persian character
                    (without the free use of vowel-signs and <hi rend="italic">hαmzαh,</hi> which
                    were seldom employed) or to Persian prosody; and its syntactical order was loose
                    and unsettled» Urdü, as we know it, is the Hindi of the end of the 16th century
                    enriched from Persian, not the Hindi of Chand and the early <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhagats.</hi></p>
                <p>The whole of Urdu poetry follows Persian models of composition; its themes are
                    those which had already been worked (some might say, worked out) by writers in
                    that language; and neither in form nor substance do we find the faintest flavour
                    of originality from its commencement to the present day.</p>
                <p>The paucity of themes and want of originality in Urdu verse has led to a most
                    elaborate development of the system of rhetoric. Where the substance of what a
                    poet has to say is identical with that which has been said by hundreds, nay
                    thousands, of poets before him, it is of the highest importance that the way of
                    saying it shall if possible be peculiar to himself. Rhetoric, accordingly,
                    rather than poetic feeling, is the distinguishing feature of composition in
                    Urdu. Pleasing hyperbole, ingenious comparison, antithesis, alliteration,
                    carefully arranged gradation of noun and epithet, are the means employed to
                    obtain variety; and few of the most eloquent passages of Urdu verse admit of
                    translation into any other language without losing that which in the original
                    makes their whole charm. Even in the <hi rend="italic">masηavis,</hi> or
                    narrative poems, the story is usually quite a subordinate matter; it has in most
                    cases been handled time after time, and is familiar to the reader in its
                    minutest detail. Even when the names chosen for the actors are new, the intrigue
                    is old, and the mode in which it is unfolded is the only thing which
                    distinguishes one poem from another. The descriptions thus, confined within a
                    narrow circle of incident and epithet, repeat each other with a monotony which
                    to a European is inexpressibly fatiguing, but which in the East is deemed rather
                    a merit than a defect. Differences of school, which are made much of by native
                    critics, are to us hardly perceptible; they consist in the use of one or other
                    range of metaphor and comparison, classed, according as they repeat the
                    well-worn poetical stock-in-trade of the Persians or seek a slightly fresher and
                    more Indian field of sentiment, as the old or the new style of composition.</p>
                <p>These being the nature and features of Urdu poetry, it will be manifest that such

                <p>The earliest Urdü authors lived and wrote in the Dakkhan, at the courts and under
                    the patronage of the Muhammadan dynasties of Golkonda and Bîjâpur, shortly
                    before these dynasties were overthrown by the campaigns of Aurangzeb in the
                    south. Shujâ'uddïn Nüri, a native of Gujarat, a friend of Faizi and contemporary
                    of Akbar, is mentioned by the native biographers as the most ancient Urdü poet
                    after Amir Khusrau. He was tutor of the son of the <hi rend="italic">wazir</hi>
                    of Sultan Abu-l-Hasan Qutb Shall of Golkonda, and several <hi rend="italic"
                    >ghazals</hi> by him are said to survive. Qulι Qutb Shäh of Golkonda, who
                    reigned from 1581 to 1586, and his successor'Abdullah Qutb Shah, who came to the
                    throne in 1611, have both left collections of verse, including <hi rend="italic"
                    >ghazals, rubais, masnavis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qaξidahs.</hi> And during
                    the reign of the latter lbn Nishäti wrote two works which are still famous as
                    models of composition in Dakhni; they are <hi rend="italic">masnavis</hi>
                    entitled the <hi rend="italic">Tüti-nämah,</hi> or “Tales of a Parrot,” and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Phül-ban.</hi> The first, written in 1639, is an adaptation of
                    a Persian work by Nakhshabi, but derives ultimately from a Sanskrit original
                    entitled the <hi rend="italic">suka-saptati</hi>; this collection has been
                    frequently rehandled in Urdu, both in verse and prose, and is the original of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Totâ-</hi><hi rend="italic">Kahdni,one</hi> of the first
                    works in Urdü prose, composed in 1801 by Muhammad Haidar-bakhsh Haidari of the
                    Fort William College. The <hi rend="italic">Phûl-ban</hi> is a love tale named
                    from its heroine, said to be translated from a Persian work entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Basâtïn.</hi> Another famous work which probably belongs to the
                    same place and time is the <hi rend="italic">Story of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kämrup</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic">Kalä</hi> by
                    Tahsιnuddιn, a <hi rend="italic">masnavi</hi> which has been published (1836) by
                    Μ. Garcin de Tassy; what makes this poem remarkable is that, though the work of
                    a Musalmän, its personages are Hindu. Kämrüp, the hero, is son of the king of
                    Oudh, and the heroine, Kalä, daughter of the king of Ceylon; the incidents
                    somewhat resemble those of the tale of es-Sindibäd in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thousand and One Nights</hi>; the hero and heroine dream one of the other, and
                    the former sets forth to find his beloved; his wanderings take him to many
                    strange countries and through many wonderful adventures, ending in a happy
                    marriage.</p>
                <p>The court of Bîjâpur was no less distinguished in literature. Ibrâhîm <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Adil Shah (1579 -1626) was the author of a work in
                    verse on music entitled the <hi rend="italic">Nau-ras</hi> or “Nine Savours,”
                    which, however, appears to have been in Hindi rather than Urdü; the three
                    prefaces <hi rend="italic">(fibajahs}</hi> to this poem were rendered into
                    Persian prose by Mania Zuhüri, and, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Sih
                    nasr-i Zuhuri, are</hi> well-known models of style. A successor of this prince,
                    ’ Ali ’ Adil Shah, had as his court poet a Brahman known poetically as Nus-rati,
                    who in 1657 composed a <hi rend="italic">masnavi</hi> of some repute entitled
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gulshan-i 'Islιq,</hi> or “Rose-garden of Love,” a romance
                    relating the history of Prince Manohar and Madmâlatï,—like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kämrup,</hi> an Indian theme. The same poet is author of an extremely long <hi
                    rend="italic">mas· navi</hi> entitled the <hi rend="italic">'Ali-namah,</hi>
                    celebrating the monarch under whom he lived.</p>
                <p>These early authors, however, were but pioneers and feelers of the way; the first
                    generally accepted standard of form, a standard which has suffered little change
                    in two centuries, was established by Wall of Aurangabad (about 1680-1720) and
                    his contemporary and fellow-townsman Siräj. The former of these is commonly
                    called “the Father of Rekhtah”— <hi rend="italic">Bäbä-e</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rekhtah</hi>; and all accounts agree that the immense development attained by
                    Urdu poetry in Northern India during the 18th century was due to his example and
                    initiative. Very little is known of Wall’s life; he is believed to have visited
                    Dehli towards the end of the reign of Aurangzeb, and is said to have there
                    received instruction from Shâh Gulshanin the art of clothing in a vernacular
                    dress the ideas of the Persian poets. His <hi rend="italic">Kulliyät</hi> or
                    complete works have been published by Μ. Garcin de Tassy, with notes and a
                    translation of selected passages (Paris, 1834-36), and may be commended to
                    readers desirous of consulting in the original a favourable specimen of Urdu
                    poetical composition.</p>
                <p>The first of the Dehli school of poets was Zuhüruddîn Hätim, who was born in 1699
                    and died in 1792. In the second year of Muhammad Shah (1719), the <hi
                    rend="italic">diwan</hi> of Wall reached Dehli, and excited the emulation of
                    scholars there. Hätim was the first to imitate it in the Urdu of the north, and
                    was followed by his friends Nâjî, Mazmûn, and Äbrii. Two <hi rend="italic"
                    >diwäns</hi> by him survive. He became the founder of a school, and one of his
                    pupils was Rafi'us-Saudâ, the most distinguished poet of Northern India. Khân
                    Arzü (1689-1756) was another of the fathers of Urdû poetry in the north. This
                    author is chiefly renowned as a Persian scholar, in which language he not only
                    composed much poetry, but one of the best of Persian lexicons, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siräju-l-lughät</hi>; but his compositions in Urdu are also highly
                    esteemed. He was the master of Mir Taqi, who ranks next to Saudä as the most
                    eminent Urdu poet. Ärzü died at Lakhnau (Lucknow), whither he betook himself
                    after the devastation of Dehli by Nadir Shâh (1739). Another of the early Dehli
                    poets who is considered to have surpassed his fellows was In'ämulläh Khân Yaqin,
                    who died during the reign of Ahmad Shâh (1748-54), aged only twenty-five.
                    Another was Mir Dard, pupil of the same Shâh Gulshan who is said to have
                    instructed Wall; his <hi rend="italic">diwan</hi> is not long, but extremely
                    popular, and especially esteemed for the skill with which it develops the themes
                    of spiritualism. In his old age he became a <hi rend="italic">darwesh</hi> of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Naqshbandi</hi> following, and died in 1793.</p>
                <p>Saudä and Mir Taqi are beyond question the most distinguished Urdu poets. The
                    former was born at Dehli about the beginning of the 18th century, and studied
                    under Hätim. He left Dehli after its devastation, and settled at Lakhnau, where
                    the Nawäb Äsafud-daulah gave him <hi rend="italic">njägir</hi> of Rs. 6000 a
                    year, and where he died in 1780. His poems are very numerous, and cover all the
                    styles of Urdû poetry; but it is to his satires that his fame is chiefly due,
                    and in these he is considered to have surpassed all other Indian poets. Mir Taqi
                    was born at Agra, but early removed to Dehli, where he studied under Arzü; he
                    was still living there at the time of Saudä’s death, but in 1782 repaired to
                    Lakhnau, where he likewise received a pension; he died at a very advanced age in
                    1810. His works are very voluminous, including no less than six <hi
                    rend="italic">diwäns.</hi> Mir is counted the superior of Saudä in the <hi
                    rend="italic">ghazal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">masnavi,</hi> while the latter
                    excelled him in the satire and <hi rend="italic">qaξidah.</hi> Sayyid Ahmad, an
                    excellent contemporary authority, and himself one of the best of modern authors
                    in Urdu, says of him in his <hi rend="italic">Asäru-s-Sanädid</hi>:—“Mir’s
                    language is so pure, and the expressions which he employs so suitable and
                    natural, that to this day all are unanimous in his praise. Although the language
                    of Saudä is also excellent, and he is superior to Mir in the point of his
                    allusions, he is nevertheless inferior to him in style.”</p>
                <p>The tremendous misfortunes which befell Dehli at the hands of Nädir Shäh (1739),
                    Ahmad Shâh Durrani (1756), and the Maräthäs (1759), and the rapid decay of the
                    Mughal empire underthese repeated shocks, transferred the centre of the
                    cultivation of literature from that city to Lakhnau, the capital of the newly
                    founded and flourishing state of Oudh. It has been mentioned how Arzü, Saudä,
                    and Mir betook themselves to this refuge and ended their daysthere; they were
                    followed in their new residence by a school of poets hardly inferior to those
                    who had made Dehli illustrious in the first half of the century. Here they were
                    joined by Mir Hasan (died 1786), Mir Soz (died 1800), and Qalandar-bakbsh Jur’at
                    (died 1810), also like themselves refugees from Dehli, and illustrious poets.
                    Mir Hasan was a friend and collaborator of Mir Dard, and first established
                    himself at Faizäbäd and subsequently at Lakhnau; he excelled in the <hi
                    rend="italic">ghazal,</hi><hi rend="italic">rubä'i,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masnavi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">marsiyah,</hi> and is counted the third,
                    with Saudä and Mir Taqi, among the most eminent of Urdü poets. His fame chiefly
                    rests upon a much admired <hi rend="italic">masnavi</hi> entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sihru-l-</hi><hi rend="italic">bayân,</hi> or “Magic of
                    Eloquence,” a romance relating the loves of Prince Be-nazir and the Princess
                    Badr-i Munir; his <hi rend="italic">masnavi</hi> called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galzâr-i</hi><hi rend="italic">Iram</hi> (“Rose-garden of Irani,” the legendary
                    'Adite paradise in Southern Arabia), in praise of Faizäbäd, is likewise highly
                    esteemed. Mir Muhammadi Soz was an elegant poet, remarkable for the success with
                    which he composed in the dialect of the harem called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rekhti,</hi> but somewhat licentious in his verse; he became a <hi
                    rend="italic">darwesh</hi> and renounced the world in his later years. Jur’at
                    was also a prolific poet, but, like Soz, his <hi rend="italic">ghazals</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">masnavis</hi> are licentious and full of double meanings. He
                    imitated Saudä in satire with much success; he also cultivated Hindi poetry, and
                    composed <hi rend="italic">dohräs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kabitts.</hi>
                    Miskin was another Lakhnau poet of the same period, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >rnarsiyahs</hi> are especially admired; one of them, that on the death of
                    Muslim and his two sons, is considered a masterpiece of this style of
                    composition. The school of Lakhnau, so founded and maintained during the early
                    years of the century, continued to flourish till the dethronement of the last
                    king, Wäjid'Ali, in 1856. Ätash and Näsikh (who died respectively in 1847 and
                    1841) are the best among the modern poets of the school in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ghazal</hi>; Mir Anis, a grandson of Mir Hasan, and his contemporary Dabir, the
                    former of whom died in December 1875 and the latter a few months later, excelled
                    in the <hi rend="italic">marsiyah.</hi> Rajab Ali Beg Surür, who died in 1869,
                    was the author of a much-admired romance in rhyming prose entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasänah-e'Ajäib</hi> or “Tale of Marvels,” besides a <hi
                    rend="italic">diwän.</hi> The dethroned prince Wajid 'Ali himself, poetically
                    styled Akhtar, is no mean poet; he has published three <hi rend="italic"
                    >diwwns,</hi> among them a quantity of poetry in the rustic dialect of Oudh
                    which is philologically of much interest.</p>
                <p>Though Dehli was thus deserted by its brightest lights of literature, it did not
                    altogether cease to cultivate the poetic art. Among the last Mughals several
                    princes were themselves creditable poets. Shâh Âlam II. (1761-1806) wrote under
                    the name of Äftäb, and was the author of a romance entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manzii,m∙i Aqdas,</hi> besides a <hi rend="italic">diwan.</hi> His son
                    Sulaimän-shikoh, brother of Akbar Shâh II., who had at first, like his brother
                    authors, repaired to Lakhnau, returned to Dehli in 1815, and died in 1838; he
                    also has left a <hi rend="italic">diwän.</hi> Lastly, his nephew Bahädur Shâh

                    does not care to refer to the original vernacular works; the peculiarities of
                    the latter can be learned only from long-continued study and familiarity with
                    Oriental modes of thought.</p>

                <p>Dehli (died 1862), wrote under the name of Zafar, and was a pupil in poetry of
                    Shaikh Ibrâhîm Zauq, a distinguished writer; he has left a voluminous <hi
                    rend="italic">dlwän,</hi> which has been printed at Dehli. Mashafi (Ghulâm-i
                    Hamdânï), who died about 1814, was one of the most distinguished of the revived
                    poetic school of Dehli, and was himself one of its founders. Originally of
                    Lakhnau, he left that city for Dehli in 1777, and held conferences of poets, at
                    which several authors who afterwards acquired repute formed their style; he has
                    left five <hi rend="italic">diwans,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Tazkirah</hi> or
                    biography of Urdu poets, and a <hi rend="italic">Shäh-nämah</hi> or account of
                    the kings of Dehli down to Shäh 'Alam. Qâim (Qiyâmuddïn'Alï) was one of his
                    society, and died in 1792; he has left several works of merit. Ghalib, otherwise
                    Mirzâ Asadullâh Khân Naushäh, laureate of the last Mughal, who died in 1869, is
                    undoubtedly the most eminent of the modern Dehli poets. He wrote chiefly in
                    Persian, of which language, especially in the form cultivated by Firdausi, free
                    from intermixture of Arabic words, he was a master; but his Urdû <hi
                    rend="italic">diwän,</hi> though short, is excellent in its way, and his
                    reputation was spread far and wide. To this school, though he lived and died at
                    Agra, may be attached Mir Wall Muhammad Nazir (recently dead in 1832); his <hi
                    rend="italic">masnavis</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Jogi-nämah, Kauri-nämah,
                    Banjäre-nämah,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Burhäpe-närnah,</hi> as well as his
                    <hi rend="italic">dlwän,</hi> have been frequently reprinted, and are extremely
                    popular. His language is less artificial than that of the generality of Urdû
                    poets, and some of his poems have been printed in Nägari, and are as well known
                    and as much esteemed by Hindus as by Muhammadans.</p>
                <p>4. While such, in outline, is the history of the poetic schools of the Dakkhan,
                    Dehli, and Lakhnau, a fourth, that of the Fort William College at Calcutta, was
                    being formed, and was destined to give no less an impulse to the cultivation of
                    Urdu prose than had a hundred years before been given to that of poetry by Wall.
                    At the commencement of the present century Dr John Gilchrist was the head of
                    this institution, and his efforts were directed towards getting together a body
                    of literature suitable as text-books for the study of the Urdu language by the
                    European officers of the administration. To his exertions we owe the elaboration
                    of the vernacular as an official speech, and the possibility of substituting it
                    for the previously current Persian as the language of the courts and the
                    government. He gathered together at Calcutta the most eminent vernacular
                    scholars of the time, and their works, due to his initiative, are still
                    unsurpassed as specimens of elegant and serviceable prose composition, not only
                    in Urdu, but also in Hindi. The chief authors of this school are Haidari (Sayyid
                    Muhammad Haidar-bakhsh), Husaini (Mir Bahadur ‘Ali), Mir Amman Lutf, Hafizuddin
                    Ahmad, Sher 'All Afsos, Nihâl Chand of Lahore, Käzim ‘Ali Jawän, Lallü Läl Kavi,
                    Mazhar ’ Ali Wilä, and Ikräm 'Ali.</p>
                <p>Haidari died in 1828. He composed the <hi rend="italic">Tolä-Kahäni</hi> (1801),
                    a prose redaction of the <hi rend="italic">Tüti-nämah</hi> which has been

                    1802. The <hi rend="italic">Akhläq-i</hi><hi rend="italic">Hindi</hi> is an
                    adaptation of a Persian work called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mufarrihzι-l-qulub</hi> (“the Delighter of Hearts”), itself a version of the

                    left in the time of Ahmad Shah Durrani for Patna, and in 1801 repaired to
                    Calcutta. To him we owe the <hi rend="italic">Bägh</hi><hi rend="italic">o
                    Bahar</hi> (1801-2), an adaptation of Amir Khusrau’s famous Persian romance

                    “Story of the Four Dervishes.” Amman’s work is not itself directly modelled on
                    the Persian, but is a rehandling of an almost contemporary rendering by Tahsin
                    of Etäwä, called the <hi rend="italic">Nazι-tarz-i Murassd.</hi> The style of
                    this composition is much admired by natives of India, and editions of it are
                    very numerous. Amman also composed an imitation of Husain Wâ'iz Kâshifï’s <hi

                    entered the service of Qâsirn 'Ali Khân, Nawâb of Bengal; he afterwards repaired
                    to Haidarâbâd in the Dakhhan, and thence to Lakhnau, where he was the pupil of
                    Mir Hasan, Mir Soz, and Mir Haidar * Ali Hairän. He joined the Fort William
                    College in 1800, and died in 1809. He is the author of a much esteemed <hi

                    of Dr F. Dieterici (1858-1879); the chapter selected by lkram 'Ali is the third,
                    which records an allegorical strife for the mastery between men and animals
                    before the king of the <hi rend="italic">Jinn.</hi> The translation is written

                <p>Sri Lallü Läl was a Brahman, whose family, originally of Gujarat, had long been
                    settled in Northern India. What was done by the other Fort William authors for
                    Urdu prose was done by Lallü Läl almost alone for Hindi. His <hi rend="italic"

                    detailing the history of Krishna, and founded on a previous Braj-bhâkhâ version

                    The <hi rend="italic">Prem Sägar</hi> was begun in 1804 and ended in 1810; it
                    enjoys immense popularity in Northern India, has been frequently reproduced in a
                    lithographed form, and has several times been printed. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Räjniti</hi> was composed in 1809; it is much admired for its sententious
                    brevity and the purity of its language. Besides these two works, Lallü Läl was
                    the author of a collection of a hundred anecdotes in Hindi and Urdü entitled <hi

                    (Devanâgarî character) of a famous collection of legends relating the prowess of
                    King Vikramäditya; and he also aided the latter author in the production of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sakzzntalä Nätak.</hi> Mazhar 'Ali Wilä was his collaborator
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Baitäl</hi><hi rend="italic">Pachisi,</hi> a collection
                    of stories similar in many respects to the <hi rend="italic">Singhäsan</hi><hi

                    >Mädhunal,</hi> a romance originally composed in Braj-bhäkhä by Moti Räm.</p>
                <p>The works of these authors, though compiled and published under the
                    superintendence of Dr Gilchrist, Captain Abraham Lockett, Professor J. W.
                    Taylor, Dr W. Hunter, and other European officers of the College, are
                    essentially Indian in taste and style, and owe to this character a popularity
                    and wide reputation which have been gained by no other work (and there have been
                    many) undertaken under British initiative. If not absolutely the first works in
                    Urdü and Hindi prose, they were at any rate the first literary standards in
                    those languages; and almost the whole of recent prose authorship is due either
                    to their influence or to one of two other impulses, the first of which was
                    almost synchronous with the Fort William productions, and the other not many
                    years posterior to them. These were the reform in Islam led by Sayyid Ahmad, and
                    the introduction of lithography and a newspaper press.</p>
                <p>Sayyid Ahmad was born in 1782, and received his early education at Dehli; his
                    instructors were two learned Muslims, Shäh Abdu-l- ’ Aziz, author of a
                    celebrated commentary on the Qur’än (the <hi rend="italic">Tafsir-i
                    'Aziziyyah),</hi> and his brother’Abdu-1-Qädir, the writer of the first and best
                    translation of the Holy Volume into Urdü. Under their guidance Sayyid Ahmad
                    embraced the doctrines of the Wahhäbis, a sect whose preaching appears at this
                    time to have first reached India. He gathered round him a large number of
                    fervent disciples, among others Ismail Haji nephew of ’ Abdu-l-Aziz and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n889/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0889-0850"/> Abdu-1-Qâdir, the chief author of the sect. After
                    a course of preaching and apostleship at Dehli, Sayyid Ahmad set out in 1820 for
                    Calcutta, attended by numerous adherents. Thence in 1822 he started on a
                    pilgrimage to Mecca, whence he went to Constantinople, and was there received
                    with distinction and gained many disciples. He travelled for nearly six years in
                    Turkey and Arabia, and then returned to Dehli. The religious degradation and
                    coldness which he found in his native country strongly impressed him after his
                    sojourn in lands where the life of Islam is stronger, and he and his disciples
                    established a propaganda throughout N orthern India, reprobating the
                    superstitions which had crept into the faith from contact with Hindus, and
                    preaching a <hi rend="italic">jihäd</hi> or holy war against the Sikhs. In 1828
                    he started for Peshawar, attended by, it is said, upwards of 100,000 Indians,
                    and accompanied by his chief followers, Haji Ismail and 'Abdu-l-Hayy. He was
                    furnished with means by a general subscription in Northern India, and by several
                    Muhammadan princes who had embraced his doctrines. At the beginning of 1829 he
                    declared war against the Sikhs, and in the course of time made himself master of
                    Peshawar. The Afghans, however, with whom he had allied himself in the contest,
                    were soon disgusted by the rigour of his creed, and deserted him and his cause.
                    He fled across the Indus and took refuge in the mountains of Pakhli and Dhamtor,
                    where in 1831 he encountered a detachment of Sikhs under the command of Sher
                    Singh, and in the combat he and Haji Ismail were slain. His sect is, however, by
                    no means extinct; the Wahhabi doctrines have continued to gain ground in India,
                    and to give rise to much controversial writing, down to our own day.</p>
                <p>The translation of the Qur’an by Abdu-1-Qâdir was finished in 1803, and first
                    published by Sayyid Abdullâh, a fervent disciple of Sayyid Ahmad, at Hûghli in
                    1829. The <hi rend="italic">Tambihu-l-ghäfilin,</hi> or “Awakener of the
                    Heedless,” a work in Persian by Sayyid Ahmad, was rendered into Urdu by
                    'Abdullâh, and published at the same press in 1830. Hâji Ismâ'il was the author
                    of a treatise in Urdu entitled <hi rend="italic">Taqwiyatu-l-Imän</hi>
                    (“Confirmation of the Faith”), which had great vogue among the following of the
                    Sayyid. Other works by the disciples of the <hi rend="italic">Tariqah-e
                    Muhammadiyyah</hi> (as the new preaching was called) are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Targhιb∙i</hi><hi rend="italic">Jihäd</hi> (“Incitation to Holy War”), <hi
                    rend="italic">Hidäyatu-l-Mürninin</hi> (“Guide of the Believers”), <hi
                    rend="italic">Mûzihu-</hi><hi rend="italic">l-Kabäir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >wa·l·Bid'ah</hi> (“Exposition of Mortal Sins and Heresy”), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nasîhatu-l-Muslimïn</hi> (“Admonition to Muslims”), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mi'at</hi><hi rend="italic">Masâil,</hi> or “Hundred Questions.”</p>
                <p>Printing was first used for vernacular works by the College Press at Fort
                    William, and all the compositions prepared for Dr Gilchrist and his successors
                    which have been already mentioned were thus made public; but the expense of this
                    method of reproduction long precluded its extensive use in India, and the
                    ungraceful characters used as types were not appreciated by the natives. In 1837
                    the first lithographic press was set up at Dehli, and from that date onwards the
                    publications, original or editions of older works, issued in this shape annually
                    may be counted by hundreds. The newspaper press soon followed the introduction
                    of lithography, and there are at present about two hundred journals in Urdu and
                    Hindi printed in India, the majority in the North-Western Provinces, the Panjâb,
                    and Oudh, but a few at Madras, Haidarâbâd, Bangalore, Bombay, and Calcutta. The
                    extension taken by vernacular literature during the last thiι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> ty years is enormous, and to describe it adequately
                    would require a volume. The reader is referred for the best account of it to Μ.
                    Garcin de Tassy’s <hi rend="italic">Annual Summaries</hi> from 1850 to 1877,
                    where he will also find much interesting information regarding the nature and
                    value of the newspapers now so numerous. Here a few names only can be mentioned
                    which seem the most prominent among the crowd of writers who daily, by the cheap
                    and simple agency of a lithographic stone and bâzâr paper, make their ideas
                    public in Northern India.</p>
                <p>Sayyid Ahmad Khan Bahadur, C.S.I. (not to be confounded with the Wahhabi
                    reformer), is perhaps the most eminent and eloquent among contemporary writers
                    of Urdu. He is the author of numerous works, among others of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Âsâru-s-Sanâdïd</hi> (“Vestiges of Princes”), an excellent account
                    of Dehli and its monuments, which has passed through three editions (1847, 1854,
                    1876). His fame, however, chiefly rests upon his persevering efforts to raise
                    the standard of civilization and culture among his co-religionists, for which
                    purpose he has since 1870 issued a most valuable journal entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tahzïbu-l-Akhlâq,</hi> or “Muhammadan Social Reformer ’ (which,
                    unlike almost all its competitors, is printed with movable types). The articles
                    in this publication, chiefly of a religious or educational character, are of a
                    high order of excellence, and display most effectively the resources of the Urdû
                    language as a means of expressing modern ideas. Maulavi Nazir Ahmad of Dehli is
                    the author of two excellent stories named <hi rend="italic">Mir'ätu-l-'arüs</hi>
                    (“the Bride’s Mirror”) and <hi rend="italic">Taubatu·n·Nasuh</hi> (“the
                    Repentance of Nasûh”); and Pandit Kâshinâth of Agra has written a good treatise
                    on ethics, founded on Persian compilations on the subject, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Akhläq-i</hi><hi rend="italic">Kâshï.</hi> These three works have
                    received rewards from the Government of the North-Western Provinces, and enjoy
                    much popularity. The officers of the educational department have been prolific
                    in schoolbooks of various degrees of excellence. Mr H. S. Reid and his
                    assistants, Qamaruddin Gulâb Khân, Chiranjï Lâl, Pandit Bansïdhar, Sri Lâl, and
                    Mohan Lâl, were at work from 1851 to 1860 in this direction, and several good
                    translations and compilations are due to them. In the Panjâb Zukâullâh Khân of
                    Dehli, and Karimuddin and Pandit Ajodhyâ Parshâd of Lahore, have been no less
                    active; and Northern India is now well supplied with the means of elementary
                    education in the vernacular in literature, history, geography, and mathematics.
                    Science, owing to the difficulties of technical nomenclature, is less
                    efficiently represented, and the controversy regarding the best method of
                    clothing its vocabulary in a vernacular dress is hardly yet solved. Owing to the
                    fortunate circumstance that Urdü is able to draw for its vocabulary upon Persian
                    and Arabic as well as upon its native Indian resources, the attempts which have
                    been made in Egypt, Turkey, and other countries where these languages are in use
                    to provide vernacular equivalents for scientific terminology will, it may be
                    hoped, work not only for the benefit of those countries, but also for that of
                    India, and thus in time provide a satisfactory means of raising vernacular
                    education in science to the level of other branches of culture.</p>
                <p>In Hindi also there is much activity, though not so much as in Urdu. The pure or
                    “High” Hindi, which rejects all foreign words, and supplies its vocabulary
                    exclusively from Sanskrit, is a recent creation, and cannot even yet be said to
                    represent the language of any large class of the population. A good specimen of
                    this dialect is Nïlkanth Shâstri Gore’s <hi rend="italic">Shad∙Barslιan
                    Barpan,</hi> or “Mirror of the Six (orthodox) Schools (of Hindu philosophy),” a
                    controversial work by a converted Brahman. The genuine Hindi of the old
                    literature, used now exclusively for poetry, is represented by an excellent
                    publication issued weekly at Benares by Bâbù Harish-Chandra, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Kabi-bachan-Sudhä,</hi> or “Ambrosia of the Words of Poets.” In
                    this will be found much good original work, and a vast quantity of old Hindi
                    poetry now for the first time published. The translations of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahäbhärata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harivansa,</hi> made by
                    Pandit Gokulnâth of Benares, and printed at Calcutta in 1829, deserve mention;
                    and one of the most important collections of Hindi poetry, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rag-Kalpadrum</hi> of Krishnânand Vyâsadev Râg-Sägar, was printed at the same
                    place in 1842-45 in an immense volume of 1800 pages.</p>
                <p>English education has naturally had a vast influence on modern vernacular
                    literature, though not wholly a beneficial one. More than a half of the new
                    works issued within the last thirty years are translations or adaptations from
                    English; the journals, the great popularizers of new ideas, take their matter
                    chiefly from English newspapers; the courts, where Urdu has since 1832 become
                    the official language, contribute to the spread of the stiff and difficult
                    phraseology of the Acts of the legislature, as different from the natural idiom
                    of the people as can well be imagined. Literature in India has always owed much
                    to the fostering influence of Government. It has been seen how the schools of
                    Dehli and Lakhnau rose and declined with the fortunes of the Mughal empire and
                    the kingdom of Oudh, and how that of Calcutta similarly owed its existence to
                    British initiative. At the present day the patronage of the rulers of India is
                    no less influential in determining the course of literary activity. Poetical
                    composition is little practised, both because of the exhaustion of its themes
                    and the little appreciation which it meets with from Europeans. More solid
                    studies, politics, science, philosophy, morals, history, and especially
                    controversial theology, are the topics now in favour; and, though much that is
                    published is of the slightest possible intrinsic value, the resources of the
                    language are being gradually cultivated and enlarged to meet the needs of the
                    day. There is thus no reason to doubt that Hindostan will in time possess a body
                    of literature worthy of the flexible and expressive speech of its people, and
                    reflecting faithfully the standard of culture which it owes to its Western
                    rulers. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps">j. l.)</hi></p>
