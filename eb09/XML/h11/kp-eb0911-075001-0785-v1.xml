                <p><label type="entry">HERMES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Georg</hi></label> (1775-1831),
                    a distinguished Catholic theologian, born on 22d April 1775, at Dreyerwald, in
                    Westphalia, was educated at the gymnasium and university of Münster. His life
                    presents no facts of importance. After completing his course of study at
                    Münster, he acted for some time as lecturer at the gymnasium and then as
                    professor at the university. In 1820 he was called, as professor of theology, to
                    the university of Bonn, where he remained till his death on 26th May 1831.
                    Hermes was peculiarly adapted for the life and work of the professoriate. He had
                    great gifts as a lecturer and teacher, and gathered round him at Bonn a devoted
                    band of adherents. His works were <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen</hi><hi

                        rend="italic">Christenthum8,</hi> Münster, 1805, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Einleitung in die Christkatholische Theologie,</hi> of which the first
                    part, a philosophical introduction, was published in 1819, the second part, on
                    positive theology, in 1829. The <hi rend="italic">Einleitung</hi> was never
                    completed. His <hi rend="italic">Christkatholische Dogmatik</hi> was published,
                    from his lectures, after his death by two of his scholars, Achterfeld and Braun,
                    3 vols. 1831-4.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Einleitung</hi> is a remarkable work, both in itself and in
                    its effect upon Catholic theology in Germany. Few works of modern times have
                    excited a more keen and bitter controversy. Hermes himself was very largely
                    under the influence of the Kantian and Fichtean ideas, and though in the
                    philosophical portion of his <hi rend="italic">Einleitung</hi> he criticizes
                    both these thinkers severely, rejects their doctrine of the moral law as the
                    sole guarantee for the existence of God, and condemns their restricted view of
                    the possibility and nature of revelation, enough remained of purely speculative
                    material to render his system obnoxious to the Catholic Church. A very few years
                    after his death, the contests between his followers and their opponents grew so
                    embittered that reference of the dispute was made to the papal see. The judgment
                    consequent upon a review of Hermes’s writings, undertaken in Rome in 1833, was
                    adverse, and on 25th September 1835 a papal bull condemned both parts of the <hi

                        >Dogmatik.</hi> Two months later the remaining volumes of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dogmatik</hi> were likewise condemned. The controversy did not
                    cease with this condemnation; but not till 1845 was there any systematic attempt
                    on the part of Catholic theology to examine and refute the Hermesian doctrines.
                    In that year was published anonymously by F. X. Werner the most complete survey
                    of the principles of the works of Hermes as contrasted with the orthodox
                    catholic faith <hi rend="italic">(Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Hermesianismus,</hi>
                    1845). In 1847 the condemnation of 1835 was confirmed by Pius IX. A sufficient
                    account of Hermes and the dispute raised by him will be found in K. Werner, <hi
