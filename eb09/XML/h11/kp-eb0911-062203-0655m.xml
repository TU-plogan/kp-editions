                    rushes swiftly along. To the left the country opens out into the broad Rhine
                    plain, cultivated like a garden, and bounded by distant and hardly perceptible
                    mountains. The town primarily consists of one long narrow street, the
                    Hauptstrasse, which begins near the station of the Main-Neckar railway on the
                    west, and runs parallel to the river with continuations for a distance of about
                    2 miles to the Karlsthor (where there is a smaller station) on the east. To the
                    south of this the Anlage, a pleasant promenade flanked with fine houses and
                    gardens, leads directly from the chief station to the centre of the town. A
                    number of smaller streets run up from the river, intersecting the Hauptstrasse
                    at right angles. On the other side of the Neckar the Heiligenberg, a vine-clad
                    hill wooded towards the summit, crowned with the ruins of an old chapel, rises
                    abruptly from the river bank. About half-way up the hill the Philosophen weg, a
                    famous road, runs from the Hirschgasse opposite the Karlsthor to the suburb of
                    Neuenheim, opposite the railway station. At this point the Neckar valley ceases,
                    and the river flows slowly onward in the almost level Rhine plain. Of late years
                    the town has grown very much towards the west end on both sides of the river.
                    The additions have been almost entirely of the better class of houses.</p>
                <p>Of the churches the chief are the Peterskirche (founded before 1392), where
                    Jerome of Prague in 1460 expounded the Reformed doctrines; the
                    Heiliggeistkirche, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0656-0623"/> erected at the beginning of the 15th century, of
                    which the nave is used for Protestant, the choir for Old Catholic worship; and
                    the Jesuitenkirche, with sumptuously decorated interior. All these are built in
                    the Gothic style. The rathhaus, the museum, and the university (1712) are large
                    but common-place erections. Two handsome bridges cross the Neckar. That to the
                    east, opposite the castle (built 1788), is adorned with a gateway, and with
                    statues of Minerva and the elector Charles Theodore of the palatinate; the other
                    (built 1877) unites Heidelberg and Neuenheim. In the west part of the town there
                    is a bronze statue of Field-Marshal Prince Wrede (1767-1838), erected in 1860 by
                    Louis L, king of Bavaria. The chief building at Heidelberg, and indeed its chief
                    attraction for strangers, is the famous castle which overhangs the west part of
                    the town. It is situated on the Castlehill, more properly called the
                    Jettenbuhel, 330 feet above the Neckar. Though now a ruin, yet its extent, its
                    magnificence, its beautiful situation, its interesting history, render it by far
                    the most noteworthy, as it certainly is the grandest and largest, of the old
                    castles of Germany. It was begun about the end of the 13th century. Elector
                    Rupert greatly improved it, and erected the Rupert’s building in the early part
                    of the 15th century; succeeding electors of the palatinate did much for it,
                    especially Frederick V., the unfortunate king of Bohemia. It suffered greatly
                    during the Thirty Years’ War, but was restored by Charles Louis (1650-1680). It
                    was dismantled by the French in 1689, and again in 1693. In 1764 it was struck
                    by lightning and its destruction completed. The castle as it at present stands
                    is a square edifice formed of several distinct structures built round a large
                    court-yard; the entrance is on the south side. The court-yard contains a
                    fountain adorned with four granite pillars brought from Charlemagne’s palace at
                    Ingelheim. The chief parts of the castle are Rupert’s building (about 1400) on
                    the left; Otto Henry’s building (1556) on the right, “the finest example of
                    Renaissance architecture in Germany,” a lofty building of which the front is
                    richly decorated; Frederick’s building (1601), the finest part, forming the
                    northern portion of the whole, and adorned with a large number of imposing
                    statues. Within this is the chapel, and behind it the Altan (1610), or castle
                    balcony, which directly overhangs the town and from which the finest of
                    Heidelberg views is obtained. The castle contains an interesting antiquarian
                    museum<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This museum was
                    acquired by the town in 1879.</p></note> formed by the Count Graimberg, and the
                    celebrated Great Tun, which was built in 1751, but has been only used on one or
                    two occasions. Its capacity is 49,000 gallons. There is a castle garden,
                    spacious and well laid out.</p>
                <p>The university of Heidelberg is the oldest in the German kingdom. It was founded
                    in 1356 by the elector Rupert, but it was not till 1386, when it obtained papal
                    sanction, that its real life begins. It was constructed after the type of Paris,
                    had four faculties, and possessed numerous privileges. Marselius von Inghen was
                    its first rector. Frederick the Victorious, Philip the Upright, and Louis V.
                    respectively cherished it. Otto Henry gave it a new organization, further
                    endowed it, and founded the library. At the Reformation it became a stronghold
                    of Protestant learning. The famous Heidelberg catechism was drawn up by its
                    theologians. Then the tide turned. Damaged by the Thirty Years’ War, it led a
                    struggling existence for a century and a half. A large portion of its remaining
                    endowments were cut off by the peace of Lunéville (1801). In 1803 however the
                    elector Charles Frederick raised it anew, and reconstituted it under the name of
                    “Ruperto-Carolina.” At present (1880) it has 38 ordinary and 26 extraordinary
                    professors. The students number about 500 in winter, and from 800 to 900 in
                    summer. A very large proportion are English aud Americans. The library was first
                    kept in the choir of the Heiliggeistkirche, and then consisted of 3500 MSS. In
                    1623 it was sent to Rome by Tilly, and stored as Bibliotheca Palatina in the
                    Vatican. It was afterwards taken to Paris, an 1 in 1815 was restored to
                    Heidelberg. In 1703 the new library was founded; it has now nearly 300,000
                    volumes, besides many valuable MSS. Among the other university institutions are
                    the academic hospital, the maternity hospital, the physiological institution,
                    the chemical laboratory, and the zoological museum.</p>
                <p>The other educational foundations are a gymnasium and a burgher and a real
                    school. There is a small theatre (closed during the summer months) and a
                    Kunstverein. The manufactures of Heidelberg are unimportant. The inhabitants
                    chiefly support themselves by supplying the wants of a large and increasing body
                    of foreign permanent residents, of the considerable body of tourists who during
                    the summer pass through the town, and of the university students. The population
                    of the town and outlying suburbs was 19,988 in 1871, and 22,334 (or including
                    Neuenheim, 23,918) in 1875. About one-third are Catholics. The town is well
                    lighted, and is supplied with excellent water from the Wolfsbrunnen.</p>
                <p>Heidelberg at an early period was a fief of the bishop of Worms, but the rulers
                    of the palatinate came more and more to reside there, till Count Otho of
                    Wittelsbach (1228-1253) made it the capital of the palatinate, and this it
                    continued to be for nearly six centuries. As Heidelberg was one of the great
                    centres of the Reformed faith, it suffered severely in the Thirty Years’ War. In
                    1622 it was sacked by Tilly, and in 1633 was taken by the Swedes. In 1634 it was
                    beleaguered by the Bavarians. In 1635 it was occupied by the imperial forces
                    under Gallas. At the peace of Westphalia (1648) Charles Louis, son of Frederick
                    V., was restored, and he did much to raise the castle, the university, and the
                    town. In 1688, and again in 1693, it was sacked by the French. On the last
                    occasion, so thorough was the work of destruction that only one house—a quaintly
                    decorated erection in the Marktplatz now used as an inn—escaped. In 1720 Charles
                    Philip removed his court to Mannheim, and in 1803 the town became part of the
                    grand duchy of Baden. On 5th March 1848 was held the famous Heidelberg assembly,
                    at which steps were taken that led to the German revolution of that year.</p>
