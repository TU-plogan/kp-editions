                    (1755-1794),a French revolutionist, surnarned from the newspaper he edited “Le
                    Père Duchesne,” was born of obscure parents at Alençon in 1755. He came at an
                    early age to Paris, where he lost more than one situation through malversation,
                    and was in abject poverty when the occurrence of the French Revolution opened up
                    to him a career in which he obtained considerable temporary success and
                    permanent notoriety. Having shown great readiness and proficiency in a style of
                    writing and of oratory which appealed to the worst feelings of the revolutionary
                    mob, he soon acquired great influence in the clubs, and was chosen to oppose the
                    constitutional paper <hi rend="italic">Ls</hi><hi rend="italic">Père</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Duchesne</hi> by editing a revolutionary paper of the same name.
                    The scurrilous and extravagant language of the new print exactly coincided with
                    the sentiments of the class to whom it was addressed, and it contributed not a
                    little to several of the worst and most violent manifestations of the
                    revolutionary spirit. It had a very beneficial influence on the fortunes of its
                    editor, who after the 10th August 1792 was one of the chief members of the

                    1793 an order was sent out for his arrest by the more moderate party of the
                    commune on the ground that he was plotting their assassination, but on account
