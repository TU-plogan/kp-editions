                    first-class honours in .both the classical and mathematical schools in 1813, he
                    in the following year obtained the chancellor’s prize for a Latin essay “On the
                    Office of the Ephors at Sparta,” and shortly afterwards he was elected to a
                    fellowship in his college, Keble, Newman, and Arnold being among the number of
                    his contemporaries. Having left the university in 1816 he held successively the
                    curacies of Newton, Faringdon, and Hackney, and in 1827 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">An Essay on the Philosophical Evidence of Christianity,</hi>
                    followed by a volume of <hi rend="italic">Parochial Sermons illustrative of the
                    importance of the Revelation of Cod in Jesus Christ</hi> (1828). In 1828 he
                    returned to Oxford as tutor of Oriel, and after having twice acted as public
                    examiner in classics, he was selected to preach the Bampton lectures in 1832,
                    when he chose for his subject <hi rend="italic">The Scholastic Philosophy
                    considered in its Relation to Christian Theology (1833;</hi> 3ded. 1848).
                    Notwithstanding a charge of Arianism now brought against him by the Tractarian
                    party, he in 1833 obtained the principalship of St Mary’s Hall, and in 1834 the
                    chair of moral philosophy; nor did a university statute of censure against him
                    on the ground of the supposed heterodoxy of the Bampton lectures avail to check
                    his promotion to the regius professorship of divinity in 1836. There resulted a
                    widespread and violent though ephemeral controversy, after the subsidence of
                    which he published a <hi rend="italic">Lecture on Tradition,</hi> which has
                    passed through several editions, and a volume on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England.</hi> His nomination by Lord John
                    Russell to the vacant see of Hereford in December 1847 was again the signal for
                    a violent and organized opposition; and his consecration in March 1848 took
                    place in spite of a remonstrance by many of the bishops and the resistance of Dr
                    Merewether, the dean of Hereford, who went so far as to vote against the
                    election when the <hi rend="italic">conge</hi><hi rend="italic">d'élire</hi>
                    reached the cathedral. As bishop of Hereford Dr Hampden made no change in his
                    long-formed habits of studious seclusion, and his episcopate was not
                    characterized in a special degree by any form of churchly <pb break="no"

                    later literary performances were the articles on Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates,
                    contributed to the eighth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica,</hi> and afterwards reprinted with additions under the title of <hi

                    1866 he had a paralytic seizure which unfitted him for severe mental exertion,
                    and he died at London on the 23d of April 1868.</p>
