                <p><label type="entry">HIEROCLES</label>, a Neo-Platonic writer of the 5th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> was apparently a native of Alexandria. He was
                    born most probably about the beginning of the 5th century, studied under the
                    celebrated Neo-Platonist Plutarch at Athens, and taught for some years in his
                    native town. He seems to have been banished from Alexandria and to have taken up
                    his abode in Constantinople, where he endured some persecution for his religious
                    opinions. His death must be referred to the closing decade of the 5th century,
                    probably about 490. The only complete work of his which has come down to us is
                    the commentary on the great Pythagorean <hi rend="italic">Carmen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aureum,</hi> but several other writings, specially one on
                    Providence or Foreknowledge, are quoted or referred to by Photius and Stobaeus.
                    The commentary contains several remarkable utterances, and is written with much
                    elegance. Philosophy is there regarded in its practical aspect, as a discipline
                    for purifying or elevating the mind by inculcating virtue and leading to truth.
                    The most curious doctrines contained in the work are those bearing on providence
                    and the human soul. The activity of the Divine Being, the supreme God, although
                    eternal and allreaching, is viewed as extending specially or immediately only to
                    spiritual existences, or rather to the genera of such existences. The
                    individuals are not directly the objects of divine operation, but are left to
                    natural chance or law. Iu more modern phraseology there is only, according to
                    Hierocles, general, not particular, providence. As against divine foreknowledge,
                    perfect freedom of individual will is maintained. All that is preordained is but
                    the connexion between volitions and their natural consequents. As regards the
                    human soul, the teaching of Hierocles in the main resembles Neo-Pythagoreanism.
                    He states the doctrine of transmigration and pre-existence, holds that there is
                    an ethereal body which is purified by trial along with the soul, and regards the
                    world as the means by which judgment upon the past actions of the individual
                    spirit is carried out.</p>
                <p>The earliest edition of the commentary is the Latin translation by Aurispa in
                    1474; the Greek text was first given by Curterius in 1583. The fragments of the
                    works on Providence and Fate weré published in 1593 by Morellus. Later editions
                    of all that is preserved appeared in 1654-5, 1673, and 1709. The commentary
                    alone has been edited by Ashton (1742), by Wolf (1710), by Gaisford in his
                    edition of Stobaeus (1850), and finally by Mullach (1853). The jest-book
                    entitled α&lt;ττ∈7α (edited by Schier, 1768, and Eberhard, 1869), though
                    frequently attributed to this author, is certainly the work of a later hand. The
                    most complete information regarding Hierocles is to be found in Mullach’s
                    edition, and in the relative portions of his <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta</hi><hi
