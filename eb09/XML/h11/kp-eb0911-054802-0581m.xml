                    >Coryleoe.</hi> The common hazel, <hi rend="italic">Corylus Avellana,</hi> L.,
                    is distributed throughout Europe, in North Africa, and in Central and Russian
                    Asia, except the northernmost parts. It is commonly found in hedges and
                    coppices, and as an undergrowth in woods, and reaches a height of some 12 feet;
                    occasionally, as at Eastwell Park, Kent, it may attain to 30 feet. According to
                    Evelyn <hi rend="italic">(Sylva,</hi> p. 35, 1664), hazels “above all affect
                    cold, barren, dry, and sandy soils; also mountains, and even rockie ground
                    produce them; but more plentifully if somewhat moist, dankish, and mossie.” In
                    Kent they flourish best in a calcareous soil. The bark of the older steni3 is of
                    a bright brown, mottled with grey, that of the young twigs is ash-coloured, and
                    glandular and hairy. The leaves are alternate, from 2 to 4 inches in length,
                    downy below, roundish-cordate, pointed, and shortly petiolate; occasionally they
                    are found with the margins coherent at the base, or with the disk so depressed
                    as to form a pitcher-like structure (Masters)., In the variety <hi rend="italic"
                    >C. purpurea,</hi> the leaves, as also the pellicle of the kernel and the husk
                    of the nut, are purple, and in <hi rend="italic">C. heterophylla</hi> they are
                    thickly clothed with hairs. In autumn the rich yellow tint acquired by the
                    leaves of the hazel adds greatly to the beauty of landscapes. The flowers are
                    monoecious, and appear in Great Britain in February and March, before the
                    leaves, and sometimes in October (Loudon). The cylindrical, drooping, and yellow
                    male catkins (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. p. 123, fig. 161)
                    are 1 to 2∣ inches in length, and occur 2 to 4 in a raceme; when in unusual
                    numbers they may be terminal in position. The female flowers are small,
                    subglobose, and sessile, resembling leaf-buds, and have protruding crimson
                    stigmas; the minute inner bracts, by their enlargement, form the palmately lobed
                    and cut involucre or husk of the nut. The ovary is not visible till nearly
                    midsummer, and is not fully developed before autumn.. The nuts have a length of
                    from ∣ to ⅛ inch, and grow in clusters. Double or treble nuts are the result of
                    the equal development of two or all the three carpels of tl <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.e original flower, of which ordinarily two become
                    abortive. Fusion of two or more nuts is not uncommon, and Masters gives an
                    instance of the union of as many as five. From the light brown or brown colour
                    of the nuts the terms <hi rend="italic">hazel</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >hazelly, i.e.,</hi> “in hue as hazel nuts” (Shakespeare, <hi rend="italic"

                    texture, and pliant, and has when dry a weight of 49 lb per cub. foot; it has
                    been used in cabinet-making, and for toys and turned articles. Curiously veined
                    veneers are obtained from the roots; and the root-shoots are largely employed in
                    the making of crates, coal-corves or baskets, hurdles, withs and bands,
                    whiphandles, and other objects. The rods are reputed to be most durable when
                    from the driest ground, and to be especially good where the bottom is chalky.
                    The light charcoal afforded by the hazel serves well for crayons, and is valued
                    by gunpowder manufacturers. An objection to the construction of hedges of hazel
                    is the injury not infrequently done to them by the nut-gatherer, vdιo “with
                    active vigour crushes down the tree” (Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Seasons,</hi>

                    >Corylus Avellana,</hi> is extensively cultivated, especially in Kent, fur the
                    sake of its nuts, which are readily distinguished from cob-nuts by their ample
                    involucre and greater length. It may be propagated by suckers and layers, by
                    grafting, and (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Arboriculture,</hi> ii. 322) by sowing.
                    Suckers afford the strongest and earliest-bearing plants. Grafted filberts are
                    less liable than others to be encumbered by suckers at the root. By the
                    Maidstone growers the best plants are considered to be obtained from layers.
                    These become w ell rooted in about a twelvemonth, and then, after pruning, are
                    bedded out in the nursery for two or three years. The filbert may be
                    economically grown on the borders of plantations or orchards, or in open spots
                    in woods. It thrives most in a light loam with a dry subsoil; rich and, in
                    particular, wet soils are unsuitable, conducing to the formation of too much
                    wood. Plantations of filberts are made in autumn, in well-drained ground, and a
                    space of about 10 feet by 8 has to be allowed for each tree. Ground good for
                    hops is good also for filberts, according to Williamson, who recommends old
                    woollen rags as the best manure for the latter (“On the Cultivation of the
                    Filbert,” <hi rend="italic">Trans.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> iv. 145). In the third year after planting the trees
                    may require root-pruning; in the fifth or sixth they should bear well. The nuts
                    grow in greatest abundance on the extremities of second year’s branches, where
                    light and air have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n582/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0582-0549"/> ready access. In 1819, a very productive year,
                    Williamson obtained from 57 trees, mostly not above six years old, and growing
                    on 360 square yards of ground, 2 cwt. of nuts. To obtain a good tree, the
                    practice in Kent is to select a stout upright shoot 3 feet in length; this is
                    cut down to about 18 inches, of which the lower 12 are kept free from outgrowth.
                    The head is pruned to form six or eight strong offsets; and by judicious use of
                    the knife, and by training, preferably on a hoop placed within them, these are
                    caused to grow outwards and upwards to a height of about 6 feet, so as to form a
                    bowl-like shape. Excessive luxuriance of the laterals may be combated by
                    root-pruning, or by checking them early in the season, and again later, and by
                    cutting back to a female blossom bud, or else spurring nearly down to the main
                    branch in the following spring. In certain conditions of growth the trees may
                    bear almost exclusively male or female flowers, and those produced in the first
                    blossoming are stated <hi rend="italic">(Gent. Hag.,</hi> 1788, vol. lviii., pt.
                    1, p. 495) to be female only. The fertilization of the latter may be secured by
                    suspending amongst them a branch with male bloom.</p>
                <p>Filbert nuts required for keeping must be gathered only when quite ripe; they may
                    then be preserved in dry sand, or, after drying, by packing with a sprinkling of
                    salt in sound casks or new flowerpots. Their different forms include the
                    Cosford, which are thin-shelled and oblong; the Downton, or large square nut,
                    having a lancinated husk; the white or Wrotham Park filbert; and the red hazel
                    or filbert, the kernel of which has a red pellicle. The last two, on account of
                    their elongated husk, were by Willdenow distinguished as a species, under the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Corylus tubulosa.</hi> Like these, apparently, were the
                    nuts of Abella, or Avella, in the Campania (c∕. Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >aveline,</hi> filbert), said by Pliny to have been originally designated
                    “Pontic,” from their introduction into Asia and Greece from Pontus (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Nat. Hist., xv. 24,</hi> xxiii. 78). Cob-nuts are short and
                    roundish, and have a thick and strong shell. Hazel-nuts, under the name of
                    Barcelona or Spanish nuts, are largely exported from France and Portugal, and
                    especially Tarragona and other places in Spain. They afford 60 per cent, of a
                    colourless or pale-yellow, sweettasting, non-drying oil, which has a specific
                    gravity of 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 92 nearly, becomes solid at - 19 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> C. (Cloez), and consists approximately of earbon 77,
                    and hydrogen and oxygen each 11 ‘5 per cent. Hazel nuts formed part of the food
                    of the ancient lake-dwellers of Switzerland and other countries of Europe (see
                    Keller, <hi rend="italic">Lake Dwellings,</hi> trans. Lee, 2d ed., 1878). By the
                    Romans they were sometimes eaten roasted. Kaltenbach <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pflanzenfeinde,</hi> pp. 633-38, 1874) enumerates ninety-eight insects which
                    attack the hazel. Among these the beetle <hi rend="italic">Balaninus nucum,</hi>
                    L., the nut-weevil, seen on hazel and oak stems from the end of May till July,
                    is highly destructive to the nuts. The female lays an egg in the unripe nut, on
                    the kernel of which the larva subsists till September, when it bores its way
                    through the shell, and enters the earth, to undergo transformation into a
                    chrysalis in the ensuing spring. The leaves of the hazel are frequently found
                    mined on the upper and under side respectively by the larvae of the moths <hi
                    rend="italic">Lithocolletis</hi><hi rend="italic">coryli,</hi> Nie., and <hi
                    rend="italic">L. Nicelii,</hi> Sta. The tomtit has been observed to pass over
                    the filbert whilst destroying other nuts (Darwin, <hi rend="italic">Anim. and
                    Pl.,</hi> ii. 231). Parasitic on the roots of the hazel is found the curious
                    leafless <hi rend="italic">Lathroea</hi><hi rend="italic">squamosa,</hi> or
                    Toothwort, of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Orobanchaceae.</hi></p>
                <p>The Hebrew word Zuz, translated “hazel” in the authorized version of the English
                    Bible (Gen. xxx. 37), is believed to signify “almond’’(see Kitto, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cycl. of Bibl. Lit.,</hi> ii. 869, and iii. 811. 1864). A belief
                    in the efficacy of divining-rods of hazel for the discovery of concealed objects
                    is probably of remote origin (c∕. Hosea, iv. 12). G. Agricola, in his treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">Vom Bergwerck</hi> (pp. xxix.-xxxi., Basel, 1557), gives an
                    account, accompanied by a woodcut, of their employment in searching for mineral
                    veins. By certain persons, who for different metals used rods of various
                    materials, rods of hazel, lie says, were held serviceable simply for silver
                    lodes, and by the skilled miner, who trusted to natural signs of mineral veins,
                    they were regarded as of no avail at all. The virtue of the hazel’wand was
                    supposed to be dependent on its having two forks; these were to be grasped in
                    the fists, with the fingers uppermost, but with moderate firmness only, lest the
                    free motion of the opposite end downwards towards the looked-for object should
                    be interfered with. According to Cornish tradition, the divining or dowsing rod
                    is guided to lodes by the pixies, the guardians of the treasures of the earth.
                    By Vallemout, who wrote towards the end of the 17th century, the divining-rod of
                    hazel, or “baguette divinatoire,” is described as instrumental in the pursuit of
                    criminals. The Jesuit Vanière, who flourished in the early part of the 18th
                    century, in the <hi rend="italic">Praedium Rusticum</hi> (pp. 12,13, new ed.,
                    Toulouse, 1742) amusingly relates the manner in which he exposed the chicanery
                    of one who pretended by the aid of a hazel divining-rod to point out hidden
                    water-courses and gold. The burning of hazel nuts for the magical investigation
                    of the future is alluded to by Gay in <hi rend="italic">Thursday, or the
                    Spell,</hi> and by Burns in <hi rend="italic">Halloween.</hi> The hazel is very
                    frequently mentioned by the old French romance writers. The <hi rend="italic"
