                    (1593-1633), one of the best of English religious poets, was born near the town
                    of Montgomery on the 3d of April 1593. He was a brother of Lord Herbert of
                    Cherbury, noticed below. Educated privately till the age of twelve, he was then
                    sent to Westminster School, and in 1608 he became a student at Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, where he was made B.A. in 1611, M.A. and major fellow of the college
                    in 1615, and orator for the university in 1619. In his capacity as orator he was
                    several times brought into contact with King James. About the same time also he
                    appeared as the champion of Anglicanism against Andrew Melville, the famous
                    Scotch Presbyterian. He numbered among his friends Dr Donne, Sir Henry Wotton,
                    Izaak Walton, Bishop Andrewes, and Francis Bacon, who consulted Herbert about
                    several of his works, and dedicated to him his translation of the Psalms. During
                    his youth he was a courtier, dancing attendance on King James, and “enjoying his
                    genteel humour for clothes”; and the king rewarded his attentions by the gift of
                    a sinecure worth £120 a year. The death of his patrons the duke of Richmond, the
                    marquis of Hamilton, and King James, approaching ill-health, and the influence
                    of his mother finally induced him, not without a struggle, to take holy orders.
                    In July 1626 he was appointed prebendary of Layton Ecclesia, in the county of
                    Huntingdon. Shortly before his induction (1630) to the parsonage of Bemerton,
                    near Salisbury, he married Miss Jane Danvers after three days’ acquaintance. Mr
                    Danvers had been set on the marriage for a long time, and had often spoken of
                    his daughter Jane to Herbert, and “so much commended Mr Herbert to her, that
                    Jane became so much a Platonic as to fall in love with Mr Herbert unseen.” The
                    story of the poet’s life at Bemerton, as told by Walton, is one of the most
                    exquisite pictures in literary biography. He devoted much time to explaining the
                    meaning of the various parts of the PrayerBook, and held services twice every
                    day, at which many of the parishioners attended, and some “let their plough rest
                    when Mr Herbert’s saints-bell rung to praise, that they might also offer their
                    devotions to God with him.” Next to Christianity itself he loved the English
                    Church. He was passionately fond of music, and usually went twice a week to
                    attend the cathedral service at Salisbury. Walton illustrates Herbert’s kindness
                    to the poor by many touching anecdotes. He had not been three years in Bemerton
                    when he succumbed to ill-health. He died in 1633.</p>
                <p>Herbert’s works are— <hi rend="italic">The Temple</hi> (1631); a few
                    miscellaneous poems; a collection of proverbs entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jacula</hi><hi rend="italic">Prudentum</hi> (1640); and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Country Parson,</hi> which did not appear till 1652. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Temple</hi> is a collection of religious poems marked by unity of sentiment and
                    inspiration. The chief faults of the book are obscurity, verbal conceits, and a
                    forced ingenuity which shows itself in grotesque puns, odd metres, and
                    occasional want of taste. In spite of these drawbacks, the quaint beauty of
                    Herbert’s style and his genuine poetical feeling give <hi rend="italic">The
                    Temple</hi> a high place in literature. The following poems are the gems of the
                    collection “The Church Porch,” “The Agony,” “Sin,” “Sunday,” “Virtue,” “Man,”
                    “The British Church,” “The Quip,” “The Collar,” “The Pulley,” “The Flower,”
                    “Aaron,” and “The Elixir.” The finest of all is his poem on “Man,” which is
                    Miltonic in its sublimity of conception, and shows how poets, in their loftier
                    moods, often anticipate the discoveries of science and the most far-reaching
                    speculations of philosophy. Herbert and Kehle are the poets of Anglican
                    theology. No book is fuller of devotion vθ the Church of England than <hi
                    rend="italic">The Temple.</hi> No poem in our language exhibits more of the
                    spirit of true Christianity. Every page is marked by transparent sincerity, and
                    reflects the beautiful character of “holy George Herbert.”</p>
                <p>Among recent editions of Herbert’s works the following may be mentioned :— <hi
                    rend="italic">Works in Prose and Verse,</hi> with life by Izaak Walton, and
                    notes by 8. T. Coleridge, 1846; Gilfillan’s edition, in his “Library of the
                    British Poets,” 1853; Willmott’s edition, 1854; Professor Nichol’s edition,
                    1863; and the Aldine edition by the Rev. Dr A. B. Grosart. For further
