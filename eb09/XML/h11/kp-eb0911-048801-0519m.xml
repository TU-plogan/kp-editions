                    approximating to triangular form from the strings diminishing in length as they
                    ascend in pitch. While the instrument is of great antiquity, it is yet from
                    northern Europe that the modern harp and its name are derived. The Greeks and
                    Romans preferred to it the lyre in its different varieties, and a Latin writer,
                    Fortunatus (vii. 8), describes it in the seventh century of our era as an
                    instrument of the barbarians—“Romanusque lyra, plaudat tibi barbarus harpa.”
                    This is believed to be the earliest mention of the name, which is clearly
                    Teutonic,—the Old High German “harapha,” the Anglo-Saxon “hearpe,” the Old Norse
                    “harpa.” The modern French “harpe” retains the aspirate; in the Spanish and
                    Italian “arpa” it is dropped.</p>
                <p>For the origin of the instrument we have to look to Egypt, and the earliest
                    delineations of it there give no indication that it had not existed long before.
                    There are, indeed, representations in Egyptian paintings of stringed instruments
                    of a bow-form that support the idea of the invention of the harp from the tense
                    string of the warrior’s or hunter’s bow. This primitive-looking instrument was
                    played horizontally, being borne upon the performer’s shoulder. Between it and
                    the grand vertical harps in the frescos of the time of Rameses IIL, <pb

                    the traveller Bruce (fig. 1), there are varieties that permit us to bind the
                    whole, from the simplest bow-form to the almost triangular harp, into one family
                    (see fig. 2).</p>
                <p>The Egyptian harp had no front pillar, and it, being strung with catgut, the
                    tension and pitch must necessarily have been low. The harps above - mentioned
                    depicted in the tomb at Thebes, assumed from the players to be more than 6 feet
                    high, have not many strings, the one, according to Wilkinson, having ten, the
                    other thirteen. What the accordance was of these strings it would be to no
                    satisfaction to follow Burney and others in trying to recover. We must be
                    content with the knowledge that the old Egyptians possessed harps in principle
                    like our own, the largest having pedestals upon which they bestowed a wealth of
                    decoration, as if to show how much they prized them.</p>
                <p>The ancient Assyrians had harps like those of Egypt in being without a front
                    pillar, but differing from them in having the sound-body uppermost, in which we
                    find the early use of soundholes; while the lower portion was a bar to which the
                    strings were tied and by means of which the tuning was apparently effected. What
                    the Hebrew harp was, whether it followed the Egyptian or the Assyrian, we do not
                    know. That King David played upon the harp as commonly depicted is rather a
                    modern idea. Mediaeval artists frequently gave King David the psaltery, a
                    horizontal stringed instrument from which has gradually developed the modern
                    piano. The Hebrew “kinnor” may have been a kind of trigonon, a triangular
                    stringed instrument between a small harp and a psaltery, probably sounded by a
                    plectrum, or, as advocated by Dr Stainer in his essay on the music of the Bible,
                    a kind of lyre.</p>
                <p>The earliest records that we possess of the Celtic race, whether Gaelic or
                    Cymric, give the harp a prominent place and hιrpists peculiar veneration and
                    distinction. The names for the harp are, however, quite different from the
                    Teutonic. The Irish “clairseach,” the Highland Scotch “chrsach,” the Welsh,
                    Cornish, Breton, “telyn,” “telein,” “télen,” show no etymological kinship to the
                    other European names. The first syllable in clairseach or clarsach is derived
                    from the Gaelic “clar,” a board or table (soundboard), while the first syllable
                    of telyn is distinctly Old Welsh, and has a tensile meaning; thus resonance
                    supplies the one idea, tension the other.</p>

                    all these authorities due care must be taken of the bias of patriotism and the
                    delusive aim to reconstruct much that we must be content to receive as only
                    vaguely indicated in records and old monuments. There is, however, one early
                    Irish monument about which there can be no mistake, the harp upon a cross
                    belonging to the ancient church of Ullard near Kilkenny, the date of which
                    cannot be later than 830; the sculpture is rude, but the instrument is clearly
                    shown by the drawing in Bunting’s work to have no front pillar. This remarkable
                    structural likeness to the old ' harps of Egypt and Assyria may be accidental,
                    but permits the plausible hypothesis of Eastern descent. The oldest specimen of
                    the beautiful form, the Irish harp is now recognized by, with gracefully curved
                    front pillar and sweep of neck (the latter known as the harmonic curve), is the
                    famous harp in Trinity College, Dublin, the possession of which has been
                    attributed to King Brian Boiroimhe. From this mythic ownership Dr Petrie (see
                    essay in Bunting) has delivered it; but he can only deduce the age from the
                    ornamentation and heraldry, which fix its date in the 14th century or a little
                    later.</p>
                <p>There is a cast of it in South Kensington Museum, accurately described in the
                    catalogue by Mr Carl Engel. The next oldest is in the Highlands of Scotland, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Clarsach Lumanach,ox</hi> Lamont’s Clarschoe, belonging, with
                    another of later date, to the old Perthshire family of Robertson of Lude. Both
                    are described in detail by Gunn. This Lamont harp was taken by a lady of that
                    family from Argyleshire about 1460, on her marriage into the family of Lude. It
                    had about thirty strings tuned singly, but the scale Was sometimes doubled in
                    pairs of unisons like lutes and other contemporary instruments. The Dalway harp
                    in Ireland (fig. 3) inscribed “Ego sum Regina Cithararum,” and dated 1621,
                    appears to have had pairs of strings in the centre only. These were of brass
                    wire, and played with the pointed finger nails. The Italian contemporary “Arpa
                    Doppia” was entirely upon the duplex principle, but with gut strings played by
                    the fleshy ends of the fingers. When Bunting met at Belfast in 1792 as manyIrish
                    harpers as could be at that late date assembled, he found the compass of their
                    harps to comprise thirty notes which were tuned diatonically in the key of G,
                    under certain circumstances transposable to C and rarely to D, the scales being
                    the major of these keys. The harp first appeared in the coat of arms of Ireland
                    in the reign of Henry VIII.; and some years after in a map of 1567 preserved in
                    a volume of State Papers, we find it truly drawn according to the outlines of
                    the national Irish instrument. References to the Highlands of Scotland are of
                    necessity included with Ireland; and in both we find another name for the harp,
                    viz., “cruit.” Bunting particularly mentions the “cinnard cruit” (harp with a
                    high head) and the “crom cruit” (the curved harp). In the Ossianic MSS. of the
                    Dean of Lismore (1512) the word “crwt” occurs several times, and in Neill M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> Alpine ’ s <hi rend="italic">Gaelic Dictionary</hi>
                    (1832), which gives the dialect of Islay, closely related to that of Ulster, the
                    word “cruit” is rendered “harp.” In Irish of the 8th and 9th centuries (Zeuss)
                    “cithara” is always glossed by “crot.” True the modern Welsh “crwth” is not a
                    harp; but the expression of Fortunatus, “Chrotta Britanna canat,” has been too
                    readily accepted as meaning the half-fiddle half-lyre which also bears the name
                    of “crwth” or ‘‘ crowd.” An old Welsh harp, not triple strung, exists, which
                    bears a great resemblance to the Irish harp in neck, soundboard, and soundholes.
                    The inference is fair that this was the form, although
                    dimensionsmayhavematerially differed,∙ of the Irish “crom cruit,” while the
                    triple strung harp with its elevated neck might be the form of the “cinnard
                    cruit.” But this does not imply derivation of the harp of Wales from that of
                    Ireland or the reverse. There is really no good historical evidence, and there
                    may have been a common or distinct origin on which ethnology only can throw
                    light. The Welsh like the Irish harp was often an hereditary instrument to be
                    preserved with great care and veneration, and used by the bards of the family,
                    who were alike the poetmusicians and historians. A slave was not allowed to
                    touch a harp, and it was exempted by the Welsh laws from seizure for debt. The
                    old Welsh harp appears to have been at one time strung with horsehair, and by
                    the Eisteddfod laws the pupil spent his noviciate of three years in the practice
                    of a harp with that stringing. The comparatively modern Welsh triple harp (fig.
                    4) is always strung with gut. It has a rising neck as before stated, and three
                    rows of strings,—the outer rows tuned diatonic, the centre one chromatic for the
                    sharps and flats. Jones gives it 98 strings and a compass of 5 octaves and one
                    note, from violoncello <pb break="no"

                    hand, and in the triple harps there are 27 strings on that side, the right or
                    bass hand having 37, and the middle or chromatic row 34.</p>
                <p>Turning to the modern harp, the first pattern of it is discovered in German and
                    Anglo-Saxon illuminated MSS. as far back as the 9th century. A diatonic
                    instrument, it must have been common throughout Europe, as Orcagna, Fra
                    Angelico, and other famous Italian painters depict it over and over again in
                    their masterpieces. No accidental semitones were possible with this instrument,
                    unless the strings were shortened by the player’s finger. This lasted until the
                    17th century, when a Tyrolese maker adapted hooks (perhaps suggested by the
                    fretted or bonded clavichord) that, screwed into the neck, could be turned
                    downwards to fix the desired semitone at pleasure. At last, somewhere about
                    1720, Hochbrucker, a Bavarian, invented pedals that, acting through the pedestal
                    of the instrument, governed by mechanism the stopping, and thus left the
                    player’s hands free, an indisputable advantage; and it became possible at once
                    to play in no less than eight major scales. By a sequence of improvements, in
                    which two Frenchmen named Cousineau took an important part, the various defects
                    inherent in Hochbrucker’s plan became ameliorated. The pedals were doubled, and,
                    the tuning of the instrument being changed from the key of Eh to Ch, it became
                    possible to play in fifteen keys, thus exceeding the power of the keyboard
                    instruments, over which the harp has another important advantage in the
                    simplicity of the fingering, which is the same for every key.</p>
                <p>It is to Sebastian Erard we owe the perfecting of the pedal harp (fig. 5), a
                    triumph he gained in Paris by unremitting studies begun when he adopted a “fork”
                    mechanism in 1786 and ended in 1810 when he had attained complete success. The
                    mechanical perfection of Erard’s apparatus must be seen to be appreciated. The
                    pedals give the extent of movement the disks perform from which the studs
                    project that stop the strings, as it may be required to raise the string in
                    pitch a half tone or a whole tone. Erard’s merit was not confined to this
                    improvement only; he modified the structure of the comb that conceals the
                    mechanism, and constructed the sound-body of the instrument upon a modern
                    principle more advantageous to the tone.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these improvements and the great beauty of tone the harp
                    possesses, the domestic use of it has for years past been declining. The great
                    cost of a good harp, and the trouble to many amateurs of tuning, may have led to
                    the supplanting of the harp by the more convenient and useful pianoforte. With
                    this comes naturally a diminution in the number of solo-players on the
                    instrument. Were it not for the increasing use of the harp in the orchestra, the
                    colour of its tone having attracted the masters of instrumentation, so that the
                    great scores of Meyerbeer and Gounod, of Berlioz, Liszt, and Wagner are not
                    complete without it, we should perhaps know little more of the harp than of the
                    dulcimer, in spite of the efforts of distinguished virtuosi whose devotion to
                    their instrument maintains its technique on an equality with that of any other,
                    even the most in public favour.</p>
