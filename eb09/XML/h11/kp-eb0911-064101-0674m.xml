                    been urged indeed by competent authority that Van der Heist was not a native of
                    Amsterdam, because a family of that name lived as early as 1G07 at Haarlem, and
                    pictures are shown as works of Van der Hebt in the Haarlem Museum which might
                    tend to prove that he was in practice there before he acquired repute at
                    Amsterdam. Unhappily Bartholomew has not been traced amongst the children of
                    Severijn van der Helst, who married at Haarlem in 1G07, and there is no proof
                    that the pictures at Haarlem are really his; though if they were so they would
                    show that he learnt his art from Frans Hals and became a skilled master as early
                    as 1G31. Scheltema, a very competent judge in matters of Dutch art chronology,
                    supposes that Van der Heist was a resident at Amsterdam in 1G36. His first great
                    picture, representing a gathering of civic guards at a brewery, is variously
                    assigned to 1G39 and 1643, and still adorns the town-hall of Amsterdam. His
                    noble portraits of the burgomaster Bicker and Andreas Bicker the younger, in the
                    gallery of Amsterdam, of the same date no doubt as Bicker’s wife lately in the
                    Ruhl collection at Cologne, were completed in 1642. From that time till his
                    death there is no difficulty in tracing Van der Helst’s career at Amsterdam. He
                    acquired and kept the position of a distinguished portraiLpainter, producing
                    indeed little or nothing besides portraits at any time, but founding, in
                    conjunction with Nicolaes de Helt Stokade, the painters’ guild at Amsterdam in
                    1654. At some unknown date he married Constance Reynst, of a good patrician
                    family in the Netherlands, bought himself a house in the Doelenstrasse, and
                    ended by earning a competence. His likeness of Paul Potter at the Hague,
                    executed in 1654, and his partnership with Backhuysen, who laid in the
                    backgrounds of some of his pictures in 1668, indicate a constant companionship
                    with the best artists of the time. Waagen has said that his portrait of Admiral
                    Kortenaar, in the gallery of Amsterdam, betrays the teaching of Frans Hals, and
                    the statement need not be gainsaid; yet on the whole Van der Heist’s career as a
                    painter was mainly a protest against the systems of Hals and Rembrandt. It is
                    needless to dwell on the pictures which preceded that of 1648, called the Peace
                    of Münster, in the gallery of Amsterdam. The Peace challenges comparison at once
                    with the so-called Night Watch by Rembrandt, and the less important but not less
                    characteristic portraits of Hals and his wife in a neighbouring room. Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds waβ disappointed by Rembrandt, whilst Van der Helst surpassed his
                    expectation. But Bürger asked whether Reynolds had not already been struck with
                    blindness when he ventured on this criticism. The question is still an open one.
                    But certainly Van der Heist attracts by qualities entirely differing from those
                    of Rembrandt and Frans Hals. Nothing can be more striking than the contrast
                    between the strong concentrated light and the deep gloom of Rembrandt and the
                    contempt of chiaroscuro peculiar to his rival, except the contrast between the
                    rapid sketchy touch of Hals and the careful finish and rounding of Van der
                    Helst. The Peace is a meeting of guards to celebrate the signature of the treaty
                    of Münster. The members of the Doele of St George meet to feast and congratulate
                    each other not at a formal banquet but in a spot laid out for good cheer, where
                    De Wit, the captain of his company, can shake hands with his lieutenant Waveren,
                    yet hold in solemn state the great drinking-horn of St George. The rest of the
                    company sit, stand, or busy themselves around,—some eating, others drinking,
                    others carving or serving—an animated scene on a long canvas, with figures large
                    as life. Well has Bürger said, the heads are full of life and the hands
                    admirable. The dresses and subordinate ’ parts are finished to a nicety without
                    sacrifice of detail or loss of breadth in touch or impast. But the eye glides
                    from shape to shape, arrested here by expressive features, there by a bright
                    stretch of colours, nowhere at perfect rest because of the lack of a central
                    thought in light and shade, harmonies, or composition. Great as the qualities of
                    Van der Heist undoubtedly are, he remains below the line of demarcation which
                    separates the second from the first-rate masters of art.</p>
                <p>His pictures are very numerous, and almost uniformly good; but in his later
                    creations he wants power, and though still amazingly careful, he becomes grey
                    and woolly in touch. At Amsterdam the four regents in the Werkhuys (1650), four
                    syndics in the gallery (1656), and four syndics in the town-hall (1657) are
                    masterpieces, to which may be added a number of fine single portraits.
                    Rotterdam, notwithstanding the fire of 1864, still boasts of three of Van der
                    Heist’s works. The Hague, as we saw, owns but one. St Petersburg, on the other
                    hand, possesses ten or eleven, of various shades of excellence. The Louvre has
                    three, Munich four. Other pieces are in the galleries of Berlin, Brunswick,
                    Brussels, Carlsπιhe, Cassel, Darmstadt, Dresden, Frankfort, Gotha, Stuttgart,
                    and Vienna.</p>
