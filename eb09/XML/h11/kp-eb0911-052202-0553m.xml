                    born at Zittau, in Lusatia, July 27, 1808. His early education was mainly
                    conducted by his father, Ernst Friedrich Haupt, burgomaster of Zittau, a man of
                    good scholarly attainment, who used to take pleasure in turning German hymns or
                    Goethe’s poems into Latin, and whose memoranda have been employed by Freytag in
                    the 4th volume of his <hi rend="italic">Bilder aus der deutschen
                    Vergangenheit.</hi> From the Zittau gymnasium, where he spent the five years
                    1821-1826, partly under the tuition of Lindemann, Haupt removed to the
                    university of Leipsic with the intention of prosecuting theology; but the
                    natural bent of his mind and the influence of Professor G. Hermann soon turned
                    all his energies in the direction of what - were to be his life-studies. On the
                    close of his university course (1830) he returned to his father’s house, and the
                    next seven years were devoted to quiet work not only at Greek, Latin, and
                    German, but at Old French, Provençal, and Bohemian. In 1834 he became acquainted
                    with Endlicher, Karajan, and F. Wolff at Vienna, and formed with Lachmann at
                    Berlin a friendship which had great effect on his intellectual development. In
                    September 1837 he “habilitated” at Leipsic as privat-docent, and his first
                    lectures, dealing with such diverse subjects as Catullus and the Nibelungenlied,
                    indicated the twofold direction of his labours. A new chair of German language
                    and literature being founded in his behoof, the new teacher received in
                    succession the title of professor extraordinarius (September 1841) and professor
                    ordinarius (November 1843); and in 1842 he married Louise Hermann, the daughter
                    of his master and colleague. But the peaceful and prosperous course opening out
                    before him at the university of Leipsic was brought to a sudden close. Having
                    taken part in 1849 with Otto Jahn and Theodor Mommsen in a political agitation
                    for the maintenance of the imperial constitution, Haupt was deprived of his
                    professorship by a decree of the 22d April 1851. Two years later, however, he
                    was called to succeed Lachmann at the university of Berlin; and at the same time
                    the Berlin academy, which had made him a corresponding member in 1841, elected
                    him an ordinary member. For one and twenty years he continued to hold a
                    prominent place among the scholars of the Prussian capital, making his presence
                    felt, not only by the prestige of his erudition and the clearness of his
                    intellect, but by the tirelessness of his energy and the ardent fearlessness of
                    his temperament. His death, which took place with very little warning, February
                    5,1874, was the result of heart disease.</p>
                <p>Haupt’s critical work is distinguished by a happy union of the most painstaking
                    investigation with intrepidity of conjecture, and while in his lectures and
                    addresses he was frequently carried away by the excitement of the moment, and
                    made sharp and questionable attacks on his opponents, in his writings he
                    exhibits great selfcontrol. The results of many of his researches are altogether
                    lost, because he could not be prevailed upon to publish what fell much short of
                    his own high ideal of excellence. To the progress of classical scholarship he
                    contributed by <hi rend="italic">Quaestiones</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    1868), of Horace (3d ed., 1871), and of Virgil (2d ed., 1873). As early as 1836
                    he with Hoffmann von Fallersleben started the <hi rend="italic">Altdeutsche

                    edited. To form a collection of the French songs of the 16th century was one of

                    labours in that direction. Three volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi>
