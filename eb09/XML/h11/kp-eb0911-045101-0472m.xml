                    of Schleswig. When a youth he served an apprenticeship to a clock and watchmaker
                    at Flensburg, with whom he remained several years. During this time he exhibited

                    professor of astronomy at Copenhagen, who, appreciating Hansen’s abilities,

                    on its foundation in 1823. Hansen’s reputation as an excellent mathematician had
                    by this time become generally known, and in 1825 he was selected to succeed
                    Professor Encke as director.of the observatory of Seeberg, near Gotha. There he
                    remained for the rest of his life, devoting his talents to the development of
                    the highest branches of mathematical astronomy, with an originality of
                    conception which was acknowledged by the English Royal Astronomical Society on
                    two occasions, by the award of their gold medal for his researches in physical
                    astronomy and his lunar tables. His <hi rend="italic">Tables de la Lune</hi>
                    appeared in 1857, published at the expense of the British Government; they have
                    been adopted for use in the calculations of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical
                    Almanac.</hi> In addition to his important volume containing the full details of
                    the formulae explanatory of his lunar theory, Hansen was the author of a large
                    number of miscellaneous astronomical papers, principally relating to the orbits
                    of comets and planets or to perturbational astronomy. In one of these he was the
                    first to point out that Encke’s value of the horizontal equatorial solar
                    parallax required to be increased to reconcile the lunar theory with modern
                    observations,—an opinion which was subsequently confirmed by Le Verrier from his
                    planetary researches, and by the observations of Mars and the transit of Venus
                    of 1874. Hansen was a foreign member of the Royal Society, and an associate of
                    the Royal Astronomical Society. He died on March 28, 1874, at the age of
                    seventy-eight.</p>
