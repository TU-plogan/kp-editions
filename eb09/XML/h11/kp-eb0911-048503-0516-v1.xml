                    of Earl Godwine and his Danish wife Gytha, the sister of Earl Ulf. The year of
                    his birth is not accurately fixed, but it must have been about 1022. The choice
                    of his name, like that of some others of his brothers and sisters (see <hi

                    mother. Both he and his elder brother Swegen were appointed to earldoms while
                    still very young, seemingly about 1045. Harold’s earldom was that of the
                    East-Angles. In 1046 Swegen, having carried off Eadgifu, abbess of Leominster,
                    and not being allowed to marry her, threw up his earldom in disgust, and his
                    possessions were divided between his brother Harold and his cousin Earl Beorn,
                    the nephew of Gytha. In 1049 Swegen came back and sought the recovery of his

                    first time in command, holding a ship in the fleet commanded by his father. For
                    some unknown cause his ship was transferred to Beorn, which most likely saved
                    Harold’s life; for Swegen presently came and entrapped and slew Beorn, who was
                    buried by Harold. We next hear of Harold in 1051 a8 accompanying Godwine when he
                    appeared in arms in Gloucestershire. He shared his father’s outlawry and
                    banishment in that year, but he chose a different place of shelter, going with
                    his brother Leofwine to Ireland, while Godwine went to Flanders. In 1052 Harold
                    and Leofwine came back. They were opposed by the men of Somerset and Devonshire,
                    whom they defeated at Porlock, and plundered the country. Then they joined their
                    father, and were with him at the assembly which decreed the restoration of the
                    whole family. Harold was now restored to his earldom of the East-Angles, and, on
                    his father’s death in 1053, he succeeded him in the greater earldom of the
                    West-Saxons.</p>
                <p>Harold was now the chief man in the kingdom, and when the older earls Leofric and
                    Siward died, his power increased yet more, and the latter part of Eadward’s
                    reign was virtually the reign of Harold. But he was the minister of the king
                    rather than his personal favourite. This last place rather belonged to his
                    younger brother Tostig, who on the death of Siward in 1055 received the earldom
                    of the Northumbrians. Two other of God wine’s younger sons, Gyrth and Leofwine,
                    also received earldoms in 1057. This last date would seem to have been about the
                    time when the prospect of the crown began to open to Harold. The Aetheling
                    Eadward, the son of Eadmund Ironside, who had been brought home from Hungary as
                    the intended successor, died that year. So did Eadward’s nephew Ralph, who,
                    though not really of the kingly house, might possibly have been looked to for
                    lack of a nearer candidate. There was now no one of the old stock but Eadgar son
                    of Eadward and his sisters. If then the king should die while Eadgar was still a
                    child, there would be no qualified candidate in the royal house. It would seem
                    as if, from this time, men began to look to Earl Harold as a possible successor
                    to the crown. He is spoken of in a way, and his name is joined with that of the
                    king in a way, which is unusual in the case of an ordinary earl.</p>
                <p>The chief events in which Harold appears personally during this time are the wars
                    with the Welsh under their king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. In 1055, in alliance with
                    the banished Earl Aelfgar of Mercia, Gruffydd defeated Earl Ralph and burned
                    Hereford. Harold now drove back the Welsh and restored Hereford, but allowed the
                    restoration of Aelfgar to his earldom. In 1058 he made the pilgrimage to Rome:
                    in 1060 he completed the building of his church at Waltham, and completed the
                    foundation of the college in 1062. In 1063 came the great Welsh war, in which
                    Harold, with the help of his brother Tostig, crushed the power of Gruffydd, who
                    was killed by his own people. Haroll now gave Wales to two vassal kings, Bleddyn
                    and Rhiwallon. Both of his wars were accompanied by an extension of the English
                    frontier toward Wales. In 1065 the Northumbrians revolted against their earl
                    Tostig, and chose in his place Morkere, the son of Aelfgar. Harold now acted as
                    mediator between the king and the insurgents, and at last, as the Northumbrians
                    were fully prepared not to receive Tostig again, he agreed to their choice of
                    Morkere and to the banishment of his brother.</p>
                <p>Besides these there is one very important event in Harold’s life the date of
                    which can only be guessed at. At some time or other between William’s visit to
                    England in 1051 and Eadward’s death at the beginning of 1066, Harold was the
                    guest of Duke William in Normandy, and took some kind of oath to him. This oath
                    the Normans represented as an act of homage, with a further oath to procure
                    William’s succession to the English crown. The tale is told only by the Norman
                    writers, and it is told by them with such contradictions of every kind that no
                    reliance can be placed on any detail. But that there is some truth in the story
                    is proved by the strongest negative evidence. While the contemporary English
                    writers take care, directly or indirectly, to deny all those Norman charges
                    against Harold which were sheer invention, they say not a word as to his alleged
                    oath to William. It seems on the whole most likely that Harold was wrecked on
                    the shore of Ponthieu, imprisoned by its Count Guy, and released by the
                    interference of William. He then helped William in a war with the Bretons, and
                    promised to marry one of his daughters. This was most likely accompanied by an
                    act of homage, such as was often made to any superior or benefactor. Such an
                    oath might, in the ideas of the times, be made to mean a great deal or very
                    little, according to circumstances. The most likely date is 1064. But there is a
                    remarkable statement that Harold took a journey in Gaul with a political object,
                    seemingly that of making alliances with some of the princes of the country, most
                    likely William’s enemies in France, Anjou, and Aquitaine. This was in the year
                    of his Roman pilgrimage. And, as there is no direct evidence for the date of the
                    oath, it is open to any one to put the two things together.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of 1066 Eadward died. His last act was to recommend Harold for
                    election to the crown. He was accordingly chosen on the day of Eadward’s death,
                    January 5th, and crowned the next day by Ealdred, archbishop of York. But,
                    though he was crowned by the Northumbrian primate, the men of Northumberland at
                    first refused to acknowledge him. They were won over by the new king, who went
                    to York, accompanied by Saint Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester. To secure Eadwine
                    and Morkere, he married their sister Ealdgyth, the widow of the Welsh king
                    Gruffydd. He thus put it out of his power to comply with that part of his
                    engagement to William which is best attested, namely, to marry one of William’s
                    daughters. The rest of Harold’s reign was taken up with preparations against the
                    attacks of two enemies at once. William challenged the crown, alleging both a
                    bequest of Eadward in his favour and the personal engagement which Harold had
                    contracted towards him. This was of course a mere matter of form, and William
                    began to make ready for the invasion of· England. Meanwhile the banished Tostig
                    was trying all means to bring about bis own restoration. He first, seemingly in
                    concert with William, came in May, and attacked first the Isle of Wight and then
                    Lindesey, but was driven to take shelter in Scotland. From May to September the
                    king kept the coasts with a great force by sea and land; but at last provisions
                    failed, and the land army was dispersed. Harold then went to London, ready to
                    meet whichever enemy came first. By this time Tostig had engaged Harold Hardrada
                    of Norway to invade England. He accordingly sailed up the Humber, defeated
                    Eadwine and Morkere (September 20th), and received the submission of York
                    (September 24th). Harold of England was now on his march northward; on September
                    25th he came on the Northmen at Stamfordbridge beyond York, and won a complete
                    victory, in which Tostig and Harold Hardrada were slain. But two days later
                    (September 27th) William of Normandy landed at Pevensey and (September 29th)
                    occupied Hastings, and laid waste the land. Harold had then to march southward
                    as fast as possible. Ho gathered his army in London from all southern and
                    eastern England, but Eadwine and Morkere kept back the forces of the north. The
                    king then marched into Sussex, occupied the hill of Senlac, now Battle, and
                    awaited the Norman attack. After a vain exchange <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n518/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0518-0487"/> of messages, the decisive battle was fought
                    on October 14th. As the English were wholly infantry, while the Normans were
                    strongest in cavalry and archers, Harold’s object was simply to hold the hill
                    against all attack. As Ion" as he was obeyed, his tactics were completely
                    successful. But <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> a part of his troops, disobeying
                    his orders, left the hill to pursue, and the English array was broken. The
                    Normans could now get up the hill, and, after a fight which lasted from morning
                    till evening, they had the victory. The king and his brothers Gyrth and Leofwine
                    were killed. As Harold was condemned by the pope, William at first refused him
                    Christian burial, and caused him to be buried on the rocks at Hastings. But it
                    seems most likely that he afterwards allowed the body to be removed to Harold’s
                    own church at Waltham. The tale which represents Harold as escaping from the
                    battle, living a life of penitence, and at last dying at Chester, is a mere
                    romance.</p>
                <p>Harold left several children, but there is a good deal of uncertainty as to his
                    marriage or marriages. He had two sons by Ealdgyth, Harold and Wulf; but they
                    must have been twins born after their father’s death. He had also three sons,
                    Godwine, Eadmund, and Magnus, and two daughters, Gytha and Gunhild. It will be
                    seen how strong the Scandinavian element is in these names. These five were not
                    children of Ealdgyth, and the sons were grown up, or nearly so, when their
                    father died. They may have been the children of an unrecorded first wife. But
                    the local history of Waltham represented Harold’s body as being found after the
                    battle by a former mistress of his, Eadgyth Swanneshals (Swansneck). Some have
                    thought that this Eadgyth is the “Eddeva pulcra” of Domesday, who appears as the
                    former holder of great estates in the east of England. This, though not
                    unlikely, is quite uncertain; but there seems evidence enough to show that
                    Eadgyth Swanneshals is a real person, and to connect her with Harold’s
                    East-Anglian earldom. It seems most likely that she was the mother of Harold’s
                    earlier children, and that the connexion between them was that intermediate
                    state between marriage and concubinage called the Danish marriage, of which we
                    not uncommonly hear in those days.</p>
                <p>The character of Harold is blackened with many, but mostly very vague, charges by
                    the Norman writers. The English, on the other hand, paint him as the perfect
                    model of a ruler. With regard to his accession to the crown, the common charge
                    of usurpation springs from ignorance of the English law of the time. Harold was
                    beyond all doubt regularly nominated by Eadward, regularly chosen by the witan,
                    and regularly crowned by Ealdred. This last point is of importance in those
                    days, when the rite of coronation was deemed of such moment. The Normans try to
                    represent the ceremony as invalid, by saying that Harold was crowned by Stigand,
                    archbishop of Canterbury, whose canonical position was doubtful. That Harold
                    crowned himself, instead of receiving the ecclesiastical consecration, is a mere
                    fable, arising from a misunderstanding of some of the rhetorical invectives of
                    the Norman writers. It should be noticed that those contemporary writers who
                    speak of Harold as an usurper do so wholly on the ground of the alleged right of
                    William, and of Harold’s oath to William. That Harold’s accession was a wrong
                    done to young Eadgar is an idea which we first hear of in the next century, when
                    the doctrine of hereditary right had taken firmer root. In Domesday the reign of
                    Harold is passed by; he is regularly spoken of as earl; the doctrine of the
                    Norman lawyers was that William, though of course not full king till his
                    coronation, had the sole right to the crown from the moment of Eadward’s
                    death.</p>
                <p>The military skill of Harold is plain, both from the Welsh war, when he overcame
                    the mountaineers by making his English soldiers adopt the Welsh tactics, and
                    from his conduct both at Stamfordbridge and at Senlac. He clearly understood the
                    difference between his two enemies, when it was wise to attack and when it was
                    wise to await the attack. At Stamfordbridge his strategy was perfectly
                    successful; it failed at Senlac only because of the disobedience of part of his
                    army. The best witness to his civil government is the general peace and good
                    order of England during that part of the reign of Eadward which was virtually
                    his reign. When the peace is broken, it is always by the act of others, and
                    Harold is always called on to make the settlement. He appears throughout as
                    singularly mild and conciliating, never pressing hard upon any enemy. The later
                    Norman writers indeed have an elaborate tale which represents Harold and Tostig
                    as enemies from their childhood. But this is mere romance, with no ground in any
                    contemporary writer.</p>
                <p>The relations of Harold to the church, always an important feature in the
                    character of a prince of that age, suggest several questions. He is charged in
                    Domesday with several encroachments on ecclesiastical property, chiefly in
                    Herefordshire, and the like charge is brought against him in a deed of Leofric,
                    bishop of Exeter. But it must be remembered that this kind of charge is brought
                    against every leading man of the time, and that we very seldom hear more than
                    one side. The most distinct and detailed charge, that which represents Harold as
                    a wholesale spoiler of the church of Wells, can be refuted, not by hearing the
                    other side, but by going back to the charge as brought by the original
                    complainant, Bishop Gisa. We here find that Harold took nothing from the church,
                    but simply hindered the bishopric from receiving a bequest to which there is
                    some reason for thinking that he may have had a right as earl. On the other
                    hand, Harold appears as the friend and protector of several ecclesiastical
                    bodies, and above all as the founder of Waltham. Here we may remark that, when
                    monks were all the fashion, he preferred the secular clergy. He was the firm
                    friend of the best prelate of his time, Bishop Wulfstan, and he appeared on good
                    terms with most of the leading churchmen.</p>
                <p>The contemporary authorities are the English Chronicles, the Latin biographer of
                    Eadward in Dr Luard’s collection (he gives a splendid panegyric on Harold), and
                    Florence of Worcester, on the English side. On the Norman side are the Bayeux
                    Tapestry, William of Poitiers, William of Jumiéges, Guy of Amiens <hi

                    especially show how the estimate of the events of the 11th century gradually
                    changed. The French life of Eadward in the 13th is very bitter against Harold.
                    Of the Scandinavian writers, Saxo Grammaticus is violent against him, while the
                    biographer of Olaf Tryggvesson counts him for a saint. All the statements are

                    earlier writers, Thien·y and Palgrave, are also worth comparing. (E. A. F.)</p>
