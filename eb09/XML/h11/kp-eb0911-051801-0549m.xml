                    Romans when on a journey; and hats with brim3 were also used, probably on like
                    occasions, by the earlier Greeks. It was not till after the Norman conquest that
                    the use of hats began in England. A “hatte of biever” about the middle of the
                    12th century was worn by some one of the “nobels of the lande, mett at
                    Clarendom;” and Froissart describes hats and plumes which were worn at Edward’s
                    court in 1340, when the Garter order was instituted. In the 13th century the use
                    of the scarlet hat which distinguishes cardinals was sanctioned by Pope Innocent
                    IV. The merchant in Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> had</p>
                <p>“On his head a FIaundrish be ver hat;”</p>
                <p>and from that period onwards there is frequent mention of “felt hattes,” “beever
                    hattes,” and other like names. Throughout mediaeval times the wearing of a hat
                    was regarded as a mark of rank and distinction. The caprices of fashion in hats
                    during the reign of Elizabeth may be understood from an extract from Stubbs’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">of Abuses,</hi> published about
                    1585 :—</p>
                <p>“Sometimes they use them sharpe on the crowne pearking up like the spire or shaft
                    of a steeple, standing a quarter of a yard above the crowne of theire heads;
                    some more, some lesse, as please the fantasies of their inconstant mindes.
                    Othersome be flat, and broade on the crowne, like the battlements of a house.

                    with another; now black, now white, now russed, now redde, now grene, now
                    yellow; now this, now that; never content with one colour or fashion two daies
                    to an end.”</p>
                <p>During the reign of Charles I. the Puritans affected a steeple crown and
                    broad-brimmed hat, while the Cavaliers adopted a lower crown and a broader brim
                    ornamented with feathers. Still greater breadth of brim and a profusion of
                    feathers were fashionable characteristics of the hats in the time of Charlee
                    II., and the gradual expansion of brim led to the device of looping or tying up
                    that portion. Hence arose various fashionable “cocks” in hats, such as the
                    “Monmouth cock,” drc.; and ultimately, by the looping up equally of three sides
                    of the low-crowned hat, the cocked hat which prevailed throughout the 18th
                    century was elaborated.</p>
                <p>Since the beginning of the present century the cocked hat as an ordinary article
                    of dress has disappeared. The Quaker hat, plain, low in crown, and broad in
                    brim, which originated with the sect in the middle of the 17th century, is also
                    now becoming uncommon. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Costume.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hat Manufacture.</hi> —Until recent times hats were principally
                    made by the process of felting, and as tradition ascribed the discovery of that
                    very ancient operation to St Clement, he was assumed as the patron saint of the
                    craft, and the annual festival of the trade continues to be held on St Clement’s
                    day, the 23d November. At the present day the trade is divided into two distinct
                    classes. The first and most ancient is concerned with the manufacture of felt
                    hats, and the second has to do with the recent but now most extensive and
                    important manufacture of silk or dress hats. In addition to these there is the
                    equally important manufacture of straw or plaited hats, which does not fall
                    within the scope of this article; and hats are occasionally manufactured of
                    materials and by processes not included under any of these heads, but such
                    manufactures do not take a large or permanent position in the industry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Felt Hats.—</hi> As now made, felt hats are of three different
                    kinds, plain soft, plain hard, and “napped” or “ruffed” felts. There is a great
                    range in the quality of felt hats, the finer and more expensive qualities being
                    made entirely of fur; for commoner qualities a mixture of fur and Saxony wool is
                    used; and for the lowest kinds wool alone is employed. The processes and
                    apparatus necessary for making hats of fur differ also from those required in
                    the case of woollen bodies; and in large manufactories machinery is now
                    generally employed for operations which at no distant date were entirely manual.
                    In the smaller factories, and for special objects, the old hand processes are
                    still in operation. An outline of the operations by which the old beaver hat was
                    and to some extent yet is made will give an idea of the manual processes in
                    making a fur napped hat, and the apparatus and mechanical processes employed in
                    making ordinary hard and soft felts will afterwards be noticed.</p>
                <p>Hatters’ fur consists principally of the hair of rabbits (technically called
                    coneys) and hares, with some proportion of nutria, musquash, and beavers’hair;
                    and generally any parings and cuttings from furriers are also used. Furs
                    intended for felting are deprived of their long coarse hairs, after which they
                    are treated with a solution of nitrate of mercury, an operation called carroting
                    or <hi rend="italic">secretage,</hi> whereby the felting properties of the fur
                    are greatly increased. The fur is then cut by hand or machine from the skin, and
                    in this state it is delivered to the hat maker. Rabbits’ fur for hat-making now
                    comes in large quantities from the Australian colonies; and it is also largely
                    collected in the United Kingdom and in northern Europe. A considerable trade in
                    rabbit fur for hat-making is maintained between Great Britain and the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>The old process of making a beaver hat is as follows. The materials of a proper
                    beaver consist, for the body or foundation, of rabbits’ fur, and for the nap, of
                    beaver fur, although the beaver is often mixed with or supplanted by a more
                    common fur. Such a hat may be regarded as the highest achievement of the hatter.
                    In preparing the fur plate, the hatter weighs out a sufficient quantity of
                    rabbit fur for a single hat, which is spread out and combined by the operation
                    of bowing. The bow or stang ABC (fig. 1) is about 7 feet long, and it stretches
                    a single cord of catgut D, which the workman vibrates by means of a wooden pin
                    E, furnished with a half knob at each end. Holding the bow in his left hand, and
                    the pin in his right, he causes the vibrating string to come in contact with the
                    heap of tangled fur, which does not cover a space greater than that <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0550-0519"/> •of the hand. At each vibration some of the
                    filaments start up to the height of a few inches, and fall away from the mass, a
                    little to the right of the bow, their excursions being restrained by a concave
                    frame of wicker work called the basket. One half of the material is first
                    operated on, and by bowing and gathering, or a patting use of the basket, the
                    stuff is loosely matted into a triangular figure, about 50 by 36 inches, called
                    a bat. In this formation care is taken to work about two-thirds of the fur down
                    towards what is intended for the brim, which being effected, greater density is
                    induced by gentle pressure with the basket. It is then covered with a wettish
                    linen cloth, upon which is laid the hardening skin, a piece of dry halftanned
                    horse hide. On this the workman presses or bakes until the stuff adheres closely
                    to the-damp cloth, in which it is then doubled up, freely pressed with the baud,
                    and laid aside. By this process, called basoning, the bat has become compactly
                    felted and thinned toward the sides and point. The other half of the fur is next
                    subjected to precisely the same processes, after which a cone-shaped slip of
                    stiff paper is laid on its surface, and the sides of the bat are folded over its
                    edges to its form and size. It is then laid paper-side downward upon the first
                    bat, which is now replaced on the hurdle, and its edges are transversely doubled
                    over the introverted side-lays of the second bat, thus giving equal thickness to
                    the whole body. In this condition it is reintroduced between folds of damp linen
                    cloth, and again hardened, so as to unite the two halves, the knitting together
                    of which is quickly effected. The paper is now withdrawn; and the body in the
                    form of a large cone is removed to the plank or battery room.</p>
                <p>The battery consists of an open iron boiler or kettle A (fig. 2), filled with
                    scalding hot water, with shelves, B, C, partly of mahogany and partly of lead,
                    sloping down to it. Here the body is first dipped in the water, and then
                    withdrawn to the plank to partly cool and drain, when it is unfolded,
                    rolledgently with a pin tapering towards the ends, turned, and worked in every
                    direction, to toughen and shrink it, and at the same time prevent adhesion of
                    its sides. Stopping or thickening the thin spots which now appear, on looking
                    through the body, is carefully performed by dabbing on additional stuff in
                    successive supplies from the hot liquor with a brush frequently dipped into the
                    kettle, until the body be shrunk sufficiently (about one half) and thoroughly
                    equalized. When quite dried, stiffening, is performed with a brush dipped into a
                    thin varnish of shellac, and rubbed into the body, the surface intended for the
                    inside having much more laid on it than the outer, while the brim is made to
                    absorb many times the quantity applied to any other part.</p>
                <p>On being again dried, the body is ready to be covered with a nap of beaver hair.
                    For this, in-inferior qualities, the hair of the otter, nutria, or other fine
                    fur is sometimes substituted. The requisite quantity of one or other of these is
                    taken and mixed with a proportion of cotton, and the whole is bowed up into a
                    thin uniform lap. The cotton merely serves to give sufficient body to the
                    material to enable the workman to handle the lap. The body of the hat being
                    damped, the workman spreads over it a covering of this lap, and by moistening
                    and gentle patting with a brush the cut ends of the hair penetrate and fix
                    themselves in the felt body. The hat is now put into a coarse hair cloth, dipped
                    and rolled in the hot liquor until the fur is quite worked in, the cotton being
                    left on the surface loose and ready for removal. The blocking, dyeing, and
                    finishing processes in the case of beaver hats are similar to those employed for
                    ordinary felts, except that greater care and dexterity are required on the part
                    of the workmen, and further that the coarse hairs or kemps which may be in the
                    fur are cut off by shaving the surface with a razor. The nap also must be laid
                    in one direction, smoothed, and rendered glossy by repeated wettings, ironings,
                    and brushings. A hat so finished is very durable, and it is much more light,
                    cool, and easy-fitting to the head than the silk hat which has now so largely
                    superseded it.</p>
                <p>Till a comparatively recent date all attempts to apply machinery to the principal
                    processes in felt hat-making resulted in failure. As is the case with many other
                    labour-saving appliances of recent introduction, the first efficient machinery
                    for felt hat-making was devised in America, and from the United States the
                    machinemaking processes were introduced into England about the year 1858; and
                    now in all large establishments machinery such as that alluded to below is
                    employed. For the forming of hat bodies two kinds of machine are used, according
                    as the material employed is fur or wool. In the case of fur, the essential
                    portion of the apparatus used consists of a cone of copper oF the size and form
                    of the body or bat to be made, perforated all over with small holes. The cone is
                    made to revolve on its axis slowly over an orifice under which there is a
                    powerful fan, which maintains a strong inward draught of air through the holes
                    in the cone. At the side of the cone, and with an opening towards it, is a trunk
                    or box from which the fur to be made into a hat is thrown out by the rapid
                    revolution of a brushlike cylinder, and as the cloud of separate hairs is
                    expelled from the trunk, the current of air being sucked through the cone
                    carries the fibres to it and causes them to cling closely to its surface. Thus a
                    coating of loose fibres is accumulated on the coppeτ cone, and these are kept in
                    position only by the exhaust at work under it. When sufficient for a hat body
                    has been deposited, a wet cloth is wrapped round it, over which an outer cone is
                    slipped and the whole is removed for felting, while another copper cone is
                    placed in position for continuing the work. The felting of fur bodies is
                    principally done by hand-labour, although machinery has recently been introduced
                    by which it is partly done. The bat or body of wool hats is prepared by first
                    carding in a modified form of carding machine. The wool is divided into two
                    separate slivers as delivered from the cards, and these are wound simultaneously
                    on a double conical block of wood mounted and geared to revolve slowly with a
                    reciprocating horizontal motion, so that there is a continual crossing and
                    recrossing of the wool as the sliver is wound around the cone. This diagonal
                    arrangement of the sliver is an essential feature iu the apparatus, as thereby
                    the strength of the finished felt is made equal in every direction; and when
                    strained in the blocking the texture yields in a uniform manner without rupture.
                    The wool wound on the double block forms the material of two hats, which are
                    separated by cutting around the median or base line, and slipping each half off
                    at its own end. Into each cone of wool or bat an “inlayer” is now placed to
                    prevent the inside from matting, after which they are folded in cloths, and
                    placed over a perforated iron plate through which steam is blown. When well
                    moistened and heated, they are placed between boards, and subjected to a rubbing
                    action sufficient to harden them for bearing the subsequent strong planking or
                    felting operations. The planking of wool hats is generally done by machine, in
                    some cases a form of fulling mill being used; but in all forms the agency is
                    heat, moisture, pressure, rubbing, and turning.</p>
                <p>When by thorough felting the hat bodies of any kind have been reduced to dense
                    leathery cones about one-half the size of the original bat, they are dried, and,
                    if hard felts are to be made, the bodies are at this stage hardened or stiffened
                    with a varnish of shellac. Next follows the operation of blocking, in which the
                    felt for the first time assumes approximately the form it is ultimately to
                    possess. For this purpose the conical body is softened in boiling water, and
                    forcibly drawn over a hat-shaped wooden block. A string is passed round where
                    the band is to be, and the brim is then flattened out from the string. Next
                    follows the dyeing of the hat in a bath of suitable dyeing materials, according
                    to the colour desired. In dealing with fine hats, each hat is separately dyed
                    while on the block, but with commoner qualities it is the practice to dye before
                    blocking. The finishing processes include shaping on a block, over which crown
                    and brim receive accurately their ultimate form, and pouncing or pumicing, which
                    consists of smoothing the whole surface with emery or glass paper while the hat
                    is still stretched on the block. The trimmer finally binds the outer brim and
                    inserts the lining, after which the brim may get more or less of a curl or turn
                    over according to prevailing fashion. Machines of American invention for
                    blocking and pouncing have to some extent been introduced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silk Hats.—</hi> The silk hat, which has now become coextensive
                    with civilization, is an article of recent introduction. It was known in
                    Florence about a century ago; but its manufacture was not introduced into France
                    till about 1825, and its development has taken place entirely since that period.
                    A silk hat consists of a light stiff body covered with a plush of silk, the
                    manufacture of which in a brilliant glossy condition is the most important
                    element in the industry; and in that manufacture the French are without equals.
                    Originally the bodies were made of felt anl various other materials, but now
                    calico is almost exclusively used.</p>
                <p>The calico is first stiffened with a varnish of shellac, and then cut into pieces
                    sufficient for crown, side, and brim. The side-piece is wound round a wooden hat
                    block, and its edges are joined by hot ironing, and the crown-piece is put on

                    thicknesses of calico cemented together, is now slipped over and brought to its
                    position, and thereafter a second side-piece and another crown are cemented on.
                    The whole of the body, thus prepared, now receives a coat of size, and
                    subsequently it is varnished over, and thus it is ready for the operation of
                    covering. In covering this body, the under brim, generally of merino, is first
                    attached, then the upper brim, and lastly the crown and side sewn together are
                    drawn over. All these by hot ironing and stretching are drawn smooth and tight,
                    and as the varnish of the body softens with the heat, body and cover adhere all
                    over to each other without wrinkle or pucker. Dressing and polishing by means of
                    damping, brushing, and ironing, come next, after which the hat is “velured” in a
                    revolving machine by the application of haircloth and velvet velures, which
                    cleans the nap and gives it a smooth and glossy surface. The brim has only then
                    to be bound, the linings inserted, and the brim finally curled, when the hat is
                    ready for use.</p>
                <p>In all kinds of hat-making the French excel, and in such centres as Auduze,
                    Lyons, and Paris the trade is very extensive and important. In the United
                    Kingdom the felt hat trade is principally centred at Denton and other localities
                    in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and in America the States of New York and
                    New Jersey enjoy the greater part of the industry. The value of the hats
                    annually exported from the United Kingdom somewhat exceeds £ 1,000,000 sterling.
