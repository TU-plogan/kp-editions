                    age of twenty-five according to 2 Kings xviii. 2; and this is probably correct
                    if the LXX. be followed in reading “twenty-five” instead of “twenty” in 2 Chr.

                    when it became apparent that the destruction of Samaria by Sargon and the

                    for twenty-nine years with a vigour and a success that deeply impressed later
                    historians; “he trusted in the Lord God of Israel; so that after him was none
                    like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him” (2 Kings
                    xviii. 5; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Ecclus. xlviii. 17-25). The very outset of
                    his reign was marked by an emphatic reversal, both in foreign and in domestic
                    affairs, of the policy which had been so disastrously followed by his weak and
                    foolish predecessor. While Ahaz had shown distinctly paganizing tendencies in
                    religion, Hezekiah was,ardent in his zeal for the exclusive worship of Jehovah,
                    which he sought to simplify, centralize, and refine even at the expense of
                    abolishing many cherished institutions which had the sanction of ancient usage.
                    “He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah,
                    and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto these days
                    the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he [or, perhaps, they] called
                    it Nehushtan” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> according to the A.V., “brazen”;
                    but, if this was the popular name, it is probably derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >nahash,</hi> serpent; see 2 Kings xviii. 4). How great were the strength of
                    conviction and the courage which were necessary to such reforms as these is
                    incidentally shown by the appeal to conservative feeling which some years
                    afterwards could still be made by a skilful diplomatist with at least some hope
                    of success (2 Kings xviii. 22). The details of the reforming activities of
                    Hezekiah, extending even to the northern kingdom, as given with characteristic
                    fulness and minuteness by the compiler of the book of Chronicles, are not now
                    accepted by the majority of critics as absolutely trustworthy, a prevalent
                    opinion being that actions have been attributed to Hezekiah which ought really
                    to have been assigned to Josiah, and that some at least of the chronology is
                    imaginary; but it is obvious that the influence of such prophets as Isaiah and
                    Micah must have been powerful enough to bring about many thorough-going changes
                    even during the earlier reign. As in the internal religious affairs of the
                    theocratic kingdom so in its relations with foreign powers Hezekiah innovated
                    very conspicuously on the policy of his father, although not here entirely on
                    the lines laid down by the great contemporary prophet. Confirmed in the
                    consciousness of military strength by a successful war against the Philistines
                    (2 Kings xviii. 8), and having no longer anything to fear either from Damascus
                    or from Samaria, he began to cherish the hope (at least with Egyptian support
                    and the active co-operation of Egyptian cavalry) of being able to shake off
                    entirely the yoke of Assyria, and with this view he set about extensive
                    fortifications and other engineering works in and about Jerusalem. “He made the
                    pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city,” “stopping the upper
                    outlet of Gihon and bringing it straight by an underground way;” he also “built
                    up all the wall that was broken, and raised thereupon towers” (2 Kings XX. 20; 2
                    Chr. xxxii. 5, 30; and <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Isa. xxii. 8—11, which also
                    has been referred by the sagacity of Ewald to this period). It is not clear from
                    the sacred historians how far Judah was affected by the successful expedition of
                    Sargon against Ashdod in 711 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which is mentioned
                    in Isa. XX. 1 (and in which possibly Sennacherib may have held the rank of a
                    rabsaki or general);· but Ewald’s brilliant conjecture, to the effect that Isa.
                    xxii. 1 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi> alludes to hardships suffered by the people
                    of Hezekiah at that time, is remarkably confirmed by the cuneiform inscriptions.
                    It was not, however, until after the accession of Sennacherib (705) and the
                    resolution of that monarch to direct one of his great expeditions against Egypt
                    (c. 701), that matters were brought to a sharp and immediate crisis between
                    Nineveh and Jerusalem. The capture of all his “fenced cities,” Jerusalem
                    excepted, coupled with the inactivity of Egypt, convinced Hezekiah of the
                    uselessness of a struggle with the greatest military power of his century, in a
                    way that Isaiah, with often repeated admonitions, had failed to do; and the
                    payment of a large sum of money by way of tribute readily purchased a temporary
                    relief. But when Sennacherib sent from Lachish his “tartan,” or
                    commanderin-chief, along with the “rab-saris,” or head eunuch, and the
                    “rab-shakeh,' ’ or chief of the staff (the rendering “chief cup-bearer” seems
                    based on a wrong etymology), with a large force to demand the surrender of
                    Jerusalem itself, it was felt by king and prophet alike that the time for
                    resistance to the utmost had come. Probably the resolution thus formed was in
                    part, at least, due to the fact that the main body of the Assyrian army was
                    already finding it necessary to fall back before Tirhakah, the Ethiopian king of
                    Egypt, from Lachish to Libnah; it was at all events justified, not only by the
                    indecisive battle at Altaku near Ekron, but also by the pestilence (2 Kings xix.
                    35) which speedily compelled the withdrawal of Sennacherib with the remains of
                    his army from Libnah to Nineveh. The relation between the accounts of this
                    retreat given by Sennacherib himself, by the sacred historians, and by Herodotus
                    (ii. 141) will be considered in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sennacherib.</hi> The sickness and recovery of Hezekiah, recorded in 2 Kings
                    XX. 1-11 and (with additional details) in Isa. xxxviii., seem to have preceded
                    the invasion of Sennacherib by three years at most; they were almost immediately
                    followed by the arrival of the messengers of Merodach (not Berodach) Baladan,
                    the son of Baladan, who for some six months, until repressed by Sennacherib,
                    usurped the throne of Babylon about the year 703. The excessive courtesy shown
                    to these ambassadors gave occasion, it is recorded (2 Kings xx. 17, 18), to a
                    prediction by Isaiah of the Babylonian exile, which took place more than a
                    century afterwards. Of the later portion of Hezekiah’s reign no details have
                    been preserved; but it appears to have been characterized by peace and
                    prosperity. He was succeeded in 688 by Manasseh, his son by Hephzibah, born
                    apparently about 702. Besides being a patron of literature (Prov. XXV. 1),
                    Hezekiah was himself a poet; and his sole remaining production (Isa. xxxviii.
                    10-20), if somewhat deficient in originality, abounds in depth and tenderness of
                    religious and poetic feeling.</p>
