                    in the scholiast on Aristoph., <hi rend="italic">Raιι.,</hi> 706, can be trusted
                    (fr. 80), Hellanicus in one of his works referred to the battle of Arginusae
                    (406 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). In that case (482-397 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> the dates assigned by Müller <hi rend="italic">{Fragm. Hist.
                    Gr.,</hi> i. p. xxxiv.), following the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vita</hi><hi rend="italic">Euripidis,</hi> must be approximately correct. On
                    the other hand Thucydides (i. 93), who died in 403 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> criticizes the work in which this statement might be expected to
                    occur, which leaves a very narrow interval for the work to appear and acquire
                    reputation enough to be taken notice of by Thucydides; while the style of the
                    reference certainly suggests at first sight that Hellanicus was dead when
                    Thucydides was writing. If on these grounds we disregard the scholiast, we may
                    on the authority of Pamphila assign 496-411 as the limits of his life. Suidas
                    says that he died at Perperene, a town on the Gulf of Adramyttium, and that he
                    lived for some time at the Macedonian court along with Herodotus. If the latter
                    fact be true, the time to which Suidas assigns it, viz., during the •reign of
                    Amyntas (553-504), is impossible.</p>
                <p>The following list of his works gives the results of Muller’s careful discussion
                    of the extant fragments :—</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">Persica·,</hi> probably in two books. This work, which was
                    written before those on Greek history, gave (probably in bk. i.) an account of
                    the Assyrians and the Medes, and (in bk. ii.) a history of the Persian empire.
                    (2. ) <hi rend="italic">Phoronis,</hi> Argolic traditions from Phoroneus,
                    “father of mortal men,” the contemporary of Ogyges, down probably to the return
                    of the Heraclidae. It consisted chiefly of genealogies, with short notices of
                    events interspersed. It was probably in two books; and the works quoted as <hi
                    rend="italic">Boeotica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Argolica</hi> are probably
                    only portions of it. (3.) <hi rend="italic">Bcucalionia,</hi> tracing Thessalian
                    traditions in a similar manner from Deucalion, who corresponds to Phoroneus as
                    the first man. It was in two books; and the <hi rend="italic">Thessalica</hi> is
                    probably only another name for it or the title of a part of it. <hi
                    rend="italic">Asoρis</hi> was apparently an appendix giving the genealogy of the
                    Aeacid race from Zeus and Aegina, daughter of Asopus, down to Miltiades. (4.)
                    <hi rend="italic">Atlantis,</hi> in two books, briefly enumerating the
                    descendants of Atlas in general, but dwelling at much greater length on the
                    offspring of Electra, and introducing in this part an account of Trojan history.
                    Hence the work is often cited under the name of <hi rend="italic">Troica.</hi>
                    The works quoted as ιrepl ’ Apκ∙αδiαs and <hi rend="italic">πepl</hi> Λυδiαs are
                    probably merely parts. (5.) <hi rend="italic">Atthis,</hi> called by Thucydides
                    (i. 97) <hi rend="italic">ή</hi> ’ Aττ&lt;κ¾ <hi rend="italic">συγγραφή,</hi>
                    giving in four books the history of the country from Ogyges or Cecrops down at
                    least to the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides says that he
                    enumerated the events between 480 and 431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> very
                    briefly, and with little regard to chronological sequence. These four works on
                    Greek history (2-5) were probably published in one single work, and were divided
                    by later grammarians into separate sections and books. (6.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lesbiaca</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aeolica,</hi> a <hi rend="italic"
                    >σύνταγμα</hi><hi rend="italic">eπιχωριov</hi> in two books at least. (7.) ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">leρeιaι τηs"Hpas,</hi> a list of the priestesses of the Argive
                    Hera, incorporating a synopsis both of what had been scattered through his other
                    works and of history that had not come within the scope of these works. We may
                    presume that a list of priestesses was preserved in the temple with a slight
                    account of contemporary events, particularly those relating to festivals and
                    religious matters, and that Hellanicus made this the basis of his work.
                    Reference to this line of priestesses was ono of the commonest methods of
                    dating, and is used by Thucydides in important cases (ii. 2; iv. 133). This is
                    probably the same work that is often referred to under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Histories.</hi> It was in three books; the first came down to the
                    apotheosis of Heracles and the voyage of Theseus to Crete, and the second
                    probably to the Persian Wars. (8.) <hi rend="italic">Cameonicae,</hi> a list of
                    the victors in the Camean games of Apollo from their foundation, 01. 26; along
                    with the conquerors in the poetical and musical contests, it probably contained
                    notices of literary events. (9.) <hi rend="italic">'Qapβaρικa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">νόμιμα,</hi> quoted also with the titles <hi rend="italic"
                    >∙πep</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">iθvωv,</hi> &amp;c. As the
                    history of the barbarian races was too little known to be arranged as Hellanicus
                    had arranged the Greek history, the plan in this work was to enumerate the
                    towns, and to describe the country, manners of the people, &amp;c., like a
                    geographer. The <hi rend="italic">Aegyptiaca</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Iter
                    ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Templum</hi><hi rend="italic">Ammonis,</hi> which were
                    parts of this work, are counted by Müller spurious insertions on Orphic theology
                    by an Egyptian writer; while ∆tδs <hi rend="italic">πoλυτυχia</hi> is merely a
                    part of this spurious insertion. Preller <hi rend="italic">(Be Hellan. Lcsb.
                    Histor.)</hi> considers this whole work to be spurious.</p>
                <p>As an historian Hellanicus is greatly in advance of preceding logographers. He
                    was not content to repeat the traditions that had gained general acceptation
                    through the poets, but he tried to give the traditions as they were locally
                    current, and he availed himself of the few national or priestly registers that
                    presented something like contemporary registration. Thus, in the first place, he
                    gave in many points accounts quite different from the usual beliefs <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> he recorded the local belief in the Troad that Troy had
                    not been totally destroyed by the Greeks but had continued to exist to his own
                    time; and in the <hi rend="italic">Atthis,</hi> touching on Spartan affairs, he
                    made no reference to Lycurgus, but attributed the Spartan constitution to
                    Eurysthenes and Procles. Now it is certain that the Spartan state registers
                    could not have made any mention of Lycurgus on account of the plan on which they
                    were framed (Müller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Bor.,</hi> i. p. 132). Secondly,
                    Hellanicus laid the foundations of a scientific chronology, though his materials
                    were insufficient and he often had recourse to the usual rough reckoning by
                    generations. On account of his deviations from common tradition, Hellanicus is
                    often called an untrustworthy writer by the ancients themselves; but probably
                    few authors would have been more useful to a scientific student if his works had
                    been preserved. Dionysius (<hi rend="italic">Judic. de Thucyd.</hi>) censures
                    him for arranging his history, not according to the natural connexion of events,
                    but according to the locality or the nation he was describing; and undoubtedly
                    he never, like his contemporary Herodotus, rose to the conception of a single
                    current of events wider than the local distinction of race. His style, like that
                    of the older logographers, was dry and bald; and there seems little foundation
                    for the statement of Suidas that he wrote poetry, though perhaps some parts of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aeolica</hi> were in verse.</p>
