                <p><label type="entry">HANNIBAL</label>, a city of the United States, in Marion
                    county, Missouri, is situated on the west bank of the Mississippi river, 150
                    miles above St Louis. Owing to its position on the river and its extensive
                    railroad connexions, it has become a busy commercial town; and evidence of the
                    prosperity of many of its inhabitants is afforded by the number of fine
                    residences on the surrounding slopes. It possesses a city hall, a Roman Catholic
                    seminary, and a high school. The river is crossed by a splendid iron bridge,
                    which has provision both for ordinary and for railway traffic. The principal
                    shipping trade is in lumber with other parts of the State, as well as with
                    Kansas and Texas; but tobacco, pork, and flour are also extensively shipped. The
                    manufactories include foundries, car-works, machineshops, tobacco-works,
                    beef-curing establishments, and flourmills. In the neighbourhood there are
                    lime-works and coal-pits. The population, which in 18G0 was 6505, and in 1870
                    was 10,125, of whom 1616 were coloured and 1632 foreigners, is now (1880)
                    estimated at 15,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> HANNO (a very common Carthaginian name, Greek
                    Aιτωv), according to the title of the <hi rend="italic">Peripl·us</hi> that
                    passes under the name, was a king (basileus) of the Carthaginians who undertook
                    an exploring and colonizing expedition along the north-western coasts of Africa
                    beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and on his return inscribed a narrative of his
                    voyage in the temple of Saturn. There are no data to fix with any precision the
                    time at which he flourished, the most definite statement about the matter being
                    Pliny’s “Punicis rebus florentissimis.” Bougainville and Vivien de Saint Martin
                    are disposed to assign him to <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 570 B.C.; Heeren,
                    Kluge, and others make him contemporary with a Hanno, father of Hamilcar (c. 510
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>); and Müller thinks he may be possibly identified
                    with Hanno the son of Hamilcar (c. 470 B.C.). According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Periplus,</hi> which is the only detailed notice of the expedition that has
                    come down to us, he sailed with sixty galleys <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ρentecontoroi')</hi> and 30,000 (?) men and women, and in the course of his
                    voyage south founded the city of Thymiaterium and settled colonies at Gytte,
                    Aera, Melitta, Arambys, and in the island of Cerne or Kerne. The terminus of the
                    voyage was an island beyond a gulf called the Noti Cornu, in which they found a
                    number of “hairy women” whom the interpreters named <hi rend="italic"
                    >gorillas.</hi></p>
                <p>The identification of the various points mentioned in the narrative has given
                    scope to abundant dissertation and conjecture, and the question as to the site
                    of the gorilla island, or southmost limit of the exploration, has been
                    discussed, with special interest. Bougainville and Dureau de la Malle maintain
                    that Hanno reached the Bight of Benin; Müller and Vivien de Saint Martin find
                    his <hi rend="italic">ultima Thule</hi> in the Gulf of Sherboro; Mannert decides
                    in favour of Bissagos, Heeren for the mouth of the Gambia, Malte Brun for the
                    Bay of Cintra, and Quatremère for the neighbourhood of the Senegal, while
                    Gosselin would go no further south than Cape Nun. But while authorities differ
                    so much in the matter of identification, almost all agree that the narrative is
                    one of the most remarkable records of early exploration that have been
                    preserved. “In its original form,” says Vivien de Saint Martin, “it was only a
                    commemorative inscription of barely a hundred lines, and yet in spite of this
                    extreme conciseness there is not one of its details, whether of localities or
                    distances, which is not rigorously conformable to the very accurate acquaintance
                    which we now have of these coasts.” In the 18th century Dodwell called tire
                    authenticity of the <hi rend="italic">Periplus</hi><hi rend="italic">va.</hi>
                    question, but it was considered that his arguments had been disposed of by
                    Falconer and others. Recently, however, Μ. Tauxier has renewed the attack,
                    maintaining that in reality we have nothing before us but “a compilation due to
                    an ignorant Greek of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> brought to
                    its present form by some Christian of the time of Theodosius, probably a student
                    to whom the task was assigned of adapting the old <hi rend="italic"
                    >Periplus</hi> to the geographical ideas of the day.”</p>
