                    measures 160 miles from N.E. to S.W., and the average breadth is about 90 miles.
                    The area is estimated at from 1200 to 1400 square miles, or two-thirds the size
                    of Sicily. From the peninsula of Lei-chow on the north it is separated by the
                    straits of Hainan, which have a breadth of 15 or 20 miles.</p>
                <p>With the exception of a considerable area in the north, and broad tracts on the
                    north-east and north-west sides, the whole island is occupied by jungle-covered
                    mountains, with rich valleys between. The central range bears the name of Li-mou
                    Shan or Wu Tchi Shan (the Five-Finger Mountain), and attains a height of 6000 or
                    7000 feet. Its praises are celebrated in a glowing ode by Ch’iu, a native poet.
                    The island appears to be well watered, and some of its rivers are not without
                    importance as possible highways of commerce; but the details of its hydrography
                    are very partially ascertained. A navigable channel extends in an irregular
                    curve from the bay of Hai-Kow in the north to Tan-chow on the west coast. Being
                    exposed to the winter monsoon the northern parts of the island enjoy much the
                    same sort of temperate climate as the neighbouring provinces of the mainland,
                    but in the southern parts, protected from the monsoon by the mountain ranges,
                    the climate is almost or entirely tropical. Snow falls so rarely that its
                    appearance in 1684 is reported in the native chronicles as a remarkable event.
                    Earthquakes are a much more familiar phenomenôn, having occurred, according to
                    the same authority, in 1523, 1526, 1605, 1652, 1677, 1681, 1684, 1702,
                    1704,1725, 1742, 1816, 1817, and 1822. Excellent timber of various kinds
                    —eagle-wood, rose-wood, liquidambar, &amp;c.—is one of the principal products of
                    the island, and has even been specially transported to Peking for imperial
                    purposes. The cocoa palm flourishes freely even in the north, and is to be found
                    growing in clumps with the J⅛'nws <hi rend="italic">sinensis.</hi> Rice, cotton,
                    sugar, indigo, cinnamon, betel-nuts, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, and tobacco
                    areall cultivatedinvarying quantities. The aboriginal inhabitants collect a kind
                    of tea called tein-cha, or celestial tea, which looks like the leaves of a wild
                    camellia, and has an earthy taste when infused. Lead, silver, copper, and iron
                    occur in the Shih-luh Shan or “stonegreen-hill”; the silver at least was worked
                    till 1850, and the copper would probably pay für its exploitation. Gold and
                    lapis lazuli are found in other parts of the island.</p>
                <p>The ordinary cattle of Hainan are apparently a cross between the little yellow
                    cow of South China and the zebu of India. Buffalos are common, and in the
                    neighbourhood of Nanleu at least they are frequently albinos. Horses are
                    numerous but small. Hogs and deer are both common wild animals, and of the
                    latter there are three species, <pb break="no"

                <p>Hainan, as already indicated, forms a foo or department of the province of
                    Kwang-tung, though strictly it is only a portion of the island that is under
                    Chinese administration, the remainder being still occupied by unsubjugated
                    aborigines. The department contains three <hi rend="italic">chow</hi> and ten
                    Asien districts,—Kiung-chow-hsien, in which the capital is situated;
                    Ting-an-hsien, the only inland district; Wen-ch’ang-hsien,in the north-east of
                    the island; Hui-tung-hsien,Lo-Ιιui-hsien, Ling-shui-hsien, Wan-chow, Ai-chou
                    (the southmost of all), Kan-en hsien, Chang-hua-hsien, Tan-chow, Lin-kao-hsien,
                    and Chang-mui-hsien. The capital Kiung-chow-foo is situated in the north about
                    10 li (or 3 miles) from the coast on the river. It is a well-built compact city,
                    and its temple3 and examination halls are in good preservation. The population
                    is frequently stated at 200,000, but, according to C. C. Stuhlmann in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Globus</hi> for 1876, it is only 100,000. Carved articles in
                    cocoa-nuts and scented woods are its principal industrial product. In 1630 it
                    was made the seat of a Roman Catholic mission by Benoit de Mathos a Portuguese
                    Jesuit, and the old cemetery still contains about 113 Christian graves. The port
                    of Kiung-chow-foo at the mouth of the river, which is nearly dry at low water,
                    is called simply Hoi-how, or in the court dialect Hai-Kow, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> seaport. The two towns are united by a good road, along which a
                    large traffic is maintained partly by coolie porters but more frequently by
                    means of wheel-barrows, which serve the purpose of cabs and carts. The net value
                    of the trade of the port, that is, the foreign and native imports minus the
                    re-exports and the native imports of local origin, rose from 684,772 Hk. taels
                    in 1876 to 1,215,056 in 1878. Out of 182 vessels engaged in the foreign trade in
                    1878 with a tonnage of 87,290 tons, 152 were British, with a tonnage of 70,078
                    tons. The exports comprised leather, hides, skins and tallow, sugar to the value
                    of 204,427 taels, hemp, galangal, lung-ngan pulp, grass cloth, and silk, and
                    sesamum to the value of 41,936 taels.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Hainan may be divided into three classes, the Chinese
                    immigrants, the civilized aborigines or Shu-li, and the wild aborigines or
                    Sheng-li. The Chinese were for the most part originally from Keang-se and the
                    neighbouring provinces, and they speak a peculiar dialect of which a detailed
                    account by Mr Swinhoe is given in <hi rend="italic">The Phoenix, a Monthly
                    Magazine for China, &lt;Lc.,</hi> 1870. The Shu-li as described by Mr Taintor
                    are almost of the same stature as the Chinese, but have a more decided copper
                    colour, higher cheek-bones, and more angular features, while their eyes are not
                    oblique. Their hair is long, straight, and black, and their beards, if they have
                    any, are very scanty. They till the soil and bring rice, fuel, timber,
                    grass-cloth, &amp;c., to the Chinese markets. The Sheng-li or Li proper, called
                    also La, Le, or Lauy, are probably connected with the Laos of Siam, and the
                    Lolos of China. Though not gratuitously aggressive, they are highly intractable,
                    and have given great troubleto the Chineseauthorities. Amongthem-selves they
                    carry on deadly feuds, and revenge is a duty and an inheritance. Though they are
                    mainly dependent on the chase for food, their weapons are still the spear and
                    the bow, the latter being made of wood and strung with bamboo. In marriage no
                    avoidance of similarity of name is required. The bride’s face is tattooed
                    according to a pattern furnished by the. bridegroom. Their funeral mourning
                    consists of abstaining from drink and eating raw beef, and they use a wooden log
                    for a coffin. When sick they sacrifice oxen. In the spring time there is a
                    festival in which the men and women from neighbouring settlements move about in
                    gay clothing hand in hand and singing songs. The whole population of the island
                    is estimated at about 2∣ millions. At its first conquest 23,000 families were
                    introduced from the mainland. In 1300 the Chinese authorities assign 166,257
                    inhabitants; in 1370, 291,000; and in 1617, 250,524; and in 1835, 1,350,000.</p>
                <p>It was in 111 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that Lu-Po-Teh, general of the
                    emperor Wuti, first made the island of Hainan subject to the Chinese, who
                    dividedit into the two prefectures, Tan-urh or Drooping Ear in the south,
                    so-called from the long ears of the native “king,” and Chu-yai or Pearl Shore in
                    the north. During the decadence of the elder branch of the Han dynasty the
                    Chinese supremacy was weakened, but in 43 A.n. the natives were led by the
                    success of Ma-yuan in Tong-king to make a new tender of their allegiance. About
                    this time the whole island took the name of Chu-yai. In 627 A.D. the name of
                    Kiung-chow came into use. On its conquest by the generals of Kublai Khan in 1278
                    the island was incorporated with the western part of the province of Kwang-tung
                    in a new satrapy Hai-peh Hai-nan Tao, t.e., the circuit north of the sea and
                    south of the sea. It was thus that Hai-nan-Tao, or district south of the sea or
                    strait, came into use as the name of the island, which, however, has borne the
                    official title of Kiung-chow-foo, probably derived from the Kiung-shan or Jade
                    Mountains, ever since 1370, the date of its erection into a department of
                    Kwang-tung. For a longtime Hainan was the refuge of the turbulent classes of
                    China and the place of deportation for delinquent officials. It was there, for
                    example, that Su-She or Su-Tung-po was banished in 1097. From the 15th to the
                    19th century pirates made the intercourse with the mainland dangerous, and in
                    the 17th they were considered so formidable that merchants were allowed to
                    convey their goods across only by the narrow channel from Sen-wen. Since 1863
                    the presence of English men-of-war has put an end to this evil. According to the
                    treaty of Tientsin, the capital Kiung-chow and the harbour Hai-Kow were opened
                    to European commerce; but it was not till 1876 that advantage was taken of the
                    permission.</p>
