                    (1815-1872), an American general, was born at Waterville, Oneida county, New
                    York, January 15, 1815. After studying a short time at Union College, he in 1835
                    entered the West Point military academy, whence he was in 1839 promoted to the
                    army as second lieutenant in the corps of engineers, being at the same time
                    appointed assistant professor of engineering at the academy. In the following
                    year he was made an assistant to the board of engineers at Washington, and from
                    1841 to 1844 he was employed in connexion with the fortification of New York
                    harbour. In 1.845 he was sent by the Government to examine the principal
                    military establishments of Europe, and during his absence he was promoted to the
                    rank of first lieutenant. After his return he in the winter of 1845-46 delivered
                    at the Lowell Institute, Boston, a course of twelve lectures on the science of
                    war, published in 1846 under the title <hi rend="italic">Elements of Military
                    Art and Science,</hi> and republished with additions in 1861. On the outbreak of
                    the Mexican war in 1846 he a3 military engineer accompanied the expedition to
                    California and the Pacific coast, where he distinguished himself not only as an
                    engineer but by his administrative skill as secretary of state, and by his
                    presence of mind and bravery in several skirmishes with the enemy. In 1847 his
                    services were recognized by promotion to the rank of captain. He com tinued for
                    several years to act on the staff of General Riley in California, holding at the
                    same time the office of secretary of state of the province; and he took a
                    leading part in framing the State constitution of California, on its being
                    admitted into the Union. In 1852 he was appointed inspector and engineer of
                    lighthouses, and in 1853 he wa3 promoted captain of engineers. He, however, in
                    1854 resigned his commission in order to devote his chief attention to the
                    practice of law, which he had already for some time carried on; and so great was
                    his success in his profession that the firm of which he was senior partner soon
                    obtained one of the largest legal businesses in the State. He was also from 1850
                    director of the New Almaden quicksilver mine, and in 1855 he became president of
                    the Pacific and Atlantic Railroad from San Francisco to San José. On the
                    outbreak of the civil war he was in August 1861 appointed major-general of the
                    United States army, and in the following November was appointed commander of the
                    western department, where he conducted the campaign with great energy and with
                    such uniform success against the Confederates that in 1862 they evacuated
                    Corinth, which they had strongly fortified. In July of the same year he was
                    appointed general-in-chief of the armies of the United States —a position he
                    held till March 1864, when he was succeeded by Grant and was appointed chief of
                    the staff. In April 1865 beheld the command of the military division of the
                    James and in August of the same year of the military division of the Pacific,
                    which he retained till March 1869, when he was transferred to that of the south,
                    a position he held till his death at Louisville, January 9, 1872.</p>
