                    he died in 1790, in his thirty-second year, he had already gained a reputation
                    that caused his early death to be widely and deeply regretted. William Hamilton
                    and a younger brother (afterwards Captain Thomas Hamilton, noticed above) were
                    thus brought up under the sole care of their mother,—a woman, fortunately, of
                    considerable ability and force of character. William received his early
                    education in Scotland, except during two years which he spent in a private
                    school near London, and went in 1807, as a Snell exhibitioner, to Balliol
                    College, Oxford. There he pursued his studies zealously, though for the most
                    part independently,— devoting himself chiefly to Aristotle, but in other
                    directions also laying the foundations of that wide and profound scholarship
                    with which his name is associated. In November 1810 he took the degree of B.A.
                    with first-class honours, after an examination so much above the usual standard
                    in the number and difficulty of the works which it embraced that the memory of
                    it was long preserved at Oxford. He had been intended for the medical
                    profession, but, soon after leaving Oxford, gave up this idea, and in 1813
                    became a member of the Scottish bar. Henceforward Edinburgh was his place of
                    residence, and, except on occasion of two short visits to Germany in 1817 and
                    1821, he never again quitted Scotland. Neither his ambition nor his success was
                    such as to absorb his time in professional pursuits. His life was mainly that of
                    a student; and the following years, marked by little of outward incident, w ere
                    filled by researches of all kinds, through which he daily added to his stores of
                    learning, while at the same time he was gradually forming his philosophic
                    system. The outward and visible traces of these researches remain in his
                    common-place books, especially in one which, having been in constant use, is a
                    valuable record of his studies from this time onwards to the close of his life.
                    He did not withdraw himself from society, but his favourite companions were the
                    books of his own and of every library within his reach. Among these he lived in
                    a sort of seclusion, from which only now and then, when stirred by some event of
                    the world around, did he come forth, in vigorous pamphlets, to denounce, or
                    protest, or remonstrate, as the case might be.</p>
                <p>His own investigations enabled him to make good his claim to represent the
                    ancient family of Hamilton of Preston, and in 1816 he took up the baronetcy,
                    which had lain dormant since the death (in 1701) of Sir Robert Hamilton, well
                    known in his day as a Covenanting leader.</p>
                <p>In 1820 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of moral philosophy in the
                    university of Edinburgh. Soon afterwards he was appointed professor of civil
                    history, and as such delivered several courses of lectures on the history of
                    modern Europe and the history of literature. In 1829 his career of authorship
                    began with the appearance of the well-known essay on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosojohy of the Unconditioned,—</hi> the first of a series of articles
                    contributed by him to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> He was
                    elected in 1836 to the Edinburgh chair of logic and metaphysics, and from this
                    time dates the influence which, during the next twenty years, he exerted over
                    the thought of the younger generation in Scotland. Much about the same time he
                    began the preparation of an annotated edition of Reid’s works, intending to
                    annex to it a number of dissertations. Before, however, this design had been
                    carried out, he was struck with paralysis of the right side, which seriously
                    crippled his bodily powers, though it left his mind wholly unimpaired. The
                    edition of Reid appeared in 1846, but with only seven of the intended
                    dissertations,—the last, too, unfinished. It was Sir William’s distinct purpose
                    to complete the work, but this purpose remained at his death unfulfilled, and
                    all that could be done afterwards was to print such materials for the remainder,
                    or such notes on the subjects to be discussed, as were found among his MSS.
                    Considerably before this time he had formed his theory of logic, the leading
                    principles of which were indicated in the prospectus of “an essay on a new
                    analytic of logical forms” prefixed to his edition of Reid. But the elaboration
                    of the scheme in its details and applications continued during the next few
                    years to occupy much of his leisure. Out of this arose in 1847 a sharp
                    controversy with the late Professor De Morgan of University College, London. The
                    essay did not appear, but the results of the labour gone through are contained
                    in the valuable appendices to his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Logie.</hi>
                    Another occupation of these years was the preparation of extensive materials for
                    a publication which he designed on the personal history, influence, and opinions
                    of Luther. Here he <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0436-0417"/> advanced so far as to have planned and partly
                    carried out the arrangement of the work; but it did not go farther, and still
                    remains in MS. In 1852-53 appeared the first and second editions of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Discussions in Philosophy, Literature, and Education,</hi> a
                    reprint, with large additions, of his contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review.</hi> Soon after, his general health began to fail. Still,
                    however, aided now as ever by his courageous and devoted wife—(he had married in
                    1829)—he persevered in literary labour; and during 1854-55 he brought out nine
                    volumes of a new edition of Stewart’s works. The only remaining volume was to
                    have contained a memoir of Mr Stewart from his pen; but this he did not live to
                    write. He taught his class for the last time in the winter of 1855-56. Shortly
                    after the close of the session he was taken ill, and-on the 6th May 1856 he died
                    at his house in Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Hamilton’s philosophy is presented in writings either more or lese
                    fragmentary in form and occasional in purpose, or else, in whole or in part,
                    prepared for publication by others, not by himself. Hence, not only do some
                    points receive what seems almost a superfluity of attention, while others of
                    equal importance are treated with barely enough of detail, but there is no
                    complete statement of the latest results of his thinking in their mutual
                    relation®. It may be that this imperfection of the outward form has tended to
                    obscure the real harmony of his system, and in part led to its being pronounced
                    —as it has too often been—an assemblage of contradictory doctrines. How far this
                    is from being the case, and how closely the various parts are connected, becomes
                    apparent when it is seen how they are all developed from the central conception
                    of consciousness. In the following sketch that conception will be used as a
                    point from which briefly to view the system as a whole, and to trace the bearing
                    on one another of its leading doctrines.</p>
                <p>Consciousness is regarded by Hamilton under three chief aspects: — (1) as it is
                    in itself; (2) as realized under actual conditions; (3) as a source of
                    truth.</p>
                <p>1. Consciousness in itself is to Hamilton but another name for immediate or
                    intuitive knowledge. For such knowledge is a relation between a subject
                    (knowing) and an object (known), which, as it is viewed from the side of the one
                    or the other term, is properly called consciousness or knowledge: there are two
                    aspects, but the thing itself is one. Immediate knowledge or consciousness
                    involves the existence of both subject and object,—it is the affirmation by the
                    subject implicitly of its own existence, explicitly of that of the object. In
                    this relation as realized in the primary judgment, that which knows is conceived
                    as the ego or self,—that which is known, either as a mole of the ego or self, or
                    as a mode of the non-ego or not-self. Thus we have, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >terms</hi> of the relation, a division of <hi rend="italic">cvisteηοe</hi> into
                    the noumenon self and the contrasted phenomena of mind ani of matter; while the
                    <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> itself yields a division of <hi rend="italic"
                    >knowledge</hi> into philosophy, corresponding to its subjective, and science,
                    corresponding to its objective, phase,—the latter being further subdivided into
                    the sciences of mental and those of material phenomena.<note anchored="true"

                <p>2. Hamilton adopted the division of mental phenomena (not as states but as
                    elements) into the three groups or classes of <hi rend="italic">cognition,
                    feeling,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">conation.</hi> Cognitions he classified
                    according to the different relations between subject and object, calling these
                    relations,— as subjective, powers or faculties,—as objective, forms or stages,
                    of knowledge. Under these, cognition is either immediate or mediate, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> either consciousness itself or the datum of
                    consciousness. The first of the faculties, therefore, is of immediate
                    knowledge,—the acquisitive or presentative power, which yields perception
                    (external and internal). The second is of that form of mediate knowledge which
                    is representative of an individual object. Here Hamilton distinguished three
                    moments or phases, which he termed the retentive, the reproductive, and the
                    representative powers,—distinguished them perhaps too widely, but at the same
                    time indicated their essential unity. The third is of that form of mediate
                    knowledge in which a number of objects receive a factitious unity from being
                    thought under a common relation. This he named the elaborative or discursive
                    faculty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> i. 183-189, ii. 1-17.</p></note> Here, where he had
                    to deal with consciousness in the form of experience, realized under actual
                    conditions and comprehending every variety of mental life, Hamilton showed, in
                    the first place, how the mutual action and reaction of the several elements
                    produces the complexity which the phenomena present. Reminiscence, imagination,
                    and judgment are all, as acts of which we are conscious, and which imply a prior
                    immediate knowledge, contained in self-perception. But, on the other hand, our
                    knowledge or perception even of self could not be what it is, did processes of
                    reminiscence, imagination, and judgment not enter into its composition.
                    Consciousness includes all the particular forms of knowledge; yet its
                    development into a whole is the effect of the agencies which make up its
                    content.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Reid's Works,</hi> 932; <hi rend="italic">Leets.,</hi> I. 205, ii.
                    523.</p></note> In the next place, he showed the laws of mental action in the
                    conditions under which consciousness is exercised. From the variety and the
                    limitation of consciousness, under the relation of time, arises the successive
                    variation of its units,—in other words, the train of thought. By the limitation
                    of consciousness is meant the limited number of objects to which it can at one
                    time be directed, but this issues in a farther limitation, consisting in the
                    disproportion between consciousness and the whole sum of mental modifications.
                    Sir W. Hamilton held that consciousness is the mental modes or ‘ ‘ movements,
                    rising above a certain degree of intensity,” and that “the movements beyond the
                    conscious range are still properties—and effective properties —of the mental
                    ego.” This doctrine he used to explain not only the phenomena of ordinarily
                    latent knowledge and of forgetfulness but also those of the abnormal recovery of
                    apparently lost knowledge and of the formation of habits and dexterities.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Reid s
                    Works,</hi> 910, 932, 938; <hi rend="italic">Lects..</hi> i. 338-371, ii.
                    209-218.</p></note> The units (or rather groups of units) of the train—partly
                    former thoughts again present, partly thoughts for the first time present to the
                    mind—follow one another according to what Hamilton called the law of
                    integration, i.e., “only as they stand together as relativo parts of the same
                    common whole.” Of this supreme law subordinate phases determine more special
                    consecutions of thought. The reappearance of former thoughts (reminiscence
                    voluntary or involuntary) is governed by the laws of (1) redintegration and (2)
                    repetition. “Thoughts tend to suggest one another which are coidentical (1) in
                    time or (2) in mode.” New wholes of thought are framed by successive analyses
                    and syntheses. Under the law of integration these analyses are effected by means
                    of attention and abstraction, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by consciousness
                    being continuously and repeatedly concentrated on certain parts or aspects of
                    objects and withdrawn from others. The syntheses of thought are infinitely
                    diverse in character, yet possess in common an invariable form. This process of
                    forming new wholes, by discrimination and comparison, out of the materials
                    supplied by perception and recollection, is the one kind of mental activity
                    recognized by Hamilton in the various products of thought, from the simplest to
                    the most complex. In other words, he regards judgment as the fundamental act of
                    mind, the proposition, or expressed judgment, as its primary product.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Reid's
                    Works,</hi> 911-913; <hi rend="italic">Leets.,</hi> 1. 225-263, ii. 227-295,
                    iii. 117-140, 275.</p></note></p>
                <p>3. Hamilton’s theory of consciousness in its third aspect, i.e., as a source of
                    principles, is embodied in his doctrines of <hi rend="italic">the
                    conditioned</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">common sense.</hi> The former is so
                    called because it professes to be a demonstration that “the conditionally
                    limited (what we may briefly call the conditioned) is the only possible object
                    of knowledge and of positive thought.” The name of the latter was adopted by
                    Hamilton, not as in itself a good one, but as sanctioned by the usage of
                    philosophers in general and of Scottish philosophers in particular. The doctrine
                    itself is that the primary data of consciousness are, as such, i.β,, as facts,
                    and solely on the authority of consciousness, to be accepted as true. The two
                    doctrines are complements of each other, as severally explications of the
                    principle of the relativity of human knowledge, which, common to both, is
                    manifested in the one through that which we cannot know,—in the other through
                    the inexplicable character of our fundamental cognitions.</p>
                <p>The primary data of consciousness Hamilton held to be of two orders, otherwise
                    diverse, but in this the same, that they are known merely as facts. These
                    are—(1) truths of perception—theconviction of the reality asmodes of self of our
                    own thoughts and feelings, and the allied conviction that in sense-perception we
                    come into contact with a reality external to the mind'; and (2) truths of
                    reason—the fundamental laws of logic, the necessary forms of thought or
                    relations of existence <hi rend="italic">C.e.,</hi> quality, and quantity in its
                    threefold aspect as time, space, degree), the causal judgment, the principle of
                    substance and phenomenon, &amp;c.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Reid's Works,</hi> np. xviii.,
                    743.</p></note></p>
                <p>Now here it was Hamilton’s peculiar contribution to philosophy that he placed,the
                    data of perception along with the data of thought, and affirmed that both
                    classes alike are inexplicable, yet as facts clear; that both rest on the same
                    authority; and that, if the one be accepted as true, so also should be the
                    other. He was a realist, because he held realism to be the dictate of
                    consciousness. Evidently here the ground of the view is of even more importance
                    than the view itself, and so to Hamilton the question of realism <hi
                    rend="italic">versus</hi> idealism was momentous chiefly from its connexion with
                    that of the authority of consciousness. He was fully aware that, since he
                    claimed so high an authority for the primary data of consciousness, it was
                    necessary to supply the means of deciding whether any given cognition is or is
                    not entitled to be placed among such; and to this end he laid down certain
                    criteria of alleged primary facts of consciousness. These criteria are (1)
                    simplicity, (2) universality and (subjective) necessity, (3) comparative
                    evidence and certainty, (4) <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0437-0418"/> incomprehensibility. In other words, no cognition
                    is an original datum of consciousness which is not simple (i.e., incapable of
                    being resolved into another), not held by all men as a self-evident and
                    necessary truth, and not in itself inexplicable. Now the doctrine of the
                    immediate knowledge of the non-ego will, Hamilton affirmed, stand all these
                    tests. It is the simple residuum of truth in the crude and erroneous beliefs of
                    men as to what they perceive through their senses; it is the spontaneous
                    conviction of all (as to this lie cited as witnesses philosophers who regarded
                    the belief as a mistake and a delusion); and it does not admit of being made
                    comprehensible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    can hardly be denied. Practically, indeed, all acknowledge that consciousness
                    does intuitively affirm what he alleges it to affirm; and, the question being
                    one of fact, a practical acknowledgment is quite as good as a theoretical
                    one.</p>
                <p>Here let it be remarked in passing that Hamilton’s doctrine of common sense is
                    wholly misrepresented when held up as an appeal to the belief of the unthinking
                    multitude <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> the judgment of philosophers. Rather it
                    carries the appeal into a sphere where the philosophic and the vulgar have
                    ceased to be distinguished; it shows that not the mind of the philosopher, and
                    not the mind of the vulgar, but the mind of man, is what philosophy has to deal
                    with, and that its office is to resolve current beliefs into their elements, not
                    satisfied till it has reached the final and absolutely pure deliverance of
                    consciousness.</p>
                <p>P&gt;ut it may be said, as it often has been said, that consciousness is not
                    competent to affirm immediate knowledge of the non-ego, because to discriminate
                    the non-ego from the ego is beyond its power. Hamilton’s answer is that, if
                    knowledge be, as he holds, essentially relative, self cannot be known except
                    with and through uot-self, and that natural realism is but a corollary of the
                    general principle of the relativity of knowledge. On that principle he held that
                    “we think one thing only as we think two things mutually and together,” and
                    that, self being inherently a relative notion, we should never interpret by it
                    facts of our experience, if experience did not come before us under a relation
                    that needs both terms (self and not-self) for its expression. Hamilton certaiuly
                    implies, if he does not expressly say, that, had we no knowledge of a not-self,
                    we could never objectify self so as to know it as such at all. To him a
                    knowledge of the ego alone would be absolute, not relative— such a knowledge,
                    that is, as he held to be impossible. But, viewing knowledge as a relation
                    between an existing subject and an existing object, he saw no reason why the
                    object should not <hi rend="italic">be</hi> what it is <hi rend="italic">knoιon
                    as—</hi> sometimes a mode of self, sometimes a mode of not-self,—and why
                    consciousness of the ego should not include also that which stands in relation
                    with it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>But that there has been so amazing an amount of misconception on the point, it
                    might seem hardly needful to say that Hamilton did <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    hold that in perception we know the thing-in-itself. His doctrine of relativity
                    included phenomenalism, though it was more than phenomenalism; and not only his
                    oft-repeated assertions that there can be no such object of knowledge, but the
                    whole tenor of his philosophy, are directly against this inteηu <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> eta-tion. In passages where he speaks of “the thing”
                    as directly known, the word is obviously used, not for nournenon or the thing in
                    itself, but for the real as opposed to the ideal in phenomena. There can be no
                    doubt that he held the object in sense-perception to be a phenomenon of the
                    non-ego; and arguments that proceed upon a different supposition are of no
                    effect against his theory.</p>
                <p>The relativity of perception on that theory is, indeed, not open to doubt.
                    According to him, we perceive phenomena alone,—such alone as we have faculties
                    to apprehend,—such alone as stand in relation to our organs of sense; and we
                    perceive only under the contrast of self and not-self. There is thus in every
                    act of perception a twofold relation—(1) between the thing and the organ,
                    manifested in sensation being a condition of perception, and (2) between self
                    and not-self, manifested in consciousness and perception being different names
                    for the same thing. This of itself should show that he cannot be expected to
                    state definitely what is the object in perception,—as it has often been said
                    that he does not do, or does differently in different places. The object of
                    intuition or perception does not admit of being definitely stated. For
                    individual objects cannot as such be conceived, still less named, till knowledge
                    has risen above the intuitive or perceptive stage. On this, as on all points
                    relating to perception, Hamilton’s mature and carefully expressed view is to be
                    found in his dissertations appended to Reid’s works. There he divides the
                    qualities of body into three classes,—primary, secondary, and secundo-primary.
                    He shows that sensation and perception proper, though up to a certain point
                    inseparable, are not only distinct, but above that point actually in the inverse
                    ratio of one another; that sensations proper (identical with the secondary
                    qualities) are merely subjective affections of the animated organism, and afford
                    no knowledge of external reality; that in perception proper the material
                    organism, which is to be regarded as an external reality, is presented under
                    those relations which constitute its extension, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> we
                    know its primary qualities; and that in sensation and perception together we
                    know the secundo-primary qualities, i.e., objects external to the body become
                    known, as directly τelated, through various modes of resistance, to the organism
                    in motion. The object in perception is, then, according to him, a primary
                    quality of the organism, or the quasi-primary phase of a secundoprimary quality.
                    It is a fundamental point of Hamilton’s doctrine that the organism is
                    differently related to the ego in perception proper and in sensation proper. In
                    his own words—“the organism is the field of apprehension to both, but with this
                    difference, that the former views it as of the ego, the latteι ’ as of the
                    non-ego,—that the one draws it within, the other shuts it out from, the sphere
                    of self.” On this distinction is partly founded his doctrine of the twofold
                    character of space, as at once an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> conception and
                    an <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> perception. He held with Kant that space
                    is a necessary condition of thought, and as such not derived from experience;
                    but he at the same time held that through sense we have a perception of
                    something extended, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of extension. Now the cognition
                    of extension is a cognition of <hi rend="italic">relations,—</hi> properly
                    therefore realized by a simple energy of <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>; but the
                    facts that <hi rend="italic">sensation</hi> is an essential condition of this
                    cognition, and that what is known as extended is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >organism,</hi> which is as much external to the ego as any other part of the
                    material world, seemed to him to justify these relations being regarded not as
                    subjective but as objective.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Hamilton’s doctrine of the conditioned relates to the second group of primary
                    truths or original data of consciousness. Relativity, as a general condition of
                    the thinkable, he asserts, is brought to bear under three principal and
                    necessary relations :—the first (subjective) <hi rend="italic">the contrast of
                    self and not-self,</hi> the second (objective) <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi>
                    and the third (objective) <hi rend="italic">quantity.</hi> Quality is realized
                    under the twofold aspect of substance and phenomenon. Quantity has three phases
                    :—time (protensive), space (extensive), degree (intensive). Now the doctrine of
                    the conditioned is (1) that under these relations—specially those of quality and
                    time—we must think everything; (2) that the unconditioned as such is either the
                    unconditionally limited—the absolute, or the unconditionally unlimited—the
                    infinite; (3) that, under the necessary relations of thought, we are unable
                    positively to conceive either unconditional limitation or unconditional
                    illimitation; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> an absolute whole or part of
                    existence in time or in space or in degree is inconceivable, so is infinite
                    increase or division; absolute quality is inconceivable, quality infinitely
                    undetermined is so equally.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    596-604.</p></note> Thus this doctrine claims to demonstrate the limited range
                    of positive thought, by showing that the mind is tossed from the one to the
                    other of two contradictory extremes, unable to conceive either, yet compelled to
                    believe that one or other is actual. The kind of inconceivability of the two
                    extremes is indeed different, and it may be regretted that, in his expositions
                    of this part of his philosophy, Hamilton did not more explicitly recognize that
                    fact. It seems true that to combine the absolute with existence regarded
                    quantitatively, i.β., in time or in space or in degree, or the infinite with
                    existence regarded qualitatively, is impossible, not only as beyond but as
                    against thought, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as involving a contradiction; and
                    therefore that, in respect of one of the two extremes, the mind is not simply
                    impotent, seeing it rejects it as that to which there can be nothing answering
                    in actual existence. But then it does so only to find itself face to face with
                    an alternative which, while it must be inferred to be actual, can by no effort
                    be realized in thought. So that, even if this objection be allowed, the doctrine
                    still remains intact as a demonstration how limited is the sphere of human
                    thought as compared with that of existence, and how little human powers of
                    conception are to be made the measure of truth.</p>
                <p>Its significance becomes still more apparent in the original and ingenious
                    application made of it by Hamilton to the solution of such philosophic problems
                    as the origin of the principles of cause and effect, substance and phenomenon,
                    &amp;c. That the sum of existence of one set of modes has passed into another
                    mode is, according to him, what we mean by saying that an event had causes.
                    Consciousness is a knowledge of existence only as conditioned in time, and we
                    are impotent—(it matters not <hi rend="italic">how)—</hi> to conceive the forms
                    of existence within our experience as having had an absolute commencement;
                    therefore we conceive them as having existed in other forms, in other words, as
                    caused. Thus it is in order to escape from the necessity of thinking an absolute
                    beginning for existence in time that we view all things as a series of causes
                    and effects. In like manner, it is because we can think neither that which
                    exists in and for itself nor that which exists merely in and through something
                    else that we recognize all objects under the double aspect of substance and
                    phenomenon,—knowing nothing but the latter, yet always supposing the
                    former.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Having showed that the original data of consciousness, however different in other

                    cognitions relative, more properly indeed, beliefs than cognitions,—Hamilton
                    claims for all that, on the sole authority of consciousness, they be accepted as
                    truths. This is the point to which the whole of his philosophy leads up; hence
                    he offers no arguments in its support. He only asks—If the authority of
                    consciousness be disallowed, what other warrant of truth remains? Where else
                    will a source of certainty be found? He saw no alternative between absolute
                    scepticism and implicit reliance on consciousness. But his reliance was no
                    absolute and blind belief. He claimed implicit credence for consciousness only
                    after having investigated and laid down the conditions of its credibility. The
                    inexplicability that is to him a mark of truth must be proved to be that which
                    springs from the fundamental character of the cognition. While the establishment
                    of principles on which belief may be sure, rational, and consistent is the
                    ultimate aim of his philosophy, groundless or inconsistent belief he sweeps away
                    wherever he meets with it. Thus he will not allow the validity of belief in an
                    external reality which, <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi,</hi> is not known.<note

                    the mutual relation (already referred to) of his doctrines of the conditioned
                    and of common sense. The former extends the bounds of existence as much as it
                    narrows those of thought, and so makes room for belief; while the latter shows
                    belief to be the condition on which alone even primary and fundamental truths
                    can be apprehended. Thus, for example, on the ground of both, he held that
                    freedom of will and necessity are alike inconceivable, but that we are not
                    entitled to reject the testimony of consciousness to the fact that as moral
                    agents we are free, on account of the speculative difficulties with which it is

                    doctrines Sir W. Hamilton did not himself apply to theology, and in themselves
                    they have no direct theological bearing, since the one is concerned with the
                    infinite and the absolute merely as notions, and the other with simple forms of
                    thought long prior to those of theology. But his references to this subject
                    indicate clearly what he considered to be the true relation of theology to
                    philosophy, and show that, in the one as in the other, he held wisdom to lie in
                    such a conviction of human ignorance as disposes the mind to accept harmony with
                    the facts of consciousness as evidence of truth.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Of the three classes into which, as we have seen, Hamilton divided mental

                    to the consideration of the phenomena of feeling and the development of a theory
                    of pleasure, founded chiefly on that of Aristotle, which is. in substance that
                    pleasure is the reflex in consciousness of the spontaneous and unimpeded
                    exercise of power or energy,—pain being, on the other hand, the consciousness of
                    overstrained or repressed exertion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The logic λvith which Sir W. Hamilton’s name is associated is a purely formal
                    science. Nothing else indeed did he consider properly to be called logic. For it
                    seemed to him an unscientific mixing together of heterogeneous elements to treat
                    as parts of the same science the formal and the material conditions of
                    knowledge. He was quite ready to allow that on this view logic cannot be used as
                    a means of discovering or guaranteeing facts, even the most general, and
                    expressly asserted that it has to do, not with the objective validity, but only
                    with the mutual relations, of judgments. He further held that induction and
                    deduction are correlative processes of formal logic, each resting on the
                    necessities of thought, and deriving thence its several laws. In establishing
                    the distinction between logical and scientific induction, he showed that
                    deduction no more than induction is self-sufficient, since it also must have a
                    prior process to start from before it can be applied to nature. He also held
                    that no other than formal logic can be distinguished from the body of the
                    sciences. Perhaps he may have too much overlooked the fact that the search for
                    causes (a problem common to all the sciences) and the presumable uniformity of
                    nature (a principle capable of guaranteeing general inferences) yield the
                    conditions of a logic entitled to the name of a science of science, and
                    possessing all the importance of the knowledge whose organon it is. Yet it is
                    well to be reminded by a difference of name that a science such as this,
                    consisting of inferences from the actual order of things, is quite distinct from
                    <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> qη truths developed from the conditions of
                    thought as such.</p>
                <p>lhe only logical laws recognized by Hamilton were the three axioms of identity,
                    non-contradiction, and excluded middle, which he regarded as severally phases of
                    one general condition of the possibility of existence and, therefore, of
                    thought. The law' of reason and consequent he considered not as different, but
                    merely as expressing metaphysically what these express logically. He added as a
                    postulate—which in his theory was of importance—“that logic be allowed to state
                    explicitly what is thought implicitly.”</p>
                <p>ihe changes by which he to a great extent remodelled formal logic were the result
                    (1) of applying to propositions and syllogisme <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    the two aspects of notions as wholes,— <hi rend="italic">extension,</hi>
                    answering to the· objects denoted, and <hi rend="italic">intension,</hi>
                    answering to the attributes connoted, —and (2) of assigning quantity to the
                    predicate as well as to the subject in judgments of extension. These judgments
                    receive the form of an equation. Only simple conversion is allowed, but,! all
                    propositions being shown to be capable of simple conversion, the· class of
                    immediate inferences is greatly increased. Categorical syllogisms (inductive and
                    deductive) may be either unfigured or figured, according as the distinction of
                    subject and predicate and 'the distinctions included in that are or are not
                    recognized. Unfigured syllogism has but one form; figured syllogisms are of
                    three forms, according to the position of the middle term in the premises. Of
                    these the first corresponds to the first and fourth figures of ordinary logic,
                    —the moods of the latter being shown to be merely indirect intensive moods of
                    the first. The laws of categorical syllogism areτe-duced to one. On the other
                    hand, one of the results of the quantification of the predicate being to
                    increase the number of propositional forms, a number of new moods are added, and
                    each figure contains twelve. Hypothetical and disjunctive inferences, whether
                    regarded as mediate or as immediate,—(as to this Hamilton varied in opinion; <hi
                    rend="italic">cf., Leets.,</hi> iv. 369, 371, 373, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    374),—foιm a separate class of syllogisms,—the conditional, properly subdivided
                    into conjunctive and disjunctive; for, according to Hamilton, as all inference
                    is hypothetical, this term ought not to be used as the name of one particular
                    group. The quantities allowed by him in logic were but two—the definite,
                    including the universal and singular, and the indefinite. The latter also he
                    considered to be twofold,—partiality as such, from which the universal, both
                    affirmative and negative; is excluded, and partiality which excludes only one
                    universal extreme, while possibly admitting the other. All these improvements
                    were embodied in a notation that clearly and compendiously presents to the eye
                    the whole logical scheme.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Even from this imperfect outline of Hamilton’s system of psychology, metaphysics,
                    and logic it appears how extensive and original were his labours in the various
                    departments of philosophy, how powerful an impetus he gave to speculation, and
                    how much he himself contributed to· the elucidation of the ultimate problems of
                    thought. By his thorough-going analysis of consciousness and of the relation of
                    consciousness to mind he did much to promote the scientific study of psychology
                    in his own country and in America, —in particular to give it at once a sound
                    method and a well-defined sphere. He did not himself trace the growth of
                    consciousness; but, by showing that it is both simple and complex, both
                    involving and evolved, he implied that it had grown, and suggested the problem
                    of the conditions of its development. On the other hand, to him there was a wide
                    gulf between mental and material phenomena, and the acceptance of innate ideas
                    was attended with no difficulty; thus his point of view is so far removed from
                    that of most of the psychologists of the present day that probably his influence
                    now is much less either than it was in his own lifetime or than it may be
                    hereafter.</p>
                <p>In metaphysics his place is plainly marked. Taking his stand at once on the
                    exclusive authority and on the limited sphere of human consciousness, he comes
                    into direct , antagonism with all schools of philosophy that find in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Unconditioned</hi> a field for speculation. At the same time he is
                    divided from scepticism by his assertion that, as the realm of existence
                    transcends that of thought, so belief is wider than knowledge, and from
                    empiricism by his admission of <hi rend="italic">a j)riori</hi> and inexplicable
                    cognitions. He ranked himself among the Scottish school of philosophers; yet
                    there he stands by himself, since even those doctrines which he held in common
                    with his predecessors he held after a fashion widely different as to both
                    grounds and results. The doctrine of common sense, in particular, he set in a
                    new light, rescued from misapprehension, and showed, on the testimony of every
                    school of thought, to be one of the most widely recognized of philosophic
                    tenets. In Reid he found a philosopher to whom by many ties of intellectual
                    affinity he was bound, and who seemed to him to have so unskilfully used the
                    right clue to a solution of the problems <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n439/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0439-0420"/> with which he dealt as to justify the doubt
                    whether he really had it. Hence he made Reid’s writings, as it were, his own,
                    corrected his errors, and gave a solid basis to the theory which he had himself
                    failed even to make plain.</p>
                <p>The philosopher to whom above all others he professed allegiance was Aristotle.
                    His works were the obje.ct of his profound and constant study, and supplied in
                    fact the mould in which his whole philosophy was cast. With the commentators on
                    the Aristotelian writings, ancient, mediaeval, and modern, he was also familiar;
                    and the scholastic philosophy he studied with care and appreciation at a time
                    when it had hardly yet begun to attract attention in his country. His wide
                    reading enabled him to trace many a doctrine to the writings of forgotten
                    thinkers; and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to draw forth such from
                    their obscurity, and to give due acknowledgment, even if it chanced to be of the
                    prior possession of a view or argument that he had thought out for himself. Of
                    modern German philosophy he was a diligent, if not always a sympathetic,
                    student. How profoundly his thinking was modified by that of Kant is evident
                    from the tenor of his speculations; nor was this less the case because, on
                    fundamental points, he came to widely different conclusions. There is a closer
                    likeness as to results between his system and that of Jacobi,—from which,
                    however, his is distinguished by its more scientific character, especially by
                    intuition being more clearly identified with the voice of reason, and more
                    rigidly required to prove its authority as such.</p>
                <p>His labours in logic coincided in time with a general movement by which formal
                    logic was effectually advanced and improved. But as to the originality of his
                    contributions, especially in regard to the quantification of the predicate,
                    there iβ no room for doubt. No evidence has ever been adduced that in the
                    smallest degree weakens the force of the abundant evidence brought forward in
                    its support.</p>
                <p>Any account of Hamilton would be incomplete which regarded him only as a
                    philosopher, for his knowledge and his interests embraced all subjects related
                    to that of the human mind. Physical and mathematical science had, indeed, no
                    attraction for him; but his study of anatomy and physiology was minute and
                    experimental. In literature alike ancient and modern he was widely and deeply
                    read; and, from his unusual powers of memory, the stores which he had acquired
                    were always at command, every topic suggesting to him apt quotations or
                    pertinent examples. If there wa3 one period with the literature of which he was
                    more particularly familiar, it was the 16th and 17th centuries. Here in every
                    department he was at home. He had gathered a vast amount of its theological
                    lore, had a critical knowledge especially of its Latin poetry, and was minutely
                    acquainted with the history of the actors in its varied scenes, not only as
                    narrated in professed records, but as revealed in the letters, table-talk, and
                    casual effusions of themselves cr their contemporaries. His article on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistol</hi><hi rend="italic">ce Obscurorum Virorum,</hi> and his
                    pamphlet on the Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843, may be cited in
                    confirmation and illustration of what has now been said. Among his literary
                    projects were editions of the works of George Buchanan and Julius Caesar
                    Scaliger. His general scholarship found expression in his library, which, though
                    mainly, was far from being exclusively, a philosophical collection. It now forms
                    a distinct portion of the library of the university of Glasgow.</p>
                <p>His chief practical interest was in education,—an interest which he manifested
                    alike as a teacher and as a writer, and which had led him long before he was
                    either to a study of the subject both theoretical and historical. He thence
                    adopted views as to the ends and methods of education that, when afterwards
                    carried out or advocated by him, met with general recognition; but he also
                    expressed in one of his articles an unfavourable view of the study of
                    mathematics as a mental gymnastic which excited much opposition, but which he
                    never saw reason to alter. As himself a teacher, he was zealous and successful.
                    He did not indeed deem it necessary to give to his lectures the elaboration and
                    precision that he bestowed on his published writings. But he made them
                    sufficient for the end which they had to accomplish, he supplemented them at
                    times by other instruction, and he strove, not only by all academic means, but
                    also by his personal influence, to develop the speculative energy and interest
                    of his pupils. His writings on university organization and reform had, at the
                    time of their appearance, a decisive practical effect, and contain much that is
                    of permanent value.</p>
                <p>Many of his moral as well as intellectual characteristics are expressed in his
                    writings,—the intensity and force of his nature, his tendency to be carried away
                    by polemical ardour, his freedom from anything like pettiness, his perfect
                    sincerity and candour. Such a reflex is at best very imperfect, but here could
                    hardly be bettered by description, which, therefore, is not attempted.</p>
