                    Shaftesbury, was born about 1630.</p>

                <p>He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father, and, having taken an
                    active part in the Restoration, he was in 1Go7 created Baron Savile and Viscount
                    Halifax. Subsequently his political conduct gave deep offence to the king, but
                    although, on his being mentioned in 1672 for a seat in the privy council,
                    Charles at first “kicked at the name,” the necessities of the political
                    situation induced him to yield to the solicitations of his advisers, whose
                    arguments for the admission of Halifax were based upon “his family, his
                    abilities, his state and credit, as well as talent to ridicule and unravel
                    whatever he was spited at.” Already he was known as one of the most brilliant
                    orators in the House of Lords, and although hi3 political opinions seemed to be
                    shifting and uncertain, the fascination of his manner aided his formidable
                    talents in gradually securing him the permanent favour, of the king. In June
                    1672 he was sent to negotiate terms of peace with France, but he was kept in
                    ignorance of the agreement between Charles and Louis in regard to the
                    establishment of popery in England. He strenuously opposed the Test Bill
                    introduced by Lord Danby in 1675, but continued to sit at the council board till
                    the following year when, having provoked Lord Danby by a witticism in reference
                    to his mild manner of refusing a bribe, the latter procured his dismissal. In
                    1679 he was, however, created an earl, and having become a member of the new
                    council after the fall of Danby, he differed from the earl of Shaftesbury and
                    his other colleagues in reference to the Exclusion Bill, and by an extraordinary
                    manifestation of nearly all the resources of oratory was instrumental in causing
                    its rejection by the Lords. On this account an address was presented by the
                    Commons praying his “dismissal from the king’s person and councils for ever but
                    the king, whose confidence he had now completely won, retained him in the
                    council, and in 1682 he was created a marquis and became lord privy seal.
                    Although, however, chiefly instrumental in securing the duke of York’s
                    succession, his proposed limitations of James’s authority when the crown should
                    devolve upon him, as well as his subsequent leaning to Whig principles, awakened
                    the duke’s settled hostility, and this was further deepened by his exposure of
                    the malversation of the earl of Rochester. After the accession of James he was
                    accordingly removed from the office of privy seal to that of president of the
                    council, a less important position; and when in 1685 he refused to give his vote
                    for the repeal either of the Test Act or of the Habeas Corpus Act, he was
                    dismissed from the cabinet. But though made privy to the negotiations entered
                    into with the prince of Orange, Halifax, notwithstanding his political
                    humiliation, was opposed to armed intervention, and endeavoured to obtain such
                    concessions from the king as would render this unnecessary. Even after the
                    landing of the prince he consented to act as one of the three commissioners
                    appointed to treat with him, and it was only the cowardly and traitorous flight
                    of James that induced him finally to abandon his cause and to take measures for
                    raising William to the throne. In the Convention Parliament he was chosen
                    speaker of the Lords, and strongly opposed the motion for a regency. On the
                    accession of William he was made lord privy seal, but the disasters of the Irish
                    campaign gave such a plausible colour to the arguments of his opponents against
                    his competency, and to their insinuations regarding his political honesty, that,
                    though still retaining the office of privy seal, he in October 1689 ceased to
                    take part in the councils of the king. . He succeeded before the committee of
                    the House of Lords in clearing himself from all guilt in connexion with the
                    murder of Russell and Sidney, but shortly afterwards resigned his office.
                    Irritated doubtless by the bitter animosity of the Whigs and by the coldness of
                    William, he now at first joined himself to the opposition, and even went so far
                    as to hold communications with St Germains; but either because his anger had
                    cooled, or because he had become convinced of the hopelessness of the fortunes
                    of the Stuarts, he gradually veered back to the support of the Government. He
                    died somewhat suddenly, 20th April 1695. He was succeeded by his son William,
                    with whose death in 1699 the title became extinct in his family. A daughter by
                    his second marriage was the mother of the fourth and celebrated earl of
                    Chesterfield; and from his natural son, Henry Carey the dramatist, was descended
                    the celebrated Edmund Kean.</p>
                <p>Halifax is portrayed in Dryden’s <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</hi>
                    as—</p>
                <p>“Jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought, Endued by nature and by learning
                    taught To move assemblies.”</p>
                <p>Of his speeches not the smallest fragment remains, but it is admitted that his
                    highest efforts far excelled in effect even those of Shaftesbury, who was his
                    only rival. “Old men,” says Macaulay, “who lived to admire the eloquence of
                    Pulteney in its meridian and that of Pitt in its splendid dawn, still murmured
                    that they had heard nothing like the great speeches of Lord Halifax on the
                    Exclusion Bill.” The key to the greater part of his political conduct is to be
                    found in the pamphlet <hi rend="italic">On the Character of a Trimmer,</hi> of
                    which he was undoubtedly the author. He was a trimmer, but a trimmer in the best
                    sense of the term; for though not insensible to worldly advantages, and,
                    notwithstanding his philosophical professions, a lover of pomp and external
                    honours, he was remarkably uncontaminated by the political corruption then
                    almost universally prevalent, and was so emancipated both from party prejudice
                    and selfish ambition as to be able generally to guide his political course by a
                    regard to the best interests of the nation. His sudden changes from one side in
                    politics to another, so far from indicating a loose political morality, were in
                    reality due to the very opposite reason; for in times so unsettled violent and
                    dangerous oscillations were apt to result from a tendency to extremes in both
                    parties. But though his peculiar mental constitution enabled him to play a more
                    important and beneficent part in the politics of his time than any of his
                    contemporaries, it unfitted him for achieving success as a minister of the
                    crown, and rendered his political career a seeming failure. His bent was
                    philosophical rather than practical, and, notwithstanding his great prudence and
                    judgment in several important emergencies, he was apt to be timid and indecisive
                    when the chief burden of responsibility rested upon himself. His writings are
                    neither large nor numerous; but their pure, polished, and nervous English, acute
                    reasoning, mature if somewhat worldly wisdom, apt and varied illustration, and
                    clever and genial wit, fairly entitle them to a place among English classics.
                    Privately he was, according to Burnet, “a man of a great and ready wit, full of
                    life and very pleasant, much given to satire.” He had the reputation of holding
                    atheistical opinions, but on his deathbed “professed himself a sincere
                    Christian.”</p>
