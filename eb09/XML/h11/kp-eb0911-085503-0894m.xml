                    >{Hippopotamidce)</hi> of artiodactyle ungulate mammals comprising two genera,
                    each containing a single living species. Of these the best known is the
                    hippopotamus <hi rend="italic">(Hippopotamus αmphibius),</hi> occurring only in
                    Africa, where it abounds in many of the river courses. It is a huge unwieldy
                    creature, measuring in the largest specimens fully 14 feet from the extremity of
                    the upper lip to the tip of the tail, while it ordinarily attains a length of 12
                    feet, with a height of 5 feet at the shoulders, and a girth round the thickest
                    part of the body almost equal to its length. Its remarkably small ears are
                    exceedingly flexible, and are kept in constant motion when the animal is seeking
                    to catch a distant sound. Its eyes are placed high up on the head, and but
                    little below the level of the ears; its gape is wide, and its upper lip thick
                    and bulging so as to cover over even the largest of its teeth when the mouth is
                    dosed. It is provided with a considerable number of molar teeth adapted for
                    grinding vegetable substances, and a formidable array of long spear-like
                    incisors and curved chisel-edged canines or tusks which, according to Baker,
                    root up the rank grass like an agricultural implement, . Its legs are short, so
                    that the body is but little elevated above the ground; and its feet, which are
                    small in proportion to the size of the animal, terminate in four short toes each
                    bearing a small hoof. With the exception of a few tufts of hair on the lips, on
                    the sides of the head and neck, and at the extremity of the short robust tail,
                    the skin of the hippopotamus, some portions of which are 2 inches in thickness,
                    is entirely destitute of covering. It is usually of a dark fleshy red colour,
                    irregularly marked with blackish spots. The hippopotamus is a gregarious animal,
                    living in herds of from 20 to 40 individuals on the banks and in the beds of
                    rivers, in the neighbourhood of which it most readily finds its appropriate
                    food. This consists chiefly of grass and of aquatic plants, of which it consumes
                    enormous quantities, the stomach of one of those creatures being capable of
                    containing from 5 to 6 bushels. They feed principally by night, remaining in the
                    water during the day, although in districts where they are little disturbed by
                    man they are less exclusively aquatic. In such remote quarters they put their
                    heads boldly out of the water to blow, but when rendered suspicious by man’s
                    persecution, they become exceedingly cautious in this respect, only exposing
                    their nostrils above the water, and even this they prefer doing amid the shelter
                    of water plants. In spite of their enormous size and uncouth form, they are
                    expert swimmers and divers, and can, it is said, remain easily under the water
                    from five to eight minutes. They are also said to walk with considerable
                    rapidity on the bottoms of rivers, beneath at least a foot of water. At
                    nightfall they come on land to feed; and when, as often happens on the banks of
                    the Nile, they reach cultivated ground, they do immense damage to growing crops,
                    destroying by their ponderous tread even more than they devour. To scare away
                    those unwelcome visitors the natives in such districts are in the habit of
                    kindling great fires at night. Although they do not willingly go far from the
                    water on which their very existence depends, occasionally they have been found
                    to travel long distances by night in search of food, and in spite of their
                    clumsy appearance they are able, according to Baker, to climb up steep banks and
                    precipitous ravines with astonishing power and ease. Of a wounded hippopotamus
                    which that traveller once saw leaving the water and galloping inland, he says,
                    “I never could have imagined that so unwieldy an animal could have exhibited
                    such speed. No man could have had a chance of escape.” The hippopotamus does not
                    confine itself to rivers only, but when opportunity occurs of exercising choice
                    it has been known to prefer the waters of the ocean as its home during the day.
                    Of a mild and inoffensive disposition, it seeks to avoid collision with man;
                    when wounded, however, or in defence of its young, it is wont to exhibit the
                    greatest ferocity, and the native canoes are frequently capsized and
                    occasionally demolished by its infuriated attacks, its usual bellowing grunt
                    then becoming loud enough to be heard a mile away. As among elephants, so also
                    among hippopotami there are “rogues”—old bulls which, having been expelled from
                    the herd, have become soured in solitude; these are at all times dangerous.
                    Assuming the offensive on every occasion, they attack all and sundry without
                    shadow of provocation; the natives, therefore, are careful to avoid the haunts
                    of those <hi rend="italic">solitaires,</hi> which are usually well known.</p>
                <p>The rifle of the European has proved the most potent destroyer of the
                    hippopotamus; but to prove effective it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n895/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0895-0856"/> must be aimed at the head, the most vulnerable
                    points in that region being immediately behind the ear and in the eye.
                    Everywhere regarded as a valuable prize, the natives employ a variety of methods
                    in order to secure it, the most common of these being the use of an iron harpoon
                    attached to a line. Allowing themselves to float down stream on a raft, the
                    hippopotamus hunters no sooner reach the sleeping herd than the expertest of
                    them plunges his harpoon deep into the body of the selected victim. The light
                    canoes are then launched from the raft, and with all speed the hunters make for
                    the shore, bearing with them the line attached to the harpoon, which they
                    further secure by giving it a turn round the trunk of a tree. Unable to free
                    itself, the hippopotamus wastes its strength in impotent rage, its⅜persecutors
                    meanwhile assailing it with a shower of javelins under which its life blood
                    gradually ebbs away, until at last it is hauled up dead or dying on the shore.
                    Another native method of destroying those animals is by means of a trap known as
                    the “downfall,” consisting of a heavy wooden beam armed at one end with a
                    poisoned spear-head and suspended by the other to a forked pole or overhanging
                    branch of a tree. The cord by which the beam is suspended descends to the path
                    beneath, across which it lies in such a manner as to be set free the instant it
                    is touched by the foot of the passing hippopotamus; the beam thus liberated
                    immediately descends, and the poisoned weapon passes into the head or back of
                    the luckless beast, whose death in the adjacent stream takes place soon after.
                    Such “downfalls” are placed over the paths by which the animals are in the habit
                    of reaching their nightly feeding grounds. They are also occasionally taken by
                    means of ordinary pitfalls, so dexterously concealed as often to entrap the
                    unwary traveller. Although inferior in sagacity to the elephant, the
                    hippopotamus is very far from being stupid, as is frequently proved by its
                    remarkable adroitness in the discovery and avoidance of traps and pitfalls, as
                    well as in its timely migration from localities which, owing to the prevalence
                    of the rifle, have become no longer tenable. It is said to be possessed of a
                    remarkably tenacious memory, so that, according to Sir Andrew Smith, when once
                    it has been assaulted in its watery dwelling and injured through incautiously
                    exposing itself, it will rarely be guilty of the same indiscretion a second
                    time, even although a very long period should elapse before its haunts are
                    revisited. The female is less in size than the male, and is exceedingly shy,
                    taking to the water with her young, which she usually carries astride on her
                    neck, on the slightest alarm. It is only after long practice that the young
                    become able to remain as long under the water as their parents, and for this
                    reason the females while tending them come much oftener to the surface than
                    their own necessities require. The period of gestation, as observed in females
                    confined in the Zoological Gardens of London and Paris, extends to nearly eight
                    months; the young reach maturity in five years; and the full term of life in the
                    species is believed to extend to thirty years. The male hippopotamus which
                    recently (1878) died in the Zoological Gardens, London, was captured in August
                    1849 when only a few days old; it had thus nearly attained the age of
                    twenty-nine, while an examination of its dead body disclosed, says Professor
                    Owen, “no special morbid appearance to suggest that death from old age had been
                    anticipated” <hi rend="italic">(Annals and Magazine of Nat. Hist.,</hi>
                    September 1879). The flesh of the hippopotamus is generally considered a
                    delicacy both by natives and colonists, although according to Livingstone there
                    are certain tribes on the Zambesi who have as great an abhorrence of
                    hippopotamus meat as Mahometans have of swine’s flesh. The fatty matter lying
                    between the skin and the muscles is one of the purest of animal fats, and was
                    formerly in great request among the Cape colonists when as yet those amphibians
                    abounded in the rivers of that colony. The skin of the hippopotamus is turned to
                    profitable account in the manufacture of elastic whips, which are in great
                    demand throughout the African continent. The skin, according to Schweinfurth,
                    when fresh is cut into long quadrilateral stripes, which when half-dried are
                    trimmed with a knife and afterwards hammered out, like iron on an anvil, into
                    round whips. As several hundreds can be made from a single hide, that part is of
                    considerable commercial value. Still more valuable are the tusks and incisor
                    teeth, which, from their extreme hardness and the fact that they do not readily
                    become yellow, were once largely used in the manufacture of artificial teeth.
                    The hippopotamus formerly abounded in such rivers as the Nile, the Niger, the
                    Senegal, and most of the rivers of South Africa. It is now, however, becoming
                    gradually more restricted in its distribution, having disappeared altogether
                    from the Egyptian Nile,—although still abundant in its Abyssinian
                    tributaries,—as well as from the rivers of Cape colony.</p>
                <p>The Liberian hippopotamus <hi rend="italic">(Chοεrοpsis liberieηsis'),</hi> the
                    only other existing member of the family, is exceedingly rare, having been only
                    known until recently from the two skulls on which the genus and species were
                    founded. It differs from the common species in possessing only one pair of
                    incisors in each jaw instead of two, and in several other minor points. A few
                    years ago a young specimen of this rare species was brought alive to England
                    from the Searcies river, north of Sierra Leone, but it died soon after landing.
                    The species is found on the west coast of Africa and on certain of the rivers
                    flowing into Lake Chad. «</p>
                <p>Although there are thus only two living species, both of which are confined to
                    Africa, the hippopotamus family was both larger and more widely distributed in
                    former periods of the earth’s history, fossil remains of at least nine species
                    having been found in the Tertiary deposits of Europe and India. In Europe they
                    occur as far north as Belgium and the south of England, but they are found
                    nowhere in such abundance as in the island of Sicily, from which they were
                    formerly exported in shiploads to England and France, where they were used in
                    the manufacture of lamp-black and manure. The occurrence of those animals in a
                    place which they could not possibly have reached had it always been an island,
                    is regarded as one of the many proofs that dry land existed during some portion
                    at least of the Tertiary period between Italy and Africa. <hi rend="smallcaps"
