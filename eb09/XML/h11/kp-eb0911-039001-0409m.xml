                    is well known as the introducer of the modern processes of bleaching on a large
                    scale. Having attended Blanchard’s academy at Nottingham, where Kirke White was
                    educated, Marshall Hall commenced in 1809 his studies for the medical profession
                    at Edinburgh university. In 1811 he was elected senior president of the Royal
                    Medical Society; the following year he took the M.D. degree, and was immediately
                    appointed resident house physician to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. This
                    appointment he resigned after two years, when he visited Paris and its medical
                    schools, and, on a walking tour, those also of Berlin, Göttingen, &amp;c, In
                    1817, taking up his abode at Nottingham, he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diagnosis,</hi> in which he insisted that, before treatment, the exact nature
                    of a malady should be ascertained. He rapidly acquired an extensive country
                    practice, his improved method in puerperal cases and his disuse of the
                    venesection then popular attracting many patients. In 1818 he wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mimoses,</hi> a work on the affections denominated bilious,
                    nervous, &amp;c. The next year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh, and in 1825 he became physician to the Nottingham general hospital.
                    In 1826 he removed to London, and in the following year he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> on the more important diseases of females. He
                    pursued his studies of the effects of bloodletting, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Researches</hi> (issuedin 1830) were acknowledged by the medical profession to
                    be of vast practical value. Much practical good also resulted from his warning
                    against mistaking exhaustion for inflammation. Hall married in 1829, and the
                    same year he made the discovery which placed him in rank with Harvey. It is
                    described in <hi rend="italic">A Critical and Experimental Essay on the
                    Circulation of the Blood in the Capillary Vessels,</hi> in which he showed that
                    the blood-channels intermediate between arteries and veins serve the office of
                    bringing the fluid blood into contact with the material tissues of the system.
                    About this time he made his original investigations on quantity of respiration,
                    detailed in <hi rend="italic">The Inverse Ratio which subsists between the
                    Respiration and Irritability in the Animal Kingdom,</hi> a work which led to the
                    treatises on hibernation. In 1831 he proposed a simple and bloodless operation
                    for the removal of vascular naevus. His most important discovery in physiology
                    was the “diastaltic spinal system,” his views being embodied in a paper on <hi
                    rend="italic">Therefiex Function of the Medulla Oblongata and the Medulla
                    Spinalis,</hi> 1832, in which year he was elected fellow of the Royal Society,
                    London. This paper was supplemented in 1837 by another <hi rend="italic">On the
                    True Spinal Marrow, and the Excito-motor System of Herves,</hi> in which he
                    explained the real classification and distribution of the entire nervous system.
                    The “reflex function” excited great attention in Germany and Holland, and M.
                    Flourens described it as “a great epoch in physiology.” Hall thus became the
                    authority on the multiform deranged states of health referable to an abnormal
                    condition of the nervous system, and he made plain the obscure class of
                    convulsive affections. The action of strychnia as a spinal tonic or excitant,
                    the relief of the epileptic, tracheotomy in laryngismal epilepsy, and the “ready
                    method” in asphyxia, were among the later objects of his investigation. His
                    “ready method ”—sometimes called Marshall Hall’s method—for resuscitation in
                    drowning and other forms of suspended respiration—is perhaps the most popular of
                    his discoveries; by it innumerable lives have been preserved. Dr Hall lectured
                    at various medical schools, at the college of physicians, and also at New York
                    during his American tour. His papers in medical and scientific journals,
                    including the <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> are remarkable for lucidity
                    and brevity. He died at Brighton of a throat affection, aggravated by lecturing,
                    August 11, 1857. A list of his works, most of which have been translated into
                    foreign languages, and details of his “ready method,” &lt;fcc., are given in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> by his widow, London, 1861.</p>
