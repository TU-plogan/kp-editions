                    (1793-1835), was born in Duke Street, Liverpool, September 25, 1793. Her father,
                    George Browne, of Irish extraction, was at the time of her birth a merchant in
                    Liverpool, and her mother, whose maiden name was Wagner, was the daughter of the
                    Austrian and Tuscan consul at Liverpool, and of united German and Italian
                    descent. Felicia, the fifth of seven children, was scarcely seven years old when
                    her father failed in business, and retired with his family to Gwrych, near
                    Abergele; and there the young poetess and her brothers and sisters grew up in
                    the wildest seclusion, in a romantic old house by the sea-shore, and in the very
                    midst of the mountains and myths of Wales, the monotony of her young life being
                    varied only by two visits to London, which she never revisited in after years.
                    The little Felicia was a lovely, precocious child. Her education was desultory;
                    and she may indeed be said to have educated herself, the only subjects in which
                    she ever received regular instruction having been French, English grammar, and
                    the rudiments of Latin. Books of chronicle and romance, and every kind of
                    poetry, she read with avidity; and she studied Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and
                    German sufficiently to be able to read them with ease and enjoyment. She was
                    also fond of music, and played on the harp and piano, her preference being for
                    simple national and pathetic melodies, especially those of Wales and Spain. In
                    1808, when she was only fourteen, a quarto volume of her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Juvenile Poems</hi> was published by subscription. Among the earliest of these
                    were “Congratulatory Lines on her Mother’s Birthday,” “A Prayer,” an “Address to
                    the Deity,” and some “Lines to Shakespeare,”—stiff, little, childish
                    productions, which show, however, a good ear for rhythm and a considerable
                    imitative faculty. The verses having been rather harshly <pb break="no"

                    Review,</hi> the little poetess was for some days in tears; but the muse was
                    soon reawakened. One of her brothers was fighting in Spain under Sir John Moore;
                    and Felicia, fired with military enthusiasm, wrote <hi rend="italic">England and
                    Spain, or Valour and Patriotism,</hi> a poem of some length and much
                    elaboration, which was afterwards published and translated into Spanish. Her
                    second volume, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Domestic Affections and other
                    Poems,</hi> appeared in 1812, on the eve of her marriage to Captain Hernans,
                    which took place in the summer of that year. She lived for some time at
                    Daventry, where her husband was appointed adjutant of the Northamptonshire
                    militia; but about this time her father went on some commercial enterprise to
                    Quebec and died there; and, after the birth of her eldest son, she and her
                    husband took up their abode with her widowed mother at Bronwylfa. Here during
                    the next six years four more children—all boys—were born; but in spite of
                    domestic cares and uncertain health she still read and wrote indefatigably. Her
                    poem entitled <hi rend="italic">The Restoration of Works of Art to Italy</hi>
                    was published in 1816, her <hi rend="italic">Modern Greece</hi> in 1817, and in
                    the following year appeared her volume of <hi rend="italic">Translations from
                    Camoens and other Poets.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1818 Captain Hernans went to Rome, leaving his wife, shortly before the birth
                    of their fifth child, with her mother at Bronwylfa. No further explanation than
                    that it was in the first instance for Captain Hemans’s health has ever been
                    offered of this step; there seems to have been then merely a tacit agreement,
                    perhaps on account of their limited means, that they should live for a time
                    apart. Letters were interchanged, and Captain Hernans was often consulted about
                    his children; but the husband and wife remained separate, and indeed never met
                    again. Kind and influential friends —among them the bishop of St Asaph and
                    Bishop Heber—clustered round the poetess and her children, Her health, however,
                    began to fail her, and her beauty, which was of a peculiarly delicate type, is
                    said to have faded rapidly, leaving behind it an habitually worn and harassed
                    expression. She became subject, too, to paroxysms of beating of the heart. Yet
                    for the next six years her literary industry never flagged. In 1819 she
                    published <hi rend="italic">Tales and Historic Scenes in Verse,</hi> and in the
                    same year she gained a prize of <hi rend="italic">£50</hi> offered for the best
                    poem on <hi rend="italic">The Meeting of Wallace and Bruce on the Banks of the
                    Carron.</hi> The poem was published in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's
                    Magazine.</hi> In 1820 appeared <hi rend="italic">The Sceptic</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Stanzas to the Memory of the late King.</hi> In June 1821 she won
                    the prize awarded by the Royal Society of Literature for the best poem on the
                    subject of <hi rend="italic">Dartmoor,</hi> and during the same year she began
                    her play, <hi rend="italic">The Vespers of Palermo.</hi> She now applied herself
                    to a course of German reading. Körner was her favourite German poet, and her
                    lines on the grave of Körner were one of the first English tributes to the
                    genius of the young soldier-poet. <hi rend="italic">The Voice of Spring,</hi>
                    one of her best known lyrics, was written in 1823, the same year in which she
                    began to contribute to the <hi rend="italic">Hew Monthly Magazine;</hi> and in
                    the summer of 1823 a volume of her poems was published by Murray, containing
                    “The Siege of Valencia,” “The Last Constantine,” and “Belshazzar’s Feast,” which
                    last had appeared previously in a collection edited for a charitable purpose by
                    Joanna Baillie. <hi rend="italic">The Vespers of Palermo</hi> was acted at
                    Covent Garden, December 12, 1823, and Mrs Hernans received £200 for the
                    copyright; but, though the leading parts were taken by Young and Charles Kemble,
                    the play was a failure, and was withdrawn after the first performance. It was
                    acted again in Edinburgh in the following April with greater success, when an
                    epilogue, written for it by Sir Walter Scott at Joanna Baillie’s request, was
                    spoken by Mrs Henry Siddons. An interchange of notes on this subject was the
                    beginning of a cordial friendship between Mrs Hernans and the novelist. In the
                    same year she wrote <hi rend="italic">De Chatillon, or the Crusaders;</hi> but
                    the manuscript was mysteriously lost, and the poem was not published till two
                    years after her death, and then from a rough copy. In 1824 she began “The Forest
                    Sanctuary,” which appeared a year later with the “Lays of Many Lands” and
                    miscellaneous pieces collected from the <hi rend="italic">Hew Monthly
                    Magazine</hi> and other periodicals.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1825 Mrs Hernans, with her mother and children and an unmarried
                    sister, removed from Bronwylfa, which had been purchased by her brother, to
                    Rhyllon, another house belonging to him on an opposite height across the liver
                    Clwyd. The contrast between the two houses suggested her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dramatic Scene between Bronwylfa and Rhyllon.</hi> The house itself was bare
                    and unpicturesque, but the beauty of its surroundings has been celebrated in
                    “The Hour of Romance,” “To the River Clwyd in North Wales,” “Our Lady’s Well,”
                    and “To a Distant Scene.” This time seems to have been the most tranquil in Mrs
                    Hemans’s life. Her children were growing up about her; her own variable health
                    was at its best; her popularity was spreading, not only in England but in
                    America, where Professor Norton of Harvard university undertook to superintend
                    the publication of a complete edition of her works and to secure to her the
                    profits. But the death of her mother in January 1827 was a second great
                    breaking-point in her life. Her own health began to alarm her; and though the
                    nature of her illness, which afterwards proved heart complaint, was not at first
                    apparent, she was from this time an acknowledged invalid. In the summer of 1828
                    the <hi rend="italic">Records of Woman</hi> was published by Blackwood, and in
                    the same year the home in Wales was finally broken up by the marriage of Mrs
                    Hemans’s sister and the departure of her two elder boys to their father in Rome.
                    Mrs Hernans therefore left Rhyllon, and took a very small house in the village
                    of Wavertree, near Liverpool, where she hoped to obtain good schooling for her
                    children and society for herself. But, although she had a few intimate friends
                    there, —among them her two subsequent biographers, Henry F. Chorley and Mrs
                    Lawrence of Wavertree Hall,—she was disappointed in her new home. She thought
                    the people of Liverpool stupid and provincial; and they, on the other hand,
                    found her uncommunicative and eccentric. In the following summer she travelled
                    by sea to Scotland with two of her boys, to visit the Hamiltons of Chiefswood.
                    This visit to Scotland was one of the most daring feats, and perhaps the richest
                    episode, in her uneventful life. She was cordially welcomed in Edinburgh, dined
                    with Jeffrey and other celebrities, visited Henry Mackenzie, heard Alison
                    preach, and stayed with Sir David and Lady Wedderburn, and with Sir Robert
                    Liston at Milburn, where she sat for a bust to Angus Fletcher. Above all, while
                    she was at Chiefswood, she enjoyed “constant, almost daily, intercourse” with
                    Sir Walter Scott, with whom she and her boys afterwards stayed some time at
                    Abbotsford. “There are some whom we meet, and should like ever after to claim as
                    kith and kin; and you are one of those,” was Scott’s compliment to her at
                    parting. One of the results of her Edinburgh visit was an article, full of
                    praise, judiciously tempered with criticism, by Jeffrey himself for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> The poetess returned to Wavertree to
                    compose her <hi rend="italic">Songs of the Affections,</hi> which were published
                    early in 1830. In the following June, however, she again left home, this time to
                    visit Wordsworth and the Lake country; and in August she paid a second visit to
                    Scotland. She was resolved to leave Wavertree, and wished to make Edinburgh her
                    home; but the climate was pronounced too rigorous, and, as a brother and his
                    family were already settled in Ireland, it was arranged that she should go to
                    live in Dublin. In her new home kind friends and admirers gathered round the
                    invalid, who now had with her only the youngest of her children. She was obliged
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0678-0645"/> to lie constantly, and the exertion of writing
                    began to be painful to her. Her poetry of this date is chiefly religious. Early
                    in 1834 her <hi rend="italic">Hymns for Childhood,</hi> which had appeared some
                    years before in America, were published in Dublin. At the same time appeared her
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">National Lyrics,</hi> and shortly afterwards <hi
                    rend="italic">Scenes and Hymns of Life.</hi> She was planning also a series of
                    German studies, to consist of translations from German authors, with
                    introductions and explanatory notes, one of which, on Goethe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tasso,</hi> was completed and published in the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly
                    Magazine</hi> for January 1834. In intervals of acute suffering she wrote the
                    lyric <hi rend="italic">Despondency and Aspiration,</hi> and dictated a series
                    of sonnets called <hi rend="italic">Thoughts during Sickness,</hi> the last of
                    which, “Recovery,” was written when she fancied she was getting well. After
                    three months spent at Redesdale, Archbishop Whately’s country seat, which had
                    been placed at the disposal of the dying poetess, she was again brought into
                    Dublin, where she lingered till spring. The use of her limbs was entirely gone;
                    but her passion for reading remained to the last, and the table at her bedside
                    was strewn with books, one of which always lay open. Her last poem, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sabbath Sonnet,</hi> was dictated to her brother on Sunday April
                    26th, and she died on the evening of Saturday, May 16, 1835, at the age of
                    forty-one. She was buried in a vault under St Anne’s church, Dublin. Besides the
                    bust of Mrs Hernans by Angus Fletcher, there were three portraits taken of her
                    in 1827 by the American painter West, one of which has been engraved; and
                    another portrait, an engraving of which is in Chorley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorials,</hi> was painted in 1831 by a young Irish artist, Edward
                    Robinson.</p>
                <p>Mrs Hemans’s poetry is the production of a fine imaginative and enthusiastic
                    temperament, but not of a commanding intellect or very complex or subtle nature.
                    It is the outcome of a beautiful but singularly circumscribed life, a life spent
                    in romantic seclusion, without much worldly experience, and warped and saddened
                    by domestic unhappiness and real physical suffering. Perhaps from these
                    circumstances, aided by a course of self-instruction at best desultory and
                    unguided, the emotional in a sensitive and intensely feminine nature was unduly
                    cultivated; and this undue preponderance of the emotional is a prevailing
                    characteristic in Mrs Hemans’s poetry, and one to which Scott alluded when he
                    complained that it was “too poetical,” that it contained “too many flowers” and
                    “too little fruit.” Her genius—beautiful and pleasing as it was—was not of a
                    very high order. Like her favourite music, it lay within a small compass, and
                    gave little opportunity for intricate harmonies. Thus her tragedies, and her
                    longer and more complicated poems, such as <hi rend="italic">The Sceptic</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Forest Sanctuary,</hi> though by no means devoid of
                    striking passages, are the least notable of her works. It is not, however, as
                    the writer of these more ambitious productions, which in her own time were but
                    doubtful successes and are now rarely read, but as the authoress of many short
                    occasional pieces, and especially as a lyrist, that Felicia Hernans has earned
                    so high a place among our poets. In her lyrics she could concentrate her
                    strength on the perfect expression of simple themes. Her skill in versification,
                    her delicate ear for rhythm, and the few ruling sentiments of her nature here
                    found ample scope. In her lyrics Mrs Hernans is uniformly graceful, tender,
                    delicately refined,—sometimes perhaps, even here, too fervent, too
                    emotional,—but always pure and spiritual in tone; and in these too she
                    occasionally displays those rarer qualities which belong only to the finest
                    lyric genius. Many of her poems, such as “The Treasures of the Deep,” “The
                    Better Land,” “The Homes of England,” “Casablanca,” “The Palm Tree,” “The Graves
                    of a Household,” “The Wreck,” “The Dying Improvisatore,” and “The Lost Pleiad,”
                    have become standard English lyrics, and on the strength of these, and others
                    such as these, Felicia Hernans is ranked among our chief British lyrical
                    poets.</p>
