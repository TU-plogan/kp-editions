                    and population (1878) 75,792. It is bounded on the N. by the Assam district of
                    Sylhet, on the W. by the Bengal districts of Tipperah and Noâkhâlt, on the S. by
                    Noâkhâli and Chittagong districts, and on the E. by the Lushâi country and the
                    Chittagong Hill Tracts. As its name implies the country is hilly. Five or six
                    ranges of hills run parallel from north to south, at an average distance of
                    about 12 miles from each other. The hills are covered for the most part with
                    bamboo jungle, while the low ground abounds with trees of various kinds,
                    canebrakes, and swamps. The principal ranges are, beginning from the east, the
                    Jâmpui, Sakkankhang, Langtarâi, and Athâramurâ. The chief rivers are the Gumti,
                    Hâorâ, Khozâi, Dulâi, Manu, and Pheni. During the heavy rains the people in the
                    plains use boats as almost the sole means of conveyance. The forests give
                    shelter to numbers of wild elephants and other large game. Small game of various
                    kinds are met with.</p>
                <p>The history of the state relates to two distinct periods—the traditional period
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Rαjmαld,</hi> or “Chronicles of the Kings of
                    Tipperah," and the period since 1407 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ràjmdlà</hi> is a history in Bengali verse, compiled by the
                    Brahmans of the court of Tripura. In the early history of the state, the râjâs
                    were in a state of chronic feud with all the neighbouring countries. The worship
                    of the All-destroyer was here, as elsewhere in India, associated with the
                    practice of human sacrifice, and in no part of India were more victims offered
                    up. It was not until thebeginning of the 17th century that the Mughals obtained
                    any footing in this country. By dint of constant invasions and continual
                    intrigues, the Mahometans gradually established themselves, and Tipperah soon
                    became a mere Mughal province under a Mussulman governor. The raja still
                    remained in possession of the hilly tracts, but subject to the nawâb of
                    Murshi&lt;labad. When the East India Company obtained the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diwdni</hi> of Bengal in 1765, so much of Tipperah as had been placed on the
                    rent-roll came under British rule. Since 1808, each successive ruler has
                    received investiture from the British Government, and has been required to pay
                    the usual <hi rend="italic">nαzαr</hi> or tribute on accession. The state has a
                    chronological era of its own, adopted by Râjâ Bir-râj, from whom the present
                    raja is 92d in descent. The year 1875 corresponded with 1285 of the Tipperah
                    era.</p>
                <p>Both as regards its constitution and its relations to the British Government, the
                    state of Hill Tipperah differs alike from the independent native states of India
                    and from those which are tributary and dependent. Besides being the ruler of
                    Hill Tipperah, the raja holds an estate in the British district of Tipperah,
                    called <hi rend="italic">chaklâ</hi> Roshnâbâd, which is by far the most
                    valuable of his possessions. The form of government is despotic and patriarchal.
                    The raja’s word is law, without appeal. In 1871 an English officer was appointed
                    as political agent to protect British interests and advise with the raja. The
                    most important hill tribe is that of the Tipperahs, who were estimated in
                    1874-75 to number 34,727. There are no towns in Hill Tipperah. Agartala, the
                    capital of the state and residence of the râjâ, is merely a moderate-sized
                    village situated on the north bank of the Haurâ.</p>
                <p>The principal crop and main food staple is rice. The other articles of produce
                    are cotton, chillies, and vegetables. The chief exports are cotton, timber, <hi
                    rend="italic">til,</hi> bamboo canes, thatching-grass, and firewood.
                    Occasionally small imports are required from the neighbouring districts. The
                    total revenue in 1874-75 was £18,693. Besides this, the râjâ’s estates in
                    Tipperah and Sylhet yield about £50,000 and £1400 respectively. His total annual
                    income, therefore, is about £70,000. The police force (1874-75) consisted of 102
                    men, and the râjâ maintains a force of 277 officers and men. The state has only
                    2 schools, and only 103 boys are being educated. The climate of Hill Tipperah is
                    generally pleasant; the annual rainfall is 60 inches. The chief endemic diseases
                    are bowel complaints, remittent and intermittent fevers, and rheumatism; the
                    principal epidemic is cholera.</p>
