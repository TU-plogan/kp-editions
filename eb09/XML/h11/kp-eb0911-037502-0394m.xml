                    runs nearly due east and west past the town of Mons, aυd falls into the Scheldt
                    not far from Condé. Hainault is well-wooded and hilly in the east and
                    south-east, where it is partly covered by the Ardennes; the rest of the province
                    is a pleasantly diversified, fertile, and well-cultivated plain land, which
                    produces all kinds of cereal crops, flax, tobacco, chicory, and beetroot. The
                    long and narrow coalfield which, with some breaks, stretches from
                    Aix-la-Chapelle to the sea near Boulogne, passes through the middle of Hainault,
                    underlying a district of about 190,000 acres; its centre is about Mons, whence
                    it extends westward to Valenciennes, eastward to Charleroi. At this latter town,
                    named after Charles II. of Spain, who built it in 1666, are iron and copper
                    works; marble and building-stone are also largely quarried in Hainault; the
                    manufactures of the province are vigorous and good; ironware and cutlery, <pb

                    variety of other articles are made, and are exported largely into France.
                    Hainault, with a population of 956,354 inhabitants in 1876 (the largest in this
                    respect of all the provinces), has an area of near 1400 square miles, and is
                    therefore somewhat thickly peopled; for administrative purposes it is divided
                    into six arrondissements, of which that of Mons is the chief; the others are
                    Tournai, Charleroi, Ath, Soignies, and Thuin; these again are subdivided into
                    thirty-two cantons.</p>
                <p>Formerly the county was nearly twice as large as the present province. In
                    Caesar’s days it was inhabited by the Nervii, and did not get its present name
                    till the 7th century, before which time it had become a county under its own
                    lords. This dignity, at first more or less elective, became hereditary in the
                    9th century. Throughout the early Middle Ages Hainault was a purely agricultural
                    district, owned by a numerous and very quarrelsome and disagreeable nobility; it
                    possessed also no less than fifteen abbeys. It was famous in legend and history
                    as the chosen land of chivalry, and Froissart, himself a native of Valenciennes,
                    faithfully reflects the character of his fatherland. In the 11th century Baldwin
                    V. of Flanders occupied it, and Baldwin VI., by marrying the heiress to the
                    county, permanently added it to the territories of his house. It was his
                    descendant Baldwin IX., count of Flanders and Hainault, who proclaimed himself
                    first Latin emperor of Constantinople in 1204. In 1300 John of Avennes, count of
                    Hainault, became also count of Holland by right of his mother Adelaide, sister
                    of William II. of Holland; it was his granddaughter Philippa who in 1326 married
                    the Prince of Wales, afterwards Edward III. Hainault went with Flanders, till it
                    was occupied by Philip “the Good” of Burgundy in the war which lasted from 1424
                    to 1427. It finally fell to the house of Burgundy on the death of the
                    unfortunate Jacoba in 1436. With the other territories of Charles the Bold it
                    passed with Mary of Burgundy in 1477 to the house of Austria, and remained
                    theirs till the peace of the Pyrenees in 1659, when part of the southern portion
                    of the county λvas ceded to Louis XIV.—a cession confirmed and enlarged at
                    Nimwegen in 1678. Thenceforth there are two Hainaults, the French and the
                    Austrian, the latter answering to the present Belgian province. French Hainault
                    (now a part of the department du Nord) had as its ancient capital Valenciennes;
                    its other towns are Condé, Cambrai, Maubeuge, Le Quesnoy, Landrécies, Avesnes,
                    Givet, Charlemont. Philippeville, which owes its name to Philip II. of Spain,
                    having been transmuted out of a village called Corbigny into a town by Charles
                    V. in 1555, was restored to the Netherlands in 1815. Austrian Hainault was
                    overrun by the French in 1793, and annexed to France as the department of
                    Jernmapes in 1794; in 1814 it was made part of the kingdom of the Netherlands;
                    and in 1830, as a matter of course, in the division of that kingdom, it became
                    one of the provinces of the Belgian half.</p>
