                    of September 1729, in a suburb of the city of Chemnitz in Saxony, where his
                    father, who had been compelled by some religious persecutions to abandon his
                    native country of Silesia, earned a precarious support for his family by
                    exercising the trade of a weaver. It was only by the liberality of his
                    godfathers that Heyne was enabled to obtain his primary instruction in the
                    elementary school of Chemnitz, and afterwards to prosecute his classical studies
                    in the gymnasium of that city. In 1748 he ehtered the university of Leipsic,
                    with the professed intention of studying for the legal profession. There he was
                    so scantily supported by those on whose assistance he relied that he was
                    frequently in want even of the common necessaries of life, and was sometimes
                    indebted for food to the generosity of a maid-servant in the house where he
                    lodged. In this situation, without even the hope of future distinction, he
                    continued to struggle on against every difficulty and disappointment in the
                    acquisition of knowledge. For six months he is said to have allowed only two
                    nights in the week to sleep, and he was at the same time forced to endure his
                    godfather’s reproaches for negligence in the prosecution of his studies. His
                    distress had almost amounted to despair, when he procured the situation of tutor
                    in the family of a French merchant resident in Leipsic, He was thus enabled to
                    continue his studies, though with much interruption,—the emoluments of his
                    appointment being sufficient to support him in what was at least comparative
                    comfort. Under Ernesti he was initiated into the criticism of the classical
                    authors; from the prelections of the celebrated Bach he acquired a competent
                    knowledge of Roman jurisprudence; and by Christius, who lectured on archaeology,
                    his attention was strongly directed to the works of ancient art. Even after he
                    had finished his studies at the university, he was exposed for many years to all
                    the accumulated distresses of poverty and neglect. The first situation he was
                    able to procure was that of copyist in the library of Count von Brühl in
                    Dresden, with a salary of somewhat less than twenty pounds sterling, which he
                    obtained in the year 1753. From the necessity of adding something to this scanty
                    pittance, he was forced to employ himself in the drudgery of translation; and,
                    besides some French novels, he rendered into German the Greek romance of
                    Chariton. He published his first edition of <hi rend="italic">Tibullus</hi> in
                    1755, and in 1756 his <hi rend="italic">Epictetus.</hi> In the latter year the
                    Seven Years’ War broke out; Dresden was entered, and the Saxon archives seized;
                    the Brühl ministry fell; and Heyne was once more in a state of absolute
                    destitution. In 1757 he was offered a tutorship in the household of Frau von
                    Schönberg, and there he first became acquainted with Teresa Weiss, whom he
                    subsequently married. In January 1759 he accompanied his pupil to the university
                    of Wittenberg, at which more than a year was spent in the study of philosophy
                    and German history, but from which he was driven in 1760 by the Prussian cannon.
                    The bombardment of Dresden (to which city he had meanwhile returned) on July 18,
                    1760, destroyed not only his humble lodging but also all his worldly
                    possessions, which included amongst other valuable papers an almost finished
                    edition of Lucian based on a valuable codex of the Dresden Library. In the
                    summer of 1761 he married, although still without any fixed means of support;
                    and for some time he found it necessary wholly to suspend his literary pursuits
                    that he might devote himself to the duties of the office of landsteward, to
                    which he had been charitably appointed in the household of the Baron von Löben
                    in Lusatia. He was enabled, however, to return to Dresden in the end of 1762,
                    where he was commissioned by Lippert to prepare the Latin text of the third
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Dactyliotheca.</hi> Ât length, in the
                    commencement of the year 1763, Heyne’s <pb break="no"

                    illustrious career was opened to him. On the death of Johann Matthias Gesner at
                    Göttingen in 1761, the appointment to the vacant chair had been first offered to
                    Ernesti, who, however, declined leaving the university of Leipsic, but proposed
                    Ruhnken of Leyden or Saxe of Utrecht for the appointment. Ruhnken likewise
                    refused it, but having been strongly impressed with the taste and learning
                    displayed by the editor of Tibullus and Epictetus, he advised Münchhausen, the
                    Hanoverian minister and principal curator of the university of Göttingen, to
                    bestow the professorship on Heyne, whose merit, though known to few, he was
                    confident would do honour to the choice. The minister had the good sense to
                    acquiesce in the recommendation of this great scholar, and Heyne, after some
                    delay, became professor of eloquence in Göttingen. Though his appointments were
                    at first few and his emoluments inconsiderable, these were gradually augmented
                    in proportion as his usefulness was proved, and his growing celebrity rendered
                    it an object with the other Governments of Germany to secure the services of so
                    distinguished a scholar. He refused the most advantageous and honourable
                    overtures from Cassel, Berlin, and Dresden. As professor, principal librarian,
                    member of the Royal Society, and chief editor of the <hi rend="italic">Gelehrte
                    Anzeigen,</hi> and still more by his publications, he greatly contributed to
                    raise the university of Göttingen to the distinguished rank it still holds among
                    the seminaries of Europe. After a long and useful career, graced with all the
                    distinctions which in Germany are conferred on literary eminence, he died, full
                    of years and honour, on the 14th of July 1812.</p>

                    of which the most valuable are those respecting the colonies of Greece and the
                    antiquities of Etruscan art and history. He left also a great number of papers
                    on almost every subject of erudition, more especially on ancient mythology,
