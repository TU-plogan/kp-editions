                    (1622-1685), surnamed el Mozo (the young), historical and fresco painter, son of
                    the subject of last notice, was also a native of Seville. Unable to endure his
                    father’s cruelty, the younger Herrera, seizing what money he could find, fled to
                    Rome. There, instead of devoting himself to the antiquities and the works of the
                    old Italian masters, he gave himself up to the study of architecture and
                    perspective, with the view of becoming a frescopainter. He did not altogether
                    neglect easel-work, but became renowned for his pictures of still-life, flowers,
                    and fruit, and from his skill in painting fish was called by the Italians <hi
                        rend="italic">Lo Spagnuolo degli pesci.</hi> In later life he painted
                    portraits with great success. He returned to Seville on hearing of his father’s
                    death; and in 1660 was appointed subdirector of the new academy there under
                    Murillo. His vanity, however, brooked the superiority of no one; and throwing up
                    his appointment he went to Madrid. There he was employed to paint a San
                    Hermenegildo for the barefooted Carmelites, and to decorate in fresco the roof
                    of the choir of San Felipe el Real. The success of this last work procured for
                    him a commission from Philip IV. to paint in fresco the roof of the Atocha
                    church. He chose as his subject for this the Assumption of the Virgin. Soon
                    afterwards he was rewarded with the title of painter to the king, and was
                    appointed superintendent of the royal buildings. He died at Madrid in 1685.
                    Herrera el Mozo was of a somewhat similar temperament to his father, and
                    offended many people by his inordinate vanity and suspicious jealousy. His
                    pictures are inferior to the older Herrera’s both in design and in execution;
                    but in some of them traces of the vigour of his father, who was his first
                    teacher, are visible. He was by no means an unskilful colourist, and was

                    Cathedral. An elder brother, known as Herrera el Rubio (the ruddy), who died
