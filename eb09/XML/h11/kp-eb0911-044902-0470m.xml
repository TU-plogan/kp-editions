                <p><label type="entry">HANSEATIC LEAGUE</label>. The word “hansa,” when we find it
                    first in the Gothic Bible of Ulfila, signifies a military assemblage or troop.
                    From this comes the general sense of union, and especially in the Middle Ages of
                    union for mercantile purposes. A later but less important meaning is that of a
                    tax paid by traders for the right of forming such an union.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi> Hansa, the league which ultimately overshadowed all
                    rivals and usurped the name for itself, was no intentional creation, and we can
                    fix no exact date for its origin. It arose gradually from two elements, the
                    union of German merchants abroad, and the union of German towns at home.</p>
                <p>The first impulse to mercantile union came from the dangers of travelling in the
                    early Middle Ages. In those days mariners had neither chart nor compass to guide
                    their course, and were forced to creep timidly along the shore and to avoid as
                    much as possible the open sea. The merchant had also to dread more positive
                    dangers than those of storm and wreck. The coasts of northern Germany harboured
                    numbers of rovere and pirates, who regarded the peaceful trader as their natural
                    prey. To increase their powers of resistance, it was usual for merchants to
                    undertake their voyages in more or less numerous companies. The union thus begun
                    on sea was still further cemented on land. In those days law was personal and
                    not territorial. The foreign merchant had no share in the’ law of the land where
                    he sojourned; he brought with him his own law, and administered it as best he
                    could. The legal customs of northern Germany were substantially alike; and this
                    similarity strengthened the bonds of union among the merchants who found
                    themselves for a time settled in a foreign land. Moreover, the state of trade
                    frequently required a long stay, and sometimes a depositing of goods among
                    strangers. This led in time to the acquisition of common possessions abroad,
                    lodgings, storehouses, &amp;c. This common depot, or “factory,” became the
                    central point of the union or Hansa formed by the merchants. The union soon
                    received a corporative constitution. At its head stood the elder3, whose chief
                    functions were to administer justice and to represent the society in its
                    relations to the natives of the country. It was by means of these orderly unions
                    that the German merchants obtained their important privileges, chiefly
                    advantages in trade and taxes, from the people among whom they sojourned.</p>
                <p>The most important German mercantile settlements were founded in Wisby, the
                    capital of Gothland, in London, Novgorod, Bergen, and Bruges. Wisby was the
                    central point of the Baltic trade; the other towns represent the four extreme
                    points of North-German commerce. It was not unnatural that the mercantile
                    settlements should exercise great influence on the towns from which they sprang.
                    In those towns the municipal government was wholly in the hands of merchants.
                    There was no feudal aristocracy as in the Italian cities, and the artisan was
                    always jealously excluded from political power. It is obvious therefore that the
                    policy of the town-councils would often be influenced by the exigencies of
                    foreign commerce. But the influence of the foreign factories was not exercised
                    by all in an equal degree. Wisby differed from the other settlements in the fact
                    that the Germans there were not merchants making a temporary visit, but were
                    real settlers living side by side with the native population. Novgorod was a
                    mere colony of the German settlement in Wisby, and never held an independent
                    position. Bergen was comparatively unimportant, and the German “counter” in
                    Bruges was not formed until some amount of union had been attained at home. But
                    in the German colony in London the majority of the members were merely passing
                    traders, who remained citizens of their native towns. It was therefore the
                    London Hansa which exercised the greatest influence on the growth of the town
                    league.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Edgar we find the “people of the emperor” occupying a prominent
                    position in London trade, and joined in a lasting league. The members of this
                    league came mostly from Cologne, the first German town which obtained great
                    importance both at home and abroad. Its citizens possessed at an early date a
                    guild-hall of their own, and all Germans who wished to trade with England had to
                    join their guild. This soon included merchants from Dortmund, Soest, and
                    Münster, in Westphalia; from Utrecht, Stavern, and Groningen, in the
                    Netherlands; and from Bremen and Hamburg on the North Sea. But when, at the
                    beginning of the 13th century, the rapidly rising town of Lübeck wished to be
                    admitted into the guild, every effort was made to keep her out. The intervention
                    of the emperor Frederick II. was powerless to overcome the dread felt by Cologne
                    towards a possible rival to its supremacy. But this obstacle to the extension of
                    the league was soon overcome. In 1260 a charter of Henry III. assured protection
                    to all German merchants. A few years later Hamburg and Lübeck were allowed to
                    form their own guilds. The Hansa of Cologne, which had long been the only guild,
                    now sinks to the position of a branch Hansa, aud has to endure others with equal
                    privileges. Over all the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n471/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0471-0450"/> branch Hansas rises the “Hansa Alamanniae,” first
                    mentioned in 1282.</p>
                <p>The opposition to the exclusive pretensions of Cologne was chiefly the work of
                    Lübeck, and with the rise of Lübeck we must connect the second element, the
                    internal political element, which contributed to the formation of the Hansa. The
                    old capitals of German trade, Cologne and Wisby, took their stand on the unions
                    of German merchants abroad. In opposition to them Lübeck found support in home
                    alliances, in its league with Hamburg and with the Wendish towns. The alliance
                    between Lübeck and Hamburg is generally and with some truth given as the origin
                    of the Hanseatic League. It was well fitted to play this part. These two towns
                    commanded the commerce of the North Sea and the Baltic. By taking the land route
                    between them, a merchant could avoid the dangerous passage of the Sound or the
                    Belts, and could evade the Sound dues which were often exacted by the Danish
                    kings. The first alliance between the two towns, for which there is no exact
                    date, had for its object the defence of the roads between them. From that came
                    agreements as to mutual legal security, and thence they advanced to common
                    political action in London and in Flanders.</p>
                <p>The league between Lübeck and Hamburg was not the only, and possibly not the
                    first, league among the German towns. But it gradually absorbed all the others.
                    Besides the influence of foreign commercial interests there were other motives
                    which compelled the towns to union. The chief of these were the protection of
                    commercial routes both by sea and land, and the vindication of town independence
                    as opposed to the claims of the landed aristocracy. The first to join this
                    league were the Wendish towns to the east, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, &amp;c.,
                    which had always been intimately connected with Lübeck, and were united by a
                    common system of law known as the “Lübisches Recht.” The Saxon, and Westphalian
                    towns had long possessed a league among themselves; they also joined themselves
                    to Lübeck. Lübeck now became the most important town in Germany. It had already
                    surpassed Cologne both in London and Bruges. It soon gained a similar victory
                    over Wisby. At a great convention in which twenty-four towns from Cologne to
                    Revel took part it was decided that appeals from Novgorod which had hitherto
                    been decided at Wisby should henceforth be brought to Lübeck.</p>
                <p>In the 14th century the Hansa changes from a union of merchants abroad to a
                    league of towns at home. In 1330 mention is first made of the Hanse towns, where
                    before it had been the Hanse merchants. In 1343 the league is first designated
                    as the Hansa by a foreign prince, Magnus of Norway, and thus acquires a
                    diplomatic position as a united state. In 1356 a statute about mercantile
                    privileges at Bruges is made, not by the German merchants, but by the towns
                    themselves, through their representatives assembled at Bruges. Henceforth the
                    town-league subordinates to itself the mercantile unions; the factories and
                    depots of the merchants lose their independence, and became the “counters,” as
                    they are called, of the Hanse towns.</p>
                <p>The league thus formed would scarcely have held long together or displayed any
                    real federal unity but for the pressure of external dangers. The true function
                    of the Hansa, and especially of the Baltic towns, was to conduct the commerce
                    between the east and west of northern Europe. But the geographical position of
                    the Scandinavian countries enabled them to interpose a bar to this commerce.
                    Thus from an early period the Hansa stood in a position of watchful hostility
                    towards those countries. It was the careful maintenance of this watch over the
                    Baltic which gave Lübeck its position in the league, and which gave the League
                    its political as contrasted with its mercantile character.</p>
                <p>The most dangerous of the Scandinavian countries at this time was Denmark. Until
                    the 16th century the southern coast of what is now Sweden was in the hands of
                    the Danes, who were thus enabled to command the important channel of the Sound,
                    and to interfere with the herring fisheries, a great source of wealth to the
                    Hanse merchants. The Danish kings were almost always opposed to German
                    interests, and were especially jealous of the supremacy of German traders in the
                    Baltic. Eric Menved (1286-1319) almost succeeded in making himself master of the
                    southern coast of the Baltic. He captured Rostock and the island of Rügen. Even
                    Lübeck submitted to him, and was for a time practically detached from the
                    empire. Stralsund alone successfully resisted the Danish attack. The league of
                    Wendish towns was for the time wholly broken up, and the growth of the Hansa was
                    arrested; but it was saved from total dissolution by the feuds which distracted
                    Denmark. Eric’s successor, Christopher II., an exile from Denmark, fled to the
                    very towns which' his predecessor had humbled. After extorting from him numerous
                    privileges, especially the exclusive right to the fisheries on the coast of
                    Schonen, the Hanse towns restored him to his throne, though to only a fraction
                    of his former power. From 1333 to 1340 Denmark was without a king, and a prey to
                    the wildest anarchy. But as it recovered strength it again became formidable to
                    the Hansa. Waldemar III. (1340-1377) devoted the early part of his reign to the
                    recovery of the lands which Denmark had lost during the recent troubles. To
                    carry out this policy he had to spend large sums of money, and in his straits he
                    determined to enrich himself by the plunder of German commerce. In 1361 he
                    sailed to Gothland, and surprised and captured the town of Wisby. The news of
                    this act reached the representatives of the Hansa as they were assembled at
                    Greifswald. They at once resolved on war, and in 1362 their fleet stormed and
                    captured Copenhagen. But while they were besieging the strong fortress of
                    Helsingborg, Waldemar attacked their defenceless fleet and destroyed it. This
                    defeat was followed by a truce, which recognized the Danish possession of
                    Gothland. Waldemar might easily have turned this truce into an advantageous
                    peace, but his success seems to have inspired him with the hope of crushing
                    German ascendency in northern Europe. In 1367 a Hanseatic assembly at Stralsund
                    was informed that Waldemar had laid new duties on the fishing stations, and that
                    he had robbed German merchants in the Sound and the Belts. Another war was
                    inevitable, and this time the result was different. Waldemar did not await the
                    arrival of the hostile fleet, but fled in 1368 to Brandenburg. Denmark fell
                    entirely into the hands of the League. In 1370 Waldemar was compelled, as the
                    price of his return to his kingdom, to sign the treaty of Stralsund. By this
                    treaty the Hansa obtained possession for five years of all fortresses on the
                    coast of Schonen, and as compensation for its losses was to receive for fifteen
                    years two-thirds of the Danish revenues. It was also stipulated that henceforth
                    no king should ascend the throne of Denmark without the consent of the Hanse
                    towns, and that their privileges should be expressly confirmed at each
                    coronation. The treaty of Stralsund marks the zenith of the power and prosperity
                    of the Hansa. The emperor Charles IV., who had always looked coldly on
                    independent combinations among his subjects, seems to have been induced to alter
                    his policy, and in 1375 he distinguished Lübeck by a personal visit.</p>
                <p>The war against Waldemar III. seems to have had a great effect in consolidating
                    the Hanseatic League, and in forcing it to adopt a federal constitution. From
                    1361 we can date the regular meeting of the general assemblies, whose acts
                    (Recesse) have been preserved in the archives <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n472/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0472-0451"/> at Lübeck. These assemblies met once a year about
                    midsummer, usually but not exclusively at Lübeck. They were attended by
                    representatives of the various towns, but no one below the rank of councillor
                    could act as representative. The League always endeavoured to maintain its
                    aristocratic character. The assemblies busied themselves with all the details of
                    foreign policy as well as of internal management. The penalty for non-observance
                    of their decrees was expulsion from the League (Verhansung). The chief offence
                    which brought this punishment on a town was the admission of democratic
                    tendencies. The struggle between the artisane and the old burgher families,
                    which is so important a feature of European history in the 13th and 14th
                    centuries, necessarily affected the Hanse towns. It was for admitting artisans
                    to the council that Brunswick was expelled from the League in 1375, and was not
                    readmitted till 1380, when the old constitution was restored.</p>
                <p>Besides the central constitution of the Hansa, there are also traces of an
                    internal grouping. At Bruges the German merchants are divided, according as they
                    came from (1) the Wendish and Saxon towns, (2) Westphalia and Prussia, (3)
                    Gothland, Livonia, and Sweden. This division is supposed to refer to a real
                    division of the League, each third being gathered round one of the three chief
                    towns, Lübeck, Cologne, and Wisby. But in later times we find the League divided
                    into four quarters with their respective capitals,—Lübeck, Cologne, Brunswick,
                    and Dantzic.</p>
                <p>Although, by comparing the documents which have come down to us, we can trace the
                    existence of a fairly definite system of government, yet we must not imagine
                    that this system was carried out with the regularity of a modern constitution.
                    The composition of the League was always fluctuating, and it is impossible to
                    say at any fixed time how many members it contained. The towns lay scattered
                    over a large territory extending from Revel to the Scheldt, and their interests,
                    both territorial and commercial, must have often clashed. It was only in time of
                    danger that the League displayed any real consistency. When the immediate danger
                    was withdrawn, the want of union soon made itself again manifest. It is true
                    that the towns joined the League of their own accord, but when they had joined,
                    they tried to make their position as independent as possible. They never
                    considered themselves bound to send deputies to the general assemblies. When the
                    deputies did appear they usually came late, and after a matter had been
                    discussed they would insist on referring it to the town-council at home, as
                    their own powers were insufficient. The wonder lies, not in the dissensions
                    which sprang up among the towns, but in the fact that for three centuries they
                    did in a manner hold together, and not infrequently sacrificed their individual
                    advantages for the common good.</p>
                <p>From the very moment of the treaty of Stralsund, the weakness of a community
                    founded chiefly on commercial interests began to show itself. The eastern Baltic
                    towns, especially those of Prussia, were indignant at the erection of a staple
                    at Lübeck. They desired to trade directly with England and Flanders. To repress
                    this movement Lübeck as the head of the League entered into the closest
                    relations with the Teutonic order. But the evil of these dissensions lay in the
                    fact that they distracted the attention of the Hanse towns from events in
                    Scandinavia. The influence guaranteed to them by the treaty of Stralsund was
                    never exercised, and their supineness allowed Margaret, Waldemar HI·’ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> · daughter, to unite the crowns of the three
                    Scandinavian kingdoms at Calmar in 1397. The erection of a powerful northern
                    state was obviously dangerous to the ascendency of the Hansa. About the same
                    time their allies, the Teutonic knights, were threatened in a similar manner by
                    the accession of the Jagellon dynasty in Poland. The battle of Tannenberg (1410)
                    and the peace of Thorn (1411) were clear signs that the Slavonic race was
                    beginning to turn the tables on its German oppressors. At one time it seemed
                    probable that Slavs and Scandinavians would unite in a great anti-German
                    crusade, and that the Hansa and the Teutonic order—the pioneers of German
                    civilization in northern Europe—would fall victims to the alliance. During the
                    15th century the Hanse towns were frequently compelled to seek safety in arms.
                    Their constant policy was to break up the union of Calmar. In 14'28 they sent a
                    large fleet against Eric, Margaret’s successor, who wished to add Schleswig and
                    Holstein to his possessions. The accession of two German princes, Christopher of
                    Bavaria and Christian I. of Oldenburg, to the Danish crown was due in no slight
                    measure to the exertions of the Hansa. On the whole the League held its own in
                    this century, though not without considerable and increasing difficulty.</p>
                <p>But with the 16th century the Hansa begins really to decline. The English and
                    Dutch proved formidable rivals for the commercial supremacy in northern Europe.
                    Henry VII. secured in 1489 a treaty from Hans of Denmark, which gave England the
                    right of commerce in the northern seas, and which enabled English merchants to
                    found mer cantile establishments in the ports. The herrings no longer came in
                    crowds to the Swedish and Norwegian coasts, where the members of the Hansa had
                    so long held a practical monopoly of the fisheries. These fish made at this time
                    one of their periodical changes of course, and went to the coasts of Holland.
                    The Dutch were not slow to grasp at the advantages thus offered to them. Another
                    great blow was dealt to Hanseatic commerce by the grand discoveries of the age.
                    Most of the German towns were out of the way of the new commercial routes, and
                    could scarcely hope to hold their own with more favourably situated
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Besides these causes of decline, the domestic position of the Hanse towns had
                    altered very much for the worse. While in other countries the power of the
                    feudal nobles had fallen before the rapid rise of the monarchy aided by the
                    sympathy of the commons, in Germany alone the power of the princes had
                    constantly increased, at the expense of both king and people. The Reformation
                    and the consequent secularization of church property in northern Germany only
                    served to strengthen the hands of the lay princes. Such a state of things was
                    fatal to the independence of a town league which had always stood opposed to the
                    lawless independence of the nobles. Gradually most of the towns fell off from
                    the League. Foreign countries triumphed at the fall of their formerly successful
                    rival. In Elizabeth’s reign the Hanse merchants in London lost the privileges
                    which they had held since the time of Henry III.</p>
                <p>Religious disturbances and the fearful disasters of the Thirty Years’ War
                    completed the work thus begun. The peace of Westphalia restored the form but not
                    the reality of the League. In 1669 the last general assembly was held.
                    Henceforth the name of Hanse towns was kept by Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen, but
                    it was to designate their independence, not their union.</p>
