                    persons have full right of way—walking, riding, or driving. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roads.</hi> Such roads in England for the most part either are
                    of immemorial antiquity or have been created under the authority of an Act of
                    Parliament. But a private owner may create a highway at common law by dedicating
                    the soil to the use of the public for that purpose; and, apart from any special
                    dedication, the using of a road for a number of years, without interruption,
                    will support the presumption that the soil has been so dedicated, and the road
                    will be to all intents and purposes a public highway. At common law the parish
                    is required to maintain all highways within its bounds; but by special custom
                    the obligation may attach to a particular township or district, and in certain
                    cases the owner of land is bound by the conditions of his holding to keep a
                    highway in repair. Breach of the obligation is treated as a criminal offence,
                    and is prosecuted by indictment. Bridges, on the other hand, and so much of the
                    highway as is immediately connected with them, are as a general rule a charge on
                    the county; and by 22 Henry VIII. c. 5 the obligation of the county is extended
                    to 300 yards of the highway on either side of the bridge. A bridge, like a
                    highway, may be a burden on neighbouring land <hi rend="italic">ratione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tenures.</hi> Private owners so burdened may sometimes claim a
                    special toll from passengers, called a “toll traverse.”</p>
                <p>Extensive changes in the law of highways have been made by the recent Highway
                    Acts, viz., The Highway Act, 1835 (5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 50), and the amending
                    Acts of 1862 and 1864. It is no longer possible for a private owner, by
                    dedicating a highway to the public, to make the charge of maintaining it a
                    burden on the parish in all cases. To create a new highway of this character he
                    must give three months’ notice of his intentions to the parish surveyor, and a
                    meeting of vestry must then be called to consider whether the proposed highway
                    is worth the expense of maintenance. Should the vestry decide against it, the
                    charge of maintenance will not fall on the parish, unless the justices of the
                    peace at the next highway sessions decide otherwise.</p>
                <p>The leading principle of the Highway Act, 1835, is to place the highways under
                    the direction of parish surveyors, and to provide for the necessary expenses by
                    a rate levied on the occupiers of land. Two or more parishes may unite to form a
                    district under a district surveyor, and large parishes may appoint more than one
                    surveyor. It is the duty of the surveyor to keep the highways in repair; and if
                    a highway is out of repair, the surveyor may be summoned before justices and
                    convicted in a penalty not exceeding X5, and ordered to complete the repairs
                    within a limited time. The surveyor is likewise specially charged with the
                    removal of nuisances on the highway, or any obstruction or injury rendering it
                    less commodious to the public. A highway nuisance may be abated by any person,
                    and may be made the subject of indictment at common law. The Act contains
                    provisions simplifying the process by which a highway may be widened, enlarged,
                    diverted, or stopped. The amending Acts, while not interfering with the
                    operation of the principal Act, authorize the creation of highway districts on a
                    larger scale. The justices of a county may convert it or any portion of it into
                    a highway district to be governed by a highway board, the powers and
                    responsibilities of which will be the same as those of the parish surveyor under
                    the former Act. The board consists of representatives of the various parishes,
                    called “way wardens,” together with the justices for the county residing within
                    the district. Salaries and similar expenses incurred by the board are charged on
                    a district fund to which the several parishes contribute; but each parish
                    remains separately responsible for the expenses of maintaining its own
                    highways.</p>
                <p>The Highway Act of 1835 specifies as offences for which the driver of a carriage
                    on the public highway may be punished by a fine, in addition to any civil action
                    that may be brought against him,—riding upon the cart, or upon any horse drawing
                    it, and not having some other person to guide it, unless there be some person
                    driving it; negligence causing damage to person or goods being conveyed on the
                    highway; quitting his cart, or leaving control of the horses, or leaving the
                    cart so as to be. an obstruction on the highway; not having the owner’s name
                    painted up; refusing to give the same; and not keeping on the left or near side
                    of the road, when meeting any other carriage or horse. This rule does not apply
                    in the case of a carriage meeting a foot-passenger, but a driver is bound to use
                    due care to avoid driving against any person crossing the highway on foot. At
                    the same time a passenger crossing the highway is also bound to use due care in
                    avoiding vehicles, and the mere fact of a driver being on the wrong side of the
                    road would not be evidence of negligence in such a case. When there is a public
                    crossing in a street, the driver is bound to use special care; and the
                    expression has been used that a crossing is the special property of the
                    foot-passengers.</p>
                <p>The “rule of the road” given above is peculiar to the United Kingdom. Cooley’s
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">American Law of Torts</hi> states that “the
                    custom of the country, in some States enacted into statute law, requires that
                    when teams approach and are about to pass on the highway, each shall keep to the
                    right of the centre of the travelled portion of the road.” The same appears to
                    be the general rule on the continent of Europe.</p>
                <p>The excessive use of the highway by acts which in moderation are lawful becomes a
                    nuisance if it interferes with the public enjoyment of the roadway. Thus when a
                    carrier, having warehouses on a public street, occupied one side of the street
                    in loading and unloading his waggons several hours at a time, so that
                    foot-passengers were incommoded and no carriage could pass on that side,
                    although there was room for two carriages on the opposite side, this was held to
                    be a nuisance; and Lord Ellenborough held it to be a nuisance for stage coaches
                    to stop in the street for three-quarters of an hour taking up and setting down
                    passengers, for the “king’s highway was not to be used as a stable-yard.” In the
                    same way, at common law a tramway laid along a highway is a public nuisance,
                    although it may be shown to be a common convenience. The construction of
                    tramways is now authorized by 33 and 34 Vict. c. 78.</p>
                <p>The Acts 24 and 25 Vict. c. 70, and 28 and 29 Vict. c. 83, regulate the use of
                    locomotives on turnpike and other roads. No engine, so constructed as to be a
                    public or private nuisance, is protected by these Acts. When horses had been
                    frightened by a traction engine, and the jury found that it was likely to
                    frighten horses and that the defendant knew it, he was held liable in
                    damages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turnpike Acts.—</hi> Many of the more important highways are
                    placed under the management of boards of commissioners or trustees. The number
                    of local and general turnpike acts is very great. No fewer than thirty-three
                    general acts are mentioned in the index to the statutes—the first and principal
                    Act being 3 Geo. IV. c. 126. The trustees are required and empowered to
                    maintain, repair, and improve the roads committed to their charge, and the
                    expenses of the trust are met by tolls levied on persons using the road. The
                    various grounds of exemption from toll on turnpike roads are all of a public
                    character, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> horses and carriages attending the
                    sovereign or royal family, or used by soldiers or volunteers in uniform, are
                    free from toll. In general horses <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n849/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0849-0812"/> and carriages used in agricultural work are free
                    from toll. By the Highways and Locomotives Act of 1878 (41 and 42 Vict. c. 77)
                    disturnpiked roads are to become “main roads,” and half the expense of
                    maintenance is to be paid out of the county rate. Ordinary highways may be
                    declared to be “main roads,” and “main roads” may be reduced to the status of
                    ordinary highways.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the highway system will in future be regulated by the Roads and
                    Bridges Act, 1878, which comes into operation at the latest on the 1st of June
                    1883, but may be adopted sooner in any county. From and after the commencement
                    of the Act in each county, the management and maintenance of the highways and
                    bridges shall be vested in the county road trustees, viz., the commissioners of
                    supply, certain elected trustees representing ratepayers in parishes, and
                    others. One of the consequences of the commencement of the Act is the abolition
                    of tolls, statutelabour, causeway mail, and other exactions for the maintenance
                    of bridges and highways; and all turnpike roads shall become highways, and all
                    highways shall be open to the public free of tolls and other exactions. The
                    county is to be divided into districts under district committees, and county and
                    district officers are to be appointed. The expenses of highway management in
                    each district (or parish), together with a proportion of the general expenses of
                    the Act, shall be levied by the trustees by an assessment on the lands and
                    heritages within the district (or parish).</p>
                <p>Highway, in the law of the States of the American Union, generally means a lawful
                    public road, over which all citizens are allowed to pass and repass on foot, on
                    horseback, in carriages, and waggons. Sometimes it is held to be restricted to
                    county roads as opposed to town-ways. In statutes dealing with offences
                    connected with the highway, such as gaming, negligence of carriers, &lt;fcc.,
                    “highway” includes navigable rivers. But in a statute punishing with death
                    robbery on the highway, railways were held not to be included in the term. In
                    one case it has been held that any way is a highway which has been used as such
                    for fifty years. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
