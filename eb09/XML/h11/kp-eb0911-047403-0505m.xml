                <p><label type="entry">HARDOI</label>, a British district of Oudh, India, under the
                    jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the NorthWestern Provinces, lying
                    between 26° 53' and 27° 47' N. lat., and between 79° 44' and 80° 52' E. long,
                    with an area in 1878 of 2285 ’ 64 square miles. The district is an irregular
                    parallelogram between the Gumti and Ganges; its greatest length from north-west
                    to south-east is 78 miles; and the average breadth is 46 miles. It is bounded on
                    the N. by Shâhjahânpur and Kheri; E. by Sitâpur, the Gumti forming the
                    boundary-line; S. by Lucknow and UnAo; and W. by Farrukhâbâd, the Ganges marking
                    the boundary. It is a level district watered by the Ganges, Râmgangâ, Garra,
                    Sukhetâ, Sâi, Baita, and Gumti,—the three rivers first named being navigable by
                    boats of 500 <hi rend="italic">maunds,</hi> or about 17 tons burden. Towards the
                    Gauges, the land is uneven, and often rises into hillocks of sand cultivated at
                    the base, and their slopes covered with lofty <hi rend="italic">mung</hi> grass.
                    The soil of Hardoi is lighter than that of perhaps any other district of Oudh,
                    27 per cent, being sand, 56 per cent, loam, aud 17 per cent. clay. Several large
                    <hi rend="italic">jhils</hi> or lakes are scattered throughout the district, the
                    largest being that of Sândi, which is 3 miles long by from 1 to 2 miles broad.
                    These <hi rend="italic">ghils</hi> are largely used for irrigation, 126,000
                    acres being watered from them. Large tracts of forest jungle still exist.
                    Leopards, black buck, spotted deer, and <hi rend="italic">nilgäi</hi> are
                    common; the mallard, teal, grey duck, common goose, and all kinds of waterfowl
                    abound.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Hardoi district in 1869 numbered 981,517, of whom 500,994 were
                    males and 430,523 females (Hindus, 845,293; Mahometans, 85,824; Christians, 48;
                    “others,” 352). The nine largest towns are,—Shâhâbâd, 18,254 inhabitants;
                    Sandila, 15,511; Bilgrâm, 11,534; Mallânwân, 11,670; Saudi, 11,123; Pihanf,
                    7582; Hardoi (the administrative headquarters of the district), 7156; Gopamau,
                    5949; and Pali, 5122. The principal religious fairs are the following:—At
                    Bilgrâm, in September, on the occasion of the <hi rend="italic">Ram Lila</hi>
                    festival, lasting ten days and attended by about 40,000 persons; at Hattia
                    Haran, during the whole month of Bliâdra (August and September), attended by
                    100,000 persons; at Barsuya, in April and November, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pramhaηska Sanιddh</hi> festival, lasting for only a single day on each
                    occasion, and attended by from 15,000 to 20,000 persons. These, together with
                    several other smaller fairs, are held for religious purposes, and have no
                    commercial importance. Rice, wheat, and other food-grains form the great staples
                    of agriculture. The area under crops is 844,560 acres or 1319 square miles,
                    being more than one-half the entire area. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from
                    Lucknow to Shâhjahânpur runs through Hardoi for a distance of 62 miles. There
                    are also 329 miles of raised and bridged roads, and 73 miles of minor roads,
                    intersecting the district. The principal imports are cotton, salt, country
                    cloth, and European piece-goods; the chief exports,—food-grains, sugar, tobacco,
                    horned cattle, and hides. The value of the imports in 1875 was £102,952; of the
                    exports, £62,977. The gross revenue of the district in 1875 amounted to
                    £170,952, the expenditure to £18,478. The regular police (1873) consisted of 436
                    officers and men, costing £6610. The number of schools in 1875 was 142, with
                    5877 pupils. The average rainfall for the ten years ending 1872 was 32 inches.
                    Malaria fevers, epidemic cholera, and smallpox prevail.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first authentic records of Hardoi are
                    connected with the Mussulman colonization. Bâwan was occupied by Sayyid Sâlâr
                    Masâud in 1028, but the permanent Moslem occupation did not commence till 1217.
                    Owing to the situation of the district, Hardoi formed the scene of many
                    sanguinary battles between the rival Afghan and Mughal empires. Between Bilgrâm
                    and Sândi was fought the great battle between Humâyun and Sher Shâh, in which
                    the former was utterly defeated. Hardoi, along with the rest of Oudh, became
                    British territory under Lord Dalhousie’s proclamation of February 1856.</p>
