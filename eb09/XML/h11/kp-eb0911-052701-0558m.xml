                    rend="smallcaps">Havre</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">de Grâce),</hi> a town of
                    France, the second to Marseilles in importance as a seaport, capital of an
                    arrondissement in the department of Seine-Inférieure, is situated on the north
                    bank of the estuary of the Seine, 143 miles N.W. of Paris and 55 W. of Rouen by
                    rail. The greater part of the town stands on a level plain, but from the heights
                    on which Ingouville, since 1856 united to Havre, is situated, a charming and
                    varied prospect is obtained. In the lower part of the town the streets run
                    chiefly in straight lines, and they are grouped round the basins or docks, which
                    communicate by lockgates and are placed so as to form a triangle entered from
                    the Outer Port. The old fortifications surrounding the town were demolished in
                    1856, and it is now defended by forts erected on the heights of Ingouville and
                    Sainte-Adresse. The principal street is the Rue de Paris, running from north to
                    south in the centre of the town, and among the principal promenades may be
                    mentioned the Boulevard de Strasbourg, the Place Louis XVI., and the Jetée du
                    Nord, which terminates in a lighthouse. Havre possesses a tribunal of the first
                    instance, a tribunal of commerce, an exchange and chamber of commerce, a chamber
                    of agriculture, a hydrographic school, and a communal college. The principal
                    buildings are the churches of Notre Dame and St Francis, the new Hôtel de Ville,
                    the Musée, containing apartments for a library, and for art, antiquities, and
                    natural history, and with statues in front of Bernardin de St Pierre and Casimir
                    Delavigne, natives of Havre, by David Angers; the theatre, the clubhouse called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cercle</hi><hi rend="italic">du Commerce,</hi> the new
                    palace of justice, the marine arsenal, the town-house, the custom-house, and the
                    Frascati bath-house. The docks are among the finest in the world, and consist of
                    eight separate basins, which, with the late enlargement of the outer harbour,
                    afford 150 acres of accommodation for vessels. The new entrance to the harbour
                    has a width of 100 metres or 328 feet. Lines of rails have lately been laid
                    along the docks. As these have absorbed much of the space on the quays, lading
                    is frequently a slow and tedious process, but the completion of the lately
                    projected harbour will afford all the facilities necessary in this respect. The
                    completion of the proposed canal between Havre and the Seine near Tancarville
                    would be a great commercial benefit to the port whose prosperity has,
                    notwithstanding its advantages as the port of Paris, and its unsurpassed
                    facilities for dock accommodation, been much hampered by the system of
                    centralization, which has both retarded improvements and led to the levying of
                    exorbitant shipping rates. Partly on this account, not only has France been
                    unable to maintain the transit of goods for Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany,
                    but even much of the traffic of its own northern and eastern provinces has been
                    directed to Antwerp. The latter port is served by an abundant network of
                    railroads and canals, while Havre has only one convenient railroad (that to
                    Paris by Rouen), and the river Seine with its dangers and high tariff. The
                    completion of the scheme for a railway over Montivilliers to Dieppe will afford
                    partial remedy for this state of matters. In the extensive shipbuilding yards of
                    Havre the finest vessels of France are built, and many are also built for other
                    countries. The construction of two new dry-docks has lately been proposed, one
                    of which is to afford accommodation for the largest Atlantic steamers. Havre is
                    now fortified as a fleet station and harbour of war. The port has regular steam
                    communication with London, Liverpool, Southampton, Dublin, Glasgow, Hull,
                    Swansea, Bristol, Dunkirk, Brest, Cherbourg, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, St
                    Petersburg, Constantinople, West Indies, San Francisco, Vancouver Island, and
                    New York. The total number of vessels which entered the port in 1878 was 6491
                    with a tonnage of 2,192,778, while 6458 cleared with a tonnage of 2,148,517. For
                    the 5 years ending 1878 the average number of vessels that entered was 6041 with
                    a tonnage of 1,841,265, the number that cleared 6006 with a tonnage of
                    1,818,189. The average annual value of exports and imports is about 2800 million
                    francs. The trade of Havre with the United States is very large, and it has
                    always retained its superiority in the importation of cotton, one-third of
                    which, however, it imports from other countries than America. It is also the
                    chief port for the exportation of French goods to the United States, and an
                    important point of emigration. Besides cotton its principal imports are
                    petroleurn, coals, wheat, woollen, silk, flax, mohair and jute tissues, spices,
                    sugar, coffee, hides, dyewoods, and building timber. The principal exports are
                    various French manufactured cloths, leather, jewellery, agricultural and dairy
                    produce, wine, brandy, and oil. Fishing is extensively prosecuted. Besides the
                    various industries connected with shipbuilding. Havre possesses sugar-refining
                    works, tobacco manufactories, iron foundries, salt works, breweries, vitriol
                    works, and manu-faclures of <hi rend="italic">faience,</hi> lace, silk, and
                    paper. It is also much frequented for sea-bathing. The population in 1872 was
                    85,538, and in 1876 it was 85,407.</p>

                <p>Until 1516 Havre was only a fishing village possessing a chapel dedicated to
                    Notre Dame de Grâce, to which it owes its original name Havre (or harbour) de
                    Grâce. The building of the harbour was begun by Francis I. who gave the town the
                    name of Franciscopolis. At the entrance to the harbour he erected a tower which
                    served as a lighthouse for ships until it was demolished in 1862. The town in
                    1562 was delivered over to the keeping of Queen Elizabeth by the Γrince de
                    Condé, leader of the Huguenots, and the command of it was entrusted to Ambrose
                    Dudley, earl of Warwick; but the English were expelled within a year, after a
                    most obstinate siege, the progress of which was pressed forward by Charles IX.
                    and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, in person. The defences of the town were
                    greatly strengthened by Henry 11, and Louis XIII., and under Louis XIV. it
                    became an important fortress. In the 17th century it was several times vainly
                    besieged by the English, who also bombarded it in 1759, 1794, and 1795. It was a
                    port of considerable importance as early as 1572, and despatched vessels to the
                    whale and cod fishing at Spitzbergen and Newfoundland. In 1672 it became the
                    entrepot of the French East India Company, and afterwards of the Senegal and
                    Guinea companies. Its development was greatly furthered by Louis XVI., and
                    Napoleon I. raised it to a war harbour of the first rank. Havre is the
                    birthplace of Bernardin de St Pierre, author of <hi rend="italic">Paid and
