                    reflecting the rays of the sun from a mirror or combination of mirrors in the
                    required direction. This method can of course be only employed to advantage in
                    places where the sky is free from clouds and the atmosphere clear for
                    considerable periods of time, and the fact that an atmospheric change may
                    indefinitely delay tire transmission of a message is an insuperable objection to
                    the establishment of permanent heliographic stations in most climates.</p>

                <p>In favourable localities, however, heliography possesses important advantages for
                    military signalling over other methods, the principal being the portability of
                    the apparatus, the great distance to which messages can be sent without
                    retransmission, and the fact that the signals are visible to those only who are
                    on the direct line of signalling.</p>
                <p>The signals are produced by causing the reflected beam to appear and disappear or
                    be obscured alternately at the distant point, the intervals of appearance and
                    obscuration being usually varied in length, so as to produce the combinations of
                    long and short signals known as the Morse alphabet. This is done in two distinct
                    ways. In the first of these, known as signalling by “appearance,” the reflected
                    beam or “flash” is obscured from the receiving station except when a message is
                    being transmitted, the flashes then giving the signals or “dots” and “dashes”;
                    while in the second method, or signalling by “obscuration,” the flash is kept
                    continually on the receiving station, and only obscured for intervals forming
                    signals. The first method is more easily read by learners; the second is less
                    fatiguing to the eye, and possesses the advantage of enabling the signaller to
                    correct the adjustment of his instrument at any time.</p>
                <p>Glass mirrors with a plane surface are employed, hence the angle of divergence of
                    the extreme rays in the reflected beam is the same as that subtended by the
                    sun’s diameter at the point, or about 32 minutes of arc; this small divergence
                    rendering the flash visible to great distances.</p>
                <p>The distance through which signalling by this method can be carried on depends on
                    the size of the mirror employed and the angle of reflexion of the rays, a large
                    mirror giving a more intense “flash” than a small one, since it reflects more
                    rays, and being therefore visible to a greater distance; also when the angle of
                    reflexion is nearly a right angle the flash will be more intense than when the
                    rays are only diverted through a small angle from the greater extent of surface
                    exposed to the sun’s rays. The range, however, depends to so great a degree on
                    the state of the atmosphere that it is impossible to assign any limits to the
                    distance that the flash might be seen through in exceptionally clear weather.
                    From the Himalayas a 5-inch mirror has been found to give very distinct signals
                    over a distance of 60 miles; but when the air was at all misty a very much
                    larger mirror had to be employed.</p>
                <p>The more perfect reflexion when the angle between the direct and reflected rays
                    is large is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of intensity caused by the
                    small number of reflected rays. Hence when this angle is greater than a right
                    angle two mirrors are used, the sun’s rays being reflected from one back to the
                    other and thence to the distant point. This is called the duplex method of
                    working.</p>
                <p>Two forms of instrument are at present used in the British army. In the one known
                    as Begbie’s field heliostat the mirrors are square, the sun mirror having a side
                    of 5 inches, and the signalling mirror 4 inches. The object of this difference
                    is to ensure the latter receiving the flash over its whole extent of surface.
                    The mirrors are screwed on to tripod stands, the stand for the signalling mirror
                    having a sighting bar with a frame of cross wires at the end, by means of which
                    the alignment can be accurately taken by looking through a hole in the centre of
                    the mirror. M hen this has been found a small white disc is put into a hole in
                    the centre of the cross wire frame, and a black disc in the central hole in the
                    signalling mirror, or, if two mirrors are used, the white disc in the signalling
                    and the black disc in the sun mirror. The flash is then brought on the true line
                    by making the shadow corresponding to the black disc fall on the white one; this
                    is accurately obtained by means of slow-motion screws in a vertical and
                    horizontal direction, by which means also the sun’s apparent motion is
                    continually corrected. The obscuration is effected by a screen placed on a
                    tripod in the alignment of the flash, pivoted horizontally, and worked by a
                    handle. In the heliograph patented by Mr Mance the mirrors are circular, the
                    obscuration being effected by giving a small angular motion to one of the
                    mirrors, causing the reflected beam to travel through twice the angle and
                    completely disappear from the distant point. This is more easily manipulated
                    than obscuration by a screen. Its working is made very similar to that of an
                    ordinary Morse key. The sun’s motion is corrected by slow-motion screws, and the
                    arrangements for directing the flash are very similar to those in the heliostat.
                    Two tripod stands are employed: one is for the signalling mirror; the other in
                    single working carries a jointed arm, fitted with a small white metal tablet
                    having a black spot on which is thrown the shadow from an unsilvered hole in the
                    centre of the signalling mirror, while in duplex working a piece of paper in the
                    centre of the second mirror answers the same purpose.</p>
                <p>In addition to its usefulness as a signalling instrument, the heliograph has been
                    found of great service in defining exactly distant points for large surveys,
                    such as the triangulation of India. For this purpose it was constantly employed
                    by the late astronomer-royal at the Cape, Sir T. Maclear, in his verification of
                    the arc of the meridian. <hi rend="smallcaps">(p. c.)</hi></p>
