                    ornithologists has been for many years encumbered by a considerable number of
                    alien forms, belonging truly to the Cranes, <hi rend="italic">Gruidoe</hi> (see
                    vol. vi. p. 546), and Storks, <hi rend="italic">Ciconiidoe,</hi> whose structure
                    and characteristics are wholly distinct, however much external resemblance some
                    of them may possess to the Herons. Eliminating these intruders, it is difficult
                    or even impossible to estimate with any accuracy the number of species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ardeidoe</hi> which exist. Professor Schlegel in 1863 enumerated
                    61, besides 5 of what he terms “conspecies,” as contained in the collection at

                    >Ardea,</hi> with 17 subgenera. But it is difficult to separate the Family, with
                    any satisfactory result, into genera, if structural characters have to be found
                    for these groups, for in many cases they run almost insensibly into each other—
                    though in common language it is easy to speak of Herons, Egrets, Bitterns,
                    Night-Herons, and Boatbills. With the exception of the last. Professor Schlegel
                    retains all in the genus <hi rend="italic">Ardea,</hi> dividing it into <hi
                    rend="italic">eight</hi> sections, the names of which may perhaps be
                    Englished—Great Herons, Small Herons, Egrets, Semi egrets, Rail-like Herons,
                    Little Bitterns, Bitterns, and Night-Herons. It may be expe-∙ dient here to
                    adopt this arrangement, though the present writer would guard himself against
                    being supposed to give it more than partial and provisional assent.</p>
                <p>The common Heron of Europe, <hi rend="italic">Ardea cinerea</hi> of Linnaeus, is
                    universally allowed to be the type of the family, and it may also be regarded as
                    that of Professor Schlegel’s first section. The species inhabits suitable
                    localities throughout the whole of Europe, Africa, and Asia, reaching Japan,
                    many of the islands of the Indian Archipelago, and even Australia. Though by no
                    means so numerous as formerly in Britain, it is still sufficiently common to
                    render a description of it almost unnecessary,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In many parts of England it is generally
                    called a “Hernser ”— being a corruption of “Heronsewe,” which, as Professor
                    Skeat states <hi rend="italic">{Etyrnοl, Dictionary,</hi> p. 264), is a
                    perfectly distinct word from “Heronshaw,” commonly confounded with it. The
                    further corruption of “Hernser” into “handsaw,” as in the well-known proverb,
                    was easy in the mouth of men to whom hawking the Heronsewe was
                    unfamiliar.</p></note> and there must be few persons who have not seen it rising

                    haunts; while they are many who have been entertained by watching it as it
                    sought its food, consisting chiefly of fishes (especially eels’ and flounders)
                    and amphibians—though young birds and small mammals come not amiss—wading midleg
                    in the shallows, swimming occasionally when out of its depth, or standing
                    motionless to strike its prey with its formidable and sure beak. When
                    sufficiently numerous the Heron breeds in societies, known as Heronries, which
                    of old time were protected both by law and custom in nearly all European
                    countries, on account of the sport their tenants afforded to the falconer. Of
                    late years, partly owing to the withdrawal of the protection they had enjoyed,
                    and still more, it would seem, from agricultural improvement, which, by draining
                    meres, feus, and marshes, has abolished the feeding-places of a great population
                    of Herons, many of the larger Heronries have broken up—the birds composing them
                    dispersing to neighbouring localities and forming smaller settlements, most of
                    which are hardly to be dignified by the name of Heronry, though commonly
                    accounted such. Thus the number of so-called Heronries in the United Kingdom,
                    and especially in England and Wales, has become far greater than formerly, but
                    no one can doubt that the number of Herons has dwindled. Mr Harting, after being
                    at great pains to collect statistics on the subject, gave, in 1872 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zoologist,</hi> s.s. pp. 3261-3272; with additions and
                    corrections, pp. 3404-3407), a list of those existing in the three kingdoms,
                    more than 200 in number, of which a little over one-half are in England and
                    Wales, more than 50 in Scotland, and nearly 50 in Ireland. The sites chosen by
                    the Heron for its nest vary greatly. It is generally built in the top of a lofty
                    tree, but not unfrequently (and this seems to have been much more usual in
                    former days) near or on the ground among rough vegetation, on an island in a
                    lake, or again on a rocky cliff of the coast. It commonly consists of a huge
                    mass of sticks, often the accumulation of years, lined with twigs, and in it are
                    laid from four to six sea-green eggs. The young are clothed in soft
                    flax-coloured down, and remain in the nest for a considerable time, therein
                    differing remarkably from the “pipers” of the Crane, which are able to run
                    almost as soon as they are hatched. The first feathers assumed by young Herons
                    in a general way resemble those of the adult, but the fine leaden-grey back, the
                    pure white breast, the black throat-streaks, and especially the long pendent
                    plumes, which characterize only the very old birds, and are most beautiful in
                    the cocks, are subsequently acquired. The Heron measures about 3 feet from the
                    bill to the tail, and the expanse of its wings is sometimes not less than 6
                    feet, yet it weighs only between 3 and 4 lb.</p>
                <p>Large as is the common Heron of Europe, it is exceeded in size by the Great Blue
                    Heron of America, <hi rend="italic">Ardea</hi><hi rend="italic">herodias,</hi>
                    which generally resembles it in appearance and habits, and both are smaller than
                    the <hi rend="italic">A. sumatrana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">A. typhon</hi> of
                    India and the Malay Archipelago, while the <hi rend="italic">A. goliath,</hi> of
                    wide distribution in Africa and Asia, is the largest of all. The Purple Heron,
                    <hi rend="italic">A. purpurea,</hi> as a well-known European species having a
                    great range over the Old World, also deserves mention here. Of the species
                    included in Professor Schlegel’s second section, little need now be said. They
                    inhabit the tropical parts of Africa, Australasia, and America. The Egrets,
                    forming his third group, require more notice, distinguished as they are by their
                    pure white plumage, and, when in breeding-dress, by the beautiful dorsal tufts
                    of decomposed feathers that ordinarily droop over the tail, and are so highly
                    esteemed as ornaments by Oriental magnates. The largest species is <hi
                    rend="italic">A. occidentalis,</hi> only known apparently from Florida and Cuba;
                    but one not much less, the Great Egret, <hi rend="italic">A. alba,</hi> belongs
                    to the Old World, breeding regularly in south-eastern Europe, and occasionally
                    straying to Britain. A third, <hi rend="italic">A. egretta,</hi> represents it
                    in America, while much the same may be said of two smaller species, <hi
                    rend="italic">A. garzetta,</hi> the Little Egret of English authors, and <hi
                    rend="italic">A. candidissima·,</hi> and a sixth, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    intermedia,</hi> is common in India, China, and Japan, besides occurring in
                    Australia. The group of Semi-egrets, containing some nine or ten forms, among
                    which the Buff-backed Heron, <hi rend="italic">A. bubulcus,</hi> is the only
                    species that is known to have occurred in Europe, is hardly to be distinguished
                    from the last section except by their plumage being at certain seasons varied in
                    some species with slaty-blue and in others with rufous. The Rail-like Herons
                    form Professor Schlegel’s next section, but it can scarcely be satisfactorily
                    differentiated, and the epithet is misleading, for its members have no Rail-like
                    affinities, though the typical species, which inhabits the south of Europe, and
                    occasionally finds its way to England, has long been known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. ralloides.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    is the “Squacco-Heron” of modern British authors—the distinctive name, given

                    Latham.</p></note><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> λ</hi>
                    Nearly all these birds are tropical or subtropical. Then there is the somewhat
                    better defined group of Little Bitterns, containing about a dozen species—the
                    smallest of the whole family. One of them, <hi rend="italic">A. miηutα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> though very local in its distribution, is a
                    native of the greater part of Europe, and has bred in England. It has a close
                    counterpart in the <hi rend="italic">A. exilis</hi> of North America, and is
                    represented by three or four forms in other parts of the world, the <hi
                    rend="italic">A. pusiUa</hi> of Australia especially differing very slightly
                    from it. Ranged by Professor Schlegel with these birds, which are all remarkable
                    for their skulking habits, but more resembling the true Herons in their nature,
                    are the common Green Bittern of America, <hi rend="italic">A. virescens,</hi>
                    and its very near ally the African <hi rend="italic">A. atricapilla,</hi> from
                    which last it is almost impossible to distinguish the <hi rend="italic">A.
                    javanica,</hi> of wide range throughout Asia and its islands, while other
                    species, less closely related, occur elsewhere as <hi rend="italic">A.

                    Australia.</p>
                <p>The true Bitterns, forming the genus <hi rend="italic">Botaurus</hi> of most
                    authors, seem to be fairly separable, but more perhaps on account of their
                    wholly nocturnal habits and correspondingly adapted plumage than on strictly
                    structural grounds, though some differences of proportion are observable. The

                    since the reclamation of the bogs and fens it used to inhabit, it is become only
                    an irregular visitant,—though not a winter passes without its appearing in some
                    numbers, when its uncommon aspect, its large size, and beautifully pencilled
                    plumage cause it to be regarded as a great prize by the lucky gun-bearer to whom
                    it falls a victim. Its value as a delicacy for the table, once so highly
                    esteemed, has long vanished. The old fable of this bird inserting its beak into
                    a reed or plunging it into the ground, and so causing the booming sound with
                    which its name will be always associated, is also exploded, and nowadays indeed
                    so few people in Britain have ever heard its loud and awful voice, which seems
                    to be uttered only in the breeding-season, and is therefore unknown in a country
                    where it no longer breeds,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The last-recorded instance of the Bittern breeding in England was in 1868,
                    as mentioned by Mr Stevenson <hi rend="italic">(Birds of Norfolk,</hi> ii. p.
                    164). All the true Bitterns, so far as is known, lay eggs of a light olive-brown
                    colour.</p></note> that incredulity as to its booming at all has in some
                    quarters succeeded the old belief in this as in other reputed peculiarities of
                    the species. The Bittern is found from Ireland to Japan, in India, and
                    throughout the whole of</p>
                <p>Africa—suitable localities being, of course, understood. Australia and New

                    that of its Old-World congener, but American ornithologists seem only to have
                    heard the croaking note it makes when disturbed.</p></note> which has several
                    times wandered to Europe, and is distinguishable by its smaller size and uniform
                    greyish-brown primaries, which want the tawny bars that characterize <hi
                    rend="italic">B. stellaris.</hi> N ine other species of Bitterns from various
                    parts of the world are admitted by Professor Schlegel, but some of them should
                    perhaps be excluded from the genus <hi rend="italic">Botaurus.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the Night-Herons the same author recognizes six species, all of which may be
                    reasonably placed in the genus <hi rend="italic">Nycticorax,</hi> characterized
                    by a shorter beak and a few other peculiarities, among which the large eyes
                    deserve mention. The first is <hi rend="italic">N. griseus,</hi> a bird widely
                    spread over the Old World, and not unfrequently visiting England, where it would
                    undoubtedly breed if permitted. Professor Schlegel unites with it the common
                    Night-Heron of America: but this, though very closely allied, is generally
                    deemed distinct, and is the <hi rend="italic">N. naevius</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">N. gardeηi</hi> of most writers. A clearly different American
                    species, with a more southern habitat, is the <hi rend="italic">N.
                    violaceus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">N. cayennensis,</hi> while others are found
                    in South America, Australia, some of the Asiatic Islands, and in West Africa.
                    The Galapagos have a peculiar species, <hi rend="italic">N. pauper,</hi> and
                    another, so far as is known, peculiar to Rodriguez, <hi rend="italic">N,

                <p>The Boatbill, of which only one species is known, seems to be merely a
                    Night-Heron with an exaggerated bill,—so much widened as to suggest its English
                    name,—but has always been allowed generic rank. This curious bird, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cancroma cochlearia</hi> of most authors, is a native of tropical
                    America, and what is known of its habits shews that they are essentially those
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Nycticorax</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><note

                    <hi rend="italic">(Balamiceps)</hi> has been regarded by many authorities as

                <p>Bones of the common Heron and Bittern are not uncommon in the peat of the
                    East-Anglian fens. Remains from Sansan and Langy in France have been referred by
                    M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards to Herons under the names of <hi rend="italic">Ardea

                <p>It remains to say that the Herons form part of Professor Huxley’s section <hi
