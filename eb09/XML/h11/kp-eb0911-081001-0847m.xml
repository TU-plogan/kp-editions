                    prevalent rendering of the plural, when a translation is hazarded at all, is in
                    the Pentateuch &lt;m∕λ&lt;u, in the historical books τα <hi rend="italic">υψηλά,
                    τα</hi><hi rend="italic">υψη,</hi> and in the prophetical writings <hi
                    rend="italic">βωpol.</hi> The Vulgate invariably gives either <hi rend="italic"
                    >excelsa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fana.</hi> The habit so widely diffused among
                    primitive peoples of selecting the tops of mountains, or at least elevated
                    sites, as suitable from their comparative isolation from the world and their
                    supposed nearness to the sky for the erection of altars and sacred pillars, is
                    so obviously natural as to require no explanation. Along with that of
                    worshipping under trees or groves (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Grove),</hi> it was
                    fully participated in by the Israelites from an early period, and continued to
                    assert itself down to a very late date, as is abundantly shown by the frequency
                    with which <hi rend="italic">bamah</hi> and other words <hi rend="italic">(liar,
                    yib</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">ah, ramaK)</hi>
                    signifying height occur in connexion with their public and private worship,
                    whether Jehovistic or idolatrous. Thus one of our earliest notices with regard
                    to Abraham after his departure from Haran is that after setting up a sanctuary
                    at Sichem at the oak of Moreh, he “removed unto a mountain on the east of
                    Bethel, and there builded an altar unto the Lord” (Gen. xii. 8). It was on a
                    mountain (Ebal) that the first altar to Jehovah was raised by Joshua after the
                    conquest of Canaan had begun (Josh, viii. 30; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Deut,
                    xxvii. 4, 5); and many other “high places,” some of them (e.y., Beth-Shemesh, or
                    Ir-Heres, and Ashtaro th Karnaim) apparently taken over directly from the
                    Canaanites, speedily obtained recognition as sanctuaries. A few of these, such
                    as Shiloh, early became important pilgrimage centres, but this was not regarded
                    as inconsistent with the right of each town or village-community to have its own
                    high place, or with the view that Palestine as a whole was the “house” or
                    peculiar territory of God, and that it was therefore lawful on suitable
                    occasions to erect new and extempore altars or high places within its limits.
                    For example, we find in 1 Sam. x., xL repeated references made to the <hi
                    rend="italic">bamαh</hi> of Samuel’s native village as if it were a thing of
                    course; from 2 Sam. xv. 32 (Hebt.) we gather that even in David’s time the top
                    of Mount Olivet was a place “where God was wont to be worshipped;” while at a
                    later period we read of Elijah repairing the altar on Mount Carmel that had been
                    broken down, and complaining of the violation of God’s covenant of which those
                    persons had been guilty who had thrown down the altars and slain the prophets (1
                    Kings xviii. 30; xix. 10, 14). And we read of new altars, generally on high
                    places, being set up by Gideon (Judg. vi. 26, 27), by Manoah (Judg. xiii. 19,
                    20), and repeatedly by Saul (1 Sam. xiv. 35). The comparatively late author of
                    the books of Kings expressly states, on the one hand, that before the days of
                    Solomon the people “sacrificed in high places because there was no house built
                    unto the name of the Lord” (1 Kings iii. 2), and, on the other hand, that after
                    that king the high places were removed neither by Asa (1 Kings xiv. 15), nor by
                    Jehoshaphat (xxii. 44), Joash (2 Kings xii. 3), Amaziah (xiv. 4), Uzziah (xv.
                    4), or Jotham (xv. 35). The still later author of the books of Chronicles,
                    indeed, states of Asa (2 Chr. xiv. 5) and Jehoshaphat (xvii. 6) that they did
                    take away the high places “out of all the cities of Judah but this apparent
                    contradiction can best be explained if we assume that the chronicler is alluding
                    only to those high places where heathen deities were worshipped or idolatrous
                    practices allowed, while the earlier author had in view the Jehovistic high
                    places which, during many of the earlier reigns at least, were not
                    discountenanced either in the northern or in the southern kingdom. In reading
                    such a passage as Amos vii. 9, it would be a mistake to interpret it as meaning
                    that the multiplicity of <hi rend="italic">bamoth</hi> was regarded as wrong in
                    itself; the prophet’s zeal is directed not against the places but against the
                    cultus and the false value that was attached to it. Hezekiah is the first
                    monarch of whom in the earlier record we read that with some risk to his
                    popularity he removed the high places and altars of Jehovah, and “said to Judah
                    and Jerusalem, ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem” (2 Kings xviii.
                    4 compared with xviii. 22). But it was not until the reign of Josiah that the
                    high places were finally repressed, not on the ground of direct prophetic
                    revelation, but on that of ħ strict written law. Even then, however, a
                    distinction was made between the “high places” of the southern kingdom, sacred
                    to Jehovah, and those of the northern, dedicated to a mixed worship; the priests
                    of the former were brought to Jerusalem, and, though not allowed to officiate at
                    the altar there, were permitted to share the priests’ portion along with their
                    brethren, while those of the latter were put to death (2 Kings xxiii. 8, 20). As
                    for the altars built upon the high places, their construe tion appears to have
                    been regulated by the law provided for the case in Ex. xx. 24, 25; very often
                    <hi rend="italic">ma&lt;χeboth</hi> or pillars were erected beside them (see Ex.
                    xxiv. 4; Josh, xxiv. 26; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Isa. xix. 19; Hosea iii. 4);
                    and sometimes they were enclosed in “houses” or “temples” (1 Kings xii. 31,
                    xiii. 32; Amos vii. 13). For the bearing of the facts contained <pb break="no"
