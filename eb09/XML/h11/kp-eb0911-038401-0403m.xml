                    market-town of England, in the northern division of the West Riding of
                    Yorkshire, is situated on a gentle acclivity almost surrounded by hills, on the
                    small river Hebble near its junction with the Calder, 7 miles south-west of
                    Bradford. Originally its streets were narrow and irregular, but many of the
                    older houses have been pulled down and new streets opened up, while the constant
                    additions made to it through the rapid increase of population have completely
                    changed its appearance. The principal buildings are the parish church of St

                    the People’s Park, 12 j acres, laid out in a highly ornamental style from the
                    designs of Sir Joseph Paxton, and presented to the town in 1858 by Sir Francis

                    fine structure of iron, spans the Hebble valley in two arches. Halifax derives
                    its importance from its manufactures of cloth, which began in the 15th century.
                    It ranks in Yorkshire with Leeds, Bradford, and Huddersfield as a seat of the
                    woollen and worsted manufacture. The principal staples are carpets, cashmeres,
                    Orleanses, coburgs, merinoes, lastings, alpacas, damasks, baizes, broad and
                    narrow cloths, kerseymeres, blankets, muslin-de-laines, shalloons, and figured
                    vestings. A considerable number of persons are employed in irom works, machine
                    works, and chemical works, and in the <pb break="no"

                    borough sends two members to parliament. The parish is the largest in Great
                    Britain, embracing 79,200 acres. The population of the municipal and
                    parliamentary borough in 1861 was 37,014, and in 1871 (with an extended area of
                    3704 acres) 65,510.</p>
                <p>Two derivations are given for the name Halifax. According to Camden it means
                    “holy hair,” and he accounts for the origin of the name from the fact that the
                    head of a virgin who had been murdered by a wicked clerk was suspended on a tree
                    in the neighbourhood, which came to be much resorted to by pilgrims. According
                    to another account, the name means “holy face,” and is derived from an image of
                    St John once preserved in a neighbouring hermitage. The first mention of the
                    town is in the 12th century, when its church was granted by William, earl of
                    Warren, to the priory of Lewes in Sussex. When its manufactures commenced in the
                    beginning of the 15th century the number of its houses was only 15, but they had
                    increased in 1540 to 520. It is said to have received a considerable accession
                    to its inhabitants and impulse to its prosperity from the merchants who fled
                    from the Netherlands to escape the persecution carried out under the auspices of
                    the duke of Alva. In 1642 it was garrisoned by the forces of the parliament, and
                    near it at a place still called the Bloody Field an engagement took place
                    between them and the royalists. In the forest of Hardwick, then coextensive with
                    the parish of Halifax, there at one time existed a custom called the “Gibbet
                    Law, ’’ according to which any person suspected to be in the unlawful possession
                    of goods to the value of 13⅛d. was tried by the frith-burghers of the liberty,
                    and if condemned was executed on a market day by a kind of axe resembling the
                    modern guillotine. The last execution took place in 1650. A number of eminent
                    men have been born in the town or neighbourhood of Halifax, including the
                    mathematician Henry Briggs, Archbishop Tillotson, Sir Henry Savile, and John
                    Foster. Daniel Defoe resided for some time in the town.</p>
