                    an American statesman and orator, was born at Studley, Hanover county, Virginia,
                    May 29, 1736, the second son in a family of nine children. His father, John
                    Henry, an emigrant from Aberdeen, Scotland, was a nephew of Robertson the
                    historian, and had risen to some eminence in the county, filling the offices of
                    surveyor and presiding magistrate. Patrick Henry was educated at a little school
                    near his home; and, after the age of ten, by his father, who had opened a
                    grammar school at his residence. In early life he showed no marked proficiency
                    in his studies, except perhaps in mathematics, but was noted chiefly for a love
                    of outdoor sports. At fifteen he became clerk in a country store; and at sixteen
                    he entered into partnership as storekeeper with his elder brother, but the
                    business was unsuccessful, and a second attempt at storekeeping ended likewise
                    in failure. Meanwhile the indifference to learning which marked his boyhood was
                    replaced by a love of history, especially that of Greece and Rome; and his
                    habitual indolence was overcome by his admiration for Livy, whose history he
                    thenceforth read through once every year. At twenty-four, by his admission to
                    the bar, Henry entered on the career that eventually brought him fame and
                    fortune, although his income for some years was in keeping with his lack of
                    previous preparation. At twenty-seven he won his first triumph, as counsel for
                    the collector of the county, in what became known as “the parson’s cause.”· His
                    unexpected display of eloquence on the side of the people procured him an
                    extravagant recognition and the title of “the orator of nature.” Business poured
                    in upon him, his popularity concealing his deficiencies; and his success was
                    assured. In 1765 he was elected to the House of Burgesses, where he
                    distinguished himself as the author of certain resolutions against the Stamp
                    Act, the last of which,—providing that “the General Assembly of this colony have
                    the sole right and power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants of
                    this colony,”—though passed by a majority of only one, was the key-note of the
                    struggle for independence. In 1769 he was admitted to practice in the general
                    court, where he attained eminence in criminal cases before juries. In 1773 he
                    was a member of the “committee of correspondence for the dissemination of
                    intelligence between the colonies.” In the following year he was chosen delegate
                    to the Virginia convention, which was the first public assembly to recommend an
                    annual “General Congress,” and bo the “Old Continental Congress ”; but his
                    success there as an orator failed to conceal his defects as a practical
                    statesman. In 1775, in the Virginia convention, he delivered a remarkable speech
                    in moving that the “colony be immediately put in a state of defence,” and at the
                    head of a body of militia he forced the royal officials to pay £330 for powder
                    clandestinely removed by order of Governor Dunmore. He was appointed by the
                    convention colonel of the first regiment and commander of all the forces to be
                    raised in Virginia, but a misunderstanding with the “committee of safety” led to
                    his resignation. He was a member of the second Continental Congress of 1775, and
                    of the Virginia convention of 1776, which had been elected “to take care of the
                    republic,” the royal governor having fled. They framed a new constitution, and
                    elected Henry the first republican governor, on the first ballot. He was
                    re-elected in 1777 and 1778. In 1780 he became a member of the legislature,
                    where he continued until he was again elected governor in 1784. In 1786 he
                    withdrew through the pressure of debt, having “never been in easy
                    circumstances.” In 1787 he was chosen a delegate to the “Federal Constitutional
                    Convention,'’ but did not attend. He had resumed his practice to better his
                    fortunes. In 1788 he was a delegate to the Virginia convention for ratifying the
                    Federal Constitution, which he vehemently <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0710-0677"/> opposed as dangerous to the liberties of the
                    country. In 1791 he declined re-election to the legislature, continuing,
                    “through necessity rather than choice,” the practice of the law, but usually in
                    great and remunerative cases only. Finally, in 1794, having not only paid his
                    debts but secured affluence, he withdrew to private life. In 1795 he declined
                    the position of secretary of state in Washington’s cabinet, in 1796 the
                    nomination for governor of Virginia, and in 1797 the mission to France, offered
                    by President Adams. In 1799, however, he suffered himself to be elected to the
                    State legislature, where he wished to oppose what he deemed the dangerous
                    doctrine of the Virginia resolutions of 1798; but he did not take his seat, his
                    death occurring on the 6th June. Henry’s manners were plain, his temper
                    cheerful, and his habits temperate. His eloquence, of which some fragmentary
                    specimens have become household words among his countrymen, was vivid and
                    startling. Almost entirely a gift of nature, it was equal to every occasion,
                    and, with the aid of a clear voice and perfect articulation, it was of
                    marvellous power in bringing his hearers to a quick decision.</p>
