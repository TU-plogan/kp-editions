                    (1776-1841), was born of cultured parents at Oldenburg in 1776. He showed his
                    bent towards philosophy while still a child, and after studying under Fichte at
                    Jena gave his first philosophical lectures at Göttingen in 1805, whence he
                    removed in 1809 to occupy the chair formerly held by Kant at Königsberg. Here he
                    also established and conducted a seminary of paedagogy till 1833, when he
                    returned once more to Göttingen, and remained there as professor of philosophy
                    till his death in 1841. His works were collected and published in twelve volumes
                    by his disciple Hartenstein (Leipsic, 1850-52).</p>
                <p>Philosophy, according to Herbart, begins with reflexion upon our empirical
                    conceptions, and consists in the reformation and elaboration of these,—its three
                    primary divisions being determined by as many distinct forms of elaboration.
                    Logic, which stands first, has to render our conceptions and the judgments and
                    reasonings arising from them clear and distinct. But some conceptions are such
                    that the more distinct they are made the more contradictory their elements
                    become; so to change and supplement these as to make them at length thinkable is
                    the problem of the second part of philosophy, or Metaphysics. There is still a
                    class of conceptions requiring more than a logical treatment, but differing from
                    the last in not involving latent contradictions, and in being independent of the
                    reality of their objects, the conceptions, viz., that embody our judgments of
                    approval and disapproval; the philosophic treatment of these conceptions falls
                    to Aesthetic.</p>
                <p>In Herbart’s writings logic receives comparatively meagre notice; he insisted
                    strongly on its purely formal character, and expressed himself in the main at
                    one with Kantians such as Fries and Krag.</p>
                <p>As a metaphysician he starts from what he terms “the higher scepticism” of the
                    Hume-Kantian sphere of thought, the beginnings of which he discerns in Locke’s
                    perplexity about the idea of substance. By this scepticism the real validity of
                    even the <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> of experience is called in question on
                    account of the contradictions they are found to involve. And yet that these
                    forms are “given” to us, as truly as sensations are, follows beyond doubt when
                    we consider that we are as little able to control the one as the other. To
                    attempt at this stage a psychological inquiry into the origin of these
                    conceptions would be doubly a mistake; for we should have to use these
                    unlegitimated conceptions in the course of it, and the task of clearing up their
                    contradictions would still remain, whether we succeeded in our inquiry or not.
                    But how are we to set about this task? We have given to us a conception A
                    uniting among its constituent marks two that prove to be contradictory, say M
                    and N; and we can neither deny the unity nor reject one of the contradictory
                    members. For to do either is forbidden by experience; and yet to do nothing is
                    forbidden by logic. We are thus driven to the assumption that the conception is
                    contradictory because incomplete; but how are we to supplement it? What we have
                    must point the way to what we want, or our procedure will be arbitrary.
                    Experience asserts that M is the same <hi rend="italic">(he.,</hi> a mark of the
                    same concept) as N, while logic denies it; and so—it being impossible for one
                    and the same M to sustain these contradictory positions—there is but one way
                    open to us; we must posit <hi rend="italic">several</hi> Ms. But even now we
                    cannot say one of these Ms is the same as N, another is not; for every M must be
                    both thinkable and valid. We may, however, take the Ms not singly but together;
                    and again, no other course being open to us, this is what we must do; we must
                    assume that N results from a combination of Ms. This is Herbart’s .method of
                    relations, the counterpart in his system of the Hegelian dialectic.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Ontology</hi> this method is employed to determine what
                    in reality corresponds to the empirical conceptions of substance and cause, or
                    rather of inherence and change. But first we must analyse this notion of reality
                    itself, to which our scepticism had already led us, for, though we could doubt
                    whether “the given” is what it appears, we cannot doubt that it is something;
                    the conception of the real thus consists of the two conceptions of being and
                    quality. That which we are compelled to “posit,” which cannot be sublated, is
                    that which <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> and in the recognition of this lies the
                    simple conception of being. But when is a thing thus posited? When it is posited
                    as we are wont to posit the things we see and taste and handle. If we were
                    without sensations, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> were never bound against our
                    will to endure the persistence of a presentation, we should never know what
                    being is. Keeping fast hold of this idea of absolute position, Herbart leads us
                    next to the quality of the real. (1) This must exclude everything negative; for
                    non-A sublates instead of positing, and is not absolute, but relative to A. (2)
                    The real must be absolutely simple; for if it contain two determinations<pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n752/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0752-0719"/>, A and B, then either these are reducible to
                    one, which is the true quality, or they are not, when each is conditioned by the
                    other and their position is no longer absolute. (3) All quantitative conceptions
                    are excluded, for quantity implies parts, and these are incompatible with
                    simplicity. (4) But there may be a plurality of “reals,” albeit the mere
                    conception of being can tell us nothing as to this. The doctrine here developed
                    is the first cardinal point of Herbart’s system, and has obtained for it the
                    name of “pluralistic realism.”</p>
                <p>The contradictions he finds in the common-sense conception of inherence, or of “a
                    thing with several attributes,” will now become obvious. Let us take some thing,
                    say A, having <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attributes, <hi rend="italic">a, b, c .
                        .</hi>.: we are forced to posit each of these because each is presented in
                    intuition. But in conceiving A we make, not <hi rend="italic">n</hi> positions,
                    still less <hi rend="italic">n</hi> +1 positions, but one position simply; for
                    common sense removes the absolute position from its original source, sensation.
                    So when we ask, What is the one posited? we are told—the possessor of <hi
                        rend="italic">a, b, c . . . , or</hi> in other words, their seat or
                    substance. But if so, then A, as a real, being simple, must = <hi rend="italic"
                        >a;</hi> similarly it must = <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; and so on. Now this
                    would be possible if <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">c . . .</hi> were but “contingent aspects” of A, as <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, √6 4, 4 -I- 3 +1
                    are contingent aspects of 8. Such, of course, is not the case, and so we have as
                    many contradictions as there are attributes; for we must say A is <hi
                        rend="italic">a,</hi> is not <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                        >b,</hi> is not <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> &amp;c. There must then, according
                    to the method of relations, be several As. For <hi rend="italic">à</hi> let us
                    assume A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + A <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. . .; for <hi rend="italic">b, A,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     subscript"> 2</hi> + A <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 2</hi> + A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. . .; and so on for the rest. But
                    now what relation can there be among these several As, which will restore to us
                    the unity of our original A or substance? There is but one; we must assume that
                    the first A of every series is identical, just as the centre is the same point
                    in every radius. By way of concrete illustration Herbart instances “the common
                    observation that the properties of things exist only under external conditions.
                    Bodies, we say, are coloured, but colour is nothing without light, and nothing
                    without eyes.. They sound, but only in a vibrating medium, and for healthy ears.
                    Colour and tone present the appearance of inherence, but on looking closer we
                    find they are not really immanent in things but rather presuppose a communion
                    among several.” The result then is briefly thus :—In place of the one absolute
                    position, which in some unthinkable way the common understanding substitutes for
                    the absolute positions of the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attributes, we have
                    really a series of two or more positions for each attribute, every series,
                    however, beginning with the same (as it were, central) real (hence the unity of
                    substance in a group of attributes), but each being continued by different reals
                    (hence the plurality and difference of attributes in unity of substance). Where
                    there is the appearance of inherence, therefore, there is always a plurality of
                    reals; no such correlative to substance as attribute or accident can be admitted
                    at all. Substantiality is impossible without causality, and to this as its true
                    correlative we now turn.</p>
                <p>The'common-sense conception of change involves at bottom the same contradiction
                    of opposing qualities in one real. The same A that was <hi rend="italic">a,b,c .
                        .</hi>. becomes <hi rend="italic">a,b,d . . .</hi>; and this, which
                    experience thrusts upon us, proves on reflexion unthinkable. The metaphysical
                    supplementing is also fundamentally as before. Since c depended on a series of
                    reals A <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + A <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + A <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. . . in connexion with A, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >d</hi> may be said similarly to depend on a series <hi rend="italic"
                        >A</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> + A <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    + A <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. . ∙., then the change from <hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi> to <hi rend="italic">d</hi> means, not that the central real A or
                    any real has changed, but that A is now in connexion with A <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 4</hi>, &amp;c., and no longer in connexion with A <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi>, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>But to think a number of reals “in connexion” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Zusammensein)</hi> will not suffice as an explanation of phenomena;
                    something or other must happen when they are in connexion; what is it? The
                    answer to this question is the second hinge-point of Herbart’s theoretical
                    philosophy. What “actually happens” as distinct from all that seems to happen,
                    when two reals A and B are together is that, assuming them to differ in quality,
                    they tend to disturb each other to the extent of that difference,, at the same
                    time that each preserves itself intact by resisting, as it were, the other’s
                    disturbance. And so by coming into connexion with different reals the
                    “self-preservations” of A will vary accordingly, A remaining the same through
                    all; just as, by way of illustration, hydrogen remains the same in water and in
                    ammonia, or as the same line may be now a normal and now a tangent. But to
                    indicate this opposition in the qualities of the reals A + B, we must substitute
                    for these symbols others, which, though only “contingent aspects” of A and B,
                        <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> representing their relations, not themselves,
                    yet like similar devices in mathematics enable thought to advance. Thus we may
                    put A = α + β - γ, B=τn ⅛ n + γ; γ then represents the character of the
                    self-preservations in this case, and <hi rend="italic">a+ β + m + n</hi>
                    represents all that could be observed by a spectator who did not know the simple
                    qualities, but was himself involved in the relations of A to B; and such is
                    exactly our position.</p>
                <p>Haying thus determined what really is and what actually happens, our philosopher
                    proceeds next to explain synthetically the objective semblance <hi rend="italic"
                        >(der</hi><hi rend="italic">objective Schein)</hi> that results from these.
                    But if this construction is to be truly objective, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    valid for all intelligences, ontology must furnish us with a clue. This we have
                    in the forms of Space, Time, and Motion which are involved whenever we think the
                    reals as being in, or coming into, connexion, and the opposite. These forms then
                    cannot be merely the products of our psychological mechanism, though they may
                    turn out to coincide with these. Meanwhile let us call them “intelligible,” as
                    being valid for all who comprehend the real and actual by thought, although no
                    such forms are predicable of the real and actual themselves. The elementary
                    spatial relation Herbart conceives to be “the contiguity <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Aneinander)</hi> of two points,” so that every “pure and independent line”
                    is discrete. But an investigation of dependent lines which are often
                    incommensurable forces us to adopt the contradictory fiction of partially
                    overlapping, i. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi>, divisible points, or in other words,
                    the conception of Continuity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Hence Herbart gives the name Synechology to this branch
                            o£ metaphysics, instead of the usual one, Cosmology.</p></note> But the
                    contradiction here is one we cannot eliminate by the method of relations,
                    because it doesnot involve anything real; and in fact as a necessary outcome of
                    an “intelligible” form, the fiction of continuity is valid for the “objective
                    semblance,” and no more to be discarded than say √ - 1. By its help we are
                    enabled to comprehend what actually happens among reals to produce the
                    appearance of matter. When three or more reals are together, each disturbance
                    and self-preservation will (in general) be imperfect, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> of less intensity than when only two reals are together. But
                    “objective semblance” corresponds with reality; the spatial or external
                    relations of the reals in this case must, therefore, tally with their inner or
                    actual states. Had the self-preservations been perfect, the coincidence in space
                    would have been complete, and the group of reals would have been inextended; or
                    had the several reals been simply contiguous, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    without connexion, then, as nothing would actually have happened, nothing would
                    appear. As it is we shall find a continuous molecule manifesting attractive and
                    repulsive forces; attraction corresponding to the tendency of the
                    self-preservations to become perfect, repulsion to the frustration of this.
                    Motion, even more evidently than space, implicates the contradictory conception
                    of continuity, and cannot, therefore, be a real predicate, though valid as an
                    intelligible form and necessary to the comprehension of the objective semblance.
                    For we have to think of the reals as absolutely independent and yet as entering
                    into connexions. This we can only do by conceiving them as originally moving
                    through intelligible space in rectilinear paths and with uniform velocities. For
                    such motion no cause need be supposed; motion, in fact, is no more a state of
                    the moving real than rest is, both alike being but relations, with which,
                    therefore, the real has no concern. The changes in this motion, however, for
                    which we <hi rend="italic">should</hi> require a cause, would be the objective
                    semblance of the self-preservations that actually occur when reals meet.
                    Further, by means of such motion these actual occurrences, which are in
                    themselves timeless, fall for an observer in a definite time—a time which
                    becomes continuous through the partial coincidence of events.</p>
                <p>But in all this it has been assumed that we are spectators of the objective
                    semblance; it remains to make good this assumption, or, in other words, to show
                    the possibility of knowledge; this is the problem of what Herbart terms
                    Eidolology, and forms the transition from metaphysic to psychology. Here, again,
                    a contradictory conception blocks the way, that, viz., of the Ego as the
                    identity of knowing and being, and as such the stronghold of idealism. The
                    contradiction becomes more evident when the ego is defined to be a subject (and
                    so a real) that is its own object. As real and not merely formal, this
                    conception of the ego is amenable to the method of relations. The solution this
                    method furnishes is summarily that there are several objects which mutually
                    modify each other, and so constitute that ego we take for the presented real.
                    But to explain this modification is the business of psychology; it is enough now
                    to see that the subject like all reals is necessarily unknown, and that,
                    therefore, the idealist’s theory of knowledge is unsound. But though the simple
                    quality of the subject or soul is beyond knowledge, we know what actually·
                    happens when it is in connexion with other’s reals, for its self-preservations
                    then are what we call sensations. And these sensations are the sole material of
                    our knowledge; but they are not given to us as a chaos but in definite groups
                    and series, whence we come to know the relations of those reals, which, though
                    themselves unknown, our sensations compel us to posit absolutely.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Psychology</hi> Herbart rejects altogether the doctrine
                    of mental faculties as one refuted by his metaphysics, and tries toshow that all
                    psychical phenomena whatever result from the action and interaction of
                    elementary ideas or presentations (<hi rend="italic">Vorstellungen).</hi> The
                    soul being one and simple, its separate acts of self-preservation or primary
                    presentations must be simple too, and its several presentations must become
                    united together. And this they can do at once and completely when, as is the
                    case, for example, -with the several attributes of an object, they are not of
                    opposite quality. But otherwise there ensues a conflict in which the opposed
                    presentations comport themselves like forces and mutually suppress or obscure
                    each other. The act of presentation <hi rend="italic">(Vorstellen)</hi> then <pb

                    and its product, the idea, becomes in the same proportion less and less intense
                    till a position of equilibrium is reached; and then at length the remainders
                    coalesce. We have thus a statics-and a mechanics of mind which investigate
                    respectively the conditions of equilibrium and of movement among presentations.
                    In the statics two magnitudes have to be determined :—(1) the amount of the
                    suppression or inhibition <hi rend="italic">{Hcmmιιngssumme),</hi> and (2) the
                    ratio in which this is shared among the opposing presentations. The first must
                    obviously be as small as possible: thus for two totally-opposed presentations
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> of which <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> is the greater, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >inhibendum</hi><hi rend="italic">= b.</hi> For a given degree of opposition
                    this burden will be shared between the conflicting presentations in the inverse
                    ratio of theiι <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> strength. When its remainder after
                    inhibition = 0, a presentation is said to be on the threshold of consciousness,
                    for on a small diminution of the inhibition the “effort” will become actual
                    presentation in the same proportion. Such total exclusion from consciousness is,
                    however, manifestly impossible with only two presentations, <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> though with three or a greater number the
                    residual value of one may even be negative. The first and simplest law in
                    psychological mechanics relates to the “sinking” of inhibited presentations. As
                    the presentations yield to the pressure, the pressure itself diminishes, so that
                    the velocity of sinking decreases, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> we have the
                    equation, (S — &lt;r) <hi rend="italic">dt = dσ,</hi> where <hi rend="italic"
                        >S</hi> is the total <hi rend="italic">inhibendum,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">σ</hi> the intensity actually in-</p>
                <p>g hibited after the time <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> Hence <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    = log -—, and <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> = S (1 - «*')· b — O <hi
                        rend="superscript"> r</hi></p>
                <p>From this law it follows, for example, that equilibrium is never quite obtained
                    for those presentations which continue above the threshold of consciousness,
                    while the rest which cannot so continue are very speedily driven beyond the
                    threshold. More important is the law according to which a presentation freed
                    from inhibition and rising anew into consciousness tends to raise the other
                    presentations with which it is combined. Suppose two presentations <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> and fl-united by the residua <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi>; then the amount of p’s “help” to π is <hi
                        rend="italic">r,</hi> the portion of which appropriated by π is given by the
                    ratio <hi rend="italic">p: π</hi>; and thus the initial help is —.</p>
                <p>ιr</p>
                <p>But after a time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> when a portion of <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> represented by <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> has been actually brought
                    into consciousness, the help afforded in the next instant will be found by the
                    equation</p>
                <p>To p — ω</p>
                <p>— · <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> —dt≈dω, ΊΓ p from which by integration we have
                    the value of ω, -√l--≡)∙</p>
                <p>So that if there are several πs connected with <hi rend="italic">p</hi> by
                    smaller and smaller parts, there will be a definite “serial” order in which they
                    will be revived by <hi rend="italic">p</hi>; and on this fact Herbart rests all
                    the phenomena of the so-called faculty of memory, the development of spatial and
                    temporal forms, and much besides. Emotions and volitions, he holds, are not
                    directly self-preservations of the soul, as our presentations are, but variable
                    states of such presentations resulting from their interaction when above the
                    threshold of consciousness. Thus when some presentations tend to force a
                    presentation into consciousness, and others at the same time tend to drive it
                    out, that presentation is the seat of painful feeling; when, on the other hand,
                    its entrance is favoured by all, pleasure results. Desires are presentations
                    struggling into consciousness against hindrances, and when accompanied by the
                    supposition of success become volitions. Transcendental freedom of will in
                    Kant’s sense is an impossibility. Self-consciousness is the result of an
                    interaction essentially the same in kind as that which takes place when a
                    comparatively simple presentation finds the field of consciousness occupied by a
                    long-formed and well-consolidated “mass” of presentations—as, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> one’s business or garden, the theatre, &amp;c., which promptly
                    inhibit the isolated presentation if incongruent, and unite it to themselves if
                    not. What we call Self is, above all, such a central mass, and Herbart seeks to
                    show with great ingenuity and detail how this position is occupied at first
                    chiefly by the body, then by the seat of ideas and desires, and finally by that
                    first-personal Self which recollects the past and resolves concerning the
                    future. But at any stage the actual constituents of this “complexion ’ are
                    variable; the concrete presentation of Self is never twice the same. And,
                    therefore, finding on reflexion any particular concrete factor contingent, we
                    abstract the position from that which occupies it, and so reach the speculative
                    notion of the pure Eg»·</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aesthctics</hi> elaborates the “ideas” involved in the
                    expression of taste called forth by those relations of object which acquire for
                    them the attribution of beauty or the reverse. The beautiful (καλόν) is to be
                    carefully distinguished from the allied conceptions of the useful and the
                    pleasant, which vary with time, place, and person; whereas beauty is predicated
                    absolutely and involuntarily by all who have attained the right standpoint.
                    Ethics, which is but one branch of aesthetics, although the chief, deals with
                    such relations among volitions (<hi rend="italic">lVillensverhdltnisse)</hi> as
                    thus unconditionally please or displease. These relations Herbart finds to be
                    reducible to five, which do not admit of further simplification; and
                    corresponding to them are as many moral ideas <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Mτιsterbegriffe),</hi> viz. :— (I) <hi rend="italic">Internal
                        Freedom,</hi> the underlying relation being that of the individual’s will to
                    his judgment of it; (2) <hi rend="italic">Perfection,</hi> the relation being
                    that of his several volitions to each other in respect of intensity, variety,
                    and concentration; (3) <hi rend="italic">Benevolence,</hi> the relation being
                    that between his own will and the thought of another’s; (4) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Right,</hi> in case of actual conflict with another; and (5) <hi
                        rend="italic">Retribution</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Equity,</hi> for
                    intended good or evil done. The ideas of a final society, a system of rewards
                    and punishments, a system of administration, a system of culture, and a
                    “unanimated society,” corresponding to the ideas of law, equity, benevolence,
                    perfection, and internal freedom respectively, result when we take account of a
                    number of individuals. Virtue is the perfeet conformity of the will with the
                    moral ideas; of this the single virtues are but special expressions. The
                    conception of duty arises from the existence of hindrances to the attainment of
                    virtue. A general scheme of principles of conduct is possible, but the
                    subsumption of special cases under these must remain matter of tact. The
                    application of ethics to things as they are with a view to the realization of
                    the moral ideas is moral technology <hi rend="italic">{Tugendlehre),</hi> of
                    which the chief divisions are Paedagogy and Politics.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Theology</hi> Herbart held the argument from design to be as
                    valid for divine activity as for human, and to justify the belief in a
                    supersensible real, concerning which, however, exact knowledge is neither
                    attainable nor on practical grounds desirable.</p>
                <p>Among the post-Kantian philosophers Herbart doubtless ranks next to Hegel in
                    importance, and this without taking into account his very great contributions to
                    the science of education. His disciples speak of theirs as the “exact
                    philosophy,” and the term well expresses their master’s chief excellence and the
                    character of the chief influence he has exerted upon succeeding thinkers of his
                    own and other schools. His criticisms are worth more than his constructions;
                    indeed for exactness and penetration of thought he is quite on a level with Hume
                    and Kant. His merits in this respect, however, can only be appraised by the
                    study of his works at first hand. But we are most of all indebted to Herbart for
                    the enormous advance psychology has been enabled to make, thanks to his fruitful
                    treatment of it, albeit as yet but few among the many who have appropriated and
                    improved his materials have ventured to adopt his metaphysical and mathematical
                    foundations. (J. W.*)</p>
