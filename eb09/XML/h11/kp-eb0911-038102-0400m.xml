                    estate. His paternal grandfather was a rich clothier of Wotton-under-Edge; on
                    his mother’s side he was connected with the noble family of the Poyntzes of
                    Acton. Both his parents having died before he was five years old, the future
                    chief-justice was placed by his guardian under the care of Mr Staunton, vicar of
                    Wotton-under-Edge, through whose influence he became strongly imbued with
                    puritanical principles. There he remained till he attained his sixteenth year,
                    when he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, under the tuition of the puritanical but
                    learned Obadiah Sedgwick. At Oxford Hale devoted himself for several terms to
                    the study of Aristotle and Calvin with a view to holy orders, and manifested
                    that steadiness and application which in after years secured his reputation and
                    advancement. But suddenly there came a change. The diligent student, at first
                    attracted by a company of strolling players, threw aside his studies, and
                    plunged carelessly into gay society. He soon decided to change his profession;
                    and resolved to trail a pike as a soldier under the prince of Orange in the Low
                    Countries. Before going abroad, however, Hale found himself obliged to proceed
                    to London in order to give instructions for his defence in a legal action which
                    threatened to deprive him of his patrimony. His leading counsel was the
                    celebrated Serjeant Glanville, who, perceiving in the acuteness and sagacity of
                    his youthful client a peculiar fitness for the legal profession, succeeded, with
                    much difficulty, in inducing him to renounce his military for a legal career,
                    and on the 8th November 1629 Hale became a member of the honourable society of
                    Lincoln’s Inn.</p>
                <p>He immediately resumed his habits of intense application. The rules which he laid
                    down for himself, and which are still extant in his handwriting, prescribe
                    sixteen hours a day of close application, and prove, not only the great mental
                    power, but also the extraordinary physical strength he must have possessed, and
                    for which indeed, during his residence at the university, he had been
                    remarkable. During the period allotted to his preliminary studies, he read over
                    and over again all the year-books, reports, and law treatises in print, and at
                    the Tower of London and other antiquarian repositories examined and carefully
                    studied the records from the foundation of the English monarchy down to his own
                    time. Even the common-place book which he composed as the result of his study
                    and research may, according to Lord Campbell, “be considered a <hi rend="italic"
                    >corpus juris</hi> embracing and methodizing all that an English lawyer on any
                    emergency could desire to know.” But Hale did not confine himself to law. He
                    dedicated no small portion of his time to the study of pure mathematics, to
                    investigations in physics and chemistry, and even to anatomy and architecture;
                    and there can be no doubt that this varied learning enhanced considerably the
                    value of many of his judicial decisions.</p>
                <p>Hale was called to the bar in 1637, and almost at once found himself in full
                    practice. Though neither a fluent speaker nor bold pleader, in a very few years
                    he was at the head of his profession. He entered public life at perhaps the most
                    critical period of English history. Two parties were contending in the state,
                    and their obstinacy could not fail to produce a most direful collision. But
                    amidst the confusion Hale steered a middle course, rising in reputation, and an
                    object of solicitation from both parties. Taking Pomponius Atticus as his
                    political model, he was persuaded that a man, a lawyer, and a judge could best
                    serve his country and benefit his countrymen by holding aloof from partisanship
                    and its violent prejudices, which are so apt to distort and confuse the
                    judgment. But he is best vindicated from the charges of selfishness and
                    cowardice by the thoughts and meditations contained in his private diaries and
                    papers, where the purity and honour of his motives are clearly seen. It has been
                    said, but without certainty, that Hale was engaged as counsel for the earl of
                    Strafford; he certainly acted for Archbishop Laud, Lord Maguire, Christopher
                    Love, the duke of Hamilton, and others. It is also said that he was ready to
                    plead on the side of Charles I. had that monarch submitted to the court. The
                    parliament having gained the ascendency, Hale signed the Solemn League and
                    Covenant, and was a member of the famous Assembly of Divines at Westminster in
                    1644; but although he would undoubtedly have preferred a Presbyterian form of
                    church government, he had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n401/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0401-0382"/> no serious objection to the system of modified
                    Episcopacy proposed by Ussher. Consistently with his desire to remain neutral,
                    Hale took the engagement to the Commonwealth as he had done to the king, and in
                    1653, already serjeant, he became a judge in the Court of Common Fleas. Two
                    years afterwards he sat in Cromwell’s parliament as one of the members for
                    Gloucestershire. After the death of the Protector, however, he declined to act
                    as a judge under Richard Cromwell, although he represented Oxford in Richard’s
                    parliament. At the Restoration in 1660 Hale was very graciously received by
                    Charles II., and in the same year was appointed chief baron of the exchequer,
                    and accepted, with extreme reluctance, the honour of knighthood. After holding
                    the office of chief baron for eleven years he was raised to the higher dignity
                    of lord chief-justice, which he held till February 1676, when his failing health
                    compelled him to resign. He retired to his native Alderley, where he died on
                    December 25th of the same year. He was twice married, and survived all his ten
                    children save two.</p>
                <p>As a judge, Sir Matthew Hale discharged his duties with resolute independence and
                    careful diligence. Lord Campbell says of him that “he is certainly to be
                    considered the most eminent judge who ever filled the office [of chief baron];
                    and being promoted to be chief-justice of England, he gave new dignity to the
                    supreme magistracy which had been illustrated by Gascoigne, by Fortescue, and by
                    Coke.” His sincere piety made him the intimate friend of Barrow, Tillotson,
                    Wilkins, and Stillingfleet, as well as of the Nonconformist leader Baxter. He is
                    chargeable, however, with the condemnation and execution of two poor women tried
                    before him for witchcraft in 1664, a kind of judicial murder then falling under
                    disuse. He is also reproached with having hastened the execution of a soldier
                    for whom he had reason to believe a pardon was preparing.</p>
                <p>Of Hale’s legal works the only two of importance are his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia Placitorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Coronae,</hi><hi rend="italic">or

                    left his valuable collection of MSS. and records to the library of Lincoln’s
                    Inn. His life has been written by Burnet, 1682; by Williams, 1835; by Roscoe, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Lives of Eminent Lawyers,</hi> in 1838; and by Lord
