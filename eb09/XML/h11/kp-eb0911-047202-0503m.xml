                    as Novalis, was born on his father’s estate in the county of Mansfeld, in
                    Prussian Saxony, May 2, 1772. He was of a shy, retiring, and thoughtful
                    disposition, and was deeply influenced by his parents, who were strict members
                    of the sect of Moravian Brethren. After attending the gymnasium of Eisleben he
                    went as a youth of eighteen to the university of Jena, where he studied
                    philosophy, mathematics, and the natural sciences. There he was treated with
                    great kindness by Schiller, of whom he was a warm admirer. He studied law in
                    Leipsic and Wittenberg, and in 1794 settled for a time in Teunstädt in order
                    to-perfect himself in the practical work of the legal profession. During his
                    residence in Tennstädt he formed a passionate attachment to Sophie von Kühn, a
                    beautiful but delicate girl of thirteen, and with her consent obtained a promise
                    from her parents that when she reached womanhood she should become his wife. In
                    1795 he was made auditor at the salt-works of Weissenfels, where his father was
                    director. Two years afterwards his betrothed died, and for some time he seemed
                    to be broken-hearted and to have lost all interest in life. In a few months,
                    however, he went to the academy of mines at Freiberg, where he studied with a
                    view to a higher appointment in connexion with the salt-works; and in the midst
                    of his studies he became engaged for a second time, and was again able to look
                    forward to a happy and useful career. He returned to Weissenfels in 1799, and
                    was associated as assessor with the directorate of the salt-works. As he was
                    preparing for his marriage in the autumn of 1800 he was alarmed by the sudden
                    appearance of blood from the lungs. The wedding was postponed, and although he
                    believed to the end that his recovery was certain, the disease made rapid
                    progress, and he died on the 25th of March 1801. He was of a tall, slight, and
                    graceful figure, with light brown hair and hazel eyes, and a face expressive of
                    a calm, gentle, and meditative spirit. After his death his writings were issued
                    in two volumes by his friends Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel, and were
                    rapidly recognized as important contributions to German literature. They are for
                    the most part composed of fragments, of which the chief is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heinrich von Ofterdingen,</hi> an unfinished romance. Hardenberg is often
                    spoken of as “the prophet of the Romantic school;” and the phrase sufficiently
                    marks his leading peculiarities. He took no part in the literary warfare carried
                    on by his friends, but he shared to the full their strongest sympathies. Like
                    them he intensely disliked those “enlightened” writers of the 18th century who
                    had claimed to say the last word about human life through mere logic; he was
                    penetrated by the conviction that there are elements in the world which cannot
                    be grasped by the understanding, and which must be felt rather than reasoned
                    about. Although he was fond of science and history, he moved most freely in the
                    borderland between religion, philosophy, and poetry; and his prose writings are
                    full of sayings which, although not easily intelligible, are impressive and
                    stimulating. His diction is often simple and unostentatious, but it is rendered
                    difficult both by the abstruseness of his themes and the remoteness of his
                    allusions. As a poet he lacked definiteness of conception; his lyrics, however,
                    especially those of a religious nature, have a certain tender beauty which gives
                    them high rank in the serious literature of Germany. They are marked by deep
                    feeling and by sweetness and grace of expression. He himself regarded a series
                    of <hi rend="italic">Hymns to Night</hi> as his best achievement, but it is in
                    <hi rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen</hi> that the majority of his
                    admirers find the fullest utterance of his mystic aspirations, his passion for
                    spiritual beauty, and his idealist philosophy.</p>
