                    rend="smallcaps">Fromental</hi> (1799-1862), a celebrated French musician, was
                    born May 27, 1799, at Paris. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire under Berton
                    and Cherubini, and in 1819 gained the grand prix de Rome with a cantata called
                    <hi rend="italic">Herminie.</hi> In accordance with the conditions of his
                    scholarship he started for Rome, where he devoted himself to the study of
                    Italian music, and wrote an opera and various minor works. His first opera
                    produced in Paris after his return from Italy was called <hi rend="italic">H
                    Artisan,</hi> which saw the light at the Théâtre Feydeau in 1827, apparently
                    without much success. Other works of minor importance, and now forgotten,
                    followed, amongst which only a ballet named <hi rend="italic">Manon
                    Lescaut,</hi> produced in 1830, deserves mention. Five years later, in 1835,
                    Halévy produced the tragic opera <hi rend="italic">La Juive</hi> and the comic
                    opera <hi rend="italic">HÉclair,</hi> and on these works his immortality is
                    mainly founded. Both have kept the stage to the present day, and will probably
                    survive changes of taste even greater than those which music has undergone in
                    France during the last forty years. <hi rend="italic">The Jewess</hi> is in
                    every way representative of the French <hi rend="italic">grand-opera,</hi> the
                    modern outgrowth of Gluck’s music-drama with a strong admixture of the Italian
                    element and of an excess of spectacular splendour wholly strange to the classic
                    simplicity of the original. It is curious that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >grand-opera,</hi> although an essentially national product of France, was both
                    initiated and brought to its highest perfection by two Germans— Gluck and
                    Meyerbeer. The genius of the latter was fatal to Halévy’s fame. By the side of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Huguenots</hi> the merits of <hi rend="italic">La
                    Juive</hi> appear in almost diminutive proportions. At the same time Halévy’s
                    work ought not to be treated with contempt. It is full of fine dramatic
                    features, and especially the introduction of the Jewish element—with which
                    Halévy, himself a Jew, was well acquainted—gives a peculiar interest on this
                    score. <hi rend="italic">H Éclair</hi> is a curiosity of musical literature. It
                    is written for two tenors and two soprani, without a chorus, and displays the
                    composer’s mastery over the most refined effects of instrumentation and
                    vocalization in a favourable light. After these two works, to which Halévy owed
                    his fame and his seat at the Institute, he wrote numerous operas of various <hi
                    rend="italic">genres,</hi> amongst which only <hi rend="italic">La Reine de
                    Chypre,</hi> a spectacular piece analysed by Wagner in one of his Paris letters
                    (1841), and <hi rend="italic">La Tempesta,</hi> in 3 acts, written for Her
                    Majesty’s Theatre, London (1850), need be referred to. In addition to his <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n402/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0402-0383"/> productive work Halévy also rendered valuable
                    services as a teacher. He was professor at the Conservatoire from 1827 till his
                    death—some of the most successful amongst the younger composers in France, such
                    as Gounod, Victor Massé, and Georges Bizet, the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carmen,</hi> being amongst his pupils. Halévy also tried his hand at
                    literature, and there exists an agreeable volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souvenirs</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Portraits</hi> from
                    his pen. He died at Nice, March 17, 1862.</p>
