                <p><label type="entry">HERCULES</label> (Old Latin, <hi rend="italic">Heredles,
                    Herdes')</hi> is the Latinized form of the mythical Heracles, the chief national
                    hero of Hellas, who has part in all the most important myths of the generation
                    before that which embraces the Homeric warriors at Troy. The name 'Ηρακλής is
                    compounded of <hi rend="italic">Hera,</hi> the goddess, and the stem of κλ∈oς,
                    “glory.” The thoroughly national character of Heracles is shown by his being the
                    mythical ancestor of the Dorian dynastic tribe, while revered by Ionian Athens,
                    Lelegian Opus, and Aeolo-Phoenician Thebes, and closely associated with the
                    Achaean heroes Peleus and Telamon. The Perseid Alcmene, wife of Amphitryon of
                    Tiryns, was Hercules’s mother, Zeus his father (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Alcmene).</hi> After his putative father he is often called Amphitryoniades,
                    and Alcides too, after the Perseid Alcaeus, father of Amphitryon. His mother and
                    her husband lived at Thebes in exile as guests of King Creon. By the craft of
                    Hera, his foe through life, his birth was delayed, and that of Eurystheus, son
                    of Sthenelus of Argos, hastened, Zeus having in effect sworn that the elder of
                    the two should rule the realm of Perseus. Hera sent two serpents to destroy the
                    new-born Hercules, but he strangled them. He was trained in all manly
                    accomplishments by heroes of the highest renown in each, until he slew Linus,
                    his instructor in music, with the lyre. Thereupon he was sent to tend
                    Amphitryon’s oxen, and at this period slew the lion of Mount Cithaeron. By the
                    subjection of the Minyans of Orchomenus he won Creon’s <pb break="no"

                    killed in a frenzy induced by Hera. After purification he was sent by the Pythia
                    to serve Eurystheus. The apologue of Prodicus on the <hi rend="italic">Choice of
                    Hercules</hi> between pleasure and virtue was founded on his obedience to the
                    oracle. Thus began the cycle of the twelve labours :—</p>
                <p>1. Wrestling with the Nemean lion.</p>
                <p>2. Destruction of the Lernean hydra.</p>
                <p>3. Capture of the Arcadian hind (a <hi rend="italic">stag</hi> in art).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">4</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> Capture of the boar of
                    Erymanthus, while chasing which he fought the Centaurs and killed his friends
                    Chiron and Pholus, this homicide leading to Demeter’s institution of <hi
                    rend="italic">mysteries.</hi><hi rend="italic">5</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
                    Cleansing of the stables of Augeas.</p>
                <p>6. Shooting the Stymphalian birds.</p>
                <p>7. Capture of the Cretan bull subsequently slain by Theseus at Marathon.</p>
                <p>8. Capture of the man-eating mares of the Thracian Diomedes.</p>
                <p>9. Seizure of the girdle of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons.</p>
                <p>10. Bringing the oxen of Geryones from Erythia in the far west, which errand
                    involved many adventures in the coast lands of the Mediterranean, and the
                    setting up of the “Pillars of Hercules” at the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>
                <p>11. Bringing the golden apples from the garden of the Hesperides.</p>
                <p>12. Carrying Cerberus from Hades to the upper world.</p>
                <p>Most of the labours lead to various adventures called <hi rend="italic"
                    >πάρεργα.</hi> Their common order and selection, due to Apollodorus and Diodorus
                    Siculus, are later than Euripides, who omits 5, 6, and 7, and seems to count the
                    victory over Cycnus in Phthiotis, the bearing of the heavens for Atlas, and the
                    freeing of the seas from dangerous monsters. In Homer we read of unspecified
                    labours for Eurystheus, of the struggle with the sea monster of the Troad, and
                    of wars. Hesiod mentions labours 1, 2, and 10, and the freeing of Prometheus. It
                    is a mistake to suppose that legends of Hercules’s struggles with monstrous
                    embodiments of evil are not of high antiquity, though we cannot say positively
                    which are old and which comparatively late. Some enumerations give only 10
                    labours. The late lists probably rest partly on astronomical ideas.</p>
                <p>On Hercules’s return to Thebes he gave his wife Megara to his friend and
                    charioteer Iolaus, son of Iphicles, and by beating Eurytus of CEchalia and his
                    sons in a shooting match won a claim to the hand of his daughter Iole, whose
                    family, however, except her brother Iphitus, withheld their consent to the
                    union. Iphitus persuaded Hercules to search for Eurytus’s lost oxen, but was
                    killed by him at Tiryns in a frenzy. He consulted the Pythia about a cure for
                    the consequent madness, but she declined to answer him. Whereupon he seized the
                    oracular tripod, and so entered upon a contest with Apollo, which Zeus stopped
                    by sending a flash of lightning between the combatants. The Pythia then sent him
                    to serve the Lydian queen Omphale. He then with Telamon, Peleus, and Theseus
                    took Troy. He nekt helped the gods in the great battle against the giants. He
                    took part in the Argonautic voyage and the Calydonian boar hunt, made war
                    against Augeas, and against Nestor and the Pylians, and restored Tyndareus to
                    the sovereignty of Lacedaemon. He sustained many single combats, one very famous
                    struggle being the wrestling with the Libyan Antaeus, son of Poseidon and Ge
                    (Earth), who had to be held in the air, as he grew stronger every time he
                    touched his mother, Earth. Hercules withstood Ares, Poseidon, and Hera, as well
                    as Apollo. The close of his career is assigned to Aetolia and Trachis. He
                    wrestles with Achelous for Deianeira (“destructive to husband”), daughter of
                    (Eneus, king of Calydon, vanquishes the river god, and breaks off one of his
                    horns, which as a horn of plenty is found as an attribute of Hercules in art.
                    Driven from Calydon for homicide, he goes with Deianeira to Trachis. On the way
                    he slays the centaur Nessus, who persuades Deianeira that his blood is a
                    love-charm. From Trachis he wages successful war against the Dryopes and
                    Lapithae as ally of Aegimius king of the Dorians, who promised him a third of
                    his realm, and after his death adopted Hyllus, his son by Deianeira. Finally
                    Hercules attacks Eurytus, takes Oechalia, and carries off Iole. Thereupon
                    Deianeira, prompted by love and jealousy, sends him a tunic dipped in the blood
                    of Nessus, and the unsuspecting hero puts it on just before sacrificing at the
                    headland of Cenaeum in Euboea. Mad with pain, he seizes Lichas, the messenger
                    who had brought the fatal garment, and hurls him on the rocks; and then he
                    wanders.in agony to Mount Oeta, where he mounts a pyre, which, however, no one
                    will kindle. At last Poeas, father of Philoctetes, takes pity on him, and is
                    rewarded with the gift of his bow and arrows. The immortal part of Hercules
                    passes to Olympus, where he is reconciled to Hera and weds her daughter
                    Hebe.</p>
                <p>In one aspect Hercules is clearly a sun god, being identified, especially in
                    Cyprus and in Thasos (as Makar), with the Tyrian Melkarth. He is again a
                    representative of endurance and effort in the cause of Hellenic civilization and
                    enterprise. Sundry of his exploits may be based on actual achievements of tribes
                    and leaders of men, but it is impossible to unravel satisfactorily the tangled
                    strands which make up this highly elaborate myth, though the separate existence
                    of some is clearly discernible. The close connexion of the hero with both Thebes
                    and Argos suggests actual relations between the two states. The Lydian episode
                    shows traces of Eastern influence. The second, fifth, and sixth labours may be
                    solar, but yet they suggest reclamation of marsh land. The third and twelfth are
                    the most obviously solar, the horned hind representing the moon, and the
                    carrying of Cerberus to the upper world an eclipse. It may be admitted as highly
                    probable that the last episode of the hero’s tragedy is a complete solar myth
                    developed at Trachis. The winter sun is seen rising over the Cenaean promontory
                    to toil across to Mount Oeta and disappear over it in a bank of fiery cloud. The
                    fatality by which Hercules kills so many friends as well as foes recalls the
                    destroying Apollo; while his career frequently illustrates the Delphic views on
                    blood-guiltiness and expiation. As Apollo’s champion Hercules is Daphnephoros,
                    and fights Cycnus and Amyntor to keep open the sacred way from Tempe to Delphi.
                    As the Dorian tutelar he aids Tyndareus and Aegimius. As patron of maritime
                    adventure (^γeμ,⅛ιoς) he struggles with Nereus and Triton, slays Eryx and
                    Busiris, and perhaps captures the wild horses and oxen, which may stand for
                    pirates. As a god of athletes he is often a wrestler <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πaλaiμωv),</hi> and founds the Olympian games. In comedy and occasionally in
                    myths he is depicted as voracious <hi rend="italic">(βουφdγος).</hi> He is also
                    represented as the companion of Dionysus, especially in Asia Minor. The
                    “Resting” <hi rend="italic">(αναπαυόμενος)</hi> Hercules is, as at Thermopylae
                    and near Himera, the natural tutelar of hot springs in conjunction with his
                    protectress Athena, who is usually depicted attending him on ancient vases. The
                    glorified Hercules was worshipped both as a god and a hero. In the Attic deme
                    Melita he was invoked as <hi rend="italic">άλεέίκακος</hi> (“Helper in ills”),
                    at Olympia as <hi rend="italic">καλλίνικος</hi> (“Nobly-victorious ”), in the
                    rustic worship of the Oetaeans as <hi rend="italic">κορνοπίων (κόρνοπες,</hi>
                    “locusts ”), by the Erythraeans of Ionia as <hi rend="italic">Ιποκτόνος,</hi>
                    (“Canker-worm-slayer”). In Italy he was, like Apollo, Musagetes (“Leader of the
                    Muses”). He was <hi rend="italic">σωτηp</hi> (“Saviour ”), <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> a protector of voyagers, at Thasos and Smyrna, and in Italy, where
                    tithes were vowed to him to be spent in entertainment. Games in his honour were
                    held at Thebes and Marathon. In early poetry, as often in art, he is an archer,
                    afterwards a club-wielder and fully-armed warrior. In early art the adult
                    Hercules is bearded, but not long-haired. Later he is sometimes youthful and
                    beardless, always with short curly hair and thick neck, the lower <pb break="no"

                    generally worn or carried. Lysippus worked out the finest type of sculptured
                    Hercules, of which the Farnese by Glycon is a grand specimen. The infantine
                    struggle with serpents was a favourite subject.</p>
                <p>Quite distinct was the Idaean Hercules, a Cretan Dactyl connected with the cult
                    of Rhea or Cybele. The Greeks recognized Hercules in an Egyptian deity <hi
                    rend="italic">Chom</hi> and an Indian <hi rend="italic">Dοrsanes,</hi> not to
                    mention personages of other mythologies. Hercules is supposed to have visited
                    Italy on his return from Erythia, when he slew Cacus, son of Vulcan, the giant
                    of the Aventine mount in Rome, who had stolen his oxen. To this victory was
                    assigned the founding of 'the <hi rend="italic">Ara maxima.</hi> With respect to
                    the Roman relations of the hero, it is manifest that the native myths of
                    Recaranus, or Sancus, or Dius Fidius, were transferred to the Hellenic
                    Hercules.</p>
                <p>The best account of the Hercules myths and cults is by L. Preller, <hi
