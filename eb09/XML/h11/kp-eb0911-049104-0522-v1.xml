                    name given to certain birds of prey which were formerly very abundant in parts
                    of the British Islands, from their habit of harrying poultry. The first of these
                    names has now become used in a generic sense for all the species ranked under
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Circus</hi> of Lacépède, and the second confined to
                    the particular species which is the <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> of Linnaeus and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Circus</hi><hi rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> of modern ornithologists.</p>
                <p>On the wing Harriers have much resemblance to Buzzards, using the same flapping
                    stroke of the pinions, and wheeling or sailing aloft as they fly. One European
                    species indeed, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">oeruginosus,</hi>
                    though called in books the Marsh-Harrier, is far more commonly known in England
                    and Ireland as the Moor-Buzzard. But Harriers are not, like Buzzards, arboreal
                    in their habits, and always affect open country, generally, though not
                    invariably, preferring marshy or fenny districts, for snakes and frogs form a
                    great part of their ordinary food. On the ground their carriage is utterly
                    unlike that of a Buzzard, and their long wing3 and legs <pb break="no"

                    when taken in the hand. All the species also have a more or less well-developed
                    ruff or frill of small thickset feathers surrounding the lower part of the head,
                    nearly like that seen in Owls, and accordingly many systematists consider that
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Circus,</hi> though undoubtedly belonging to the <hi

                        rend="italic">Striges.</hi> No osteological affinity, however, can be
                    established between the Harriers and any section of the Owls, and the
                    superficial resemblance will have to be explained in some other way. Harriers
                    are found almost all over the world,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Mr Sharpe <hi rend="italic">(Cat. Birds Brit. Museum,</hi> i. pp. 50-73). In
                    most if not all the Harriers the sexes differ greatly in colour, so much so that
                    for a long while the miles and females of one of the commonest and best known,
                    the <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> above mentioned,
                    were thought to be distinct species, and were or still are called in various
                    European languages by different names. The error was maintained with the greater
                    persistency since the young males, far more abundant than the adults, wear much
                    the same plumage as their mother, and it was not until after Montagu’s
                    observations were published at the beginning of the present century that the
                    “Ringtail,” as she was called (the <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >pygargus</hi> of Linnaeus), was generally admitted to be the female of the
                    “Hen-Harrier.” But this was not Montagu’s only good service as regards this
                    genus. He proved the hitherto unexpected existence of a second species,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A singular mistake, which
                            has lately been productive of further error, was made by Albin, who drew

                            specimen of one species, and coloured it from a specimen of the

                    called by him the Ash-coloured Falcon, but it now generally bears his name, and
                    is known as Montagu’s Harrier, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >cineraceus.</hi> In habits it is very similar to the Hen-Harrier, but it
                    has longer wings, and its range is not so northerly, for while the Hen-Harrier
                    extends to Lapland, Montagu’s is but very rare in Scotland, though in the south
                    of England it is the most common species. Harriers indeed in the British Islands
                    are rapidly becoming things of the past. Their nests are easily found, and the
                    birds when nesting are easily destroyed. In the south-east of Europe, reaching
                    also to the Cape of Good Hope and to India, there is a fourth species, the <hi
                        rend="italic">C. swaiηsoηi</hi> of some writers, the <hi rend="italic">C.
                        pallidus</hi> of others. In North America <hi rend="italic">C. cyaneus</hi>
                    is represented by a kindred form, <hi rend="italic">C. hudsοnius,</hi> usually
                    regarded as a good species, the adult male of which is always to be recognized
                    by its rufous markings beneath, in which character it rather resembles <hi
                        rend="italic">C. cineraceus,</hi> but it has not the long wing3 of that
                    species. South America has in <hi rend="italic">C. cinereus</hi> another
                    representative form, while China, India, and Australia possess more of this
                    type. Thus there is a section in which the males have a strongly contrasted
                    black and grey plumage, and finally there is a group of larger forms allied to
                    the European <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">oerugïnosus,</hi>
                    wherein a grey dress is less often attained, of which the South African <hi
