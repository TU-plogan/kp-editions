                    and 56° 4' N. lat. and between 2° 8' and 2° 49' W. long. It is bounded on the N.
                    by the Firth of Forth, on the E. by the North Sea, on the S. by Berwickshire, on
                    the W. by Edinburghshire. Its seaboard is 31f miles. Its greatest length from
                    east to west is 25 miles, its breadth from north to south about 16 miles. Its
                    area covers 179,142 acres (280 square miles), of which 189⅛ are under water,
                    5505 foreshore, and 142⅛ in “links.” The general outline of the county is that
                    of an irregular quadrilateral figure with its northern angle projecting into the
                    sea. Along a south-and-north line through the county town, the land slopes
                    gradually up from the coast to the Garleton Hills, thence down to the Tyne
                    valley, and then up again to the Lammermuir Hills, which occupy the southern
                    district of the county. On the east and west the ground slopes from the
                    Lammermuirs to the sea, but near the sea the fall is so gentle that the land has
                    the appearance of a plain. Two almost isolated hills break the level,—North
                    Berwick Law (612 feet) on the coast, and Traprain Law (724) in the eastern part
                    of the Tyne valley. The chief summits of the Lammermuir Hills are Spartleton
                    (1534), Lammerlaw (1500), and Soutra Hill (1230). The only stream of any
                    importance is the Tyne, which, after a course of 7 miles in Midlothian, flows
                    through the county with a gentle current north-east past the town of Haddington,
                    and falls into the sea at Tynemouth. A very fine variety of trout is found in
                    it; and below the rocks of the linn at East Linton salmon are occasionally
                    caught. The Whiteadder rises in the county, and flows south-east into
                    Berwick.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Mineralogy.—</hi> The Lammermuirs are composed
                    chiefly of Lower Silurian strata, overlaid in part by Old Red Sandstone and
                    conglomerate—one great mass of the latter extending south-east from Spott, with
                    a breadth of 3 or 4 miles, across the hills into Berwickshire. Another belt of
                    Old Red Sιndstone rather more than 1 mile in breadth begins at the sea a little
                    to the south of Dunbar, and stretches along the base of the Lammermuirs. Patches
                    of Old Red Conglomerate occur also here and there in the Lammermuirs further to
                    the west, and are seen in the upper tributaries of Gifford and Humbie waters.
                    The ground to the north of the Lammermuirs is occupied chiefly by rocks
                    belonging to the Calciferous Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone series of the
                    Carboniferous formation. The Calciferous Sandstones cover a wide area west and
                    east of Haddington, extending south to the Lammermuirs, along the base of which
                    they trend south-west beyond the county boundary. They also appear in the lower
                    reaches of the Tyne valley, covering a considerable area between Tynning-harne
                    Links and Biel Water. Again they are seen on the shore between Torness Point and
                    Dunglass Burn, whence they strike inland. The hilly tract between Haddington and
                    North Berwick is made up of various volcanic rocks of Lower Carboniferous age,
                    such as porphyrite, dolerite, and tuff. In the western part of the county the
                    Carboniferous Limestone series occupies an extensive area and is rich in
                    limestones and coal-seams. This area forms the eastern margin of the Midlothian
                    coal-field. A patch of the Limestone series also appears upon the coast about a
                    mile south of Duubar. Besides these bedded aqueous and volcanic rocks, there are
                    numerous intruded masses, dykes, and veins of felstone and basalt, and some
                    pipes of tuff and agglomerate which mark the sites of ancient volcanoes of Lower
                    Carboniferous age. Granite is found at Priestlaw. Deposits of glacial origin are
                    met with more or less abundantly, especially in the low-lying tracts. These
                    consist of till or boulder-clay and mounds and sheets of sand and gravel,
                    underneath which the older rocks are often concealed over wide areas. Alluvial
                    deposits occur along the course of many streams, but the only considerable
                    alluvial flats are those of the Tyne.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Coal of a very fair quality is extensively worked in the west. So long ago as
                    1200 the monks of Newbattle. obtained this mineral from Prestongrange. Limestone
                    is found throughout the greater part of the shire. A vein of hematite of a
                    peculiarly fine character was discovered in 1866 at the Garleton Hills, and
                    wrought for some years; but from a variety of causes the works have been
                    meanwhile suspended.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is on the whole mild and equable.
                    East winds, however, prevail in the months of March, April, and May, and from
                    the lie of the county it is exposed to their full sweep. The amount of rainfall
                    is far below the average of Great Britain. During the period 1835-64 the average
                    annual rainfall was 24’85 inches,— the greatest fall being 32'7 in 1836, the
                    least 17'3 in 1842. The average monthly fall is lowest in April (1 ∙16) and
                    highest in August (2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 57). In 1872 the rainfall
                    reached the exceptional amount of 41’51 inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture, Ac.—</hi> The soils are various. The Lammermuirs
                    are of course unproductive, but the slopes to a considerable height are
                    cultivated; and for a considerable way down the land is very good. In the centre
                    of the county there is “a tenacious yellow clay resting upon a tilly subsoil/’
                    and this land is not well suited for agricultural purposes. Along the margin of
                    the Firth the soil is naturally of a sandy nature, but farther inland it is
                    composed of rich loam and is very fertile. The most productive region is the
                    land about Dunbar. The potatoes there are very good, and under the name of
                    “Dunbar reds ’ are highly esteemed in the London market, selling at times for as
                    much as £45 an acre. From the beginning of the present century till within the
                    past few years East Lothian agriculture has on the whole been held to be the
                    best in Scotland. This is not so much due to the natural fertility of the soil
                    as to the enlightened enterprise of its cultivators. Andrew Meikle here first
                    introduced the threshing mill (1787). Tile draining was first extensively used
                    here, and the reaping machine (now universally employed) and the steam plough
                    were introduced ata comparatively early period of their history. The high price
                    of grain at the time of the Crimean War gave a great impetus to farming, and in
                    consequence rents rose as much as from 15s. to <hi rend="italic">£1</hi> per
                    acre; this, with the increased cost of labour, which has risen 35 or 40 per
                    cent, (about 10s. per acre) within the last seven or eight years, has sadly
                    diminished the profits of the farmer. The size of the farms is above the average
                    of Great Britain. The majority are from 200 to 500 acres—a very few from 600 to
                    1200 acres. They are usually let on leases of nineteen years’ duration. The
                    rotation of crops is generally the six-course shift, viz., (1) grass (pasture or
                    hay), (2) oats, (3) potatoes, turnips, or beans, (4) wheat, (5) turnips, (6)
                    barley <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns of 1879, of the total area of 179,142 acres
                    115,364 acres were under cultivation, distributed as follows:—com crops, 44,719
                    (wheat, 7910; barley, 19,536; oats, 15,746); green crops, 25,656 (potatoes,
                    9835; turnips and swedes, 14,796); clover and grass, 27,194; permanent pasture,

                    type="authorial"><p>The statistics of the five preceding years do not show any
                    very great variation from these figures.</p></note> Those comparatively small
                    averages are of course explained by the fact that the county is not a pastoral
                    one. It deserves to be noted, however, that its flocks of Leicester sheep have
                    for years been justly celebrated, and shorthorns of a very high class have been
                    successfully bred.</p>
                <p>Game is no great hindrance to agriculture. A source of greater annoyance is the
                    immense number of wood pigeons which, in defiance of all efforts to hold them in
                    check, commit great havoc yearly.</p>
                <p>The wages of farm servants average about 18s. weekly, the ‘ ‘grieve” or farm
                    overseer receiving a little more; but of this only from £20 to £25 per annum is
                    given in money. The rest is paid in kind, and consists of meal, potatoes, a
                    cow’s keep, a cottage, and piece of ground. These cottages have been greatly
                    improved of late years, and are now very fair dwellings indeed. The “bothy
                    system” is practically a thing of the past. Extra field labour is supplied by
                    gangs of Irish or Highland workers, who dwell in the towns, but go out during
                    the day to work in the country. The regular employés are hired for the most part
                    at “feeing-markets,” though advertisement and private arrangement are also often
                    employed.</p>
                <p>According to the return for 1873-74, there were 1509 proprietors in the county
                    owning a total 171,739 of acres, of the annual value of £349,209.<note

                    >Communication.—</hi> The county is well supplied with roads. The chief line of
                    railway, however, runs along the coast, and this, notwithstanding the aid of
                    branch lines, places a considerable district at a serious disadvantage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population, &lt;kc.—</hi> The population of the county, which
                    is divided into 25 parishes, was 37,676 in 1871, showing an increase of 78 over
                    the number for 1861. It thus appears that the growth of the county town, of
                    North Berwick, a thriving watering-place, and of the mining parishes does little
                    more than counterbalance the decrease in purely agricultural parishes, which in
                    some cases amounts to as much as from 7 to 18 per cent. The chief towns and
                    villages are—Haddington, the county town, 4004; Dunbar, 3422; North Berwick,
                    1418; Tranent, 2306; East Linton, Prestonpans, Aberlady, Gullane, and Dirleton.
                    The county returns one member to parliament, and the burghs of Haddington,
                    Dunbar, and North Berwick unite with Lauder (Berwickshire) and Jedburgh
                    (Roxburghshire) in returning another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Educational Endowments.—</hi> The provision for education
                    outside of the public school system is inconsiderable. Schaw’s and StielΓs
                    Hospitals in the parishes of Prestonpans and Tranent are charitable educational
                    institutions. In Salton parish there is a fund for educational purposes, left by
                    Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury. According to the Endowed Schools’ Report of
                    1875, the annual incomes of these were £864, £812, and £97 respectively. School
                    and college bursaries are given annually by the East Lothian Association.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> The early Celtic inhabitants of
                    the district have left as memorials of their possession a few local names, and
                    some traces of circular camps (Garvald and Whittingham parishes) and hill forts
                    (Bolton parish). The Romans built here no enduring edifices, and there are no
                    certain remains of their camps, but they brought the ground to a high degree of
                    cultivation. The county afterwards formed part of the Saxon kingdom of
                    Northumberland, but it was joined to Scotland by Malcolm II. in 1020. It was
                    fairly prosperous till the wars of Bruce and Balliol; but from that time till
                    the union of the kingdoms it suffered from its proximity to the English border,
                    and from civil wars. In more modern times it was the scene of two great
                    battles—that of Dunbar (1650) gained by Cromwell over Leslie and the
                    Covenanters, and that of Prestonpans (1745) in which Prince Charles defeated Sir
                    John Cope. The prosperity of the county, like that of many other parts of
                    Scotland, is the growth of the present century.</p>
                <p>The chief ruins are—Hailes Castle, where Queen Mary of Scots resided for a brief
                    period after her abduction by Bothwell; Dunbar Castle, defended in 1337 by Black
                    Agnes against the earl of Salisbury; Dirleton Castle, a venerable ruin of the
                    12th century,—</p>
                <p>taken in 1298 by Edward I. and again in 1650 by Cromwell’s forces; Innerwick
                    Castle, near Dunbar; the collegiate church of Seton in the parish of Tranent,
                    built before 1390; North Berwick Abbey, founded about the middle of the 12th
                    century; and Tantallon Castle, opposite the Bass Rock, formerly the chief seat
                    in the east of the Douglas family. The genius of Scott has given to Tantallon a
                    name in English literature greater even than its name in Scottish history; and
                    readers of <hi rend="italic">Mannion</hi> will also remember the name of
                    Hobgoblin Hall, romantically situated near the village of Gifford (about six
                    miles south of the county town), a place connected by name and legend with all
                    manner of popular superstitions. Of modern mansions the chief are Broxmouth Park
                    (Duke of Roxburghe), Yester House (Marquis of Tweeddale), Tynninghame House
                    (Earl of Haddington), Gosford and Amisfield House (Earl of Wemyss)—Gosford

                    and Archerfield (Lady Μ. Hamilton), Winton House (Lady Ruthven), and Salton Hall
                    (Fletcher). A lofty column on one of the Garleton hills, -erected to the memory

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Haddington,</hi> a royal and parliamentary burgh, and the
                    chief town of the above county, is situated on the banks of the Tyne, about 17
                    miles east of Edinburgh. It occupies almost the centre of the shire to which it
                    has given the name. It consists of two main streets, which are wide and well
                    built,—High Street to the south and Market Street to the north; both run towards
                    the Tyne, here crossed by three bridges, two of which connect the town with its
                    suburb of Nungate. This suburb consists of old and ruinous houses, and is
                    inhabited for the most part by Irish agricultural labourers. The systems of
                    drainage and water supply are excellent, but the want of manufactures and the
                    inconvenience of its railway branch line have prevented the growth of the
                    burgh.</p>
                <p>The chief edifices are the county buildings, the corn exchange, which next to
                    that of Edinburgh is the largest in Scotland, the town-house adorned with a very
                    elegant spire 150 feet high, and the district asylum for the insane. There is a
                    monument of some pretensions to Robert Fergusson of Raith, and a somewhat
                    trifling one to the memory of Home the author of <hi rend="italic">Douglas.</hi>
                    The chief structure, however, is the church, an edifice probably dating from the
                    13th century It is 210 feet long, and is surmounted by a square tower 90 feet
                    high. One part is used as the parish church; the remainder, though ruinous, is
                    now preserved with a care that makes some amends for centuries of neglect. To
                    this church the name of <hi rend="italic">Lucerιιa Laudonice</hi> has long been
                    applied, but it seems probable that the edifice to which Fordun and Major
                    applied that name was the church of the Franciscan Friars close to the Tyne, of
                    which not a fragment now remains. The Nungate possesses the ruin of an old
                    chapel of St Martin. The grammar school of Haddington was established at a very
                    early period, and carefully fostered by the burghal authorities. At one time it
                    attained considerable eminence, but latterly fell into complete disuse. Under
                    the name of the Knox Memorial Institute, a very handsome school building has
                    been erected (1879), and with this the ancient burgh school is incorporated. The
                    population of the burgh in 1861 was 3874and in 1871 4004.</p>
                <p>Haddington is said to have been erected into a burgh by David I. It must have
                    been a place of considerable importance, for when the ‘ ‘ Curia Quatuor
                    Burgorum” subsisted there was an appeal from the sentences of burgh courts to
                    that of the chamberlain at Haddington. There are also extant charters in its
                    favour from Robert the Bruce and Robert II. Exposed as it was to the English
                    attack it was frequently ravaged and burned. In 1548 it was fortified<pb

                    but was besieged in the following year by the Scotch and their French
                    auxiliaries, who forced the garrison to abandon the town. As one result of all
                    this struggle and suffering, it is impossible to dig far in any direction
                    without coming on human remains. Haddington has also suffered frequently from
                    floods. An inscription in the centre of the town commemorates one of the most
                    notable of these (October 4, 1775), marking the point to which the water rose.
                    John Knox was born (1505) at the Giffordgate in the Nungate; John Brown, a
                    celebrated dissenting divine, several of whose descendants have been eminent in
                    science and literature, had a charge in Haddington for many years; and Edward
                    Irving was for somo years mathematical master in the burgh school.</p>
