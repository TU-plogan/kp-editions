                    year he was sent to Westminster school, where he was chosen king’s scholar in
                    1677, and distinguished himself in the composition of extempore epigrams made
                    according to custom upon theses appointed for king’s scholars at the time of
                    election. In 1682 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he acquired a
                    solid knowledge of the classics and surpassed all his contemporaries at the
                    university in logic and ethics. Latterly, however, he preferred to the
                    abstractions of Descartes the practical philosophy of Sir Isaac Newton; and he
                    was one of the small band of students who assisted Newton in forming the
                    Philosophical Society of Cambridge. But it was his facility in verse-writing,
                    and neither his scholarship nor his practical ability, that first opened up to
                    him the way to fortune. His clever but absurdly panegyrical poem on the death of
                    Charles II., which was published in the <hi rend="italic">Book of Condolence and
                    Congratulation</hi> presented by the university to James II., secured for him
                    the notice of the earl of Dorset, who invited him to town and introduced him to
                    the principal wits of the time; and in 1687 his joint authorship with Prior of
                    the 7bwn <hi rend="italic">and Country Mouse,</hi> a happy parody of Dryden’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Hind and Panther,</hi> not only increased his literary
                    reputation but directly helped him to political influence. In 1688, through the
                    patronage of the earl of Dorset, he entered parliament as member for Maldon, and
                    sat in the convention which resolved that William and Mary should be declared
                    king and queen of England. About this time he married the countess-dowager of
                    Manchester, and it would appear, according to Johnson, that it was still his
                    intention to take orders; but after the coronation he purchased a clerkship to
                    the council. On being introduced by Earl Dorset to King William, after the
                    publication of his poetical <hi rend="italic">Epistle occasioned by his
                    Majesty's Victory in Ireland,</hi> he was ordered to receive an immediate
                    pension of .£500 per annum, until an opportunity should present itself of
                    “making a man of him.” In 1691 he <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> was chosen
                    chairman of the committee of the House of Commons appointed to confer with a
                    committee of the Lords in regard to the Bill for regulating trials in cases of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0405-0386"/> high treason; and he displayed in these
                    conferences such tιct and debating power that he was made one of the
                    commissioners of the treasury and called to the privy council. It was during
                    these debates that he had recourse to the peculiar oratorical device of losing
                    his presence of mind, in order to give a practical illustration of the necessity
                    of allowing the privilege of counsel to criminals before a court of justice. But
                    his success as a politician was less due to his oratorical gifts than to his
                    skill in finance, and in this respect he soon began to manifest such brilliant
                    talents as completely eclipsed the painstaking abilities of Godolphin. Indeed it
                    may be affirmed that no other statesman has initiated schemes which have left a
                    more permanent mark on the financial history of England. Although perhaps it was
                    inevitable that England should sooner or later adopt the Continental custom of
                    lightening the annual taxation in times of war by contracting a national debt,
                    the actual introduction of the expedient was due to Montague, who on the 15th
                    December 1692 proposed to raise a million of money by way of loan. Previous to
                    this a Scotchman named William Paterson had submitted to the Government his plan
                    of a national bank, and when in the spring of 1694 the prolonged contest with
                    France had rendered another large loan absolutely necessary, Montague introduced
                    a Bill for the incorporation of the Bank of England. The bill after some
                    opposition passed the House of Lords in May, and immediately after the
                    prorogation of parliament Montague was rewarded by the chancellorship of the
                    exchequer. In the following year he was triumphantly returned for the borough of
                    Westminster to the new parliament, and succeeded in passing his celebrated
                    measure to remedy the depreciation which had taken place in the currency on
                    account of dishonest manipulations. To,.provide for the expense of recoinage,
                    Montague, instead of reviving the old tax of hearth money, introduced the window
                    tax, and the difficulties caused by the temporary absence of a metallic currency
                    were avoided by the issue for the first time of exchequer bills. His other
                    expedients for meeting the emergencies of the financial crisis were equally
                    successful, and the rapid restoration of public credit secured him a commanding
                    influence both in the House of Commons and at the board of the treasury; but
                    although Godolphin resigned office in October 1696, the king hesitated for some
                    time between Montague and Sir Stephen Fox as his successor, and it was not till
                    1697 that the former was appointed first lord. In 1698 and 1699 he acted as one
                    of the council of regency during the king’s absence from England. When in
                    February of the former year he had been accused of peculation in connexion with
                    the issue of exchequer bills, not only had he been triumphantly acquitted but
                    the House had declared that for his good services to the Government he had
                    deserved his Majesty’s favour; and his reputation was still further increased in
                    the same year by the extraordinary popularity of his project for a new East
                    India Company. With the accumulation of his political successes his vanity and
                    arrogance became, however, so offensive that latterly they utterly lost him the
                    influence he had acquired by his administrative ability and his masterly
                    eloquence; and when his power began to be on the wane he set the seal to his
                    political overthrow by conferring the lucrative sinecure office of auditor of
                    the exchequer on his brother in trust for himself should he be compelled to
                    retire from power. For some time after this ia attempting to lead the House of
                    Commons he had to submit to constant mortifications, often verging on personal
                    insults, and after the return of the kingin 1699 he resigned his offices in the
                    Government and succeeded his brother in the auditorship. On the accession of the
                    Tories to power he was removed in 1701 to the House of Lords by the title of
                    Lord Halifax. In the same year he was impeached for malpractices along with Lord
                    Somers and the earls of Portland and Orford, but all the charges were dismissed
                    by the Lords; and in 1703 a second attempt to impeach him was still more
                    unsuccessful. He continued out of office during the reign of Queen Anne, but in
                    1706 he was named one of the commissioners to negotiate the union with Scotland;
                    and after the passing of the Act of Settlement in favour of the house of
                    Hanover, he was appointed ambassador to the elector’s court to convey the
                    insignia of order of the garter to George I. On the death of Anne (1714) he was
                    appointed one of the council of regency until the arrival of the king from
                    Hanover; and after the coronation he received the office of first lord of the
                    treasury in the new ministry, being at the same time created Earl of Halifax and
                    Viscount Sunbury. He died on the 15th May of the following year, and left no
                    issue. His nephew succeeded to the barony, and was raised to the earldom; he
                    left it to his son George Dunk, a statesman of some eminence, with whose death
                    without issue in 1771 the Halifax titles became extinct.</p>
                <p>Montague’s association with Prior in the travesty of Dryden’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hind and Panther</hi> has no doubt largely aided in preserving his literary
                    reputation; but he is perhaps indebted for it chiefly to his subsequent
                    influential position and to the fulsome flattery of the men of letters who
                    enjoyed his friendship, and who, in return for his liberal donations and the
                    splendid banqueting which they occasionally enjoyed at his villa on the Thames,
                    “fed him,” as Pope says, “all day long with dedications.” That, however, his
                    beneficence to needy talent, if sometimes attributable to an itching ear for
                    adulation, was at others prompted by a sincere appreciation of intellectual
                    merit, is sufficiently attested by the manner in which he procured from
                    Godolphin a commissionership for Addison, and also by his lifelong intimacy with
                    Newton, for whom he obtained the mastership of the miut. The small fragments of
                    poetry which he left behind him, and which were almost solely the composition of
                    his early years, display a certain facility and vigour of diction, but their
                    thought and fancy are never more than commonplace, and not unfrequently in
                    striving to be eloquent and impressive he is only grotesquely and extravagantly
                    absurd. In administrative talent he was the superior of all his contemporaries,
                    and his only rival in parliamentary eloquence was Somers; but the skill with
                    which he managed measures was superior to his tact in dealing with men, and the
                    effect of his brilliant financial sùccesses on his reputation was gradually
                    almost nullified by the affected arrogance of his manner and by the
                    eccentricities of his sensitive vanity. So eager latterly was his thirst for
                    fame and power that perhaps Marlborough did not exaggerate when he said that “he
                    had no other principle but his ambition, so that he would put all in distraction
                    rather than not gain his point.”</p>
                <p>Among the numerous notices of Halifax ny contemporaries may be mentioned the
                    eulogistic reference which concludes Addison’s account of the “greatest of
                    English poets”; the dedications by Steel to the second volume of the <hi
