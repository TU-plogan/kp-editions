                <p><label type="entry">HERACLIUS</label><hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 575-641), emperor
                    of the East, was boni in Cappadocia about 575. He was brought into notice by his
                    heading a successful revolt against the emperor Phocas in 610, when he usurped
                    the usurper’s throne. At that period the eastern provinces of the empire were
                    being ravaged by the triumphant armies of Chosroes (Khosru) II., which in the
                    first twelve years of Heraclius’s reign continued their unresisted progress to
                    the Bosphorus and the Nile, pillaging Asia Minor and Syria, and reducing
                    Constantinople to the utmost distress by cutting off its Egyptian corn supplies.
                    In 618 the public distributions of grain, which had been carried on since
                    Constantine had instituted them as a bribe to attract citizens to his new city
                    in 330, were suspended; and the bankrupt emperor was hardly dissuaded by the
                    almost imperative prayers of his people from quitting his capital in shame and
                    fear for Carthage. Taking courage, Heraclius appears to have set himself to the
                    task of reorganizing both state and army, a labour which had probably occupied
                    him since his accession. He was menaced on the west by the fierce tribe of the
                    Avars, who were casting longing eyes on the riches of the imperial city; but in
                    620 he succeeded in making a treaty with them, and interposed a human barrier
                    against their further encroachments by inviting the Serbs and Croats to settle
                    in the intervening regions, which they have never since left. In 621 Heraclius
                    led an army into camp in Asia Minor, and devoted himself with ardour to the
                    drilling of his inexperienced troops. Every military manoeuvre, every useful
                    exercise and even hardship, was ordered and shared by the emperor. He kindled
                    the enthusiasm of his soldiers by his stirring words, and excited their
                    admiration and affection by his deeds. Next year he led his forces against
                    Persia, and within five years, in a series of brilliant campaigns that place him
                    side by side with the greatest generals of the world, he overthrew the pride of
                    that empire, drove its monarch a fugitive from his throne, and enriched his
                    exulting troops with untold wealth. Siroes, the son of Chosroes, revolting
                    against his unhappy father, put him to death in 628, and speedily made a peace
                    with Heraclius, according to which the Persian empire retired to its former
                    limits, prisoners were mutually given up, and the true cross, carried from
                    Jerusalem by the Persians, was restored to Christian hands. Heraclius returned
                    in triumph to Constantinople, which had in his absence two years before
                    successfully repulsed a combined assault by the Avars and Persians; and in 629
                    he proceeded to Jerusalem to restore solemnly the holy relic to its ancient
                    place. But he was not long to enjoy the peaceful fruits of victory. A mighty
                    power had been steadily growing up in the hot sands of Arabia, and was now
                    coming to measure its strength with that of the Roman empire. In 632 the
                    Mahometans invaded Syria; and, overthrowing the armies sent to oppose them, in
                    six years they made themselves masters of the country. Egypt next fell before
                    Islam, and in 640 that fair province of the empire was Mahometan. The people of
                    Asia Minor alone successfully resisted the advancing Saracens. Heraclius seems
                    meanwhile to have sunk into a sort of lethargy, as though his efforts in'Persia
                    had completely exhausted him. While bis generals and armies were being cut to
                    pieces he was engaged at Constantinople, whither he had retreated in 634, with
                    speculative theological questions. In 638 his <hi rend="italic">Ectlιesis</hi>
                    appeared, which, tinctured with the heresy of Monothelism, was probably drawn up
                    by the patriarch Sergius. The energy of his earlier life never returned, and in
                    641 he sank under a long-continued disease. He had been twice married; the
                    second time to his niece Martina, an illicit union which he compelled ths
                    reluctant Sergius to celebrate. His eldest son, Heraclius, succeeded him, taking
                    the title of Constantine III.</p>
                <p>The character of Heraclius is a curious riddle, which it is not easy to solve.
                    Personally brave, and possessed of tried ability as a diplomatist and a general,
                    in his latter years hë passively allowed his empire to fall to pieces before his
                    eyes,—presenting in the periods of his life a contrast that would almost seem to
                    argue the possession of not merely contrary but contradictory qualities. But we
                    must not forget that our information regarding the inner details of his latter
                    reign is very imperfect, and that possibly there may be some reason, though
                    hardly an excuse, for his conduct. It would have been better for his fame if he
                    had died immediately after his Persian campaigns.</p>
