                <p><label type="entry">FREDERICK WILLIAM I</label>. (1688-1770), king of Prussia,
                    son of Frederick I. by his second marriage, was born in 1688. He spent a
                    considerable time in early youth at the court of his grandfather, the elector of
                    Hanover. On his return to Berlin he was placed under General von Dohna, who
                    trained him to the energetic and regular habits that ever afterwards
                    characterized him. He was soon imbued with a passion for military life, and this
                    was deepened by acquaintance with the duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene,
                    whom he visited during the siege of Tournay. In nearly every respect he was the
                    opposite of his father, having frugal, simple tastes, a passionate temper, and a
                    determined will. He intensely disliked the French, and highly disapproved the
                    imitation of their manners by Frederick I. and his courtiers. When he mounted
                    the throne, his first act was to dismiss from the palace every unnecessary
                    official, and to regulate the royal household on principles of the strictest
                    parsimony. In 1715 he was forced, in alliance with Russia, Saxony, and Denmark,
                    into a war with Charles XII. of Sweden, in consequence of which, in return for
                    two million thalers paid to Sweden, he obtained the islands of Wollin and
                    Usedom, Stettin, and part of Swedish Pomerania. This was his only war. All
                    through his reign he strenuously insisted on his right to Jülich and Berg in the
                    event of the Pfalz-Neuburg line dying out (which it seemed certain to do), and
                    his anxiety respecting these duchies gives the key to most of his foreign
                    policy. For some time he inclined to an understanding with England and Hanover;
                    but in 1726 he formed an alliance with Austria, and in the Polish war of
                    succession (1733-35) aided her with 10,000 men. Ultimately, however, he
                    perceived that the emperor was not acting honourably by him, and withdrew from
                    the alliance, occupying himself solely with the internal affairs of his kingdom.
                    He despised many things which the modern world holds in high esteem, and was
                    often coarse, violent, and fond of hideous practical jokes. Nevertheless Prussia
                    profited immensely by his reign. He saw the necessity of rigid economy not only
                    in his private life but in the whole administration of the state; and the
                    consequence was that he paid off the debts incurred by his father, and left to
                    his successor an overflowing treasury. He did nothing for the higher learning,
                    and even banished the philosopher Wolf at 48 hours’ notice, “on pain of the
                    halter,” for teaching, as he believed, fatalist doctrines; but he established
                    many village schools, and he encouraged industry by every means in his power,
                    particularly agriculture. Under him the nation flourished, and although it stood
                    in awe of his vehement spirit, it respected him for his firmness, his honesty of
                    purpose, and his love of justice. He was devoted to his army, the number of
                    which he raised from 48,000 to 83,500; and there was not in existence a more
                    thoroughly drilled or better appointed force. The Potsdam guard, made up of
                    giants collected from all parts of Europe, sometimes kidnapped, was a sort of
                    toy with which he amused himself. The reviewing of his troops was his chief
                    pleasure; but he was also fond of meeting his friends in the evening in what he
                    called his “tobacco college,” where he and they, amid clouds of tobacco smoke,
                    discussed affairs of state. He died on the 31st May 1740, leaving behind him his
                    widow, Sophie Dorothea of Hanover, and a numerous family.</p>
