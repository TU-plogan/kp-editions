                <p><label type="entry">FRAUD</label>, in law, is a word of wide import, to which it
                    isdiffi-cult to assign any exact definition. The courts have in fact
                    deliberately refrained from defining it, because they did not wish to limit
                    their power of dealing with fraudulent transactions. The word, however, carries
                    its own meaning on the face of it, and there is practically no difference
                    between fraud in the popular and fraud in the legal sense. Any course of conduct
                    that would generally be described as dishonest, any cheating or deceiving
                    another so that he would be injured thereby, would be fraud in law as in common
                    parlance. In some writers, indeed, there is found an attempted distinction
                    between <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> fraud. The
                    acts of a vendor who puffs the goods he sells are, it is said, in so far as they
                    conceal the truth or produce a false impression in the mind of the buyer,
                    fraudulent from an ethical point of view. The law, however, regards them not,
                    holding that the buyer must look to his bargain for himself. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caveat emptor;</hi> if he chooses to believe the assertions of the puffer when
                    he might verify the facts for himself, so much the worse for him. An examination
                    of the case, however, shows that there is little or no value in the alleged
                    distinction. The meaning of the maxim is that when the parties are dealing at
                    arm’s length, neither is in fact <hi rend="italic">deceived</hi> by the
                    exaggerations or depreciations of the other. If actual and intentional
                    misrepresentation is proved the law will avoid the contract, but it will not
                    readily listen to the claim of a man who, having the opportunity of examining
                    what he bought, protests that he purchased on the strength of the vendor’s
                    recommendations.</p>
                <p>The essential element in fraud is misrepresentation,— producing a false
                    impression on the mind of another—causing him to believe that which is not true.
                    And misrepresentation, to amount to fraud, must also be intentional. There is a
                    wide difference between a false statement believed to be true by the person who
                    makes it and a false statement known to be false by the person who makes it. The
                    latter is clearly fraudulent, and although it would not be safe to set this down
                    as a sufficient definition of fraud, something of this sort will be found to
                    exist in all conduct which is recognized as legally or morally fraudulent. The
                    innocent misrepresentation of facts is, both in law and in common morality, a
                    much less serious thing than wilful misrepresentation. The latter would include
                    not merely the cases where the statement is known to be false by the person
                    making it, but also the cases in which the statement is made recklessly without
                    any belief one way or the other. He who deliberately makes a statement which he
                    does not know or believe to be true does so at his peril, and if it turns out to
                    be false he will find himself in the same position as if he had known it to be
                    false from the beginning.</p>
                <p>It is in reference to contracts that the legal treatment of fraud is of the
                    greatest importance. The broad rule is that any contract tainted by fraud is
                    void at the option of the party injured. Innocent misrepresentation in the sense
                    above defined has no such effect on a contract, has in general no effect at all
                    unless in certain exceptional cases. Thus if the representation is a <hi
                    rend="italic">condition,</hi> the contract is avoided if it turn out not to be
                    true. Or if it is a <hi rend="italic">ιvarranty,</hi> its falsehood will give a
                    right of action for the breach thereof. And so in certain other cases. But
                    wilful misrepresentation or fraud taints the whole contract. Suppose a contract
                    for the sale of goods between A and B. A, the vendor, makes statements relating
                    to the contract which are not true. If the truth of the statements was made a
                    condition of the contract, or if A warranted their truth, he would be
                    responsible to B whether he in point of fact believed the statements to be true
                    or not. In other cases he would be responsible if he knew the statements to be
                    false or made them recklessly without any belief as to their truth or
                    falsehood.</p>
                <p>Statements, misrepresentations, or frauds, to be within the rule, must be such as
                    are material to or such as have given rise to the contract. There must be <hi
                    rend="italic">dolus dans locum</hi><hi rend="italic">contractui.</hi> A
                    fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation, which had no effect on the mind of
                    the innocent party because the circumstances for which it was prepared did not
                    arise, has no effect on the contract. And the fraud must be the fraud of one of
                    the contracting parties or his agents. False or fraudulent statements, through
                    which A is induced to enter into contract with B, have no effect on the contract
                    if B was in no way privy to them. So also it has been held that the fraud must
                    relate to the same transaction, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a fraudulent
                    misrepresentation made on a former occasion by one of the contracting parties
                    has no effect on the contract, although in point of fact it was that which
                    induced the other party to contract.</p>
                <p>A contract vitiated by fraud is void at the option of the party injured. He may
                    rescind the agreement if he chooses, or he may affirm it and require the other
                    party to place him in the same position as if the false statement had in point
                    of fact been true. This option he must exercise within a reasonable time after
                    discovering the misrepresentation.</p>
                <p>Apart from contract, fraud or misrepresentation may give a right of action to the
                    party injured thereby. A typical case is where A is induced by the false
                    representation of B to give credit to C. A has a right of action against B for
                    any damage he may have sustained in consequence.</p>
                <p>It may be expedient here to notice the <hi rend="italic">Statute of Frauds</hi>
                    (29 Charles II., c. 3)—perhaps the most important piece of legislation in the
                    whole statute-book. Its object is stated to be the “prevention of frauds and
                    perjuries,” and its effect is to make writing essential to the validity of many
                    transactions. The most important sections are those relating to contracts, viz.,
                    the 4th and the 17th, almost every word of which has been the subject of
                    numerous decisions. By the 4th section <hi rend="italic">no action shall be
                    brought</hi> on the contracts therein mentioned unless the agreement, or some
                    note or memorandum thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
                    charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.
                    The contracts referred to are the following :—(1) any special promise by an
                    executor or administrator to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) any
                    special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another
                    person; (3) any agreement made upon consideration of marriage; (4) any contract
                    or sale of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or any interest in or concerning
                    them; and (5) any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one
                    year from the making thereof. It will be noticed that this section does not make
                    the contract null and void, but only unactionable. The 17th section refers to
                    sales of goods for the price (or value) of &lt;£10 and upwards, which are “not
                    allowed to be good” unless some memorandum of the bargain has been made in
                    writing (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Contract).</hi> Arrangements by which an
                    insolvent debtor agrees to give to one of his creditors a preference over the
                    others without their knowledge or consent are known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >fraudulent preferences,</hi> and are null and void.</p>
                <p>Fraud can hardly be said to be under that name an offence known to the criminal
                    law; the vagueness of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0762-0727"/> conception renders it impossible to treat fraud
                    <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> as a crime. But there are specific offences (both
                    at common law and by statute) of which fraud is the gist, and in dealing with
                    these the courts have had some little difficulty in drawing the line between
                    criminal and non-criminal fraud. At common law it would appear that only those
                    cheats or frauds are indictable which amount to “fraudulently obtaining the
                    property of another by any deceitful and illegal practice or token (short of
                    felony) <hi rend="italic">which affects or may affect the public”</hi> (Russell
                    <hi rend="italic">On Crimes,</hi> vol. ii.). Chief Justice Cockburn in one case
                    stated, as the result of the authorities, that “if a person in the course of his
                    trade, <hi rend="italic">openly and publicly carried on,</hi> were to put a
                    false mark upon an article so as to pass it off as a genuine one, when in fact
                    it was only a spurious one, and the article was sold and money obtained by means
                    of that false mark or token, that would be a cheat at common law.” On the other
                    hand, cheats by means of a bare lie or false affirmation in a private
                    transaction are not indictable at common law; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when
                    a merchant falsely pretended that a certain parcel of gum was gum seneca,
                    whereas it was an inferior and less valuable gum, the fraud was held not
                    indictable. And in another case where the defendant was charged with obtaining
                    money from another by a falsehood, Chief Justice Holt said, “Shall we indict one
                    man for making a fool of another? Let him bring his action.” Frauds affecting
                    the crown would be indictable, and so would any cheat aimed at the general
                    public, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when an impostor maims himself to have a
                    pretence for asking charity. Russell considers that the publication of false
                    news likely to produce any <hi rend="italic">public detriment</hi> would be
                    criminal.</p>
                <p>The principal criminal enactment against frauds is 24 and 25 Vict., c. 96, §§
                    75-90. By § 88, “whoever shall by any false pretence obtain from any other
                    person any chattel, money, or valuable security, with intent to defraud, shall
                    be guilty of a misdemeanour.” Other sections deal with frauds by agents,
                    bankers, or factors, by trustees, by directors of companies (keeping fraudulent
                    accounts, publishing false statements, &lt;fcc.). Other enactments are the
                    statutes of Elizabeth against fraudulent conveyances (13 Eliz., c. 5, and 27
                    Eliz., c. 4); 9 Geo. II., c. 5 (persons pretending to exercise witchcraft, tell
                    fortunes, &amp;c.); 25 and 26 Vict., c. 88 (forgery, trade marks, &amp;c.); the
                    Debtors Act, 1869 (fraudulent debtors, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>The distinction between private and public frauds does not hold in the law of
                    Scotland. Thus if a person undertake to supply an article according to sample,
                    or an article which has been inspected and ordered, and intentionally send a
                    substance which is not the thing contracted for at all, or which, though
                    containing some proportion of the article ordered, is an adulterated mixture, he
                    is guilty of falsehood, fraud, and wilful imposition (Macdonald’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Criminal Law of Scotland).</hi> This passage may be compared with
                    the private frauds cited above. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
