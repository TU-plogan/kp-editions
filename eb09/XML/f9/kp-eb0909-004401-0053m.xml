                    England, in the 16th homily, on the authority of the Council of Chalcedon<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The Fathers assembled there
                    . . . decreed in that council that every person, as well in his private as
                    public fast, should continue all the day without meat and drink, till after the
                    evening prayer. And whosoever did eat or drink before the evening prayer was
                    ended should be accounted and reputed not to consider the purity of his fast.
                    This canon teacheth so evidently how fasting was used in the primitive church as

                    a looser sense the word is employed to denote abstinence from certain kinds of
                    food merely; and this meaning, which in ordinary usage is probably the more
                    prevalent, seems also to be at least tolerated by the Church of England when it
                    speaks of “fast or abstinence days,” as if fasting and abstinence were
                    synonymous.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As indeed

                <p>Fasting is of special interest when considered as a discipline voluntarily
                    submitted to for moral and religious ends. As such it is very widely diffused.
                    Its modes and motives vary considerably according to climate, race,
                    civilization, and other circumstances; but it would be difficult to name any

                    arisen out of the custom of providing refreshments for the dead, either by
                    actually feeding the corpse, or by leaving eatables and drinkables for its use.
                    The offerings to the dead are often made in so lavish a manner as necessarily to
                    involve the survivors in temporary starvation, and it is no uncommon thing for a
                    man to ruin himself by a funeral feast It is suggested that the fasting which
                    was at first the natural and inevitable result of such sacrifice on behalf of
                    the dead may eventually have come to be regarded as an indispensable concomitant
                    of all sacrifice, and so have survived as a well-established usage long after

                    pretended that this explanation is sufficient to account satisfactorily for all
                    the known cases of primitive fasting; indeed its extreme precariousness at once
                    becomes evident when it is remembered that, now at least, it is usual for
                    religious fasts to precede rather than to follow sacrificial and funeral feasts,
                    if observed at all in connection with these. Mr Spencer himself (p. 284) admits
                    that “probably the practice arises in more ways than one,” and proceeds to
                    supplement the theory already given by another—that adopted by Mr E. B. Tylor—to
                    the effect that it originated in the desire of the primitive man to bring on at
                    will certain abnormal nervous conditions favourable to the seeing of those
                    visions and the dreaming of those dreams which are supposed to give the soul

                    we leave out of sight the very numerous and obvious cases in which fasting,
                    originally the natural reflex result of grief, fear, or other strong emotion,
                    has come to be the usual conventional symbol of these, we shall find that the
                    practice is generally resorted to, either as a means of somehow exalting the
                    higher faculties at the expense of the lower, or as an act of homage to some
                    object of worship. The axiom of the Amazulu that “the continually stuffed body
                    cannot see secret things” meets even now with pretty general acceptance; and if
                    the notion that it is precisely the food which the worshipper foregoes that
                    makes the deity more vigorous to do battle for his human friend be confined only
                    to a few scattered tribes of savages, the general proposition that “fasting is a
                    work of reverence toward God” may be said to be an article of the Catholic

                <p>Although fasting as a religious rite is to be met with almost everywhere, there

                    notably with that of Isis (Herod, ii. 40), but it does not appear that, so far
                    as the common people were concerned, the observance of these festivals (which
                    were purely local) was compulsory. The <hi rend="italic">wηστtia</hi> on the

                    observed on the 10th day of the 7th month (Tisri), the penalty of disobedience
                    being death. The rules, as laid down in Lev. xvi. 29-34, xxiii. 27-32, and Numb.
                    xxix. 7-11, include a special injunction of strict abstinence (“yo shall afflict

                    associated with the chief feast of the year. Before that feast could be entered
                    upon, the sins of the people had to be confessed and (sacramentally) expiated.
                    The fast was a suitable concomitant of that contrition which befitted the
                    occasion. The practice of stated fasting was not in any other case enjoined by
                    the law; and it is generally understood to have been forbidden on Sabbath.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Judith viii. 6. “And yet
                    it may be a question whether they (the Jews) did not always fast upon Sabbath,”
                    says Hooker <hi rend="italic">(E. P.,</hi> v. 72, 7), who gives a curious array
                    of evidence pointing in this direction. He even makes use of Neh. viii. 9-12,
                    which might be thought to tell the other way. Justinian’s phrase “Sabbata
                    Judseorum a Mose in omne aevum jejunio dicata” (1. xxxvi. c. 2; comp. Suetonius
                    in Octav. c. 76) may be accounted for by the fact that the day of atonement is
                    called Sabbat Sabbaton (“a perfect Sabbath”).</p></note> At the same time,
                    private and occasional fasting, being regarded as a natural and legitimate
                    instinct, was regulated rather than repressed. The only other provision about
                    fasting in the Pentateuch is of a regulative nature, Numb. xxx. 14 (13), to the
                    effect that a vow made by a woman “to afflict the soul” may in certain
                    circumstances be cancelled by her husband.</p>
                <p>The history of Israel from Moses to Ezra furnishes a large number of instances in
                    which the fasting instinct was obeyed both publicly and privately, locally and
                    nationally, under the influence of sorrow, or fear, or passionate desire. See,
                    for example, Judg. xx. 26; 1 Sam. vii. 6 (where the national fast was conjoined
                    with the ceremony of pouring out water before the Lord); J er. xxxvi. 6, 9; and
                    2 Sam. xii. 16.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>° There

                    out, no direct evidence that the fast on the 10th of the 7th month was ever
                    observed before the exile. But the inference which he draws from this silence of
                    the historical books is manifestly a precarious one at best. Bleek calls Lev.
                    xvi. “ein deutliches Beispiel Mosaischer Abfassung” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Einlcitung,</hi> p. 31, ed. 1878).</p></note> Sometimes the observance of such
                    fasts extended over a considerable period of time, during which, of course, the
                    stricter <hi rend="italic">jejunium</hi> was conjoined with <hi rend="italic"
                    >abstinentia</hi> (Dan. x. 2). Sometimes they lasted only for a'day. In Jonah
                    iii. 6, 7, we have an illustrative example of the rigour with which a strict
                    fast might be observed; and such passages as Joel ii. aud Isa. lviii. 5 enable
                    us to picture with some vividness the outward accompaniments of a Jewish fast
                    day before the exile.</p>
                <p>During the exile many occasional fasts were doubtless observed by the scattered
                    communities, in sorrowful commemoration of the various sad events which had
                    issued in the downfall of the kingdom of Judah. Of these, four appear to have
                    passed into general use—the fasts of the 10th, 4th, 5 th, and 7 th
                    months—commemorating the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, the capture of the
                    city, the destruction of the temple, the assassination of Gedaliah. As time
                    rolled on they became invested with increasing sanctity; and though the prophet
                    Zechariah, when consulted about them at the close of the exile (Zech. viii. 19),
                    had by no means encouraged the observance of them, the rebuilding of the temple
                    does not appear to have been considered an achievement of sufficient importance
                    to warrant their discontinuance. It is worthy of remark that</p>
                <p>Ezekiel’s prophetic legislation contains no reference to any fast day; the book
                    of Esther (ix. 31), on the other hand, records the institution of a new fast on
                    the 13th of the 12 th month.</p>
                <p>In the post-exile period private fasting was much practised by the pious, and
                    encouraged by the religious sentiment of the time (see Judith viii. 6; Tob. xii.
                    8, and context; Sirach xxxiv. 26; Luke ii. 37, and xviii. 12). The last
                    reference contains an allusion to the weekly fasts which were observed on the 2d
                    and 5th days of each week, in commemoration, it was said, of the ascent and
                    descent of Moses at Sinai. The real origin of these fasts aud the date of their
                    introduction are alike uncertain; it is manifest, however, that the observance
                    of them was voluntary, and never made a matter of universal obligation. It is
                    probable that the Sadducees, if not also the Essenes, wholly neglected them. The
                    second book <hi rend="italic">(Seder Moed)</hi> of the Mishna contains two
                    tractates bearing upon the subject of fasting. One <hi rend="italic">(Yoma,</hi>
                    “the day”) deals exclusively with the rites which were to be observed on the
                    great day of expiation or atonement; the other <hi rend="italic">(Taanith,</hi>
                    “fast ”) i3 devoted to the other fasts, and deals especially with the manner in
                    which occasional fasting is to be gone about if no rain shall have fallen on or
                    before the 17th day of Marcheschwan. It is enacted that in such a case the
                    rabbis shall begin with a light fast of three days (Monday, Thursday, Monday),
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a fast during which it is lawful to work, and also
                    to wash and anoint the person. Then, in the event of a continued drought, fasts
                    of increasing intensity are ordered; and as a last resort the ark is to be
                    brought into the street and sprinkled with ashes, the heads of the Nasi and
                    Ab-beth-din being at the same time similarly sprinkled.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The allusion to the ark warns us to be
                    cautious in assuming the laws of the Mishna to have been ever in
                    force.</p></note> In no case was any fast to be allowed to interfere with
                    new-moon or other fixed festival. Another institution treated with considerable
                    fulness in the treatiso <hi rend="italic">Taanith</hi> is that of the lOPD 'tyjx
                    <hi rend="italic">(viri stationis),</hi> who are represented as having been
                    laymen severally representing the twenty-four classes or families into which the
                    whole commonwealth of the laity was divided. They used to attend the temple in
                    rotation, and be present at the sacrifices; and as this duty fell to each in his
                    turn, the men of the class or family which he represented were expected in their
                    several cities and places of abode to engage themselves in religious exercises,
                    and especially in fasting. The suggestion will readily occur that here may be
                    the origin of the Christian <hi rend="italic">stationes.</hi> But neither
                    Tertullian nor any other of the fathers seem to have been aware of the existence
                    of any such institution among the Jews; and very probably the story about it may
                    have been a comparatively late invention. It ought to be borne in mind that the
                    Aramaic portion of the <hi rend="italic">Megillath Taanith</hi> (a document
                    considerably older than the treatises in the Mishna) gives a catalogue only of
                    the days on which fasting was forbidden. The Hebrew part (commented on by
                    Maimonides) in which numerous fasts are recommended is of considerably later
                    date. See Reland, <hi rend="italic">Antiq. Hebr.,</hi> p. iv. c. 10; Derenbourg,

                    not inculcate asceticism in His teaching, and the absence of that distinctive
                    element from His practice was sometimes a subject of hostile remark (Matt. xi.
                    19). We read, indeed, that on one occasion He fasted forty days and forty
                    nights; but the expression, which is an obscure one, possibly means nothing more
                    than that He endured the privations ordinarily involved in a stay in the

                    His disciples were in the habit of observing the other fasts which custom and
                    tradition had established. See Mark ii. 18, where the correct reading appears to
                    be—“The disciples of John, and the Pharisees, were fasting” (some customary
                    fast). He never formally forbade fasting, but neither did He ever enjoin it. He
                    assumed that, in certain circumstances of sorrow and need, the fasting instinct
                    would sometimes be felt by the community and the individual; what He was chiefly
                    concerned about was to warn His followers against the mistaken aims which His
                    contemporaries were so apt to contemplate in their fasting (Matt. vi. 16-18). In
                    one passage, indeed, He has been understood as practically commanding resort to
                    the practice in certain circumstances. It ought to be noted, however, that Matt,
                    xvii. 21 is probably spurious; and that in Mark ix. 29 the words “and fasting”
                    are omitted by Westcott and Hort as well as by Tischendorf on the evidence of
                    the Cod. Sinaiticus (first hand) and Cod. Vaticanus.<note anchored="true"

                    has generally been held to indicate that the apostles continued to observe the
                    yearly Jewish fast. But this inference is by no means a necessary one. According
                    to Acts xiii. 2, 3, xiv. 23, they conjoined fasting with prayer at ordinations,
                    and doubtless also on some other solemn occasions; but at the same time the
                    liberty of the Christian “in respect of an holiday, or of the new moon, or of
                    the Sabbath” was strongly insisted on, by one of them at least, who declared
                    that meat whether taken or abstained from commendeth not to God (Col. ii. 16-23;
                    1 Cor. viii, 8; Rom xiv. 14-22; 1 Tim. iv. 3-5). The fastings to which the
                    apostle Paul alludes in 2 Cor. vi. 5, xi. 27, were rather of the nature of
                    inevitable hardships cheerfully endured in the discharge of his sacred calling.
                    The words which appear to encourage fasting in 1 Cor. vii. 5 are absent from all
                    the oldest manuscripts and are now omitted by all critics;<note anchored="true"

                    and practice of the New Testament, while, recognizing the propriety of
                    occasional and extraordinary fasts, seem to be decidedly hostile to the
                    imposition of any of a stated, obligatory, and general kind.</p>
                <p>The usage of the Christian church during the earlier centuries was in this, as in
                    so many other matters, influenced by traditional Jewish feeling, and by the
                    force of old habit, quite as much as by any direct apostolic authority or
                    supposed divine command. Habitual temperance was of course in all cases regarded
                    as an absolute duty; and “the bridegroom” being absent, the present life was
                    regarded as being in a sense one continual “fast.” Fasting in the stricter sense
                    was not unknown; but it is certain that it did not at first occupy nearly so
                    prominent a place in Christian ritual as that to which it afterwards attained.
                    There are early traces of the customary observance of the Wednesday and Friday
                    fasts—the <hi rend="italic">dies statio-nurn</hi> (Clem. Alex., <hi
                    rend="italic">Strom.,</hi> vii. 877), and also of a “quadragesimal” fast before
                    Easter. But the very passage which proves the early origin of “quadragesima,”
                    conclusively shows how uncertain it was in its character, and how unlike the
                    Catholic “Lent.” Irenaeus, quoted by Eusebius (v. 24), informs us with reference
                    to the customary yearly celebration of the mystery of the resurrection of our
                    Lord, that disputes prevailed not only with respect to the day, but also with
                    respect to the manner of fasting in connexion with it. “For some think that they
                    ought to fast only one day, some two, some more days; some compute their day as
                    consisting of <hi rend="italic">forty hours</hi> night and day; and this
                    diversity existing among those that observe it is not a matter that has just
                    sprung up in our times, but long ago among those before us.” It was not
                    pretended that the apostles had legislated on the matter, but the general and
                    natural feeling that the anniversaries of the crucifixion and the resurrection
                    of Christ ought to be celebrated by Christians took expression in a variety of
                    ways according to the differing tastes of individuals. No other stated fasts,
                    besides those already mentioned, can be adduced from the time before Irenaeus;
                    but there was also a tendency—not unnatural in itself, and already sanctioned by
                    Jewish practice—to fast by way of preparation for any season of peculiar
                    privilege Thus, according to Justin Martyr <hi rend="italic">(Apol.,ii</hi> 93),
                    catechumens were accustomed to fast before baptism, and the church fasted with
                    them. To the same feeling the quadragesimal fast which (as already stated)
                    preceded the joyful feast of the resurrection, is to be, in part at least,
                    attributed. As early as the time of Tertulliau it was also usual for
                    communicants to prepare themselves by fasting for receiving the eucharist. But
                    that Christian fasts had not yet attained to the exaggerated importance which
                    they afterwards assumed is strikingly shown in the well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shepherd of Hermas</hi> (lib. iii. sim. v.), where it is declared that “with
                    merely outward fasting nothing is done for true virtue;” the believer is
                    exhorted chiefly to abstain from evil and seek to cleanse himself from feelings
                    of covetousness, and impurity, and revenge: “on the day that thou fastest
                    content thyself with bread, vegetables, and water, and thank God for these. But
                    reckon up on this day what thy meal would otherwise have cost thee, and give the
                    amount that it comes to to some poor widow or orphan, or to the poor.” The right
                    of bishops to ordain special fasts, “ex aliqua sol-licitudinis ecclesiastics
                    causa” (Tertullian), was also recognized.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Later Practice of the Church.—</hi> According to an expression
                    preserved by Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(IL E.,</hi> v. 18), Montanus was the
                    first to give laws (to the church) on fasting. Such language, though rhetorical
                    in form, is substantially correct. The treatise of Tertullian,— <hi
                    rend="italic">Concerning Fasting: against the Carnal,—</hi> written as it was
                    under Montanistic influence, is doubly interesting, first as showing how free
                    the practice of the church down to that time had been, and then as foreshadowing
                    the burdensome legislation which was destined to succeed. In that treatise (c.
                    15) he approves indeed of the church practice of not fasting on Saturdays and
                    Sundays (as elsewhere, <hi rend="italic">De Corona,</hi> c. 3, he had expressed
                    his concurrence in the other practice of observing the entire period between
                    Easter and Pentecost as a season of joy); but otherwise he evinces great
                    dissatisfaction with the indifference of the church as to the number, duration,
                    and severity of her fasts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    involved in discussions as to the number of days to be observed, especially in
                    “Lent,” as fast days, as to the hour at which a fast ought to terminate (whether
                    at the 3d or at the 9th hour), as to the rigour with which each fast ought to be
                    observed (whether by abstinence from flesh merely, <hi rend="italic"
                    >abstinentia,</hi> or by abstinence from lacticinia, <hi rend="italic"

                    penalties by which the laws of fasting ought to be enforced. Almost a century,

                    early date.</p></note> The synod of Laodicea framed several rules with regard to
                    the observance of “Lent,” such as that “during Lent the bread shall not be
                    offered except on Saturday and Sunday” (can. 49), that “the fast shall not be
                    relaxed on the Thursday of the last week of Lent, thus dishonouring the whole
                    season; but the fast shall be kept throughout the whole period” (can. 50), that
                    “during the fast no feasts of the martyrs shall be celebrated” (can. 51), and
                    that “no wedding or birthday feasts shall be celebrated during Lent·” (can. 52).
                    The synod of Hippo (393 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> enacted that the
                    sacrament of the altar should always be taken fasting, except on the Thursday
                    before Easter. Protests in favour of freedom were occasionally raised, not
                    always in a very wise manner, or on very wise grounds, by various individuals
                    such as Eustathius of Sebaste <hi rend="italic">{c.</hi> 350), Aerius of Pontus
                    <hi rend="italic">(ç.</hi> 375), and Jovinian, a Roman monk (c. 388). Of the
                    Eustathians, for example (whose connection with Eustathius can hardly be
                    doubted), the complaint was made that “they fast on Sundays, but eat on the
                    fast-days of the church.” They were condemned by the synod of Gangra in
                    Paphlagonia <hi rend="italic">{cir.</hi> 860) in the following canons :—Can. 19,
                    “If any one fast on Sunday, let him be anathema.”<note anchored="true"

                    commanded and observed by the whole church, let him be anathema.” Jovinian was
                    very moderate. He “did not allow himself to be hurried on by an inconsiderate
                    zeal to condemn fasting, the life of celibacy, monachism, considered purely in
                    themselves He merely sought to show that men were wrong in recommending so
                    highly and indiscriminately the life of celibacy and fasting, though he was
                    ready to admit that both under certain circumstances might be good and useful”
                    (Neander). He was nevertheless condemned (390) both by Pope Siricius at a synod
                    in Rome, and by Ambrose at another in Milan. The views of Aerius, according to

                    to have been characterized by great wisdom and sobriety. He did not condemn
                    fasting altogether, but thought that it ought to be resorted to in the spirit of
                    gospel freedom according as each occasion should arise. He found fault with the

                    practices of the church. The Romans fasted three weeks continuously before
                    Easter</p>
                <p>(Saturdays and Sundays excepted). In Hlyτia, Achaia, and Alexandria the
                    quadragesimal fast lasted six weeks. Others (the Constantinopolitans) began
                    their fasts seven weeks before Easter, but fasted only on alternate weeks, five
                    days at a time. Corresponding differences as to the manner of abstinence
                    occurred. Some abstained from all living creatures; others ate fish; others fish
                    and fowl. Some abstained from eggs and fruit; some confined themselves to bread;
                    some would not take even that. Some fasted till three in the afternoon, and then
                    took whatever they pleased. “Other nations,” adds the historian, “observe other
                    customs in their fasts, and that for various reasons. And since no one can show
                    any written rule about this, it is plain the apostles left this matter free to
                    every one’s liberty and choice, that no one should be compelled to do a good
                    thing out of necessity and fear.” When Leo the Great became pope in 440, a
                    period of more rigid uniformity began. The imperial authority of Valentinian
                    helped to bring the whole West at least into submission to the see of Rome; and
                    ecclesiastical enactments had, more than formerly, the support of the civil
                    power. Though the introduction of the four Ember seasons was not entirely due to
                    him, as has sometimes been asserted, it is certain that their widespread
                    observance was due to his influence, and to that of his successors, especially
                    of Gregory the Great. The tendency to increased rigour may be discerned in the
                    2d canon of the synod of Orleans (541), which declares that every Christian is
                    bound to observe the fast of Lent, and, in case of failure to do so, is to be
                    punished according to the laws of the church by his spiritual superior; in the
                    9th canon of the synod of Toledo (653), which declares the eating of flesh
                    during Lent to be a mortal sin; in Charlemagne’s law for the newly conquered
                    Saxony, which attaches the penalty of death to wanton disregard of the holy
                    season.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cap. iii. pro

                    century those who ate flesh during Lent were liable to have their teeth knocked
                    out. But it ought to be remembered that this severity of the law early began to
                    be tempered by the power to grant dispensations. The so-called Butter Towers
                    (Tours de beurre) of Rouen, 1485- 1507, Bourges, and other cities, are said to
                    have been built with money raised by sale of dispensations to eat lacticinia on
                    fast days.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the apparent severity of the mediaeval Latin Church on this
                    subject was largely due to the real strictness of the Greek Church, which, under
                    the patriarch Photius in 864, had taken what was virtually a new departure in
                    its fasting praxis. The rigour of the fasts of the modem Greek Church is well
                    known; and it can on the whole be traced back to that comparatively early date.
                    Of the nine fundamental laws of that church <hi rend="italic">(iwea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">παραγγέλματα της</hi> εκκλησίας) two are concerned with fasting.
                    Besides fasts of an occasional and extraordinary nature, the following are
                    recognized as of stated and universal obligation (1) The Wednesday and Friday
                    fasts throughout the*year (with the exception of the period between Christmas
                    and Epiphany, the Easter week, the week after Whitsunday, the third week after
                    Epiphany); (2) The great yearly fasts, viz., that of Lent, lasting 48 days, from
                    the Monday of Sexagesima to Easter eve; that of Advent, 39 days, from November
                    15th to Christmas eve; that of the Theotokos (η/σταα <hi rend="italic"
                    >της</hi><hi rend="italic">θeoτoκov),</hi> from August 1st to August 15th; that
                    of the Holy Apostles, lasting a variable number of days from the Monday after
                    Trinity; (3) The minor yearly fasts before Epiphany, before Whitsunday, before
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0057-0048"/> the feasts of the transfiguration, the invention
                    of the cross, the beheading of John the Baptist During even the least rigid of
                    these the use of flesh and lacticinia is strictly forbidden; fish, oil, and wine
                    are occasionally conceded, but not before two o’clock in the afternoon. The
                    practice of the Coptic church is almost identical with this. A week before the
                    Great Fast (Lent), a fast of three days is observed in commemoration of that of
                    the Ninevites, mentioned in the book of Jonah. Some of the Copts are said to
                    observe it by total abstinence during the whole period. The Great Fast continues
                    fifty-five days; nothing is eaten except bread and vegetables, and that only in
                    the afternoon, when church prayers are over. The Fast of the Nativity lasts for
                    twenty-eight days before Christmas; that of the Apostles for a variable number
                    of days from the Feast of the Ascension; and that of the Virgin for fifteen days
                    before the Assumption. Ali Wednesdays and Fridays are also fast days except
                    those that occur in the period between Easter and Whitsunday. The Armenians are
                    equally strict; but (adds Rycaut) “the times seem so confused and without rule
                    that they can scarce be recounted, unless by those who live amongst them, and
                    strictly observe them, it being the chief care of the priest, whose learning
                    principally consists in knowing the appointed times of fasting and feasting, the
                    which they never omit on Sundays to publish unto the people.”<note

                <p>At the council of Trent no more than a passing allusion was made to the subject
                    of fasting. The faithful were simply enjoined to submit themselves to church
                    authority on the subject; and the clergy were exhorted to urge their flocks to
                    the observance of frequent jejunia, as conducive to the mortification of the
                    flesh, and as assuredly securing the divine favour. Bellarmine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De jejunio)</hi> distinguishes jejunium spirituale (abstinentia a vitiis),
                    jejunium morale (parsimonia et temperantia cibi et potus), jejunium naturale
                    (abstinentia ab omni prorsus cibo et potu, quacunque ratione sumpto), and
                    jejunium ecclesiasticum. The last he defines simply as an abstinence from food
                    in conformity with the rule of the church. It may be either voluntary or
                    compulsory; and compulsory either because of a vow or because of a command. But
                    the definition given by Alexander Halensis, which is much fuller, still retains
                    its authority:—“Jejunium est abstinentia a cibo et potu secundum formam
                    ecclesiae, intuitu satisfaciendi pro peccato et acquirendi vitam aeternam.” It
                    was to this last clause that the Reformers most seriously objected. They did not
                    deny that fasting might be a good thing, nor did they maintain that the church
                    or the authority might not ordain fasts, though they deprecated the imposition
                    of needless burdens on the conscience. What they protested against was the
                    theory of the opus operatum et meritorium as applied to fasting. As matter of
                    fact, the Reformed churches in no case give up the custom of observing fast
                    days, though by some churches the number of such days was greatly reduced. In
                    many parts of Germany, the seasons of Lent and Advent are still marked by the
                    use of emblems of mourning in the churches, by the frequency of certain phrases
                    (Kyrie eleison, Agnus Dei) and the absence of others (Hallelujah, Gloria in
                    excelsis) in the liturgical services, by abstinence from some of the usual
                    social festivities, and by the non-celebration of marriages. And occasional
                    fasts are more or less familiar. The Church of England has retained a
                    considerable list of fasts; though Hooker <hi rend="italic">(E. P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> v. 72) had to contend with some who, while
                    approving of fastings undertaken “of men’s own free and voluntary accord as
                    their particular devotion doth move them thereunto,” yet “yearly or weekly fasts
                    such as ours in the Church of England they allow no further than as the temporal
                    state of the laud doth require the same for the maintenance of seafaring menaod
                    preservation of cattle; because the decay of the one and the waste of the other
                    could not well be prevented but by a politic order appointing some such usual
                    change of diet as ours is.”</p>
                <p>In the practice of modern Catholicism the following are recognized as fasting
                    days, that is to say, days on which one meal only, and that not of flesh, may be
                    taken in the course of twenty-four hours :—The forty days of Lent (Sundays
                    excepted), all the Ember days, the Wednesdays and Fridays in Advent, and the
                    vigils of certain feasts, namely, those of Whitsuntide, of St Peter and St Paul,
                    of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, of All Saints, and of Christmas
                    day. The following are simply days of abstinence, that is to say, days on which
                    flesh at all events must not be eaten :— The Sundays in Lent, the three Rogation
                    days, the feast of St Mark (unless it falls in Easter week), and all Fridays
                    which are not days of fasting. In the English Church, the “days of fasting or
                    abstinence” are the forty days of Lent, the Ember days, the Rogation days, and
                    all the Fridays in the year, except Christmas day. The evens or vigils before
                    Christmas, the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Annunciation of the
                    Blessed Virgin Mary, Easter day, Ascension day, Pentecost, St Matthias, the
                    Nativity of St John Baptist, St Peter, St James, St Bartholomew, St Matthew, St
                    Simon and St Jude, St Andrew, St Thomas, and All Saints are also recognized as
                    “fast days.” By the 64th canon it is enacted that “every parson, vicar, or
                    curate, shall in his several charge declare to the people every Sunday at the
                    time appointed in the communionbook [which is, after the Nicene creed has been
                    repeated] whether there be any holy-days or fast-days the week following.” The
                    72d canon ordains that “no minister or ministers shall, without licence and
                    direction of the bishop under hand and seal, appoint or keep any solemn fasts,
                    either publicly or in any private houses, other than such as by law are or by
                    public authority shall be appointed, nor shall be wittingly present at any of
                    them under pain of suspension for the first fault, of excommunication for the
                    second, and of deposition from the ministry for the third.” While strongly
                    discouraging the arbitrary multiplication of public or private fasts, the
                    English Church seems to leave to the discretion of the individual conscience
                    every question as to the manner in which the fasts she formally enjoins are to
                    be observed. In this connexion the homily <hi rend="italic">Of Fasting</hi> may
                    be again referred to. By a statute of the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was
                    enacted that none should eat flesh on “fish days” (the Wednesdays, Fridays, and
                    Saturdays throughout the year) without a licence, under a penalty. In the
                    Scottish Presbyterian churches days of “fasting, humiliation, and prayer” are
                    observed by ecclesiastical appointment in each parish once or twice every year
                    on some day of the week preceding the Sunday fixed for the administration of the
                    sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. In some of the New England States, it has been
                    usual for the governor to appoint by proclamation at some time in spring a day
                    of fasting, when religious services are conducted in the churches. National
                    fasts have more than once been observed on special occasions both in this
                    country and in the United States of America.</p>
                <p>On the subject of fasting the views of Aerius are to a large extent shared by
                    modern Protestant moralists. Rothe, for example, who on this point may be
                    regarded as a representative thinker, rejects the idea that fasting i3 a thing
                    meritorious in itself, and is very doubtful of its value even as an aid to
                    devotional feeling. Of course when bodily health and other circumstances require
                    it, it becomes a duty; and as a means of selfdiscipline it may be used with due
                    regard to the claims <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n58/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0058-0049"/> of other duties, and to the fitness of things. In
                    this last aspect, however, habitual temperance will generally be found to be
                    much more beneficial than occasional fasting. It is extremely questionable, in
                    particular, whether fasting be so efficient as it is sometimes supposed to be in
                    protecting against temptation to fleshly sin. The practice has a well
                    ascertained tendency to excite the imagination; and in so far as it disturbs
                    that healthy and well-balanced interaction of body and mind which is the best or
                    at least the normal condition for the practice of virtue, it is to be deprecated
                    rather than encouraged <hi rend="italic">(Theologische Ethik,</hi> sec.
                    873-875).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mahometan Fasts.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Among the
                    Mahometans, the month Ramadan, in which the first part of the Koran is said to
                    have been received, is by command of the prophet observed as a fast with
                    extraordinary rigour. No food or drink of any kind is permitted to be taken from
                    daybreak until the appearance of the stars at nightfall. Extending as it does
                    over the whole “month of raging heat,” such a fast manifestly involves
                    considerable self-denial; and it is absolutely binding upon all the faithful
                    whether at home or abroad. Should its observance at the appointed time be
                    interfered with by sickness or any other cause, the fast must be kept as soon
                    afterwards as possible, for a like number of days. It is the only one which
                    Mahometanism enjoins; but the doctors of the law recommend a considerable number
                    of voluntary fasts, as for example on the tenth day of the month Moharram. This
                    day, called the “Yom Ashoora,” is held sacred on many accounts :—“because it is
                    believed to be the day on which the first meeting of Adam and Eve took place
                    after they were cast out of paradise; and that on which Noah went out from the
                    ark; also because several other great events are said to have happened on this
                    day; and because the ancient Arabs, before the time of the prophet, observed it
                    by fasting. But what, in the opinion of most modern Moslems, and especially the
                    Persians, confers the greatest sanctity on the day of Ashoora is the fact of its
                    being that on which El-Hoseyn, the prophet’s grandson, was slain a martyr at the
                    battle of the plain of Karbala^ It is the practice of many Moslems to fast on
                    this day,* and some do so on the preceding day also. Mahomet himself called
                    fasting the “gate of religion,” and forbade it only on the two great festivals,
                    namely, on that which immediately follows Ramadan and on that which succeeds the
                    pilgrimage. See Lane, <hi rend="italic">Modern Egyptians,</hi> chaps, iii.,
