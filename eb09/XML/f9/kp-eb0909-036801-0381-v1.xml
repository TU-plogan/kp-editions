                <p><label type="entry">FOOTE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label> (c.
                    1720-1777), comic dramatist and actor, was born at Truro about the year 1720. Of
                    his attachment to his native Cornwall he gives no better proofs as an author
                    than by making the country-booby Timothy (in <hi rend="italic">The Knights)</hi>
                    sound the praises of that county and of its manly pastimes; but towards his
                    family he showed a loyal and enduring affection. His father was a man of good
                    family and position; his mother, the daughter of a baronet (Sir Edward Goodere),
                    is said, in person as well as in disposition, to have strongly resembled her
                    famous son. According to tradition, she afterwards fell into pecuniary
                    embarrassments closely analogous to his own; but in the days of his prosperity
                    he liberally supported both her and an unfortunate clerical brother. After her
                    death he indignantly vindicated her character from the imputations recklessly
                    cast upon it by the revengeful spite of the duchess of Kingston. About the time
                    when Foote came of age, a family quarrel between his two maternal uncles ended
                    in the brutal murder, under extraordinary circumstances, of the one by the
                    other, who was, with his accomplices, hanged for the crime. By this event Foote
                    came into his first fortune, through which he ran with great speed in the
                    beginning of his London life. Before this he had completed his education in the
                    collegiate school at Worcester, and at Worcester College, Oxford, distinguishing
                    himself in both places by practical jokes, mimicry, and audacious pleasantries
                    of all kinds, but also acquiring a classical training which afterwards enabled
                    him neatly to turn a classical quotation or allusion, and helped to give to his
                    prose style, when he chose to write seriously, a sufficient degree of fluency
                    and elegance.</p>
                <p>Foote was, it is stated, “designed” for the law, but certainly not by nature. Iu
                    his chambers at the Temple, and in the Grecian Coffee-house hard by, he learned
                    to know something of lawyers if not of law, and picked up a smattering of
                    law-terms, and a knowledge of the forms and features of ordinary law-suits. Thus
                    he was afterwards able to jest at the jurgon and to mimic the mannerisms of the
                    bar, and to satirize the Latitats of the other branch of the profession with
                    particular success. The famous argument in Hobson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Nobson (in <hi rend="italic">The Lame Lovers)</hi> is as good of its kind as
                    that in Bardell <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Pickwick itself; and doubtless Foote
                    had duly studied some of the most ludicrous or contemptible types among the 1175
                    barristers (“if we reckon one barrister to twenty attorneys”) and 23,518
                    attorneys (if we “only quarter one attorney upon fifty houses ”), of whom,
                    according to the lecturer in <hi rend="italic">The Orators,</hi> the profession
                    was in his day composed. But a stronger attraction drew him to the Bedford
                    Coffee-house in Covent Garden, and to the theatrical world of which it was the
                    social centre. After he had got rid of a second fortune (which he appears to
                    have inherited at his father’s death), and had in the interval passed through
                    severe straits of want, he gave up playing the part of a fine gentleman, and in
                    1744 made his first appearance on the actual stage. Whether before this time
                    Foote had married remains a very doubtful question. It is said that about the
                    time of the family catastrophe he had married a young lady in
                    Worcestershire—actually, and not in imagination only, like young Wilding in <hi
                        rend="italic">The Liar·,</hi> but the traces of his wife (he affirmed
                    himself that he was married to his “washerwoman”) are mysterious, and probably
                    apocryphal; in after days no lady presided at his table, or controlled the
                    libations of claret which flowed with equal abundance in his servants’ hall, and
                    his two sons were illegitimate.</p>
                <p>Foote’s first appearance as an actor was made little more than two years after
                    that of Garrick, as to whose merits the critics, including Foote himself, were
                    now fiercely at war. His own first venture, as Othello, was a failure; and
                    though he was fairly successful in genteel comedy parts, and was, after a
                    favourable reception at Dublin, enrolled as one of the regular company at Drury
                    Lane in the winter of 1745-6, he had not as yet made any palpable hit. Finding
                    that his talent lay neither in tragedy nor in genteel comedy, he had begun to
                    wonder (as he tersely expressed it) “where the devil it <hi rend="italic"
                        >did</hi> lie,” when his successful performance of the part of Bayes in <hi
                        rend="italic">The Rehearsal</hi> at last suggested to him the true outlet
                    for his peculiar talent. Following the example of Garrick, he had introduced
                    into this famous part imitations of actors, and had added a variety of other
                    satirical comment in the way of what in stage parlance is called “gag.” He lost
                    no time in availing himself of the discovery that in his powers of mimicry lay
                    his surest means of securing a hold over the public. After engaging a small
                    company of actors, he boldly announced for April 22, 1747, at the theatre in the
                    Haymarket <hi rend="italic">{“gratis”), “</hi> a new entertainment called the
                        <hi rend="italic">Diversions of the Morning,”</hi> to which were to be added
                    a farce adapted from Congreve, and an epilogue “spoken by the B—d—d
                    Coffee-house.’ Though, of course, nine-tenths of the fun in all such
                    entertainments would evaporate even in a shorthand report, and though of these
                        <hi rend="italic">Diversions</hi> it is only possible to form a notion from
                    scattered recollections and from such parts as were afterwards incorporated in
                    one of Foote’s comedies <hi rend="italic">{Taste,</hi> act i.), or adapted for
                    later reproduction at Drury Lane (act ii, printed in Cooke’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoirs),</hi> yet there is no difficulty in understanding the secret of
                    Foote’s immediate success, which is said at once to have obtained for him the
                    name of “the English Aristophanes.” The absurdity of this compliment has often
                    been remarked upon; but it may be worth observing that Foote was probably
                    himself the first (in his letter on <hi rend="italic">The Minor)</hi> to decline
                    the comparison, while “leaving the task of pointing out the mistake to his
                    enemies.” The <hi rend="italic">Diversions</hi> consisted of a series of
                    imitations of actors and other well-known persons, whose various peculiarities
                    of voice, gesture, manner, or dress were brought directly before the spectators;
                    while the epilogue introduced the wits of the Bedford engaged in ludicrous
                    disputation, and specially “took off” an eminent physician and a notorious quack
                    oculist of the day. The actors ridiculed in this entertainment having at once
                    procured the aid of the constables for preventing its repetition, Foote
                    immediately advertised an invitation to his friends to drink a dish of tea with
                    him at the Haymarket on the following day at noon—“and ’ tis hoped there will be
                    a great deal of comedy and some joyous spirits; he will endeavour to make the
                    morning as diverting as possible. Tickets for this entertainment to be had at St
                    George’s Coffee-house, Temple-Bar, without which no person will be admitted.
                    N.B.— <hi rend="italic">Sir Dilbury Diddle will be there, and Lady Betty Frisk
                        has absolutely promised.”</hi> The device succeeded to perfection; further
                    resistance was abandoned as futile by the actors, whom Foote mercilessly
                    ridiculed in the “instructions to his pupils” which the entertainer pretended to
                    impart (typifying them under characters embodying their several chief
                    peculiarities or defects—the massive and sonorous Quin as a watchman, the
                    shrill-voiced Ryan as a razor-grinder, the charming <pb break="no"

                    squeak in them, as an orange-woman crying her wares and the bill of the play);
                    and Mr Foote’s <hi rend="italic">Chocolate,</hi> which was afterwards converted
                    into an evening <hi rend="italic">Tea,</hi> became an established favourite with
                    the town.</p>
                <p>The way to fame and its fruits having now at last been found, the remainder of
                    Foote’s professional career was on the whole prosperous enough. He seems,
                    indeed, after this to have contrived to spend a third fortune, and to have found
                    it necessary to eke out his means by a speculation in small-beer, as is recorded
                    in an amusing anecdote told of him by Johnson. But whatever abstract arguments
                    ho might find in favour of the life of a man in debt and against the practice of
                    “muddling away money in tradesmen’s bills,” he could now command a considerable
                    income; and when money came he seems (like a true actor) to have freely divided
                    it between the pleasures of hospitality and the claims of charity. During his
                    engagements at Covent Garden and at Drury Lane (of which he was, in passing,
                    joint-manager), and in professional trips to Scotland, and more especially to
                    Ireland, he appeared both in comedies of other authors and more especially in
                    his own. Among the latter, of which something will be said below, <hi
                        rend="italic">Taste</hi> (1752) is the first of a series numbering
                    (exclusively of the <hi rend="italic">Diversions</hi> and one or two similar
                    pieces) eighteen. The majority of them were produced at the Haymarket, which
                    continued the favourite home of Foote’s entertainments, and for which in 1760 he
                    succeeded in obtaining a licence from the lord chamberlain, afterwards (in 1766)
                    converted into a licence for summer performances for life. The entertainments in
                    question may be briefly described as a succession of variations on the original
                    idea of the <hi rend="italic">Diversions</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tea.</hi> Now, it was an <hi rend="italic">Auction of Pictures</hi> (1748),
                    of part of which an idea may be formed from the second act of the comedy <hi
                        rend="italic">Taste;</hi> now, a lecture on <hi rend="italic">Orators</hi>
                    (1754), suggested by some bombastic discourses given by Macklin in his old age
                    at the Piazza Coffee-house in Covent Garden, where Foote had amused the audience
                    and confounded the speaker by interposing his humorous comments. <hi
                        rend="italic">The Orators</hi> is preserved in the shape of a hybrid piece,
                    which begins with a mock lecture on the art of oratory and its representatives
                    in England, and ends with a very diverting scene of a pot-house forum debate, to
                    which Holberg’s <hi rend="italic">Politician-Tinman</hi> can hardly have been a
                    stranger. At a later date (1773) a new device was introduced in a <hi
                        rend="italic">Puppet-show,</hi> and it is a pity that the piece played in
                    this by the puppets should not have been committed to print. It was called <hi
                        rend="italic">Piety in Pattens,</hi> and professed to show “by the moral how
                    maidens of low degree might become rich from the mere effects of morality and
                    virtue, and by the literature how thoughts the most commonplace might be
                    concealed under cover of words the most high flown.” In other words, it was an
                    attack upon sentimental comedy, to which more than one blow had been already
                    dealt, but which was still not altogether extinguished. Indeed, though no one
                    now reads <hi rend="italic">Pamela,</hi> it may be doubted whether she and her
                    cousinhood will ever be altogether suppressed on the modem stage. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Puppet-show</hi> was also to have contained a witty attack
                    upon Garrick in connexion with the notorious Shakespeare jubilee; but this was
                    withdrawn, and thus was avoided α recurrence of the quarrel which many years
                    before had led to an interchange of epistolary thrusts, when the manager of
                    Drury Lane had permitted Woodward to attempt an imitation of Foote. On the
                    whole, the relations between the two public favourites were very friendly, and
                    on Foote’s part (notwithstanding a number of witticisms directed especially
                    against Garrick’s interest in Queen Anne’s farthings and the like) unmistakably
                    affectionate; and they have been by no means fairly, or at least generously,
                    represented by Garrick’s most recent biographer. A comparison between the two as
                    actors is of course out of the question; but, though Foote was a buffoon, and
                    his tongue a scurrilous tongue, there is nothing in the well-authenticated
                    records of his life to suggest that his character was one of malicious
                    heartlessness. On the other hand, it was not altogether the fault of his
                    position that he was unable to conciliate the respect of society, though, unlike
                    Garrick, he could hardly have expected to form one of the chosen circle into
                    which (though not without protest) the former gained admittance. It is at the
                    same time characteristic of the difference between the London of that day and
                    the London of our own, where club secrets are among the favourite morsels of
                    public gossip, that the famous Club had been ten years in existence before Foote
                    knew of it. Of Johnson’s opinions of him many well-known records remain in
                    Boswell; and if it is remembered that when Johnson had at last found his way
                    into Foote’s company (he afterwards found it to Foote’s own table) he was unable
                    to “resist” him, it should likewise not be forgotten that on hearing of Foote’s
                    death he recognized his career as worthy of a lasting biographical record.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile most of poor Foote’s friendships in high life were probably those that
                    are sworn across the table, and require “t’other bottle” to keep them up. It is
                    not a pleasant picture—of Lord Mexborough and his royal guest the duke of York,
                    and their companions, bantering Foote on his ignorance of horsemanship, and
                    after he had weakly protested his skill, taking him out to hounds on a dangerous
                    animal. He was thrown and broke his leg, which had to be amputated, the
                    “patientee” (in which character he said he was now making his first appearance)
                    consoling himself with the reflexion that he would now be able to take off “old
                    Faulkner” (a pompous Dublin alderman with a wooden leg, whom he had brought on
                    the stage as Peter Paragraph in <hi rend="italic">The Orators) “</hi> to the
                    life.” The duke of York made him the best reparation in his power by promising
                    him a life-patent for the theatre in the Haymarket (1766); and Foote not only
                    resumed his profession, as if, like Sir Luke Limp, he considered the leg he had
                    lost “a redundancy, a mere nothing at all,” but ingeniously turned his
                    misfortune to account in two of his later pieces, <hi rend="italic">The Lame
                        Lover</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Devil on Two Sticks,</hi> while, with
                    the true instinct of a public favourite, making constant reference to it in
                    plays and prologues. He seemed to have lost none of his energy with his leg,
                    though it may be observed that the characters played by him in several of his
                    later plays are comparatively short and light. He continued to retain his hold
                    over the public, and about the year 1774 was beginning to think of withdrawing,
                    at least for a time, to the Continent, when he became involved in what proved a
                    fatal personal quarrel. Neither in his entertainments nor in his comedies had he
                    hitherto (except in Garrick’s case, and it is said in Johnson’s) put the
                    slightest restraint upon the personal satire by which he terrified his victims
                    and delighted their neighbours. One of his earlier experiments of this kind <hi
                        rend="italic">(The Author),</hi> in which, under the infinitely humorous
                    character of Cadwallader, he had brought a Welsh gentlemen of the name of
                    Ap-Rice on the stage, had, indeed, ultimately led to the suppression of the
                    play. But, to an extent of which it is impossible fully to judge, he had pursued
                    his hazardous course, mercilessly exposing to public ridicule and contempt not
                    only fribbles and pedants, quacks or supposed quacks in medicine (as in <hi

                    in religion, such as Dr Dodd (in <hi rend="italic">The Cozeners)</hi> and

                    pundits who rationalized away Whittington’s Cat, of Horace Walpole and other
                    eminent members of the body, but had <pb break="no"

                    representative of a very influential though detested element in English society,
                    the “Nabobs” themselves. But there was one species of cracked porcelain or
                    blemished reputation which he was not to try to hold up to contempt with
                    impunity. The rumour of his intention to bring upon the stage, in the character
                    of Lady Kitty Crocodile in <hi rend="italic">The Trip to Calais,</hi> the
                    notorious duchess of Kingston, whose trial for bigamy was then (1775) impending,
                    roused his intended victim to the utmost fury; and the means and influence she
                    had at her disposal enabled her, not only to prevail upon the lord chamberlain
                    to prohibit the performance of the piece (in which, it should be observed, there
                    is no hint as to the charge of bigamy itself), but to hire agents to vilify
                    Foote⅛ character in every way that hatred and malice could suggest. After he had
                    withdrawn the piece, and letters had been exchanged between the duchess and him
                    equally characteristic of their respective writers, Foote took his revenge upon
                    the chief of the duchess’s instruments, a “Reverend Doctor” Jackson, who
                    belonged to the “reptile ’’society of the journalists of the day, so admirably
                    satirized by Foote in his comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Bankrupt.</hi> This
                    man he gibbeted in the character of Viper in <hi rend="italic">The
                        Capuchin,</hi> under which name the altered <hi rend="italic">Trip to
                        Calais</hi> was performed in 1776. But the resources of his enemies were not
                    yet at an end; and a discharged servant of Foote’s was suborned by Jackson to
                    bring a charge and apply for a warrant against him. Though the attempt utterly
                    broke down, and Foote’s character was thus completely cleared, his health and
                    spirits had given way in the struggle—as to which, though he seems to have had
                    the firm support of the better part of the public, including such men as Burke
                    and Reynolds, the very audiences of his own theatre had been, or had seemed to
                    be, divided in opinion. He thus resolved to withdraw, at least for a time, from
                    the effects of the storm, let his theatre to Colman, and after making his last
                    appearance there in May 1777, set forth in October on a journey to France. But
                    at Dover he fell sick on the day after his arrival there, and after a few hours
                    died (October 21st). His epitaph in St Mary’s Church at Dover (written by his
                    faithful treasurer Jewel) records that he had a hand “open as day for melting
                    charity.” His resting-place in Westminster Abbey is without any memorial; nor
                    indeed is it the actor’s usual lot to receive from posterity any recognition
                    which the contemporaries whom he has delighted have denied to him.</p>
                <p>Foote’s chief power as an actor must clearly have lain in his extraordinarygift
                    of mimicry, which extended, as the best kind of mimicry always does, to the
                    mental and moral, as well as the mere outward and physical peculiarities of the
                    personages whose likeness he assumed. He must have possessed a wonderful
                    flexibility of voice, though his tones are said to have been harsh when his
                    voice was not disguised, and an incomparable readiness for rapidly assuming
                    characters, both in his entertainments and in his comedies, where he
                    occasionally “doubled” parts. The excellent “patter” of some of his plays, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">The Liar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Cozeners,</hi> must
                    have greatly depended for its effect upon rapidity of delivery. In person he
                    seems to have been by nature ill-qualified for light comedy parts, being rather
                    short and stout, and coarse-featured; but the humour with which he overflowed is
                    said to have found full expression in the irresistible sparkle of his eyes.</p>
                <p>As a dramatic author, although he displays certain distinctive characteristics of
                    indisputable brilliancy, he can only be assigned a subordinate rank. He was
                    himself anxious to limit the definition of comedy to “an exact representation of
                    the peculiar manners of that people among whom it happens to be performed; a
                    faithful imitation of singular absurdities, particular follies, which are openly
                    produced, as criminals are publicly punished, for the correction of individuals
                    and as an example to the whole community.” This he regarded as the <hi
                        rend="italic">utile,</hi> or useful purpose, of comedy; the <hi
                        rend="italic">dulce</hi> he conceived to be “the fable, the construction,
                    machinery, conduct, plot, and incidents of the piece.” For part at least of this
                    view (advanced by him in the spirited and scholarly “Letter” in which he replied
                    “to the Reverend Author of the ‘ Remarks, Critical and Christian,’ on <hi
                        rend="italic">The Minor</hi> ’’), he rather loftily appealed to classical
                    authority. But he failed to point out the relation between the <hi rend="italic"
                        >utile</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">dulce,</hi> and to remember the
                    indispensableness of the latter to the comic drama under its primary aspect as a
                    species of art. His comic genius was particularly happy in discovering and
                    reproducing characters deserving of ridicule; for “affectation,” he says (in the
                    introduction to <hi rend="italic">The Minor,</hi> where he appears in person),
                    “I take to be the true comic object ;” but he failed in putting them to true
                    artistic use. That he not only took his chief characters from real life, but
                    closely modelled them on well-known living men and women, was not in himself an
                    artistic sin, though it may have been a practice of doubtful social expediency,
                    as it certainly involved considerable personal risk. Nor was the novelty of this
                    absolute, but rather one of degree and quantity; other comic dramatists before
                    and after him have done the same thing, though probably no other has ever gone
                    so far in this course, or has pursued it so persistently. The public delighted
                    in his “d d fine originals,” because it recognized them as copies; and he was
                    himself proud that he had taken them from real persons, instead of their being
                    “vamped from antiquated plays, pilfered from the French farces, or the baseless
                    beings of the poet’s brain.” But the real excellence of Foote’s comic characters
                    lies in the fact that, besides being incomparably ludicrous types of manners,
                    many of them remain admirable comic types of general human nature. Sir Gregory
                    Gazette, and his imbecile appetite for news; Lady Pentweazel, and her
                    preposterous vanity in her superannuated charms; Mr Cadwallader, and his view of
                    the advantages of public schools (where children may “make acquaintances that
                    may hereafter be useful to them; for between you and I, as to what they learn
                    there, does not signify twopence ”); Major Sturgeon and Jerry Sneak; Sir Thomas
                    Lofty, Sir Luke Limp, Mrs Mechlin, and a score or two of other characters, are
                    excellent comic figures in themselves, whatever their origin; and many of the
                    vices and weaknesses exposed by Foote’s vigorous satire will remain the
                    perennial subjects of comic treatment so long as a stage exists. The real defect
                    of his plays lies in the abnormal weakness of their construction, in the
                    absolute contempt which the great majority of them show for the invention or
                    conduct of a plot, and in the unwarrantable subordination of the interest of the
                    action to the exhibition of particular characters. In a good play, whether it be
                    tragedy or comedy, the characters are developed out of and by means of the
                    action; but of this there is little trace in Foote. His characters are
                    ready-made, and the action is only incidental to them. With the exception of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Liar</hi> (which Foote pretended to have taken from Lope
                    de Vega, but which was really founded on Steele’s adaptation of Corneille’s Ze
                        <hi rend="italic">Menteur),</hi> and perhaps of <hi rend="italic">The
                        Bankrupt,</hi> there is hardly one of Foote’s “comedies” in which the
                    conception and conduct of the action rise above the exigencies of the merest
                    farce. Not that sentimental scenes and even sentimental characters are wanting,
                    that virtue is not occasionally in distress, or fails to vindicate itself
                    triumphantly from the semblance of vice; but these familiar procedures are as
                    incapable of exciting real interest as the ordinary course of a farcical action
                    is in itself calculated to produce more than the most transitory amusement. In
                    his earlier plays Foote constantly resorts to the most hackneyed device of
                    farce—a disguise —which helps on the progress of a slender fable for which
                    nobody cares to a close which everybody foresees. Of course Foote must have been
                    well aware of the defect under which his rapidly manufactured productions
                    laboured; he knew that if he might sneer at “genteel comedy” as suited to the
                    dramatists of the servants’ hall, and pronounce the arts of the drama at the
                    great houses to be “directed by the genius of insipidity,” he, like the little
                    theatre where he held sway, was looked upon as “an eccentric, a mere summer
                    fly.”</p>
                <p>His merits as a comic dramatist are not, however, obscured by his incontestable
                    defects. He was inexhaustible in the devising of comic scenes of genuine farce,
                    in which the humour and wit of the dialogue are on a level with the general
                    excellence of the conception. An oration of “old masters,” an election of a
                    suburban mayor, an examination at the College of Physicians, a newspaper
                    conclave where paragraphs are concocted and reputations massacred—all these and
                    other equally happy scenes are brought before the mere reader with unfailing
                    vividness. And everywhere the comic dialogue is instinct with spirit and vigour,
                    and the comic characters are true to themselves with a buoyancy which at once
                    raises them above the level of mere theatrical conventionalism. Foote professed
                    to despise the mere caricaturing of national peculiarities as such, and
                    generally used dialect as a mere additional colouring; he was, however, too wide
                    awake to the demands of his public not to treat France and Frenchmen as fair
                    game, and perhaps there is nothing coarser in hιs plays than this constant
                    appeal to national patriotic prejudice. His satire against those everlasting
                    victims of English comedy and farce, the Englishman in Paris and the Englishman
                    returned from Paris, was doubtless well warranted; and he was not slow to point
                    out the fact—which Englishmen are wont to conceal when they come home from their
                    travels—that they are nowhere more addicted to the society of their countrymen
                    than abroad. In general, the purposes of Foote’s social satire are excellent,
                    and the abuses against which it is directed are those which it required courage
                    to attack. The tone of his morality is healthy, and his language, though not
                    aiming at refinement, is remarkably free from <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0384-0371"/> intentional grossness. Like all professed
                    humorists, he made occasional mistakes; but he, too, was on the right side in
                    the warfare against the pretentiousness of Cant and the effrontery of Vice, the
                    two master evils of the age and the society in which he lived.</p>

                <p>Foote’s biography may be read in W. (“Conversation”) Cooke’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoirs of Samuel Foote</hi> (3 vols., 1805), which contain a large
                    collection of his good things and of anecdotes concerning him, besides two of
                    his previously unpublished occasional pieces (with the act of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Diversions</hi> in a later form already mentioned), and an
                    admixture of extraneous matter. From this source seems to have been mainly taken
                    the biographical information in the rather grandiloquent essay on Foote prefixed
                    to “Jon Bee’s/ useful edition of Foote’s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (3 vols.
                    1830). But few readers will care to go further than to the essay on Foote,
                    reprinted with additions, from the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> in
                    the late Mr Forster’s <hi rend="italic">Biographical Essays</hi>; and none can
                    fare better than those who turn to this delightful and discriminating study of a
                    man of real though peculiar genius. (A.W.W.)</p>
