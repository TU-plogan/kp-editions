                    measure for distributing <hi rend="italic">virüim</hi> among the plebeians, in
                    terms of the Licinian law, the ager Gallicus Picenus, an extensive tract of
                    newly-acquired territory lying along the east coast of the peninsula to the
                    south of Ariminum. This law was carried in face of the determined opposition of
                    the entire senatorial party, who, according to Valerius Maximus (lib. v., c. 4,
                    sec. 5), at one stage threatened to declare him a public enemy and raise an army
                    against him should he persevere in his agitation. In 227 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> he was appointed praetor, Sicily being assigned to him as his
                    province; and there he so conducted himself as to win the. lasting gratitude of
                    the people whom he governed. This they took occasion to show thirty years
                    afterwards when his son was curule aedile. In 223 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    he was made consul, and, along with his colleague P. Furius Philus, hastened at
                    once to the north to prosecute the Gallic war, which had been occasioned, it is
                    said, by the operation of his own agrarian law, and which had been going on with

                    Γo near the site of Piacenza, he sustained a check which compelled him to
                    capitulate. The facile Insubres having granted him a free retreat, he speedily,
                    in conjunction with the Cenomani, renewed the attack at another point, perhaps
                    on the river Oglio. On this occasion he was successful; but it seems very
                    doubtful whether the victory was not gained in spite of rather than by means of
                    the generalship of the consul. At all events his conquest of the Insubres failed
                    to make any impression on the aristocratic party who had opposed his election
                    and afterwards sought to obtain his recall; and the honours of a triumph were
                    awarded to him only when the negative decision of the senate had been overborne
                    by the popular voice. According to Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Marcelliis,</hi>
                    4) he was nevertheless compelled to resign his office before the natural term
                    had expired. In 221 he was chosen magister equitum under the dictatorship of Μ.
                    Minucius Rufus, but was not permitted to take office owing to a bad omen—the
                    squeaking of a shrew-mouse—which had occurred immediately after the election. In
                    the following year (220 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) he was censor; and this
                    period of office was marked by the execution of two great public works which are
                    permanently associated with his name—a circus and a road. The Circus Flaminius,
                    erected in a locality which had previously been known as the Prata Flaminia, was
                    dèsigned for the accommodation of the plebeians, especially for their public
                    meetings,—they having no right at that period to sit in the Circus Maximus. The
                    Via Flaminia was the first to be carried across the Apennines, thus connecting
                    the Adriatic and Tuscan seas. It was a continuation of the old military road
                    which had been carried as far as to Spoletium (Spoleto) in 240 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> From Spoletium it went to Fulginium (Foligno) and
                    Forum Flaminii (San Giovanni in Fori-fiamma); thence it mounted the Apennine
                    slope to the station Ad Ensem (La Schieggia), crossing the central ridge at what
                    is now know n as the pass of Furlo, and descending by the valley of the Metaurus
                    to Fanum Fortunae (Fano), whence it kept the coast as far as to Ariminum. In 218
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as a leader of the democratic opposition,
                    Flaminius was one of the chief promoters of the measure brought in by the
                    tribune Claudius, which prohibited senators and senators’ sons from possessing
                    seagoing vessels, except such as might be necessary for the transport of the
                    produce of their own estates, and generally shut them out from everything which
                    the Romans included under the category of commercial speculation (quaestus),
                    such as undertaking public contracts (redemptiones), and the like. The effective
                    support which he had given to this measure vastly increased the popularity of
                    Flaminius with his own order, and secured his second election as consul in the
                    following year (217 B.C.), shortly after the defeat of Sempronius at the Trebia.
                    Without staying to go through the usual solemnities of installation at the
                    Capitol, or to celebrate the feriae Latinae, Flaminius at once hastened to
                    Ariminum and thence to Arretium, there to be ready for an aggressive campaign
                    against Hannibal as soon as the roads should be open. Meanwhile Hannibal, uneasy
                    in his winter quarters, had accomplished with comparative ease the passage of
                    the Apennines, and forced his way southward across the flooded plains of the
                    lower Arno. The consul, fearing lest the enemy should find Rome unprotected,
                    impetuously set out in pursuit. Free to select his own ground, Hannibal chose to
                    make his stand between Borghetto and Passignano, in the narrow defile formed by
                    the hills of Cortona, which is dosed at its entrance by the Trasimene lake. With
                    the main body of his infantry he barred the further outlet at the hill of Torre,
                    while the light troops and the cavalry were posted on the sides of the pass. It
                    was early morning (on the 23d of June, according to the uncorrected calendar,
                    but in reality on some day in April)<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    a thick haze covering hill and lake altogether concealed the position and even
                    the existence of the enemy, until the Roman army found itself completely and
                    hopelessly surrounded in the fatal defile. In the three hours’ carnage that
                    followed 15,000 Romans perished, and Flaminius was among the slain.</p>
                <p>From the materials which Livy and Polybius—no friendly critics—furnish, it is
                    manifest that Flaminius was a man of ability, energy, and probity, who with the
                    bravery of a true soldier combined many of the best qualities of a popular
                    democratic leader. While eminent, however, as the head of a political party, and
                    successful in carrying some pieces of useful legislation, he has little or no
                    claim to rank among the greater statesmen of the republic. As a general,
                    moreover, he was headstrong and self-sufficient, and he seems to have owed such
                    victories as he achieved to personal boldness favoured by good fortune rather
                    than to any superiority of strategical skill (see Livy, xxi., xxii.; Polybius,
                    ii., iii.).</p>
