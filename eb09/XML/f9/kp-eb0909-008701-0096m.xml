                    time accidentally awakened on seeing his father making use of a lever to raise a
                    part of the roof of his house—an exhibition of seeming strength which at first
                    “excited his terror as well as wonder.” On discovering how the seeming wonder
                    was effected, he began experiments with the view of improving on the simple
                    lever his father had made use of; and although he soon learned that all his
                    inventions had been anticipated, he was so well pleased to find his principles
                    confirmed that his passion for the study of mechanics was increased rather than
                    diminished. As soon as his age permitted he was sent to a neighbouring farm to
                    keep sheep, where in the day time he amused himself by making models of mills
                    and other machines, and at night in studying the stars. Afterwards, as a servant
                    with a miller, and then with a doctor, he met with hardships which rendered his
                    constitution feeble through life. Being compelled by his weak health to return
                    home, he there amused himself with making a wooden clock. When slightly
                    recovered he showed this and some other inventions to a neighbouring gentleman,
                    who engaged him to clean his clocks, and also desired him to make his house his
                    home. He there, at the suggestion of a lady visitor, commenced to draw patterns
                    for needle work, and his success in this art led him to think of becoming a
                    painter. Through the assistance of the same lady he was at length sent to
                    Edinburgh, where, having obtained some instruction in drawing, he began to take
                    portraits in miniature, by which means, while engaged in his scientific studies,
                    he supported himself and his family for many years. On account of the success of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Astronomiccd</hi><hi rend="italic">Rotula,</hi> he
                    determined, in 1743, to leave Edinburgh for London, where he published some
                    curious astronomical tables and calculations, and afterwards gave public
                    lectures on experimental philosophy. These he repeated in most of the principal
                    towns in England. His deep interest in his subject, his clear explanations, his
                    ingeniously constructed diagrams, and his mechanical apparatus rendered him one
                    of the most successful of popular lecturers on scientific subjects. It is,
                    however, as the inventor and improver of astronomical and other scientific
                    apparatus, and as a striking instance of self-education, that he claims a place
                    among the most remarkable men of science of his country. His manners were
                    unaffected and courteous, and his life simple, studious, and irreproachable. In
                    1763 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1770 a member of the
                    American Philosophical Society. During the latter years of his life he was in
                    receipt of a pension of £50 from the privy purse. He died in London 17th
                    November 1776.</p>
