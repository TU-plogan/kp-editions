                    trained to the study of art in Flanders. Son of a stone-cutter, Cornelis de
                    Vriendt, who died at Antwerp in 1538, he began life as a student of sculpture,

                    in Italy had transformed a style truly Flemish into that of a mongrel
                    Leonardesque. Following in the footsteps of Mabuse, Lambert Lombard had visited
                    Florence, and caught the manner of Salviati and other pupils of Michelangelo and
                    Del Sarto. It was about the time when Schoreel, Coxcie, and Heemskerk, after
                    migrating to Rome and imitating the masterpieces of Raphael and Buonarroti, came
                    home to execute Dutch-Italian works beneath the level of those produced in the
                    peninsula itself by Leonardo da Pistoia, Nanaccio, and Rinaldo of Mantua. Fired
                    by these examples, Floris in his turn wandered across the Alps, and appropriated
                    without assimilation the various mannerisms of the schools of Lombardy,
                    Florence, and Rome. Bold, quick, and resolute, he saw how easy it would be to
                    earn a livelihood and acquire a name by drawing for engraversand painting on a
                    large scale after the fashion of Vasari. He came home, joined the guild of
                    Antwerp in 1540, and quickly opened a school from which 120 disciples are stated
                    to have issued. Floris painted strings of large pictures for the country houses
                    of Spanish nobles and the villas of Antwerp patricians. He is known to have
                    illustrated the fable of Hercules in ten compositions, and the liberal arts in
                    seven, for Claes Jongeling, a merchant of Antwerp, and adorned the duke of
                    Arschot’s palace of Beaumont with fourteen colossal panels. Comparatively few of
                    his works have descended to us, partly because they came to be contemned for
                    their inherent defects, and so were suffered to perish, partly because they were
                    soon judged by a different standard from that of the Flemings of the 16th
                    century. The earliest extant canvas by Floris is the Mars and Venus ensnared by
                    Vulcan in the Berlin Museum (1547), the latest a Last Judgment (1566) in the
                    Brussels gallery. Neither these nor any of the intermediate works at Alost,
                    Antwerp, Copenhagen, Dresden, Florence, Léau, Madrid, St Petersburg, and Vienna
                    display any charm of originality in composition or in form. Whatever boldness
                    and force they may possess, or whatever principles they may embody, they are
                    mere appropriations of Italian models spoiled in translation or adaptation.
                    Their technical execution reveals a rapid hand, but none of the lustre of bright
                    colouring; and it is not too much to say that whilst Floris failed to acquire
                    absolute mastery over design as improved by the Italians, he was equally devoid
                    of the gifts which distinguish the earlier colourists of Flanders. Vasari justly
                    praises the plates engraved by contemporaries from the drawings of Floris, but
                    he adds that these plates would have been better had the skill of the
                    draughtsman been more ably seconded by that of the engraver. A more temperate
                    judgment will probably be that Floris owed much of his repute to the cleverness
                    with which his works were transferred to copper by Jerome Cock and Theodore de
                    Galle. Whilst Floris was engaged on a Crucifixion of 27 feet, and a Resurrection
                    of equal size, for the Grand Prior of Spain, he was seized with illness, and
                    died on the 1st of October 1570 at Antwerp. His burial took place three days
                    later in the cemetery of the Récollets.</p>
