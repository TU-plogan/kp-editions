                    (1688-1749), a French scholar, one of the most learned men of his age, was born
                    at Paris, February 7 or 15, 1688. His father was <hi rend="italic"
                        >procureur</hi> to the parliament of Paris, and destined him to the
                    profession of the law. His passion for knowledge declared itself almost from his
                    birth; and so early did he apply himself to studies of the most diverse kind,
                    and accumulate vast stores of information, that he scarcely seemed to have any
                    childhood. His precocity in learning and literary labour appears to rival even
                    that of John Stuart Mill. He had for his tutors the historian Rollin and Father
                    Desmolets. Amongst his early studies history, chronology, and mythology held a
                    prominent place. To please his father he studied law and began to practice as a
                    pleader; but the force of his genius soon carried him into his own path. At
                    nineteen he was admitted to a society of learned men who sought more freedom of
                    discussion than was to be had within the Academy, and he read before them
                    memoirs on the religion of the Greeks, on the worship of Bacchus, of Ceres, of
                    Cybele, and of Apollo. The astonishing reputation which he gained for learning,
                    and the influence of the eminent men whose friendship he enjoyed, opened the way
                    for his recognition by the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0804-0769"/> Academy. He was hardly twenty-six years of
                    age when he was admitted as pupil to the Academy of Inscriptions. One of the
                    first memoirs which he read was a learned and critical discourse <hi
                        rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine des
                        Français.</hi> His views, well-grounded, unusual, and audacious, excited
                    great indignation in the Abbé Vertot, who had written on the same subject in a
                    manner more flattering to the vanity of Frenchmen, and he denounced Fréret to
                    the Government as a libeller of the monarchy. A <hi rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de cachet</hi> was issued, and Fréret was sent to the
                    Bastille. He was thus silenced on the perilous subject, and his memoir even
                    remained unpublished till nearly fifty years after his death. During his six
                    months of confinement—“a solitude,” he says, “whose tranquillity there was
                    nothing to disturb”—he devoted himself to the study of the works of Xenophon,
                    the fruit of which appeared later in his memoir on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cyropadia.</hi> The assertion, frequently repeated, that he was allowed to
                    read nothing but Bayle’s famous <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> and that he
                    nearly learnt it by heart and imbibed all its scepticism, is entirely untrue and
                    unjust. From the time of his liberation in June 1715 his life was uneventful. It
                    was a life of the most simple, pure, and complete devotion to knowledge, with
                    absolute indifference to fame. In January 1716 he was received associate of the
                    Academy, and in December 1742 he was made perpetual secretary. He lived and
                    laboured without internïission for the interests and the honour of the Academy,
                    not even claiming any property in his own writings, which almost all remained
                    unpublished till after his death. The list of his memoirs occupies four columns
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Biographie Générale.</hi> They treat of a
                    large variety of subjects, chiefly in the fields of history, chronology,
                    geography, mythology, and religion. Throughout he appears as the keen, learned,
                    and original critic; examining into the comparative value and credibility of
                    documents, distinguishing between the mythical and the historical, and
                    separating traditions with an historical element from pure fables and legends.
                    He rejected the extreme pretensions of the chronology of Egypt and China, and at
                    the same time controverted the scheme of Sir Isaac Newton as too limited. He
                    investigated the mythology not only of the Greeks, but of the Celts, the
                    Germans, the Chinese, and the Indians, and was a vigorous opponent of
                    “euhemeristic” interpretation. He w as one of the first scholars of Europe to
                    undertake the study of the Chinese language: and in this he was engaged at the
                    time of his committal to the Bastille. In addition to these labours and
                    acquirements Fréret made himself master of modern literature, and was intimately
                    acquainted with the dramatic works of the French, Italian, English, and Spanish
                    poets. His multifarious pursuits left him no time for carrying on the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the Academy, an enormous
                    arrear of which had to be made up by his successor. He died at Paris, March 8,
                    1749.</p>
                <p>Long after his death several works of an atheistic character were falsely
                    attributed to him, and were long believed to be his. These were the <hi

                    They were republished under the title of <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres
                        philosophiques</hi> in 1776. It is now believed that they were put forth in
                    Fréret’s name by Holbach, Naigeon, and Lagrange, and that Fréret had nothing
                    whatever to do with them. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> very defective and inaccurate
                    edition of Fréret’s works was published in 1796-1799. A new and complete edition
                    was projected by Cham-ρollion-Figeac, but of this only the first volume appeared
                    (1825). His manuscripts, after passing through many hands, were deposited in the
                    library of the Institute.</p>
