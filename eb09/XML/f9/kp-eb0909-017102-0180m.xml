                <p><label type="entry">FINANCE</label></p>
                <p>IN the 13th and 14th centuries, the words finare, finacio, and financia were
                    employed, principally by writers in France, to denote those bargains by which
                    the indefinite liabilities of ancient tenures were commuted for fixed sums
                    payable to the immediate lord of the tenant. It was at this time that the
                    commutation became general, except when the service of the tenant was of a
                    military or dignified character. Even here, however, a remarkable innovation was
                    made at an early period in English social history, on which we shall comment
                    presently. In course of time the word finance became nearly synonymous with the
                    product of taxation, and the finances of a country (though the phrase is
                    sometimes used to denote the aggregate revenues of those who are liable to
                    taxation) are understood to be the ways and means by which the expenditure of
                    government, imperial and local, are met. In the present article we shall deal
                    with the history of finance only. Under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Taxation,</hi> the reader will find an analysis of the economical theory, in
                    accordance with which taxation is shown to be innocuous and equitable, or the
                    reverse.</p>
                <p>The most ancient forms of finance have always been taxes on produce. Such appear
                    to have been the taxes of ancient Egypt; such were and still are the principal
                    taxes of Turkey and Hindustan. Whatever may have been the character of the first
                    agricultural settlement, the development of a central government has always been
                    assisted by a theory that the true lordship of the soil is the property of the
                    state or the ruler, on which the immediate occupant of the soil is dependent,
                    and to which a portion of the produce is due. The conquests of Rome always
                    involved a confiscation of the vanquished nation’s land, and the re-grant of a
                    portion of the confiscated estate on what we might call by analogy a base
                    tenure. In the same way, when in the 10th and 11th centuries the Christianized
                    Teutonic tribes of northeastern Europe pressed on the heathen Slavs, the victory
                    of the former was always followed by the establishment of a military and
                    well-endowed church, on which a third of the conquered territory was generally
                    settled, the vanquished race being permitted, though in a state of dependence,
                    to occupy the residue. The settlement of Aegina and Euboea by the Athenian
                    lot-holders, to say nothing of more ancient occupancies, was of the same
                    character. Here indeed the state distributed the ownership which it had acquired
                    by its arms among its citizens, though doubtless it claimed military service
                    from them as a garrison, and probably exacted a revenue which was similar in its
                    nature to a rent.</p>
                <p>The financial system of ancient states was, as a rule, exceedingly simple. The
                    charges of government were few, except in the vast despotisms of Asia and Egypt,
                    and later on in the great military republics of Carthage and Rome, where the
                    revenues of the king and state were derived from tribute in money or kind from
                    inferior or dependent districts and races. The district of the Aristotelian
                    ideal city <hi rend="italic">(Politics,</hi> vii. 10, 11) is to be divided into
                    two portions, one the property of the state, out of the produce of which the
                    charges of the national religion and the costs of the common tables are to be
                    supplied, the other to be held in private ownership. The philosopher does not
                    contemplate the necessity of making provision for the ordinary charges of
                    government. The magistrates were unpaid; the army was a militia, serving at its
                    own charges. When the Lacedaemonians undertook the command of the allies in the
                    Peloponnesian war, they had no public revenue. Later on in their history, we are
                    told by Aristotle that the public exchequer of the Lacedaemonians was ill
                    managed, for most of the land of Laconia belonged to the Spartiate, and they
                    assessed themselves.</p>
                <p>The beginning of Athenian finance was a revenue derived from the silver mines in
                    the promontory of Sunium, the ownership of which was, it seems, vested in the
                    state. It was the practice of the Athenian Government to grant a perpetual lease
                    of allotments in these mines, and to exact, moreover, a small percentage on the
                    produce, reserving to itself a right of forfeiture and re-entry if the terms of
                    the lease were infringed, or the produce rents were unpaid. With the proceeds of
                    these mines the Athenians built their first navy, and with this navy they won
                    the victory of Salamis, thus paving the way to their naval supremacy.</p>
                <p>The next great source of Athenian revenue was the contribution from those
                    protected states which failed to supply a proper naval contingent for the
                    defence of the Aegean. Most of the Greek cities of Asia Minor and the islands
                    owed their security from the attacks of the Phoenician navy, then dependent on
                    Persia, to the vigorous and effective sea forces of the Athenian republic. It
                    was cheaper for them to commute their contingent for a money payment, and the
                    police of the sea became far more efficient when wielded by a single power,
                    which had every interest in bringiug its navy to the highest pitch of
                    serviceableness. The Athenians contrived to economize, and, later on, to
                    increase the contributions of those states whom they protected. Considering that
                    they had fully satisfied the terms of their own bargain if they thrust back the
                    Persian despot, they concluded that they might fairly accumulate a surplus in
                    the public treasury, and even expend a portion of their revenues in embellishing
                    their city. we may be certain that the power which this revenue gave the
                    Athenian republic was the chief cause of that jealous fear which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n181/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0181-0172"/> precipitated the thirty years’ war of the 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and which produced results as disastrous
                    to the progress of mankind as a war of the same duration twenty centuries later
                    did on the rapidly growing civilization of central Europe. So desperate and so
                    penniless were the military rivals of Athens, overwhelming as their land forces
                    were, that they even thought of appropriating the sacred treasures of Delphi, a
                    proposal, in the 5th century before Christ, which was as shocking as it would
                    have been in the 12th century after Christ to have suggested that the sacred
                    vessels and shrines of the great churches and monasteries should be coined in
                    order to pay the soldiers of the crusade.</p>
                <p>The finance of antiquity derived a revenue from customs. These customs were, at
                    least in Athens, an ad valorem duty of two per cent, as a war measure. Twelve
                    years before the conclusion of the great thirty years’ struggle, the Athenians
                    levied a five per cent, ad valorem duty on their subject cities, though this was
                    in substitution for the old contribution on account of the police of the seas. A
                    poll tax was levied on foreign residents, perhaps on slaves; and it appears
                    that, possibly as a measure of police, another poll tax was imposed on the
                    inmates of disreputable houses.</p>
                <p>The revenue, therefore, of that Greek state whose history is best known to us was
                    derived from the rent of public lands, especially the mines, from a composition
                    paid by the allies in lieu of naval service, from very moderate customs duties,
                    and from a few personal taxes. It must not, however, be imagined that the
                    finance of antiquity was successful in the eyes of those who saw how inelastic
                    it was. There is still extant a treatise by a very practical man. Xenophon, in
                    the oldest work on finance, discusses the means by which the Athenian home
                    revenue might be conveniently increased, and, like many other speculative
                    thinkers, suggests projects which would have created far more mischief than they
                    would have remedied. It will be obvious also that by far the most important item
                    in Athenian finance, the contributions from the allies in lieu of personal
                    service, was necessarily precarious, and that when the Athenian empire was
                    finally broken up, the revenue of the state was gone, while the necessity of
                    finding ways and means for the public defence was as urgent as ever.</p>
                <p>This brings us to another aspect of Athenian finance, viz., the extraordinary
                    taxes on property which the Government levied, and which the contributors paid
                    apparently with the greatest readiness. These were the Λεtτoυργιαι, exceptional
                    imposts with a view to defraying certain kinds of public expenditure; and
                    property taxes assessed on a valuation, and graduated according to the means of
                    the contributor.</p>
                <p>The principal liturgies, as they are called from the Greek word quoted above (the
                    word is suggestive of the process by which it was finally appropriated in the
                    ecclesiastical vocabulary), were three in number, two religious and one secular.
                    The tendency of a religion, like that of Greece, in which so much nature worship
                    was contained, was to associate many of the acts of life with religious
                    ceremonies, and, as culture progressed, with art. Thus the drama of antiquity
                    arose from the worship of the wine god and the vintage, and the arts of
                    sculpture and painting had originally a similar religious origin. The dramatist
                    who succeeded in securing a representation of bis composition had assigned to
                    him a citizen whose wealth was sufficient to defray some of the charges of
                    representation, as the instruction, maintenance, and dresses of the actors. A
                    second and similarly religious service was the public games. Here again a
                    considerable portion of the expenses incurred in the performance werθ imposed on
                    wealthy persons. The third was the trierarchy, the equipment and command of a
                    ship of war. The state supplied the ship, the trierarch its stores and tackling,
                    and in some cases provisions and pay. In return the trierarch was captain of the
                    ship. This arrangement is closely analogous to that financial arrangement in
                    England by which, after the Revolution, local regiments were raised, clothed,
                    and officered by wealthy men, who had in return the colonelcy of the regiment,
                    and the right of appointing its subordinate officers.</p>
                <p>The liability to these charges, distributed, as it seems, at the discretion of
                    the Government, was a serious charge on the wealthy. Hence, when the state fell
                    on evil days, and reverses had impoverished the Athenian people, persons were
                    allowed to club together in order to supply these public functions. To abandon
                    them would have been to incur the wrath of the gods, or imperil the safety of
                    the state. The modern critics of Greek sentiment are amazed at the fact that
                    only on the very eve of the great crisis in which the fate of Greece was finally
                    determined, the battle of Chaeronea, Athens reluctantly devoted the taxes which
                    had hitherto been employed for ecclesiastical purposes to the pressing
                    necessities of the public defence. The theorie fund was that portion of the
                    revenues of the state which was assigned to those sacred purposes. It was
                    distributed nominally among the spectators as the price of tickets for
                    admission. It actually was paid over to the managers of those public buildings
                    in which the ceremony was performed.</p>
                <p>If the person on whom the duty of supplementing the charges of the state was
                    imposed conceived that he was unfairly selected, or asserted that his means were
                    inadequate for the purpose, he was allowed to name another citizen to whom he
                    could proffer an exchange of property. In this offer the other was bound to
                    acquiesce, unless he consented to allow himself to be substituted for the
                    individual on whom the duty was originally set. In short, the possession of
                    property involved serious liabilities in Athens, though it seems that men of
                    substance gloried in the satisfaction of these public charges, and completely
                    conformed themselves to public opinion. For it will be found to be a fundamental
                    law in successful finance that those imposts are always found to be most
                    productive which are most in accord with public opinion, and that in the
                    selection of a system of taxation it is not always possible to adopt that which
                    is most expedient or even most just, but that which can be most readily enforced
                    and is most willingly accorded.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable illustration of Athenian opinion in matters of finance is
                    the regular property tax. In the costly services which have been sketched above,
                    some compensation was afforded to the contributor by the position he occupied.
                    The choragus was the chief official in rank at those religious ceremonies in
                    which the drama was the highest act of worship; the chief of the gymnasts
                    exercised authority over his staff of competitors in the public games, and was
                    even empowered to compel parents to allow their children to take part in the
                    contest. The man of substance on whom the state imposed the duty of equipping,
                    manning, and provisioning a hull was captain of the vessel, and though he was
                    liable to a due performance of his service, and subject to an audit on the
                    termination of his year of office, he exercised full authority during his
                    command, and might be, indeed was, rewarded for exceptional diligence and
                    smartness during the period of his office.</p>
                <p>The property tax was a contribution which did not make the tax payer conspicuous,
                    and did not confer on him any distinction. The impost dates from the earliest
                    records of the Athenian constitution. It was graduated, being a heavier
                    percentage in the case of the richer citizens than in that of the middle
                    classes. It passed through several notable changes, always, however, in the same
                    direction, the particulars of which are well given in Boeckh’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Public</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n182/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0182-0173"/><hi rend="italic">Economy of Athens.</hi> But the
                    principles of the assessment are very simple, though the process by which the
                    result was finally arrived at is somewhat artificial.</p>
                <p>The property of every Athenian citizen was assessed, whether it were movable or
                    immovable, and the amount was entered in a public register. The assessment
                    included the value of slaves, manufactured goods, and raw materials. A register
                    of the assessment was open for examination, and undoubtedly re-valuations were
                    frequent. The state was informed as to the property which each citizen— and
                    indeed every resident alien—possessed, and made this property the basis of
                    direct taxation. It then proceeded to divide all assessments into several
                    schedules, assuming in each schedule a variable quantity, varying from a fifth
                    to a tenth, as the taxable property of the individual. On this sum it levied a
                    fixed rate. Thus, if a very wealthy man possessed an estate valued at 500
                    talents, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> nearly £122,000, his taxable wealth was
                    treated as £24,400, and a five per cent, tax, £1220, exacted from him; while the
                    owner of property valued at 25 mime, t.e., about £101, 10s., the lowest sum
                    apparently which was liable to property tax, found his property assessed for
                    purposes of taxation at £10, 3s., and his property tax of five per cent, at a
                    little over 10s.</p>
                <p>In the budget speech which the great statesman of the Athenian empire delivered
                    before the commencement of the Peloponnesian war, and of which Thucydides gives
                    us the heads, we learn that the revenue of Athens from the contributions cf her
                    allies amounted on an average to 600 talents (£147,250) a year, and that there
                    was an existing accumulation of treasure in coined silver amounting to a million
                    and a half sterling, besides other immediate resources. It is to be regretted
                    that the historian did not supply us with further particulars as to the finance
                    of his country during the period of her greatest wealth and power. These
                    resources, had Athens merely carried on a defensive warfare, would, as the
                    statesman justly argued, have rendered the country not only unconquerable, but
                    practically invulnerable.</p>
                <p>The high rate of interest, and the general insecurity of society, excluded the
                    states of ancient Greece from having recourse to regular loans, though not from
                    attempting to meet current exigencies by anticipations of revenue. Occasionally
                    portions of the revenue were assigned to creditors; sometimes the public lands
                    were granted for a term, during which the principal and interest might be
                    repaid. Instances may even be found in which the state issued a currency of
                    tokens, which fulfilled some of the functions of state paper in modern times.
                    Another financial expedient, always followed by the most mischievous
                    consequences, was occasionally adopted, the issue, namely, of a debased
                    currency. But from this fraud Athens always kept herself free, not only
                    inflicting the punishment of death on those who put base money into circulation
                    (the criminal code of Athens having been generally very lenient), but abstaining
                    in her deepest distress from the temptation of supplementing her revenues by the
                    temporary issue of base money So studious was Athens of her reputation in this
                    respect that, when she was the home of the fine arts, she continued to maintain
                    the clumsy archaic type of her coinage, although the arts of die-sinking and
                    coining were carried to perfection in states which were far less scrupulous.</p>
                <p>The revenue of Rome in the earlier ages of the republic was derived from the
                    lands of the state, payments in kind or money from subjects, from import and
                    export duties, and a few taxes on products and articles of luxury. Partly as
                    compensation for the loss of the national domain, partly as a means of checking
                    discontent, the state, in the later ages of the republic and the beginning of
                    the empire, undertook the maintenance of its poorer citizens, either by
                    gratuitous distributions of corn, or by the sale of food at low fixed prices.
                    Cicero calculates the charge incurred by the revenue in consequence of this
                    expedient at one-fifth of the public expenditure. Augustus increased the charges
                    of maintaining these state paupers till the cost amounted to more than half of
                    what had been the revenue of republican Rome. The emperor Vespasian declared
                    (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Vesp.</hi> 16) that the necessities of government in
                    Rome required a sum of £400,000,000 sterling, apparently after the destructive
                    civil war which preceded the elevation of the Flavian family to the throne. But
                    the manner in which the revenue of the Roman empire was collected was even more
                    destructive than the crushing weight of the charge itself.</p>
                <p>The collection of taxes in Rome, both under the republic and the early empire,
                    was entrusted to contractors, who purchased by auction the right of levying the
                    tax. The character of the Roman contractor is aptly illustrated by Livy, who
                    narrates the frauds practised by those persons on the Roman treasury during the
                    deepest distresses of the second Punic war, and the violence with which other
                    contractors defended the interests of the order in general, and the convicts in
                    particular. But after the Macedonian war, the Roman citizen was relieved from
                    direct taxes, the weight of which fell on the provincials. Associations of
                    wealthy men were formed, who could give security to the Government, and who,
                    being protected by the Government, could practice what extortion they pleased on
                    the provincials. The law, indeed, provided that such persons should be liable to
                    prosecution for corrupt and illegal practices, but the law was far too weak to
                    check the malpractices of the officials. It appears that the province was
                    divided into districts, or dioceses, as they are called, a manager being
                    appointed for each district, who was in regular correspondence with the chief of
                    the office at Rome. The law recognized the guild of the publicans, who were
                    indeed, by their agency, the centre of the Roman system of finance, and in many
                    emergencies the parties with whom the state negotiated for an advance on the
                    security of its revenues. But, on the other hand, it was said with too much
                    truth that where the tax-gatherer appeared public law and private liberty
                    vanished.</p>
                <p>Taxes paid in kind were the tenth of corn and the fifth of fruit. Such taxes were
                    imposed in Sicily, in Africa, in Sardinia, and in Egypt. Spain was treated more
                    generously, partly to compensate for the reputed unproductiveness of its soil,
                    partly in all likelihood from fear of the high-spirited character of its
                    inhabitants. In some cases, the contributor of the tithe had to carry his quota
                    to the nearest port for shipment to Rome. The rest of the empire paid money
                    taxes, partly from an assessment on the value of property, partly by what
                    appears to be a poll tax, but was really an artificial estimate, under which
                    several needy persons might be made to represent a unit, and on the other hand
                    one wealthy person might be treated as many units. The assessment lasted for a
                    definite period, which, in the age of Constantine at least, got the name of the
                    Indiction. In the sense of a tax, this term is as old as Pliny, if indeed it
                    cannot be carried back to the early empire.</p>
                <p>The finance of the Roman empire imposed a tax on the profits of trade, which
                    seems to have been collected with great severity, and to have exposed those who
                    were liable to it to strict scrutiny, and to degrading punishments in case of
                    default Capitation taxes were levied on cattle, on imports and exports, on
                    slaves kept for the purpose of luxury, on auctions (1 per cent), on sales in the
                    public markets, analogous to the octroi in the French towns, on salt works, on
                    emancipated slaves, and on successions in cases where the inheritance went by
                    devise to strangers.</p>

                <p>The Roman empire even anticipated the benevolences of the Plantagenet and Stuart
                    kings of England in the coronary gold, which was first received as a present on
                    the occasion of a triumph, but afterwards exacted as a right on such occurrences
                    as the emperor might choose to proclaim.</p>
                <p>The distinction of Roman and provincial was merged in a common servitude under
                    the edict of Caracalla, which conferred the Roman franchise upon all the
                    subjects of the empire. The task of collecting and transmitting the taxes from
                    the provinces to Rome, and subsequently to Constantinople, was imposed on the
                    decurions, the senate of the colonies. These persons exercised what little
                    authority was left to the local magistracy by the centralization and despotism
                    of the empire, and were exempted from some of the more degrading punishments
                    which were imposed on the mass of the people. But they bought their rank and
                    privileges at a dear rate. They were liable, in case they failed to collect it,
                    to the whole impost which was assessed on the locality whose affairs they
                    administered. To escape from the dignity and responsibility of the decurion’s
                    office, without sinking into the condition of an unprotected citizen, was the
                    object of numerous petitions to the emperor. The privilege was occasionally,
                    sometimes lavishly, awarded as a matter of special favour. But the necessities
                    of the public revenue demanded that enough decurions should be left for the
                    purpose of meeting the burden of taxation. Hence, under the financial system of
                    the later empire, the weight of fiscal charges fell with increasing severity on
                    the middle classes, so that at last, when the military system of Rome collapsed,
                    nothing remained to withstand the assaults of the barbarian invaders. One is
                    struck at finding how small are the armies which subverted the Roman empire, and
                    how easily they occupied Gaul, Spain, and northern Italy.</p>
                <p>The fiscal and military system of the Roman empire caused the downfall of ancient
                    civilization. The Roman army and the Roman exchequer were developments from a
                    centralized despotism. The army exhausted the free growth of Italy, devoured the
                    population of those most warlike races who were successively allowed to recruit
                    the Roman legions; and when the subject races, from which new blood could be
                    introduced into the forces, were thoroughly drained, the Government was forced
                    to enlist soldiers from those foreign hordes who were already threatening, and
                    were soon about to overthrow the empire. Civil society was simultaneously
                    crushed by a prodigious weight of taxation, arbitrarily imposed, and rigorously
                    exacted. Before the final collapse occurred, wide regions, once occupied by
                    opulent and populous cities, were found to be destitute of inhabitants, and
                    released from taxation on the plea that there was no population left from which
                    to collect a revenue. Large tracts of Asia, southern Europe, and northern Africa
                    have never recovered from the desolating effects which were induced on them by
                    the fiscal and military policy of imperial Rome. A great break occurred in the
                    history of human progress. Social development was thrown back for centuries, and
                    in some particulars has not even yet recovered the ground on which it stood in
                    the first century before our present era. Not a few fragments, too, survive from
                    that imperial system which was the downfall of ancient civilization, and which
                    will remain an impediment to modern civilization until they are completely taken
                    out of the societies in which they have been embedded.</p>
                <p>The history and progress of modern finance may be best studied in English fiscal
                    history. Some countries, as Holland, adopted expedients in finance long before
                    other states understood or accepted them; others, as France, have been informed
                    by many acute authors of the means by which a sounder, fairer, and more
                    productive fiscal system might be adopted in place of one which was ruinous,
                    oppressive, and unproductive. But in England only theory and practice have gone
                    on together,—not indeed simultaneously, for the English legislature has accepted
                    scientific principles with hesitation and slowness, but progressively, the
                    result being a compromise, which is open indeed to serious criticism from the
                    point of view of the economist, but is, under existing circumstances, of easy
                    manipulation to the financier. Into the former of these we do not propose to
                    enter; it will be treated under <hi rend="smallcaps">Taxation;</hi> but the
                    latter can be presented from an historical point of view.</p>
                <p>English finance is historically connected with the foundation and growth of the
                    English exchequer. It is further divisible into two periods,—one in which almost
                    the whole income of the sovereign, acting for the state, was derived from direct
                    taxation; another in which a continually increasing revenue has been obtained
                    from the indirect taxation of consumable articles. The dividing line in these
                    two systems is the civil war of the 17th century; and it may be affirmed
                    confidently that nothing but the emergencies of a great convulsion like that of
                    the parliamentary war could have reconciled the English people to so total a
                    change in the system of taxation as the adoption of the excise was. For more
                    than a century after the compromise was effected, of which the perpetual or, as
                    it was called at first, the hereditary excise was the outcome, the impost was
                    detested. A generation has hardly passed away since offences against the excise
                    have ceased to command public sympathy, and, despite the severity with which the
                    law treated frauds on the revenue, have been looked on as venial acts, detection
                    in which was rather thought unlucky than scandalous. We no doubt owe the change
                    in public sentiment, in accordance with which frauds on the excise are
                    considered criminal, to the happy change in the fiscal policy of the country,
                    under which taxes are imposed for the purposes of revenue only, and are no
                    longer seen to be protective or partial.</p>
                <p>The origin of the English exchequer is variously ascribed to William the Norman
                    and his youngest son Henry I. It is certain that the great cadastre of Domesday
                    Book, the terrier of inhabited England, was treated as the register of the
                    exchequer, the authority of which, as a record of the crown’s title to lands and
                    services, and of the subjects’ tenure, was held in the exchequer court to be
                    conclusive. It is also certain that whatever arrangement may have been made by
                    the first and third Norman kings, the system was suspended during the troubles
                    of Stephen’s reign, and that the exchequer was reconstructed by Henry II. It
                    appears, too, that the machinery of the exchequer was perfected by a family of
                    clerical financiers, who held at once high dignities in the church and
                    confidential offices in the state; that they were, and avowed themselves to be,
                    eager advocates of regal rights; and that they strove to extend, as far as
                    possible, the liabilities and responsibilities of the subject towards the crown.
                    They also found means by which the judicial powers of the crown, the protection
                    which the powers of police wielded by the crown could afford to the subject, and
                    even the validity of contracts were made the machinery for securing a
                    revenue.</p>
                <p>The Norman and Plantagenet kings were not only the overlords of all their
                    subjects, and therefore interested in the escheat of their estates by failure of
                    heirs, but by far the largest landholders in the country. The royal estates were
                    managed, at least in the 13th and 14th centuries, just as the estates of the
                    nobles and gentry were. They were superintended by bailiffs, generally of very
                    low social rank, and cultivated by customary and hired labour. The profits of
                    the estate, as long as this system was continued, were paid into the exchequer
                    by the bailiffs, and after the king ceased to cultivate land with his own stock
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n184/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0184-0175"/> capital, the collectors of rents succeeded to
                    similar duties with those of the more ancient bailiffs. The sheriffs collected
                    the customary charges which were imposed on the counties, and the extraordinary
                    receipts of the crown, making audit of their liabilities twice a year, and
                    receiving a quittance when those liabilities were discharged. Careful search was
                    made into the estates of deceased tenants of the crown, and the antiquary or
                    genealogist has derived the largest amount of his information as to family and
                    local history from the numerous and exact <hi rend="italic"
                    >inquisitiones</hi><hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> which were taken by the
                    proper authorities. As certain offences involved a forfeiture, and as all
                    offences might be condoned by the payment of mulcts, the attention of the royal
                    officials was stimulated to all such cases of misconduct, and except in matters
                    of petty police, adjudicated in the manorial courts, the royal tribunals rapidly
                    superseded private jurisdictions. In England these private jurisdictions
                    disappear in the middle of the 14th century; in Scotland they survived till they
                    were abolished after the insurrection in 1745; in France they existed till the
                    eve of the Revolution. Nothing has tended so much to develop English
                    nationality, and to consolidate the authority of the crown, as the royal
                    tribunals, working through and for the machinery of the exchequer.</p>
                <p>As the King’s Bench dealt with pleas of the crown, when the king’s peace was
                    broken, and the exchequer hunted up and punished offences against the revenue,
                    and through both agencies assisted the revenue, so a further source of royal
                    income was derived from the fees levied for the administration of justice
                    between subject and subject. There are many forms of conveyance known to those
                    who are curious in legal antiquities. But the court of Common Pleas competed
                    against them, by recognizing a form of conveyance transacted in court, recorded,
                    and thereupon protected by valid evidence of title. “No assurances,” said
                    Clarendon, when, in the full tide of revived loyalty, the cavaliers of the
                    Restoration strove to reverse or make void disadvantageous or forced sales made
                    by themselves during the course of the civil wars, “are equal in validity to
                    titles created by fines,” as these kinds of conveyances were called. “There is
                    no precedent of their being vacated by judgment or Act of Parliament, or
                    otherwise, without the consent of the parties.” So conclusive was this form of
                    conveyance, that when Viscount Purbeck surrendered his title to the king by the
                    process of a fine, the Lords, though they protested against the act, did not
                    venture on demanding that it should be void. This form of conveyance also
                    supplied a revenue to the crown. The exchequer, in short, was ubiquitous,
                    constantly searching after means by which the finances of the crown could be
                    recruited or enlarged, and sometimes offering very solid advantages to the
                    subject in return for business of which the law courts, centred in the
                    exchequer, took cognizance.</p>
                <p>Besides these revenues, the crown derived an income from the corporations whose
                    charters were granted in lieu of annual payments, and were renewed on further
                    payments. Sometimes the accession of a new sovereign was made the ground for
                    fresh demands on the re-grant of charters, and payment was always expected for
                    the concession of new rights. All these receipts, from whatever sources derived,
                    were entered in the annual registers, the great rolls of the Pipe, a series of
                    documents still preserved, and extending without break from early in the reign
                    of Henry II. down to the reign of William IV., when offices, long obsolete, and
                    already mere sinecures, were abolished. But for nearly seven centuries the
                    financial history of England is contained in an unbroken series of public
                    records, carefully made up from year to year, and as carefully audited. And as
                    the receipts of the exchequer were exactly scheduled, so the payments were
                    checked. No mere order, even of the sovereign, was valid for payment, unless it
                    were countersigned by some official—originally the treasurer—and therefore duly
                    subjected to a formal examination.</p>
                <p>It is reasonable to conclude that arbitrary taxation was, if not unknown, always
                    unconstitutional in England. The strict definition of the crown’s rights in
                    relation to revenue, which Domesday Book defended, and which the exchequer
                    interpreted, naturally suggests that the rights of the subject were equally
                    acknowledged and intelligible. Hence it was a general opinion, pretty freely
                    expressed when the administration was unpopular, that the king should live
                    within that income, in ordinary times at least, which had, under good
                    management, been found sufficient for the dignity of the crown and the good
                    government of the kingdom. The risk of the crown’s impoverishment, and the
                    consequent necessity of grants from the subject, made the English people
                    exceedingly hostile to favourites, and led parliaments to recommend or even
                    insist on a resumption of grants. The improvidence of Henry III. led to the
                    Barons’ War. The worse improvidence of Henry VI.’s administration, when the
                    crown was in abject penury, was a principal stimulant to the party of the duke
                    of York. The last echo of this discontent was the dissatisfaction felt at the
                    grants made by William III. to the Bentincks and the Keppels, grants which had
                    to be revoked in part, and which were only confirmed in part by the adroit
                    manner in which the Whigs proposed to extend the same resumption to the estates
                    bestowed on the numerous illegitimate children of Charles II.</p>
                <p>One financial expedient, however, adopted, as is supposed, at the instigation of
                    Becket, and certainly introduced in the middle of the 12th century, had such
                    lasting and peculiar effects on the fiscal and political system of the country
                    that it should be explained. This was the commutation of foreign military
                    service for a fixed money payment.</p>
                <p>The policy of Henry II. was to strengthen the revenue, and to make it the
                    instrument of government. Beyond his immediate and obvious interests, the
                    warning which he derived from the straits to which his great rival Louis VII.
                    was constantly reduced was enough to make him eager to secure and perpetuate the
                    means for carrying out his own designs. The expedient on which he hit led to
                    three results, two of which had an overwhelming influence on the mediaeval
                    history of England and of western Europe, while in the third was contained the
                    solution of the greatest problem with which civilization has had to grapple,
                    which ancient politics failed to grasp, but which is the great victory of modern
                    politics. The commutation of foreign military service for a fixed money payment
                    was, first, the cause why the Norman settler and the subject Englishman rapidly
                    developed a common sentiment against the royal prerogative; was, secondly, the
                    origin of that irresistible English army before which, till it was rivalled by
                    the Swiss infantry, no feudal levy could hold its ground; and, thirdly, was the
                    unwilling parent of representative government, of parliamentary control, and
                    finally of scientific finance.</p>
                <p>The king, under that system of reciprocal obligation between overlord and tenant
                    which is called, somewhat loosely, feudalism, had a right to the military
                    service of such among his subjects as held lands by military tenure. Sometimes,
                    to be sure, as in France and Germany in the 11th and 12th centuries, the
                    suzerain was not in a position to enforce the obligation; sometimes, as in the
                    kingdom of Jerusalem, the obligation was rendered stringent by the necessity of
                    defence against a common enemy. It would seem that the position of the English
                    king and Norman duke was intermediate to the above. There was no doubt that he
                    could call on his subjects in England to do battle on behalf of interests which
                    were indisputably insular, his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0185-0176"/> Norman subjecta for such interests as were
                    indisputably continental. But it was not quite so clear that an English tenant
                    was bound to defend the transmarine interests of the English king, or that a
                    Norman, a Gascon, or Languedoc tenant should be constrained to vindicate the
                    English rights of a Norman duke. But there was so much to be said on behalf of
                    the king’s claim that a compromise was possible, and it was so much to the
                    advantage of the English monarch that such a compromise should be made, that the
                    bargain known as escuage or scutage was struck between the English king and his
                    barons.</p>
                <p>Military service rendered by a military tenant was a tax in kind. In 1158 Henry
                    II. laid claim to the great fief of Toulouse in right of his wife. If this fief
                    could be transmitted through females, his claim, according to the public law of
                    the time, was'good. But another family had been in possession for nearly a
                    century, and it was plainly inexpedient to the French king that his dominions
                    should be completely girdled round, from Flanders to the Alps, by the fiefs of
                    the English king, who, by various titles, had inherited or claimed the whole
                    seaboard of France. The recovery, therefore, of the fief of Toulouse was sure to
                    be an arduous task, and in effect Henry did not achieve it. But by bargaining
                    for a money payment instead of personal service he could supply himself with the
                    most effective means towards the object aimed at. A feudal army was collected
                    slowly, was destitute of solid organization, and was at once disbanded when the
                    time of its service was passed. An enlisted army, paid and commanded by the
                    sovereign, gathered by careful selection, and drilled with all the skill which
                    the age possessed, was a far more efficient instrument of warfare.</p>
                <p>The assize of arms under which the militia was enrolled defined the equipment of
                    the national forces as precisely as those of Rome were defined under the
                    so-called constitution of Servius. Each social order had its proper arms and
                    place in the army. None but freemen were entitled to serve. But in the king’s
                    enlisted army a serf could be enrolled, and rise to knighthood and even to
                    nobility. During the long wars of Edward III. many such persons of originally
                    ignoble birth became distinguished captains. The royal army became, like the
                    church, the road by which humble merit might be promoted to rank and affluence.
                    Such an army was highly paid, well drilled, rapidly manoeuvred, and prodigiously
                    effective. Though small, it easily routed hosts many times greater in numbers
                    than itself. The chivalry of France went down before the English footmen at
                    Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt, and Verneuil, as the Persian armies were destroyed
                    at Granicus, Issus, and Arbela, and as the native forces of India were routed at
                    Plassy or Assaye. It is true that these English victories were ultimately
                    barren, because the victors were too few to hold the country which they
                    conquered. But in action, as long as the army was true to its drill and
                    discipline, it was irresistible, and could only be beaten or dislodged in
                    detail. Perhaps it is not too much to say that the tradition of these exploits
                    has had a permanent effect.</p>
                <p>Again, the commutation first adopted in 1158 united the two races, Norman and
                    English, in a common policy. In accordance with the spirit of the time the
                    bargain was a record and a precedent. If it strengthened the king’s military
                    power, it weakened his civil power. The feudal chieftain might not be unwilling
                    to undertake a campaign from which he might get plunder or glory, or the solid
                    advantages of successful and appreciated service. But it was another thing to
                    find the funds from which others might be hired, and drilled, and win these
                    advantages. The military tenant began to criticize the sovereign’s policy in
                    undertaking foreign wars, and to demur to his demands for escuage. His natural
                    ally against the power of the crown was the free peasant. In little more than
                    half a century after the bargain which Becket made with the military tenants of
                    the crown, the whole nation, churchmen, nobles, burghers, and peasants, were
                    united against John and his mercenaries, forced the Great Charter from him, and
                    despite the anathemas of the most powerful pope which ever sat at Rome, insisted
                    that the Charter should be maintained. The history of no European nation
                    supplies a parallel to the events of 1215. It will be found also that this
                    common purpose influenced the minds of all ranks of Englishmen, till, under the
                    unhappy reign of Henry VI., the feuds of the nobles made havoc of English
                    liberty for a century and a half. But it was during the period of national
                    resistance to the excesses of prerogative, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> during
                    the 13th, 14th, and the first half of the 15th century, that those precedents
                    were created which served the parliamentary opposition of the 17th century to
                    such good purpose.</p>
                <p>In the third place, the commutation of personal service was the true cause of
                    parliamentary representation. It is known that the earliest traces of
                    representation are to be found in those elections of county knights who were
                    appointed to assess the contributions for extraordinary necessities which the
                    irregular councils or assemblies of the earlier Plantagenet kings had conceded.
                    From local or county assessments to a national or general assessment, based on
                    uniform principles, was only a step. At first there was no need that any but the
                    country districts should be dealt with in this fashion. The resources and
                    liabilities of the towns were well known, and the king could treat directly with
                    the borough authorities. These relations of the crown to the chartered boroughs
                    is the explanation of those anomalous franchises which characterised so many of
                    the boroughs before the Reform Act of 1832. At last, in 1265, Simon de Montfort
                    summoned the representatives of the boroughs as well as the counties, avowedly
                    for the purpose of obtaining their adhesion to his policy, and the precedent was
                    copied thirty years later by Edward I.</p>
                <p>How the parliament gradually, through its control over the supply of funds for
                    the extraordinary necessities of the crown, undertook the cognizance and remedy
                    of abuses, assumed legislative functions, affirmed its own privileges, debated
                    political questions, changed or determined the succession to the crown, extended
                    or narrowed the franchises of the electors, and criticized the royal
                    administration and expenditure, is matter of familiar history. The origin of the
                    English parliament was peculiar, as its place in modern European history was
                    unique, till, at the conclusion of the 18th century, other countries began to
                    imitate the forms and traditions of the English constitution, and at last a free
                    parliament has become a symbol and condition of constitutional government.</p>
                <p>It has been stated that finance, during the Plantagenet and Tudor dynasties,
                    consisted mainly in the occasional imposition of direct taxes. The crown made
                    known its necessities, and the parliament declared the amount of supply. At a
                    period which is not settled, the right or duty of originating supply became
                    vested in the lower chamber. It is probable that this great privilege, to which
                    the House of Commons owes its ascendency, but which was formally conceded only
                    in the reign of Charles II., was partly due to the willingness of the Lords to
                    throw on the lower chamber the odium or danger of refusing or cutting down the
                    demands of the crown, partly to the original character of parliamentary
                    representation,—the fact, namely, that it was called into being for the purpose
                    of assessment. In course of time, the House of Commons assumed the right of
                    giving validity to the grants of the clergy in their Convocations, a right which
                    they angrily affirmed in the first <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n186/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0186-0177"/> session of the Long Parliament. Here, again, it
                    is probable that the clergy had, at some period which cannot be now defined,
                    attempted to protect themselves against the heavy demands of the king by putting
                    their grants under the sanction of the popular chamber.</p>
                <p>The direct taxes of the Plantagenet and Tudor times were percentages on the
                    annual value of lands and tenements, property taxes strictly so called on
                    personal estate, and percentages on ecclesiastical revenues. The first two were
                    granted by the secular, the last by the clerical parliament. Very early in the
                    history of English finance, the district from which the tax was raised was
                    assessed, and the assessment was made a permanent valuation. It seems that this
                    was even done with the tax on personalty. The town, for instance, from which the
                    tax was collected was set down at a fixed sum, and the sum thus fixed was raised
                    <hi rend="italic">rateábly</hi> by the local authorities. Hence in the time of
                    James I. the subsidies and fifteenths, as the direct taxes on real and personal
                    property were called, produced less than they did more than three centuries
                    before, though the money of the Stuart sovereign contained only one third of the
                    specie which was coined in pieces bearing the same name in the 13th century, and
                    prices had risen owing to the increasing cheapness with which silver was
                    obtained. It is likely that the motive for maintaining the same assessment was
                    that parliament might exactly understand the amount of the burden, and the
                    extent of the aid given to the king. The taxing rolls in which the amounts
                    levied are set down exist by thousands in the national archives, and might be
                    made the material for illustrating the social condition and opulence of
                    mediaeval England. Similarly the value of benefices was assessed and remained
                    constant, the tax levied being a percentage on the nominal value as entered on
                    the books of the pope or the king.</p>
                <p>The tax levied on the clergy was always a higher percentage than that imposed on
                    the laity. It was reasonably argued that a tax on tithes was a lighter burden
                    than a tax on products or annual value, since the tithe-owner had contributed
                    neither in labour nor capital to his share in the produce. Hence Edward I.
                    demanded, in 1296, an enormous percentage—a third—on the revenues of the clergy.
                    The clergy had procured a bull from Boniface VIII., under which they were
                    forbidden to pay taxes to lay persons. That this bull was obtained at their
                    solicitation seems manifest, since the crown was in want of money for carrying
                    on war with Philip the Fair, with whom the pope was at constant feud, and
                    against whom he would be likely to support any enemy. The attitude which Edward
                    instantly assumed towards the clergy, the success which attended his policy, and
                    the serious diminution in their privileges and prestige which followed from the
                    expedient so unluckily adopted, are matters of familiar history. From the time
                    of Edward there are only faint and occasional signs of that clerical
                    independence which had exhibited such vigour in earlier times. During the 15 th
                    century the clergy had ceased to be a separate power in the state, though they
                    exercised a great conservative influence in the obscure politics of the
                    Lancastrian and Yorkist period.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the king received taxes in kind, especially in wool, the principal
                    export of English produce. It appears that sheep-feeding was almost confined to
                    England, probably because the peace was better kept in England than elsewhere,
                    and destitution was nearly unknown. Hence it was possible to put a heavy export
                    duty on the produce, or, what was the same in effect, to sell it at a much
                    higher price than it was purchased at, by assuming a temporary monopoly of the
                    article. Such an expedient was adopted by Edward I. in 1297, and several times
                    over by Edward III. The importance of English wool to the Flemish manufactures
                    was so great, and the trade was so easily manipulated by the English Government,
                    that, from the time of Edward I. till that of Henry VII., <hi rend="italic"
                    >iae.,</hi> during two centuries, the political sympathies of the Flemish were
                    easily secured on the side of England through the agency of commercial
                    intercourse. When Margaret of Burgundy gave a refuge to the Yorkist exiles, and
                    sent forth pretenders to disturb the throne of Henry Tudor, the negotiation of a
                    commercial treaty with Flanders, the Intercursus Magnus, formed an effectual bar
                    to her intrigues.</p>
                <p>The direct taxes of the period before us were doled out sparingly and grudgingly.
                    Sometimes, as in the minority of Richard II., they were appropriated, to use a
                    modern phrase, by the hands of a body of commissioners appointed for the
                    purpose. On the occasion referred to, Sir Richard Whittington was one of the
                    persons selected to see that the moneys granted were duly applied to the war
                    with France. It may also be stated that munitions for the defence of Cherbourg,
                    saltpetre and sulphur, were sold to the Government of this time by Sir William
                    Walworth, well known in history as the slayer of Wat Tyler, the leader of the
                    Kentish insurgents in the peasants’ war. It is almost superfluous to say, that
                    supply was granted on the condition that the grievances were redressed. In the
                    early part of the 15th century, when it was seen that the officials of the court
                    evaded the redress of that which the Commons prayed for and paid for, the
                    practice became general of drawing up petitions in the form of bills, and thus
                    of making the redress of grievances the basis of a legislative act.</p>
                <p>It is a common-place with historians to assert that the right of the crown to
                    purveyance, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to provisions and labour, purchased at
                    market rates, or distrained for royal works, was a serious grievance in the
                    Middle Ages. There is no evidence that it was so. The present writer has read
                    many thousands of mediaeval accounts, and has rarely found that the forced
                    purchases of the crown were treated as a wrong. Sometimes a great courtier, such
                    as was the younger Despencer in the reign of Edward IL, usurped a right which
                    belonged to the crown, and injured the proprietor. But, as a rule, the crown
                    paid its way honestly during the Plantagenet period. It was especially in the
                    reign of the first two Stuarts that the grievance of purveyance was felt. But
                    the discontent was due to the fact that the crown had determined on paying for
                    supplies at the old rates of value which prevailed before the currency was
                    changed and prices had risen. Such a system put on the county, through the
                    justices at quarter sessions, the cost of the difference between nominal and
                    market rates; and the crown, when the supplies were not forthcoming from the
                    county, purchased on its own account, and forced the county to pay extravagant,
                    perhaps factitious, prices for that which it had failed to purvey. An additional
                    cause of discontent was found in the fact that, though purveyance was claimable
                    only while the king was in the district, the Stuart kings demanded the
                    contribution when the court was in London, or at any rate at some distance from
                    the locality which was charged, and often overcharged for default.</p>
                <p>In the 14th century a practice of making voluntary gifts to the crown began.
                    Stories are told of Pole and Whittington having made presents or loans to the
                    king, and of the latter having cancelled the king’s debts at a banquet which he
                    gave to his sovereign. In the 15th century the voluntary gifts of rich men were
                    modified into a system of begging, under the name of a benevolence. It is
                    probable that the extreme poverty of the crown during the latter years of Henry
                    VI.’s reign, and the growth of partisan spirit among the nobles and gentry of
                    this time, may have led to the practice becoming common. At any rate the custom
                    became general during the twenty-five years of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n187/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0187-0178"/> Yorkist ascendency. That it was exceedingly
                    unpopular is shown by an Act of Richard III.’s single parliament, in which
                    benevolences were declared illegal. The successors of the usurper pretended to
                    treat this statute as inoperative since it was enacted during an illegal
                    government. Henry VII. and his successors constantly supplemented their revenues
                    by benevolences. Chancellor Morton’s fork, by which parsimonious and expensive
                    opulence were equally invited to aid the king’s necessities,—the one out of
                    savings, the other out of expenditure,—is well known. The practice continued
                    down to the eve of the Long Parliament, if indeed it can be said to have ceased,
                    as far as the Royalist party was concerned, before the final collapse of Charles
                    I.’s fortunes at Naseby. It was a commonplace with the courtiers of the day that
                    the king might, if he wished, take the subject’s wealth without asking leave. On
                    the other hand, they who refused professed that they were restrained from giving
                    by the anathemas of the Great Charter, by which those were denounced who
                    violated any of the provisions which the Great Charter contained, and notably
                    that by which common assent must be accorded to taxation. Anticipations of
                    revenue by loans were common. The foolish project of Henry III., which was set
                    on foot in order to secure the throne of Sicily for his second son, more
                    accurately in order to enable the pope to crush the reigning members of the
                    house of Swabia, loaded the king with debt, and, forcing him to consult his
                    nobles as to the means of liquidating his obligations, gave an occasion for
                    Simon de Montfort’s abortive political and financial reforms. The long wars of
                    Edward III. compelled him to make loans, and ultimately to repudiate his debts;
                    and we are told that his bankruptcy brought down some of the most opulent
                    financial houses in Florence. Henry VIII., who squandered the enormous treasure
                    which his father had accumulated, and afterwards the great personal estates of
                    the church, and finally its lands,—reputed, and perhaps with reason, to have
                    been, in the wealthiest age of its existence, one-third of the fertile land in
                    the kingdom,—constantly incurred large debts, from which he was relieved by his
                    obsequious parliaments. Charles and his son incurred debts which were never
                    paid, and Macaulay does not misstate the case when he says that public debt was
                    not incurred for the first time at the Revolution; what did happen was the
                    satisfaction of the obligation to pay the interest and, if possible, the
                    principal.</p>
                <p>One of the financial expedients of the Middle Ages, and indeed of much later
                    times, was a depreciation of the currency by means of issues which, nominally of
                    the same value with an older issue, were intrinsically below it. This is not the
                    place in which one might point out how disastrous and suicidal a policy it is to
                    tamper with the currency, how mischievously the forces of Government are
                    employed when they undertake this kind of fraud, and how enduring are the
                    calamities which result from so great a political crime. Not a little of the
                    stability and progress of England has been due to the fact that dishonesty on
                    the part of Government in dealing falsely with the currency has been a very rare
                    offence,—has, indeed, been committed only within a short but continuous period.
                    The evil, however, which the action caused to England, even for so short a time,
                    was so great that it reduced this country from the position of a first-rate to
                    that of a third-rate power in Europe for more than a century.</p>
                <p>At the close of the 13 th century, the pound sterling contained what its name
                    imported, a pound weight of silver, of 11 ∙2 fineness,—the penny, which was the
                    commonest coin, containing the 24Oth part of a pound. Between this period and
                    the first quarter of the 16th century, the penny was reduced to oue-third of its
                    ancient weight. But there is reason to believe, from direct and indirect
                    evidence, that it was the practice to pay by weight and not by tale. It is
                    inconceivable that the crown would, for the sake of a temporary gain, have
                    sacrificed the fixed or quit rents, which constituted, after the beginning of
                    the 15th century, the greater part of the revenues raised from crown lands and
                    regalian rights. Besides, the evidence of prices is conclusive as to the
                    alternatives that the value of silver must either have quadrupled in the 15th
                    century, or that payments must have been made by weight, for during
                    three-fourths of the 15th century the prices of the necessaries of life are much
                    lower than they are in the 14th. During the whole of this period, however, the
                    coinage was kept to its customary standard of fineness, and therefore no
                    uncertainty was induced upon pecuniary transactions.</p>
                <p>In 1543 Henry VIII. commenced an issue of base coin. At first the alloy was only
                    one-sixth of the silver; but in 1545 a second issue was put into circulation, in
                    which the alloy was one-half, and in 1546 a third issue only contained one-third
                    of silver. Henry died on January 28, 1547. The guardians of his son continued
                    the practice during the first five years of his reign, coining money in 1547
                    which was only one-third fine, in 1549 of one-half fineness, and in 1551 of only
                    one-fourth fineness. An attempt was made at the conclusion of this reign to
                    issue a coinage of genuine quality, but as the base money continued in
                    circulation, the attempt was futile. Mary was anxious to restore the ancient
                    standard, but found it impossible to do so. Elizabeth called in her father’s and
                    brother’s base money at a low fixed rate, which gave her a considerable profit,
                    and put into circulation money of the old character and quality. This was
                    effected in 1560, so that England suffered from the evils of a base currency for
                    seventeen years. The effect was disastrous in the highest degree, for it
                    impoverished the nation, and for a long time disabled it from filling that place
                    in Europe which it had occupied for centuries before.</p>
                <p>Among the sources of the royal revenue, the ancient customs of tonnage and
                    poundage occupied an inconsiderable place. These were dues levied upon exports
                    and imports, and seem to have been yielded from the earliest times. They are
                    justified on the ground that the sovereign was under the obligation of
                    maintaining the police of the narrow seas. Attempts of a more or less successful
                    kind were made for the purpose of securing this part of the revenue by limiting
                    exports and imports to certain towns, and particularly by fixing the market of
                    exports in particular localities, known as towns of the staple. Thus, for a long
                    time, Calais was by law the sole market of English wool, and the West of England
                    tin was sold at Bodmin and some other Cornish towns. Towards the latter end of
                    the 16 th century the growth of foreign trade was rapid and considerable. But
                    the old dues on exports and imports, which had been granted to the crown on the
                    occasion of each accession from the 15th century, were small and inelastic. An
                    attempt was therefore made to revise them, and in 1608 Cecil, James I.’s
                    minister, drew up a new book of rates.</p>
                <p>It is well known that these new taxes, for the imposition of which many plausible
                    reasons were alleged, were the commencement of that quarrel between king and
                    parliament which culminated in the civil war. The law courts decided in favour
                    of the crown, and it does not appear that at this time the special scandal of
                    the Stuart government,—the practice, namely, of displacing such judges as gave
                    decisions on points of constitutional law or public justice that were
                    distasteful to the sovereign,—had commenced. But, on the other hand, it was seen
                    clearly enough that, if the crown could, at its own discretion, impose what
                    taxes it pleased on trade, the checks which parliament might impose on the
                    administration would be annihilated. In point of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0188-0179"/> fact, the Book of Batea had. very much this
                    effect. Practically there was no parliament between* 1610 and 1621, for the
                    parliament of 1611 was dissolved without passing a bill or making a grant. But
                    in the latter part of this period, owing to the skill and energy of Cranfield,
                    the first of English financiers, the king was relieved from his debts, and put
                    in possession of a revenue which was independent of parliamentary supply under
                    ordinary circumstances. The election of 1621 was simply due to the outbreak of
                    the Thirty Years’ War, and the disastrous condition to which the king’s
                    son-in-law was reduced.</p>
                <p>Another expedient by which the crown strove to increase its fiscal receipts was
                    the grant of monopolies. It seems that the creation of a trading company, and
                    the accord of special privileges to those who founded a market in those regions
                    which were opened up to trade by the discovery of the Cape passage and the New
                    World, was deemed to be incontestably the province of the crown. The houses of
                    parliament could not have ventured on criticizing the action of a chartered
                    company, much less have pretended to define its privileges. Now the papal see
                    had granted to Spain the whole of the New World, or at least such parts of it as
                    were in any way inviting, and had made a similar grant to Portugal of the
                    district which lay on the road to India. By the death of Cardinal Henry in 1580,
                    the succession of Portugal passed to Philip II., who thus united under one rule
                    the West and the East. But the Dutch were now engaged in the War of
                    Independence, and were assisted by the English, though war had not actually
                    broken out between England and Spain. The war came at last, and the Eastern
                    possessions of Spain were obviously the most convenient spot in which the power
                    of Spain might be attacked. There was every reason, then, in according trade
                    privileges to a company which had to contend against the power of Spain, to
                    build forts and factories in which trade could be secured and extended, and to
                    deal discreetly with rivals who were associated with Protestant England by a
                    common European interest, but were sooner or later to come into collision in
                    more distant regions. The massacre of Amboyna was the beginning of those
                    differences which culminated in the wars with Holland during the protectorate
                    and after the monarchy was restored. On December 31,1600, the first East India
                    Company was created by charter. So far was the revenue from being the better for
                    this charter that the queen granted the company an exemption from customs duties
                    for the first four of their voyages.</p>
                <p>From the undisputed power of granting charters for the monopoly of foreign trade
                    there was only a step to the grant of monopolies to the home trade, though of
                    course always on the plea that the monopoly was really a control which it was in
                    the public interest to exercise. It is well known that, when these monopolies
                    caused discontent, Elizabeth graciously cancelled them. They were renewed by
                    James, were again the subject of remonstrance, and were abandoned by the king
                    with so little conciliation that the surrender of the practice gave no great
                    ground for gratitude. The other fiscal expedients which J am es adopted were the
                    creation of a new title which was conferred by purchase, the sale of peerages,
                    and the rigorous exaction of feudal rights. In the parliament of 1610 an attempt
                    was made to cancel these rights by commuting them for a fixed payment, which, if
                    the scheme had been accepted, would have taken the form of a quit rent on all
                    estates held on military service by tenants of the crown. But the scheme failed,
                    probably as much from a disinclination on the part of the parliament to aid the
                    prerogative by granting the king a fixed revenue, as from any dispute over the
                    amount of the commutation. The whole subject has been ably and judiciously
                    treated by Mr Gardiner, whose conscientious and painstaking histories of the
                    earlier Stuart period are of the utmost value to the student of finance and
                    politics.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, the history of English finance has been that of the process by which
                    the Government attempted, with more or less success, to derive a revenue from
                    direct taxation. Cecil and James I. discovered that a fruitful source of
                    increased revenue was to be found in the customs and a new book of rates, and
                    the Commons as clearly saw that in this fiscal expedient lay the whole issue of
                    the debate between parliamentary control and the royal prerogative. The struggle
                    began with the accession of Charles. The independence and privileges of
                    parliament, the desire to obtain certain guarantees for that .kind of church
                    government which represented the dominant feeling of most Englishmen, were the
                    objects of those who constituted the parliamentary opposition to the court; but
                    the machinery by which these results were to be effected was finance. No one can
                    understand the politics of the first fifteen years of Charles I.’s reigu who
                    does not detect that the parliament intended to bring the king to terms by
                    stinting the revenue. The struggle began with the first parliament of Charles.
                    The parliamentary leaders imagined that they had won the victory when they
                    secured the Petition of Right. The king interpreted that concession in another
                    way, and was supported by legal advice in the view which he took. During the
                    long interval between the third and fifth parliaments of Charles, the king tried
                    every expedient by which to raise a revenue. Clarendon’s statement that the
                    country was peculiarly prosperous between 1629 and 1640 is undoubtedly correct.
                    But the country determined not to let Charles have his way, and the resistance
                    to his financial expedients was only the prelude to those measures which the
                    Long Parliament at once adopted when it met.</p>
                <p>During the period which intervened between the dismissal of the third and the
                    summons of the fourth parliament, Charles adopted various fiscal expedients in
                    order to fill up the deficiency of his finances. They were all, except the rates
                    levied on imports and exports, forms of direct taxation. Such were the
                    compositions in lieu of knighthood, the annual payments made by chartered
                    monopolies, the resumption of lands which were said to be encroachments on the
                    royal forests, the fines of the Star Chamber, and in particular the fine of
                    &lt;£70,000 imposed on the city of London, and lastly ship-money.</p>
                <p>In the earliest times, the maritime towns, and especially the ports in the
                    south-east of England, were liable to be charged with the duty of the national
                    defence at sea. The privileges of the Cinque Ports were connected with this duty
                    of defence, and it appears that the sailors of these ports needed very little
                    persuasion to undertake a duty in which privateering differed little from
                    piracy. Sometimes these irregular forces did good service. The victory of the
                    Cinque Ports over Eustace the Monk in 1216 had even more important results than
                    the battle of Lincoln. The navy of Philip of Valois was annihilated at the
                    battle of Sluys by the same kind of force, and Edward III. was freed from
                    rivalry on sea. In later times the piratical ventures of Hawkins and Drake had
                    royal patronage, and it is said that some of the families who purchased titles
                    from James I.—notably the Riches—had gained their wealth by expedients very
                    similar to those which were familiar to the Algerines, and that their
                    expeditions were as equivocal as those of the Mediterranean pirates. Not a few
                    men who had won their wealth as buccaneers spent a calm and respectable old age
                    in England. There was no hardship felt in the demand occasionally made by the
                    crown, that the seaboard towns and counties must defend the realm at sea.</p>
                <p>The first writs of ship-money in 1634 were levied on the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0189-0180"/> maritime counties only. The second and third of
                    1635 and 1636 were imposed on the inland counties as well, the judges affirming,
                    at first privately, and afterwards, on Hampden’s appeal, by a majority, that the
                    crown could levy the tax at its discretion and without the consent of
                    parliament. It seems that the tax yielded about £200,000, though it is said that
                    after the judgment in Hampden’s case, the payments were more reluctant and
                    irregular than they were before the judges affirmed the legality of the
                    impost.</p>
                <p>The civil war broke out in the autumn of 1642. The king was better off for
                    soldiers, the parliament better off for money, and in the end the possession of
                    adequate funds supplied the means by which the single advantage which the king
                    possessed was neutralized. These were afforded by the new forces which Cromwell
                    drilled effectively and paid highly. Not only was London, always in the interest
                    of parliament, richer than all the towns in England put together; not only was
                    the eastern district of England untouched by the war; but Norfolk was by far the
                    most wealthy and populous district in England, as Yorkshire and Lancashire were
                    the poorest and least populous. The resources, therefore, from which the
                    parliament could procure its means were ample and easily obtained,</p>
                <p>In 1643 the parliament imposed an excise on beer and ale within all the counties
                    which acknowledged their authority. They also levied a heavy tax on tobacco and
                    wine, and on other articles of consumption. The project was denounced by the
                    king as an act of unheard-of oppression, but was soon imitated in the royalist
                    district by the parliament which sat at Oxford, though, after it had made this
                    grant, it did not meet again. In 1646 the parliament abolished the old feudal
                    dues, turning all tenures into common socage. It is said that between the
                    outbreak of the civil war and the year 1647 the parliament raised more than
                    forty millions in the counties which they governed. Among other expedients, the
                    Protector in 1656 established a general post office. According to the theory
                    advocated by the crown lawyers at the Restoration, that all acts of the
                    parliament from the date of the rupture with the king in the summer of 1642 were
                    void, the old feudal liabilities were revived with the monarchy, and also, by
                    implication, the royal privilege of purveyance. But as the country had been quit
                    of these liabilities for fourteen years, the revival was felt to be an
                    intolerable burden, and by 12 Charles II. cap. 12 they were extinguished. In
                    common justice this emancipation should have been compensated according to the
                    bargain nearly completed in 1610, which was known as “the great contract,” by a
                    land tax specially levied on lands which had hitherto been subject to feudal
                    dues, and such an arrangement was proposed. But the cavalier party, now in the
                    ascendant, contrived by a bare majority to carry a measure by which the king
                    obtained the hereditary excise in lieu of his feudal dues, duties being imposed
                    on beer, cider, perry, mead, spirits, coffee, tea, sherbet, and chocolate.
                    Parliament also gave the king the old tonnage and poundage for life.</p>
                <p>The excise was an expedient borrowed from the Dutch. In the long War of
                    Independence, the people of Holland were constrained to make great loans, and to
                    pledge their revenues to pay interest on these loans. The debt was almost all
                    held in the country, and to meet the charges the Dutch financiers imposed taxes
                    on all articles of consumption, whether necessaries or luxuries, on commercial
                    transactions, on births, marriages, and deaths, on successions and legacies. A
                    Dutchman in the 17th century was taxed from the cradle to the grave, and the
                    expedients of the Dutch financiers formed for a long time a series of Precedents
                    from which other countries borrowed largely, n effect Holland was the source of
                    modern finance, and proved how taxation, though apparently of crushing weight,
                    could be easily endured, if it were counterbalanced by industry and thrift. In
                    point of fact, only a few years after the disastrous war with the English
                    Commonwealth (a war waged quite as much for the political reason that the Dutch
                    democracy, always inclined to the House of Orange, which was connected by
                    marriage with the Stuarts, favoured the English exiles, and insulted or even
                    murdered the English envoys, as from motives of commercial rivalry), the state
                    of Holland contrived to reduce the interest on its debt of nearly fourteen
                    millions sterling from five to four per cent, by the threat of paying off the
                    principal. In the same period this state established, for the first time, a
                    genuine sinking fund, by which, principal and interest being paid together, the
                    debt of fourteen millions was to be completely extinguished in twenty-one years.
                    The rate of interest in England at this time was eight per cent.</p>
                <p>During the reign of Charles II. the English nation increased greatly in opulence,
                    especially through its foreign trade. But its internal trade and industry
                    suffered severely by the appropriation in 1672 of the goldsmiths’ loans. The
                    goldsmiths of London, who during the civil war had undertaken the office of
                    bankers to the London merchants, and took in money at call, or at short notice
                    on rates of interest, had lent these deposits to Charles, in anticipation of
                    revenue, to the amount of more than a million and a quarter, at eight per cent.
                    At the instigation of the Lord High Treasurer Clifford, the king suspended the
                    payment of interest on this loan, for one year only, as he said. But the
                    obligation was never acknowledged, and in 1701, nearly thirty years after the
                    exchequer was shut up, the bankers’ debt was treated as a national debt, on
                    which three per cent, interest was to be paid, but which might be redeemed on
                    the payment of a moiety of the principal. It is the oldest portion of the
                    English public debt. In 1720 it became part of the South Sea stock.</p>
                <p>Finance became a science in England at the Revolution. The immediate effect of
                    the deposition of James was an alliance between England, Germany, Spain, and
                    Holland, and a declaration of war against France. The war lasted for rather more
                    than eight years, and was concluded by the peace of Ryswick. Now the founders of
                    the English Revolution were determined that for the future the crown should be
                    dependent for its supplies on the pleasure of parliament, and especially that
                    its foreign policy should be held in check by the control of supply. There was
                    the greater reason for this policy at the moment, for it was quite understood
                    that the expulsion of James implied war with France, and that such a war,
                    carried on as it would be by the vigour and determination of William, must be
                    prolonged and costly. In 1688 the revenue was derived from (1) tonnage and
                    poundage, (2) the hereditary excise granted in lieu of the old feudal incidents,
                    (3) the profits of the post office, (4) the hearth money, a house tax, and (5)
                    the grants made in the parliament of 1685 for eight years. The income derived
                    from these sources has been variously computed at two millions to two and a half
                    millions, and the receipts from the excise and customs were steadily increasing.
                    William was under the impression that this great revenue was vested at once in
                    him by the change of the succession,—a view which was supported by several Whig
                    lawyers, who urged that, as long as the late king lived, these duties were
                    payable, but that they were to be enjoyed by his successor. But the political
                    Whigs thought differently. They determined, and they carried without opposition,
                    that a fixed revenue should be settled on the crown during time of peace, that
                    this revenue should be divided into two portions, one for the household and the
                    civil expenditure, the other for the public defence and other analogous charges.
                    It is true that they must <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n190/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0190-0181"/> have contemplated the immediate contingency of
                    war, and have known that the sum at which they fixed the revenue would be wholly
                    inadequate for the emergencies which would arise; but they were affirming a
                    principle which should be permanent, while the contingency to be dealt with was
                    temporary. It appears that the attitude taken by the parliament gave deep and
                    lasting offence to William, and that the distrust and dislike which marked the
                    relations of crown and parliament during this reign, and prepared the reaction
                    under Anne, had no other origin than the settlement of the revenue by the
                    convention parliament.</p>
                <p>The parliament further determined, once for all, to affinn a principle,
                    occasionally acted on in past times, and fundamental to the concession of
                    extraordinary grants, by which all supplies, other than the civil list and the
                    hereditary estate of the crown, should be strictly appropriated to the objects
                    for which they were granted. The demands of the crown in the Middle Ages were
                    generally for public objects, in which the whole community was reputed to be
                    interested, though sometimes, in accordance with the theory of the age, they
                    were acknowledgments for favours received, petitions granted, or pardons
                    allowed. They were therefore ordinarily granted to the exchequer, and no limit
                    was put on the objects for which they were to be expended. But, as we have
                    stated above, appropriations were made in the minority of Richard II. and of
                    Henry VI., in the last year of James I., and pretty frequently after the
                    Restoration, greatly to the disgust of some among the courtiers, who conceived
                    that the prerogative of the crown was dangerously invaded, if Charles were
                    disabled from diverting parliamentary grants from special objects to those which
                    the king might be pleased to select. But from the Revolution the Appropriation
                    Act has always denounced severe penalties on any minister of state, or head of
                    department, who converts supply voted from one branch of the service into any
                    other direction. The trial of Lord Melville, in 1806, illustrates the manner in
                    which a parliament, otherwise disposed to trust implicitly in the Government,
                    resented the apparent breach of a fundamental principle in English finance.</p>
                <p>The settlement of the revenue on William and Mary left the parliament in the
                    possession of a surplus of £800,000, the difference between the grants made to
                    James and the sums actually settled on the crown. But £200,000 of this was
                    immediately remitted by the abolition of the hearth tax or chimney money. The
                    nation had also incurred a debt to the Dutch of £600,000, which was repaid at
                    once. To meet these charges, a sum of rather more than £400,000 was voted, to be
                    raised by monthly instalments, and as a security for borrowing £370,000 at six
                    per cent, in order to meet immediate requirements. The expedient of anticipating
                    revenue by loans at short dates was very ancient, and is indeed obvious. At
                    first, the Government of the Revolution, feeling its way cautiously, raised
                    loans on short periods, at high rates of interest, and pledged particular taxes
                    for the payment of the principal and interest. These taxes were—new excise
                    duties, t.e., t ιxes on consumption; a monthly assessment, t.e., a direct tax on
                    income; and a quarterly poll tax, which of course was graduated. A resolution
                    was, moreover, passed by the House of Commons, by which it was proposed to lower
                    the Hilaries of all offices under the crown to £500 a year m ιximum, with the
                    exception of certain cases. It took no effect, and was indeed a mere expression
                    of dissatisfaction at the enormous gains of official statesmen. Nothing tended
                    to lower political morality during the latter part of the 17th and the whole of
                    the 18th centuries so much as the enormous perquisites which officials
                    enjoyed.</p>
                <p>In 1693 a loan was raised on the basis of a tontine. This expedient was familiar
                    to Italian financiers, and was probably suggested by the life loans of the papal
                    Curia. It combined a limited security with the charms of survivorship,—a kind of
                    lottery which is very often found to be attractive, unless, as is generally the
                    case, the tontine is employed as a speculation by those who put selected lives
                    into the loan. Tontines have been employed by English financiers as a means for
                    raising money up to the beginning of the present century. On this occasion, when
                    a million was advanced on the security of additional excises to be levied on
                    beer and ale, interest' was paid to all subscribers at the rate of ten per cent,
                    for seven and a half years, after which date £70,000 per annum was to be divided
                    among the survivors, till the number was reduced to seven, when the annuity of
                    each was to revert to the public on his decease. In order to stimulate the
                    operation of this loan, persons were allowed to nominate lives at ten per cent,
                    on the capital invested on each life. Although the latter offer was equivalent
                    to selling annuities at less than half their value, the loan was raised with
                    difficulty. But the capital expedient of 1693 was the imposition of the land
                    tax. Willing as the parliament was to extend the area of indirect taxation, it
                    was impossible that landed estates should be allowed to go untaxed, especially
                    as, within half a century, nearly all taxation had been derived from the
                    contributions of land and property, and, as it was remembered that the
                    emancipation of the military tenancies was effected at the expense of the
                    general public. But the Government did not venture on departing from the old
                    principle under which the subsidies were collected, that of making certain local
                    authorities responsible for the assessment, or rather of relieving them of all
                    virtual responsibility. The tax was fixed at four shillings in the pound on the
                    profits of land and personal estate, the latter being taken at six per cent. But
                    from the very beginning the assessment was unequal. It is said that those
                    districts which were favourable to the principles of the Revolution assessed
                    themselves fully and fairly, but that those in which Jacobite views were in the
                    ascendant greatly understated their liabilities. It appears, too, that the
                    assessment of personal estate was soon lost sight of, or rather merged in an
                    aggregate local charge. In point of fact, no revaluation was made. Hence the
                    estimated rental of agricultural estates remained unaltered, and the assessment
                    of the towns, which was also taken as a fixed quantity, was imposed on the
                    owners of property, the capital of the townsfolk and traders being merged in the
                    value of the premises. For example, if the assessment of a town was £1000 in
                    1693, this sum including both items in the land tax, the same assessment was
                    charged whenever the full land tax was imposed. But the inhabitants of the town
                    had the right of redistributing the fixed assessment on the property contained
                    in the town, as the value of individual holdings was increased or diminished by
                    the outlay of the owners, or the depreciation of the premises. The land taxes,
                    therefore, in the county districts became virtually a secured rent payable to
                    the crown; in the towns it became a tax on improvements, though the amount was
                    not considerable enough to discourage improvement. It was Adam Smith’s opinion
                    that in his time there were districts in which the land tax was half what it
                    professed to be, an impost of four shillings in the pound on rents. Since the
                    great increase in the rent of land, owing to the great improvements which have
                    been made in the art of agriculture, the land tax is nowhere heavy, and in some
                    districts is trivial.</p>
                <p>Taxes on the rent of land, or on its value as property to be rented, constitute a
                    far larger percentage in the budget of foreign countries than they do in
                    England. In the reign of William and Mary it is true that the land tax, where it
                    was fairly assessed, was a very considerable impost, and the country gentlemen
                    easily fell in with the pacific projects of Walpole, when he coupled them with
                    the fact of a reduced <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0191-0182"/> land tax, and a prospect that the tax would be
                    abrogated altogether. But as, owing to the increasing value of land, and the
                    growth of the system of indirect taxation (the principal expedient of English
                    financiers during the 18th and the first half of the 19th century), the land tax
                    became absolutely and relatively a decreasing charge, taxes on the rent of land
                    ceased to be an important element in the national budget. Adam Smith informs us
                    that in Prussia the land tax on secular estates was from 20 to 25 per cent, of
                    the revenue, on ecclesiastical 40 to 45. In some European countries lands held
                    by a noble tenure were taxed at a slightly higher rate than those held by a base
                    tenure. In France, on the other hand, lands held by a noble tenure and the lands
                    of the clergy were exempt from land tax, while the burden of direct taxation
                    fell exclusively on those held by a base tenure. The inequality of this system,
                    its injury to the revenue, and the still greater wrong which it inflicted on
                    those who were liable to the tax, were constantly commented on by those French
                    writers who made finance their study, and particularly by the Economists, whose
                    peculiar views on the nature of taxation were an exaggeration of what contained
                    a serious and important truth. But the interests which profited by the
                    inequality were too strong for any reform. They were at last sacrificed by a
                    revolution, much of the bitterness and ferocity which accompanied the change
                    having been unquestionably due to the sense of injustice felt at the extreme
                    unfairness of the feudal taille.</p>
                <p>The next expedient was that of borrowing money on lotteries. There are instances
                    of state lotteries before the Revolution. One was drawn in 1568, with the object
                    of improving the harbours; another was held in 1612 and subsequent years, for
                    the benefit of the Virginian colonists. But the parliament of 1620 presented
                    these lotteries as a grievance, and they were discontinued by an order in
                    council. In these later lotteries the Government found it impossible to dispose
                    of the tickets except by granting at the same time annuities at exorbitant rates
                    of interest. In course of time, when the English people became more inclined to
                    speculation, lotteries became a profitable means of raising money, though they
                    had such disastrous effects on public morality that they were ultimately
                    discontinued. In the year 1693 loans were raised on the security of stamp
                    duties, now introduced for the first time, and on the tonnage of ships. The
                    charter of the Bank of England was granted at the same time in exchange for a
                    loan of £1,200,000, the security of the loan being generally the assignment of
                    one half the additional excise duties. These duties were now imposed without any
                    limit of time. Hitherto indirect taxes had been granted for fixed periods. The
                    negotiations which led to the foundation of the Bank of England contemplated a
                    permanent debt and a permanent fund from which the interest of the debt was to
                    be paid.</p>
                <p>The relations of the Bank of England to the finance of the country are as
                    important as the effects which it had upon trade,—in the early part of its
                    career were far more important, for the private bankers were already fulfilling
                    many of the functions of commercial banking. But the Bank of England was from
                    the first the banker of the Government, managing its revenue,—for which it
                    received on its foundation £4000 a year,—anticipating its revenues, putting its
                    securities into circulation, and assisting its credit at emergencies. It was, in
                    point of fact, from the beginning a great department of state, and so obvious
                    and, to the public opinion of the time, so dangerous were its powers, that
                    provision was taken in the Act by which it was constituted, that if it advanced
                    to the Government any moneys on the credit of the public revenue without the
                    authority of parliament, it should forfeit treble the sum which it had so
                    advanced. Moreover, the Bank of England, by virtue of its financial power,
                    became a great political institution, existing by and for the principles of the
                    Revolution; and to it much more than to the public debt may be applied the
                    statement of Bolingbroke that, while the taxes necessary for the expenditure of
                    the eight years’ war might have been met by taxation within the year, the
                    Government of the Revolution preferred to incur debt, because the holders of the
                    public securities were thereby interested in the maintenance of the new
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>A singular tax was imposed in the year 1694, that on marriages, births, and
                    burials, on bachelors and widowers. These taxes were graduated, rising from four
                    shillings on the burial of the humblest person to £50 in the case of a duke or
                    duchess. The duty on births ranged from two shillings to £30, on marriages from
                    two and sixpence to £50, on bachelors and widowers from a shilling a year to
                    £12, 10s. In the same year taxes were imposed on glass, stone and earthenware,
                    coals and culm. In the next year the currency was reformed, the Government
                    conceiving it expedient that the cost of restoring the clipped and hammered
                    money should be borne by the nation.</p>
                <p>During the period in which the old money was being called in, and the new coinage
                    struck and issued, the country was in the direst distress. But the fertile
                    genius of Montagu, now chancellor of the exchequer, invented exchequer bills.
                    Long ago, exchequer tallies, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> certificates of
                    indebtedness on the part of the exchequer, had been in circulation, or at any
                    rate been negotiated. But the first exchequer bills—these did not bear
                    interest—were virtually a Government paper based on the security of the revenue,
                    and intended to be a temporary substitute for the currency, now deficient, but
                    in course of restoration and extension. They came at a critical time, and
                    supplied an urgent want. Thus they were an immediate success. They helped to
                    sustain mercantile credit, they lightened the burden of pressing charges on the
                    revenue, they supplemented the weakness of the currency, and they thenceforward
                    formed part of the machinery of English finance. The second issue of exchequer
                    bills bore interest at 5d. per cent, per diem, ι.e., a little over 7∣ per cent,
                    per annum. These instruments of credit were put into circulation in amounts from
                    £5 upwards. Exchequer bills survived a risk which has been fatal to similar
                    instruments, for in 1698 it was discovered that an extensive forgery of them had
                    been perpetrated, for which some few persons were punished, though the greater
                    criminals escaped. In 1696 the malt tax was first imposed. During the reign of
                    William the whole amount of receipts for revenue was a little over 72 millions,
                    <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> rather more than 5¾ millions annually. Of this
                    amount, about 34⅜ millions are obtained by indirect taxation, about 211 millions
                    by direct taxation, 2 ¾ millions from the post office and the hearth money, and
                    nearly 13⅜ millions remained as debt. The expenditure was about 45 millions on
                    the public service, nearly 9 millions on the civil list, and rather more than 18
                    millions on various objects, including repayment of debt.</p>
                <p>In forty years, then, the English financiers had found out how elastic and
                    fertile indirect taxation is. We shall see in the course of a century and a half
                    how they used their discovery, and improved on it. Hitherto most of the indirect
                    taxes had been imposed temporarily; the policy on which the country was about to
                    enter necessitated their perpetual imposition. Thus, for example, the malt tax,
                    having been a temporary tax in the eiglit years’ war, was revived and made a
                    permanent tax at the beginning of the war of the Spanish succession. The
                    principal sources, however, of the extraordinary revenue needed for this war
                    were customs and excise, land taxes, stamps, and similar duties, and loans. The
                    amount of debt contracted during the period was a little in excess over that
                    obtained by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n192/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0192-0183"/> land tax, the land tax being less than two-thirds
                    of that obtained by indirect taxation. The form in which the loans were raised
                    was annuities on lives or on terms of years, granted on disadvantageous
                    conditions, lotteries, and the funding of floating debt. The latter operation
                    was in part undertaken by the Bank of England, which thus considerably enlarged
                    its capital. The rate of interest was about 6 per cent., and it appears that the
                    form in which the loans were contracted -was the best method after all in which
                    the Government could borrow.</p>
                <p>A still larger operation was attempted by Harley in 1710. A new company was
                    formed, which was to take the unfunded debt, amounting to more than 19 millions,
                    to receive 6 per cent on the sum, with £8000 a year for expenses of management,
                    and in consideration of having performed this financial operation for the
                    Government, was to be invested with the sole privilege of trading to the South
                    Seas. This was the origin of that famous company which ten years afterwards
                    obtained so scandalous a notoriety. In 1715 the aggregate fund was established.
                    Numerous taxes had been made perpetual, and the Act creating this fund directed
                    that the proceeds of these taxes, with the surplus of other revenues, and all
                    other public money, should be brought into the exchequer as a collective
                    quantity. But by this time the whole revenue of the country, with the exception
                    of the annual land and malt taxes, had been pledged to the various loans
                    contracted during the two wars which followed on the Revolution. An attempt was
                    made to lighten the burden of the debt in another direction of finance, i.e., by
                    diminishing the rate of interest.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the peace of Utrecht the rate of interest began to fall, and
                    continued to decline till it became possible to make use of the fact for the
                    purpose of effecting a considerable reduction in the annual charge of the debt.
                    An attempt was therefore made in 1717 to obtain a small loan at 4 per cent. The
                    project was permature as yet; only a trifling sum was subscribed, and at last it
                    became necessary to raise the rate to 5 per cent. But in order to consolidate
                    parliamentary credit, the Government of the day created three new funds in
                    addition to the aggregate fund of 1715. These are called the South Sea fund, the
                    general fund, and the sinking fund. The aggregate fund was the guarantee under
                    which the Bank of England consented to accept 5 instead of 6 per cent, on their
                    capital, and to circulate exchequer bills at a very low rate of interest. The
                    South Sea fund was the security afforded by the perpetual duties appropriated to
                    the South Sea Company at the foundation of that corporation, the interest in
                    this case being reduced also from 6 to 5 per cent. In order to pay off such
                    public creditors as were unwilling to submit to the reduction, the two companies
                    agreed to advance 4⅜ millions at 5 per cent., and certain taxes granted
                    heretofore for terms of years were now made perpetual, under the name of the
                    general fund. By these financial operations a saving of more than £300,000 a
                    year was effected. The sinking fund consisted of the surpluses derived from the
                    several other funds, which were to be employed for the extinction of debt, and
                    for no other purpose whatever. The policy of these arrangements, particularly
                    the latter, was soon approved by a considerable rise in the value of stocks.
                    Thus, for example, South Sea stock, which was worth 100f at Ladyday, rose by
                    Michaelmas to 111 J. In the same year, too, the first vote of credit was taken,
                    in expectation of a threatened invasion by Charles XII. of Sweden. The vote was
                    indeed strongly resisted, and as the majority by which it passed was very
                    slender, Townsend, Walpole, Methuen, and Pulteney were put out of office or
                    resigned. In 1719 the surplus of the three funds referred to above, amounting to
                    over £400,000, was applied to the reduction of debt.</p>
                <p>In 1720 the celebrated South Sea scheme was projected. It gives some colour to
                    the opinion of those who hold that commercial and financial follies are
                    epidemic, that a scheme far more disastrous in its eflects than the South Sea
                    bubble was put into shape the year before in France, when Law floated the
                    Mississippi Company. In the month of November 1719 the nominal value of the
                    stock of the French company was 18,000 millions sterling, a sum which the
                    statists of the age reckoned at 180 times more than all the currencies of Europe
                    put together. Both projects were trading companies, and in both companies the
                    grant of trade privileges was made the occasion for negotiating terms with the
                    public creditor through the agency of the company. The immediate object of the
                    negotiations entered into with the South Sea Company was the reduction of what
                    were called the irredeemable annuities, created for long terms of years during
                    the wars of William III. and Anne. It is probable that the proposals of the
                    company would have been, to judge from the success with which the conversion of
                    the various stocks in 1710 was effected, financially satisfactory. But unluckily
                    the other great financial corporation, the Bank of England, bid against the
                    South Sea Company, and in this rivalry the latter offered terms, which were
                    finally accepted, under which the company contemplated the purchase of the whole
                    national debt, to be represented by a total capital of 43 j millions, for which
                    they were to receive interest at 5 per cent. The magnitude of the operation, the
                    difficulty sure to arise when attempts were made to obtain <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide</hi> subscriptions for the large amount which would be required in
                    order to complete the bargain, and the reaction certain to ensue as soon as ever
                    a check was given to the operation, were lost sight of. It was not perhaps so
                    remarkable, when it is mentioned that the very manner of the negotiation between
                    the company and the Government pushed up the price of the original stock much
                    beyond its natural value, a rise which the directors of the company were not
                    slow to take advantage of, and that the stocks of other companies which could
                    offer no exceptional prospects of profit were raised to nearly as absurd a price
                    as that of the South Sea. The directors of the company took advantage of the
                    fictitious price which the stock had reached, and created shares at or near the
                    market value of their stock. As the fever of speculation reached its height, the
                    directors exalted the price of their shares, and it seems even contemplated an
                    issue of stock at the price of ten times its nominal amount. By midsummer the
                    advanced prices of all public stocks are said to have reached a market value of
                    500 millions. Before the books of the company closed on June 22, the directors
                    had negotiated for all the irredeemable debts of the Government. On August 12th
                    they dealt with the redeemable debts, amounting to nearly 14⅛ millions, at the
                    price of 800. When parliament met in December, the price of South Sea stocks had
                    fallen to 200. In the interval, however, the directors declared a dividend of 30
                    per cent, at Christmas, and pledged themselves to a dividend of 50 per cent, for
                    the next twelve years. This might perhaps have been possible had the subscribers
                    made good their payments, had the directors been able to place all their stock
                    at the nominal prices, and if all their loans were repaid. But the payment would
                    only have been temporary, and both principal and finally interest would have
                    speedily been lost to the shareholders.</p>
                <p>The issue to the nation was that the South Sea stock was fixed at nearly 34
                    millions; that this was divided into moieties, one half to be the trading stock
                    of the company, the other to be a fund stock on which dividends should be paid;
                    and that the rate of interest payable by the Government on the whole should be 5
                    per cent till June 2, 1727, when it should be reduced to 4 per cent. The nation
                    suffered <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n193/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0193-0184"/> considerable temporary loss, for the capital of
                    the debt, instead of being reduced, was increased by three millions, and the
                    temporary annuities were converted into a perpetual stock. But, on the other
                    hand, the state secured a reduction of interest within six years, and could, if
                    the state of the money market proved favourable, reduce their rate of interest
                    at an earlier date, or if the revenue exceeded the expenditure could bring the
                    machinery of the sinking fund into operation. In 1727 three-fifths of the public
                    debt was South Sea stock. In 1724 the rate of interest had fallen so much that
                    the bank, on a revision of its bargain with the Government, agreed to accept 4
                    per cent, instead of 5 on its new stock, the old rate of 6 per cent, remaining
                    on its original stock.</p>
                <p>In 1726 it was found possible to borrow at 3 per cent., and a small stock was
                    raised at this rate. In 1727 the land tax, which had been at two shillings for
                    five years, was raised to four. Those customs and excise duties which had now
                    been made permanent, and were reckoned on an average at 30 per cent, of the
                    value of duty-paying and excisable articles, now yielded, with the malt tax,
                    about four and a half millions, or twice as much as the land tax at four
                    shillings in the pound. In 1732-3 the land tax was reduced to a shilling in the
                    pound in order to conciliate the landed interest, the salt taxes were reimposed,
                    and the deficiencies of the revenue were made up from the receipts of the
                    sinking fund, which now amounted to more than a million annually, and by which
                    reductions were made from time to time in the public debt to the amount of more
                    than six millions in the twelve years between 1727 and 1739. As Walpole had been
                    designated the father of the sinking fund, his policy was severely, perhaps
                    sincerely, criticized by the opposition. But while it was certain that the
                    ministers could count on a great majority for the financial scheme which he
                    proposed, it was not equally certain that he could reckon on support except by
                    reducing the land tax, an impost which was sensibly felt by the landowners, and
                    was correspondingly distasteful. The land tax remained at two shillings in the
                    pound from 1733 to 1739. In other words, direct taxation remained odious, and
                    indirect taxation became familiar.</p>
                <p>In 1737 the rate of interest on public securities was less than 3 per cent., for
                    the 3 per cent, stocks were worth 107 in June. This is at about the middle of
                    that remarkable series of years in which the prices of grain were singularly
                    low, a set of facts which is characteristic also of the first half of the 15th
                    century. The cheapness was undoubtedly due in great measure to a succession of
                    abundant harvests, and to the rapid growth of agricultural skill. But it is also
                    to be ascribed in some degree to the increasing dearness of the precious metals,
                    especially silver, and it is likely, for economical reasons which would not be
                    in place to allege here, that a period in which the precious metals are dear
                    will be accompanied by persistently low rates of interest. It is manifest that,
                    at the present time, gold is rapidly increasing in value, and that a low rate of
                    interest has accompanied this fact, as it will in all likelihood continue. The
                    House of Commons resolved, in view of the high prices to which public securities
                    had risen, that the rate of interest on all Government stocks which were
                    redeemable should be reduced to 3 per cent. A bill was brought forward embodying
                    this resolution, and was read twice, but lost in the course of the session. It
                    appears that the plan was frustrated in deference to the monied interest. That
                    it caused some alarm to the holders of redeemable stocks is proved by the fact
                    that, when the three per cents, stood at £105, 3s. 8d., the four per cents, were
                    at £113 only.</p>
                <p>There is one incident in the history of Walpole’s financial projects which must
                    be referred to. In 1733 this minister brought forward his famous excise scheme.
                    The payment of customs duties by the importers was obligatory on the landing of
                    such articles as were liable to the tax, or the importer, if he desired delay,
                    was compelled to enter into a bond with sufficient securities for the payment of
                    the impost. The inconveniences of the system were obvious. If the importer were
                    in narrow circumstances, he was frequently obliged to realize the value of his
                    goods by immediate sales, when the market price was low already, and was thus
                    deprived of one advantage which is characteristic of capital, that it enables
                    the possessor of it to wait for favourable markets. It inflicted the maximum
                    loss on the consumer, to whom the tax was of course transferred, and a minimum
                    advantage to the Government; for of course the trader’s profit was derived from
                    capital advanced for payment of duty, estimated by the time intervening between
                    the importation and the sale. It tended towards limiting competition in foreign
                    products, for the wealthier merchants had nearly a monopoly of sale in articles
                    on which considerable customs duties were charged, owing to the necessity of
                    finding the tax at once. A further assistance was given to such merchants by the
                    rule under which the importer who paid his tax promptly was allowed a bonus of
                    10 per cent, on the amount of the tax. It opened the way for frauds on the
                    revenue, for it encouraged smuggling, and assisted the dishonest exporter of
                    foreign produce in obtaining a fraudulent drawback. It checked the carrying
                    trade, narrowed consumption, and impaired the revenue.</p>
                <p>The reform which Walpole contemplated was to extend to foreign products imported
                    into Great Britain that system which was already practised with such articles as
                    were liable to the internal duties of excise, <hi rend="italic">iae.,</hi> to
                    permit the storage of foreign goods in bonded warehouses on the payment of a
                    trifling landing duty. Thus tobacco—the experiment was to be tried with tobacco
                    and wine at first—was liable to 6|d. per pound. Walpole proposed to reduce the
                    tax to 4¾d., to levy ¾d. on importation and deposit in the warehouse, the import
                    duty being payable as part of the hereditary excise, but being repaid on
                    exportation, and to delay the payment of the 4d. till such time as the owner of
                    the goods might wish to dispose of it to the dealer for home consumption. In
                    this way Walpole contemplated that a great ease would be afforded to the fair
                    trader, and that frauds on the revenue—an invariable source of loss to the
                    honest merchant—would be obviated. It is clear that Walpole anticipated that the
                    revenue would gain all from the check to smuggling and factitious drawbacks
                    which it lost in reducing the duty.</p>
                <p>It was unfortunate for Walpole’s project that he brought it forward at a time
                    when he had, in deference to the clamour of the landed interest, reduced the
                    land tax to a shilling in the pound, and suspended the operation of the sinking
                    fund. It is true that the plan was not wrecked on these issues, though they must
                    have been present to the minds of many among those who resisted it. It was in
                    vain that Walpole most accurately predicted, as the result of his reform, “that
                    it would make London a free port, and by consequence the market of the world.”
                    The great merchants, who had a monopoly of importation; the smugglers who, in
                    that age of corruption, found means to make themselves a parliamentary power;
                    the public, which loathed the excise as an inquisitorial system, begun in the
                    old days of Cromwell’s military usurpation, continued in order to sustain the
                    foreign policy which the Government of the Revolution had prosecuted, and
                    extended in order to enrich foreign favourites and to bribe the servants of the
                    state; and the patriots, as the opposition called themselves, eager to use every
                    chance against Walpole, even when he was in the right, because they had so
                    pertinaciously asserted that he was always in the wrong,—united to defeat the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n194/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0194-0185"/> project. Walpole’s life was threatened in the
                    streets, and, what he feared more, his majority was imperilled in the House. The
                    warehousing scheme was abandoned, and not revived till 1803. The elder Pitt,
                    when, being in the ascendant, he could afford to criticize his own conduct, said
                    that he regretted nothing so much as his opposition to Walpole’s excise. It is
                    singular that the principal works on commerce and finance which were published
                    before the adoption of the bonded warehouses system pass over Walpole’s plan in
                    silence.</p>
                <p>The public debt was increased between 1739 and 1748, the date of the peace of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, by about 28 millions, the interest on this sum being
                    principally provided by duties on spirits, though during the whole period the
                    land tax was put at 4s. In 1750 it was reduced to 3s. But the old customs and
                    excises were continued and increased. In 1731 a duty of 20s. a gallon had been
                    imposed on gin, with a view to checking its use. It is well known that this
                    prohibitory duty led to extensive smuggling, and to illicit distillation on a
                    large scale. Hence in 1743, when the Government was on the look-out for means,
                    it was proposed to repeal the Act of 1731, and impose remunerative duties in the
                    place of the prohibitive tax. The proposal was resisted on grounds of health and
                    morals, but was carried.</p>
                <p>Early in 1750 the plan suggested in Walpole’s time of reducing the rate of
                    interest on public securities, with the option of receiving the principal, was
                    revived, as the three per cents, had been above par in the autumn of 1746. The
                    amount to be treated in this way was nearly 58 millions. The holders of the
                    stock were offered 4 per cent, for 1750, 3J till the end of 1757, and 3
                    afterwards. In the course of the year the terms were, except for about 3¾
                    millions, agreed to. In the next year the consolidated stock was first formed by
                    merging nine separate loans into a common 3 per cent, fund, and subsequently
                    other stocks were consolidated in the same manner. The project was not only
                    highly successful, but the new three per cents, rose in June of the same year to
                    106⅜. In 1753-4 the land tax was reduced to 2s. In 1755, when the Seven Years’
                    War was imminent, the land tax was raised to 4s., at which sum it continued,
                    except in 1767, 1768, 1769, 1770, 1772, 1773, 1774, 1775, till 1798, when, being
                    made perpetual, the ceremony of its being granted annually was abandoned. During
                    the Seven Years’ War and onwards, it became the practice of English financiers
                    to invite loans upon one of three principles. They either offered such a
                    variable sum of three per cent, annuities as represented the difference between
                    the value of this security and the same amount actually lent, as, for example,
                    £120 stock for £100 borrowed: or a fixed amount of stock for a variable
                    percentage, as £100 stock for (say) £80 lent; or gave £100 stock, and a variable
                    sum in long or life annuities, as (say) £100 stock and 22s. 6d. per cent, per
                    £100 subscribed for ninety-nine years. The loans raised during the Seven Years’
                    War were far in excess of any that had been negotiated before. . That, for
                    instance, of 1760 was twelve millions, and the same sum was raised in the next
                    year. When the peace of Paris was signed in February 1763, the nominal capital
                    of the English funded debt was in amount nearly double that which had been
                    incurred up to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
                <p>The loser in the Seven Years’ War was France. It was prostrated, was stripped of
                    its colonies, and wholly impoverished. No war in the world’s history had such
                    important results on the remote future as this has had. From this time France
                    ceased to be a colonizing nation, and England occupied its place, as well as
                    extended the settlements which it had already founded. At the beginning of the
                    Seven Years’ War, France was the determined rival of England in the East, and
                    had occupied the south and north of the English plantations in the West. At the
                    conclusion of the Seven Years’ War, it had lost both its colonial centres. By
                    this loss it was also deprived of one among those outlets for discontent which
                    have been so serviceable to the Governments of Western Europe. Emigration does
                    not relieve a country of its population so much as it does of its dissatisfied
                    and disaffected members. The destruction of French colonial enterprise had no
                    little indirect effect on the passions of the Revolution. The supremacy of
                    England in the northern part of the New World led the Protestant inhabitants of
                    Ireland, bowed down and impoverished by the oppressive revenue laws of England,
                    to emigrate westwards, and so give at home an opportunity for the Irish
                    Catholics to reassert themselves, and for the Americans to strengthen or recruit
                    themselves in the War of Independence. Again, the charges of the Seven Years’
                    War were so great that the British parliament tried to help itself by taxing the
                    colonies; the colonies met this project, after various acts of resistance, by
                    the Declaration of Independence; the war of American independence found an ally
                    in France, which was eager to blot out the memories of the Seven Years’ War; the
                    reaction of republican America on monarchical France aided those theories which
                    developed the French Revolution. On the Revolution followed the Empire; the
                    Empire induced the reaction of the Holy Alliance; from this came the western
                    rising of 1830, the general rising of 1848, and ultimately the doctrine of
                    modern European politics, that, namely, of the nationalities.</p>
                <p>We are concerned, however, with the financial consequences of the Seven Years’
                    War. It was in no slight degree provoked by the hostility of the French and
                    English settlers in America, and it had been carried on at an enormous expense.
                    The result was to secure the ascendency of the English race on the American
                    continent. It appeared to deserve the gratitude and the sacrifices of the
                    colonists. There is little doubt that the inhabitants of the plantations would
                    have recognized these facts, and have responded according to their means to an
                    appeal made to them by the ministry. In an evil hour the ministry attempted to
                    impose taxes on them by the authority of the English parliament. No one, not
                    even the colonists themselves, doubted that the English parliament could enact
                    laws for the colonies, could regulate their trade, could dictate the course of
                    their industry, and thus as effectually bring them within the financial
                    arrangements of the British empire as though it collected a revenue from them.
                    In fact the colonial system was really a department of finance, though its
                    details were defended on those mercantile principles which Adam Smith expounded
                    and refuted. The imposition of the Stamp Act was resented on political
                    principles, and was resented successfully. Passed in 1765, it was repealed in
                    1766, though at the same time the House of Commons passed an Act asserting, in
                    the broadest manner, the right of the English parliament to tax its
                    dependencies. The Americans answered by refusing to· consume British goods. As
                    is well known, the ultimate cause of the revolt of the colonies was the despatch
                    of the East India Company’s tea ships to Boston, the tax on tea imposed on the
                    colonists being nominally retained in order to serve the interests of the
                    company, whose finances were seriously affected at the time, but really in order
                    to affirm the right, on which king, ministry, and parliament insisted, of taxing
                    the colonies through the machinery of the English House of Commons.</p>
                <p>From the outbreak of the War of American Independence the land tax was annually
                    granted at 4s. in the pound, though of course on the old assessment. It formed
                    the basis on which an annual issue of two millions in exchequer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0195-0186"/> bills was made. But the residue of the means from
                    which the interest on the annual increment of debt was payable was derived from
                    taxes on consumption and stamps, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from indirect
                    sources. The actual debt created during the American war was nearly 97∣
                    millions. The sum received from loans was 75J millions, and the annual sum
                    needed for the interest on this debt was a little over 4 millions. In 1786 Pitt,
                    after inviting the attention of parliament to the magnitude of the debt, and the
                    necessity for reducing it, proposed to revive and make permanent the machinery
                    of a sinking fund. The minister had taken counsel with Dr Price, who for some
                    years previously had been lamenting the downfall of Walpole’s sinking fund, and
                    urging that by borrowing at simple interest great accumulations might be formed
                    at compound interest, and that thereby the debt would be ultimately
                    extinguished. Pitt’s proposal was that the exchequer should pay a million
                    annually in quarterly instalments to six eminent persons, who should invest the
                    sum in the purchase of stock, and that this payment should have precedence over
                    any other issues of the exchequer, except the interest on the debt. He intended
                    that the interest on this fund should accumulate with the annual receipts, and
                    he calculated that in twenty-eight years the fund, with accumulated interest,
                    would yield an annual surplus of four millions. When this sum was reached, the
                    interest was to be at the disposal of parliament.</p>
                <p>An amendment was proposed on Pitt’s proposal by Fox, to the effect that when at
                    any future time a loan was proposed, say of six millions, the commissioners, if
                    they had sufficient funds at their disposal, might purchase a sixth of the
                    stock. It was accepted by Pitt, and formed the process by which, during the
                    great Continental war, the commissioners of the sinking fund continued to lend
                    their balances and the annual sum which they received from the Government to the
                    state, thus piling up an imaginary obligation of the nation to itself, which
                    seemed to extinguish public debt, but which would certainly be treated as a
                    fiction, as indeed came to be the case, when the great war was over. The
                    efficiency of the sinking fund consisted entirely in the extent to which, by
                    requiring an income which should be in excess of expenditure, it necessarily
                    diminished debt. Its delusiveness arose from the fact that the actual funds
                    which it had accumulated were actually invaded under the pressure of
                    war-taxation and expenditure, and that its nominal continuance was accompanied
                    by the creation of a fictitious loan, the process of which was burdened by the
                    expenses of an office. Other schemes were adopted subsequently, more or less
                    similar to the old sinking funds, in later times, to which we shall allude
                    presently.</p>
                <p>For a short time before 1793, when England began her longest and costliest war,
                    the English funds rose greatly in value, chiefly, it is said, because they were
                    conceived to be the safest investment which could be found for those who were
                    flying from the Continent in dread of actual or prospective violence. But
                    immediately on the outbreak of hostilities with France the country was put to
                    the severest straits. In the year 1793 a serious commercial panic occurred,
                    accompanied with an unparalleled number of bankruptcies. Loans of enormous
                    amounts were raised as the war went on; the current expenses of Government were
                    met by credits on the bank; and at last, on February 27, 1797, the Privy Council
                    ordered the Bank of England to suspend cash payments. For twenty-three years
                    afterwards the suspension was continued.</p>
                <p>Up to 1796 the additional burdens which were imposed to meet the interest on
                    loans and to defray some of the annual charges of the war were raised almost
                    entirely from indirect taxation on consumption, sometimes on production, but not
                    on property. But in this year Pitt proposed to levy duties on the succession to
                    real and personal estate. Knowing that his budget would meet with hostile
                    criticism, he determined to divide his bill, and impose the projected tax on
                    real and personal estate by separate enactments. The tax on personalty was
                    accepted with very little remonstrance, though a few solid objections were urged
                    against the measure. But the country party strongly resented the proposed tax on
                    real estate. They absented themselves from the House, and nearly left Pitt in a
                    minority. The minister felt that he must give way to them, and postponed his
                    bill for granting duties on realty in succession for three months, thus
                    virtually abandoning the project. The discrepancy, therefore, between the
                    liabilities of real and personal estate, when they become the subject of devise
                    or succession, has never been remedied. It is true that an attempt was made by
                    Lord Lauderdale to suspend the operation of the Act which had been passed, till
                    such time as the anomaly might be rectified. But he was ruled to be out of
                    order, on the ground that no bill after it has been passed can be repealed or
                    modified in the same session. Like many similar Acts, the legacy duty was
                    tentative, and the rates of tax were progressively raised according to the
                    proximity of blood in which the legatee or heir stood to the testator or
                    ancestor. In order to compel the making of wills, and to obviate the risk that
                    persons might avoid a testamentary disposition with a view to escape the legacy
                    duties, exceptional probate duty was imposed on those estates which were
                    administered without a will.</p>
                <p>Apart from the manifest inequality of a tax which omitted to charge succession
                    duty upon real estate, especially at a time in which the value of such estate
                    was rapidly rising, objections were alleged against the tax on the ground that
                    it was likely to inflict inconvenience or injury in the case of persons engaged
                    in trade by the compulsory exposure of their circumstances, and because it was
                    sure to breed discontent. More subtle was the objection taken by Lord
                    Lauderdale, and afterwards by Mr Ricardo, on the ground that it was a tax on
                    capital, and therefore injurious to the development of wealth. The answer to
                    this objection is, however, simple. It is impossible for a Government to tax
                    that which cannot be saved, but must be consumed in order that industry may be
                    continuous. Now that which may be saved is either consumed in superfluities, and
                    therefore may be made the subject of direct or indirect taxation, as the case
                    may be, or is saved and employed as capital, or accumulated as reserve. In other
                    words, not only is it not true that capital should not be taxed, but it is tree
                    that nothing but that which is or may be capital can be taxed.</p>
                <p>More valid than this objection to legacy duties is that which can be alleged from
                    the fact that, under existing circumstances, it is easy for the wealthy to evade
                    the tax by a <hi rend="italic">donatio inter vivos.</hi> Tlιe attempt to evade
                    duties or liabilities on successions is a very old practice in England. One of
                    the earliest, after the Great Charter perhaps the earliest, written law in
                    English history, the Statute of Marlebridge, is intended to defeat attempts to
                    evade feudal dues by such donations. There can be no doubt that similar
                    practices prevail at present. Nor can they be prevented until voluntary gifts
                    and transfers are registered, published, and rendered traceable at last to the
                    officers of the revenue, who might have powers to visit with penalties in
                    addition to ordinary duties all conveyances and transfers made at such a date
                    previous to the death of the donor as would indicate that the gift could
                    reasonably be interpreted to imply an intention of evading legacy duty. But at
                    the same time it cannot be stated too often that, first, it is not always the
                    best system of taxation which must be adopted, but the best possible system,
                    since communities require to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0196-0187"/> be habituated to a new tax; and, next, that any
                    unfairness in the imposition of taxation is sure to suggest evasion. A financier
                    must be just, if he wishes the taxpayer to be honest. There are three offences
                    against the revenue, looked on as very differently culpable, but all stimulated
                    by financial error or injustice. The first is that just alluded to, a gift of
                    property during the life of the donor with a view to evade the legacy duties.
                    This fraud is thought scarcely culpable, though it will be obvious that it is
                    much more easy for the wealthy to practise it than for those who are in narrow
                    or moderate circumstances. The second is the evasion of the charges imposed on
                    earnings by the so-called property tax, but which is of course no property tax
                    at all, since large masses of property are exempted from its operation, and
                    incomes which are in no sense property are taxed at the same rate as those which
                    issue from property. The third, now considered as merely vulgar larceny, is
                    smuggling. A generation ago public sympathy was strongly with the smuggler. The
                    change in this opinion is intelligible and instructive. The greater part of
                    English taxation of an indirect kind was imposed for political purposes, or to
                    serve private interests, up to the time when Sir Robert Peel, nearly forty years
                    ago, began seriously to reform the tariff. In course of time, he and those who
                    succeeded to his policy have adopted and carried out the principles that
                    protection must be abandoned, that finance must not be manipulated in order to
                    suit political antipathies, and that taxation must be imposed for revenue
                    purposes only. The progress of these principles has extinguished the trade of
                    the smuggler. For a long time even economists argued that the smuggler was the
                    practical critic of a vicious system of finance. It may be predicted with some
                    confidence that, when a just property tax is imposed instead of an unfair income
                    tax, public opinion will enforce a morality which it does not require at
                    present, and will assist the Government in enforcing that morality by penalties
                    and by compulsory publicity; and that similarly when real estate is made liable
                    to the same duties as are imposed on personalty, the disposition to evade the
                    duties will be checked, and that machinery of Government which detects and
                    chastises fraud will be strengthened and enforced.</p>
                <p>The disasters which followed on the outbreak of the great Continental war, the
                    enormous cost at which the war was carried on, and the demand for money in order
                    to meet current charges, produced serious effects on the currency. A
                    considerable exaltation took place in the value of gold, and as gold had become
                    the chief currency of England, its exportation was under the circumstances
                    inevitable. In 1794 the Bank of England possessed in cash and bullion over 8
                    millions. In February 1797 the stock of treasure had sunk to l† millions. The
                    Government had overdraw n its account with the Bank on February 25, 1797, to the
                    amount of nearly 10 millions, and was demanding further advances. It is true
                    that no real alarm was felt for the ultimate solvency of the Bank, but
                    considerable and just alarm was entertained as to the convertibility of the
                    notes. Hence the Government, on February 27, 1797, ordered the Bank of England
                    to suspend cash payments, and shortly afterwards authorized the issue of notes
                    below five pounds.</p>
                <p>In November 1797 Mr Pitt introduced what he called a new and solid system of
                    finance. The scheme was afterwards explained to consist in a triple assessment,
                    t.e., a trebling of all the assessed taxes imposed on individuals, with a
                    limitation, however, that such a tax should not exceed the tenth of the
                    taxpayer’s income. It was estimated that this tax would yield 7 millions, but
                    the result was disappointing. From the first it was exceedingly unpopular. It
                    was felt to be unequal, and to press with peculiar severity on those whose
                    avocations constrained them to contribute to those assessments which the
                    Government imposed, and perhaps necessarily, without much consideration for
                    those who had to pay them. At the same time the poor escaped the tax, for
                    according to Pitt’s budget speech, the assessed taxes were leviable on between
                    700,000 and 800,000 householders, and yielded £2,700,000, though the
                    contributions of 400,000 of these householders did not amount to more than
                    £150,000.</p>
                <p>The triple assessment lasted only a year. It was probably intended only to be
                    preparatory for the income tax, which was imposed in 1798. Indeed, if the
                    expenditure of the war was to be met by any other resource than loans, it was
                    necessary to discover some tax which should reach all classes who could be made
                    to contribute to the necessities of the exchequer. Now it was plain that, had
                    the assessed taxes been ever so productive,—the amount actually received from
                    them was only two-thirds of their estimated yield,—they are more or less
                    optional in character, and could therefore be evaded. The income tax, according
                    to Lord Stanhope, had often been urged on Pitt, and especially by Bishop Watson.
                    It began as a graduated percentage. If the income of the taxpayer was between
                    £60 and £65 a year—it was not imposed on those rated below that sum— the tax was
                    to be a 120th part of the income, and the proportion gradually rose to a 10 per
                    cent, tax on incomes of £200 and upwards. Pitt estimated the produce of the tax
                    at 10 millions; it actually yielded only 7. It was imposed as a war tax, to
                    cease at a declaration of peace. But Pitt immediately pledged it to a loan, and
                    in 1801 3 millions of its annual produce was thus appropriated to irredeemable
                    debt. The remission of the tax then rendered it necessary that new taxes should
                    be imposed, and such was the course actually adopted after the short-lived peace
                    of Amiens.</p>
                <p>The income tax was criticized by Lord Holland on grounds very familiar to us in
                    the later times, namely, that it visited incomes “derived from permanent and
                    disposable capital, those arising from precarious and temporary possessions, and
                    those from labour, talents, and industry at the same rate, and was therefore
                    unjust, unequal, and impolitic.” It was also argued that the term property tax
                    was a misnomer,—that property was often not visited by the tax at all, and that
                    what was not property was mulcted. It was alleged that to require the disclosure
                    of one’s circumstances was contrary to the prejudices and customs of Englishmen,
                    was unconstitutional, and a serious injury to commerce and trade, since
                    merchants, it was alleged, would often find it convenient to sacrifice more than
                    a tenth of their income rather than permit the publication of their affairs,
                    and, lastly, that it was a violation of public faith with the stockholder, whose
                    dividends were mulcted, by the intervention of that very Government which was
                    pledged to pay him an irredeemable annuity, of one tenth of his just due. But no
                    objection seems to have been alleged, on the one hand, against the graduated
                    character of the tax, nor, on the other, against the low limit on which the full
                    amount was exacted.</p>
                <p>At the remission of the income tax imposts to the amount of 38∣ millions a year
                    were paid, this sum being double the amount raised in 1793. With the exception
                    of the perpetual land tax, a little over 2 millions, and every year becoming
                    more disproportionate to the rising value of land, almost the whole of this
                    amount was raised on consumption, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from indirect
                    sources. Rents rose rapidly, under the joint operation of high prices and
                    deficient crops. Profits increased, owing partly to the legitimate growth of
                    manufacturing industry,—for the inventions of Hargreaves, Arkwright, and Watt
                    were beginning to produce their effects,— partly to the enormous expenditure of
                    Government, and to the subsidies and loans which were lavished on the <pb

                    of British manufactures. But the condition of the working classes became
                    deplorable. Mr Porter has proved with minute exactness that the real burden of
                    the long and exhausting Continental war was, as far as England is concerned,
                    mainly sustained by labour.</p>
                <p>In 1803 the income tax, under the name of a property tax, was reimposed. The
                    sources of income were distinguished and put into five schedules named A, B, C,
                    D, E,—being respectively lands, tenements, mines, &lt;fcc.; occupancies or
                    tenancies; shares, annuities, and dividends; profits and gains in professions
                    and callings; and public offices of profit and pensions. On all but the second a
                    tax of a shilling in the pound was levied, but on the second ninepence only in
                    England and sixpence in Scotland. Incomes below £60 a year were exempt from the
                    tax, and, following the analogy in some degree of the first income tax, a
                    reduction of the rate was made in incomes increasing by £10 a year up to £150,
                    beginning at threepence in the pound tax up to elevenpence, the largest
                    remission being made on the largest income. But it will be observed that, as in
                    the first income tax, the quantity payable increased with the income, so in this
                    system the deduction increased with the receipts of the taxpayer, though it
                    ceased at a low amount of income. Furthermore, some consideration was shown to
                    those who had families. Those householders who had more than two children were
                    allowed, on incomes between £60 and £400, a reduction in the rate of 4 per cent,
                    for each child; those between £400 and £1000, 3 per cent; those between £1000
                    and £5000, 2 per cent; those who had £5000 and upwards, 1 per cent, for each
                    child.</p>
                <p>In 1805 25 per cent, was added to the income tax, and in 1807 it was raised to
                    two shillings in the pound on incomes in schedules A, C, D, and E, and to
                    eighteen-ρence in England and a shilling in Scotland on the annual rental of
                    tenancies under schedule B. The limit of exemption was lowered to £50, and an
                    abatement of a shilling in the pound was allowed on al] incomes between £50 and
                    £150 a year. Labourers and artisans whose earnings were less than thirty
                    shillings a week were exempted from the tax, but it does not appear that the
                    deductions in the case of children were allowed, as in the Act of 1803. The war
                    income tax was levied up to April 5, 1816, when it expired, and despite the
                    efforts of Castlereagh and others who urged its continuance, parliament refused
                    to sanction the impost any longer.</p>
                <p>The rejection of the income tax as a means of revenue in 1816 necessitated, at
                    the winding up of the costly Continental war, the imposition of indirect taxes
                    upon most processes of production and all of consumption, for the corn laws and
                    customs duties on foreign imports of food exalted indirectly the value of home
                    produce. Industry was checked at its source. Food, the raw material of labour,
                    was rendered scarce, while the farmer, who conceived that the maintenance of the
                    corn laws was his only hope of profit, and the sole power by which he could pay
                    his rent, was mocked by violent fluctuations of prices, and was equally ruined
                    by plenty and by scarcity.</p>
                <p>The first hint given that the progress of the nation was impossible until its
                    fiscal system was revised, was the formation and presentation of the Merchants’
                    Petition. This remarkable document was drawn up by Mr Tooke, who has narrated,
                    in the last volume of his <hi rend="italic">History of Prices,</hi> the
                    circumstances under which it was composed, signed, and presented to the House of
                    Commons. It was not presented in the House of Lords, for Tooke had resolved on
                    committing the document to the hands of Lord Lansdowne. But those who had signed
                    the petition objected to this nobleman, on the ground of his Whig principles,
                    and the framer of the petition would not give way. The petition was presented to
                    the House of Commons by Mr Baring, afterwards Lord Ashburton, and was debated.
                    The Government, that of Lord Liverpool, expressed its agreement in the
                    principles which the petition avowed,—those, in short, of free trade,—and
                    admitted that these principles were not only abstractedly correct, but ought to
                    be adopted at once if one were making a beginning, but declined to agree to the
                    inference that they could be adopted in a country where trade and commerce were
                    and had been for so long a time based on artificial restrictions. The protected
                    interests, however, signified pretty clearly that they would not allow
                    themselves to be molested. But the Government granted a committee of inquiry on
                    foreign trade, and with this committee commences the movement which
                    six-and-twenty years later culminated in the practical adoption of free trade
                    principles and in the abolition of the corn laws. Such a result was only a
                    question of time, when Lord Liverpool could say in May 1820 :—“We have risen to
                    our present greatness under a different system than that of free and
                    unrestricted trade. Some suppose that we have risen in consequence of that
                    system. Others, of whom I am one, believe that we have risen in spite of that
                    system. It is utterly impossible, with our debt and taxation, even if they were
                    but half their amount, that we can suddenly adopt the system of free trade.”
                    Lord Liverpool probably knew that, as Swift had said, “in the arithmetic of the
                    custom-house, two and two do not always make four;” but he was not alive to the
                    enormous fertility of thatsystem of finance which, substituting low for high
                    duties, with some exceptions, and invariably avoiding such fiscal changes as
                    hinder the progress of industry, leaves the widest opportunities for production,
                    exchange, and consumption. Lord Liverpool added that though he supported the
                    coni law of 1815 as a measure of justice to the agricultural interest, he was of
                    opinion that had the bill not passed at that time, it should not have been
                    passed at all. It may be observed, so much was trade hampered at this time by
                    legislation the primary object of which was to extract a revenue at all costs
                    and hazards, that there were more than 1500 custom-house acts relating to the
                    entry, export, and custody of goods.</p>
                <p>The committee of the Commons continued its sittings through three sessions, and
                    presented four reports on the subject of foreign trade, accompanied by abundant
                    evidence. The committee of the Lords sat for two sessions, and presented two
                    reports. The necessity for admitting the principles of free trade was felt and
                    expressed by the committee; but so much alarm was excited among protected
                    interests, even by the recognition of the abstract propriety of free exchange,
                    that the committee felt it necessary to strongly disclaim any sympathy with
                    sudden change, and to calm frightened imaginations by declaring that the
                    greatest prudence and circumspection must precede any project, and accompany any
                    measure of reform. The first thing, however, which people recognized was that
                    great additional taxation did not add but a very small degree to the income of
                    the exchequer. This was the effect of the financial statement of 1819, which
                    Tooke justly characterizes as the last thoroughly vicious project accepted by
                    the House. In 1823 Mr Vansittart retired from office, and during the next five
                    years, when Mr Huskisson was at the Board of Trade, great and notable
                    modifications were made in the customs and excise, for taxes amounting in the
                    aggregate to £8,340,000 were remitted, the experiment being attended by a
                    manifest elasticity in the revenue. The enormous aggregate of custom-house
                    statutes was consolidated into eleven, by the labours of Mr Deacon Hume. Between
                    1827 and 1841 further reforms, though not on so considerable a scale, were made,
                    the most important of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0198-0189"/> which was the abandonment of the excise on beer
                    in 1830, and that on printed cottons in 1831. It is an apt illustration of the
                    effect induced by such duties as this, that within a very short time the price
                    of cottons fell below the amount (3jd. a yard) which was levied under the old
                    excise. But, on the whole, little was done for a systematic financial reform
                    during the period which elapsed between the death of Mr Huskisson and the defeat
                    of the Melbourne administration. One change of great importance was made in the
                    adoption of Mr Rowland Hill’s plan of the penny postage. This scheme involved
                    the immediate sacrifice of revenue to the amount of a million and a quarter, but
                    it gave a considerable impetus to trade, and rendered the discussion of those
                    further fiscal reforms which were effected by Sir Robert Peel easy, perhaps
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Sir Robert Peel’s ministry was formed in September 1841, and had before it a task
                    of no common magnitude. For five years the average deficiency of the revenue,
                    according to Sir Stafford North cote’s statement, had averaged a million and a
                    half, the year in which Sir Robert Peel took office having been characterized by
                    the largest deficiency. The cause of this was that the revenue had fallen short
                    of the estimates; in other words, the financial system of the country was
                    fundamentally vicious. The reforms which Sir Robert Peel immediately determined
                    to bring about were greatly assisted by the information obtained from Mr Joseph
                    Hume’s report of 1840, which stated “that the tariff contained 1150 different
                    rates of duty chargeable on imported articles, besides others imposed on all
                    unenumerated articles; that there was no principle in the finance of the
                    country, some duties being levied for the sake of revenue, some for that of
                    protection; that serious detriment to the home consumer ensued from the
                    differential duties in favour of the colonies; and that of 862 articles
                    chargeable with duty 147 paid no duty at all, while 17 articles supplied 94 per
                    cent, of the revenue, 29 others 4 per cent, more, so that 816 articles yielded
                    no more than 2 per cent, of the revenue, though the imposition of the customs
                    duties was a serious hindrance to trade and manufactures.”</p>
                <p>In drawing up his budget of 1842, Peel had three expedients before him. One was
                    to adjust the corn laws, so as to make themapress less heavily on the consuming
                    and manufacturing classes; the second, to reform the tariff; the third, to
                    obviate the constant deficit in the revenue. The first was undoubtedly the most
                    pressing. The depression of trade and manufactures in 1842 was so serious, and
                    the remedy in a repeal or great reduction of the taxes on food was so obvious to
                    all rational persons, that the measure was in the highest degree expedient. But
                    Peel could not as yet venture upon it; the mere proposal to levy a foreign fixed
                    duty on corn had more than anything else contributed to the downfall of the
                    Whigs in 1841, and the measure was postponed till it was yielded to famine and
                    agitation by an angry and disappointed faction.</p>
                <p>Sir Stafford Northcote, in discussing the fact why the Whigs were the freetraders
                    and the Tories the protectionists in 1842-46, says he sees no particular reason
                    why this phenomenon should have been exhibited, judging from the antecedents of
                    the two historical parties, and he inclines to believe that the Whigs were
                    discredited in the eyes of their opponents by their associations with the
                    Radical party. But the solution of the question is not far to seek. The reforms
                    of Mr Huskisson applied solely to commerce and manufactures, to colonial
                    interests, and to some local industries. Most of those who represented such
                    interests were alive to the fact that protection was no longer necessary for
                    them, or that it was inexpedient that the consumers of colonial produce should
                    be exceptionally taxed in order to give a subvention to colonial planters and
                    their agents. The majority which supported Peel would have been on the whole
                    indifferent to such financial reforms as simply affected manufactures and
                    foreign trade. As consumers, they were benefited by the cheapening of such
                    produce; as producers themselves, they had wit enough to discern that the
                    general prosperity of the country improved the market of the agriculturist. But
                    when it came to be a question whether the artificial prices which the sliding
                    scale was supposed to bestow on farmers and landowners should be abandoned, they
                    were convinced that their interests were being sacrificed; and though they
                    constantly tried to alarm the public with the bugbear of dependence on foreign
                    supply, they frequently admitted that the struggle on their part was to maintain
                    the existing level of their rents. In the 18th century, especially in its
                    earlier half, the country gentlemen would have had no difficulty in accepting
                    free trade, provided they could escape the land tax, for the produce of the
                    country was on an average in excess of its wants; in the first half of the 19th
                    century, they were firmly convinced that all their interests were bound up in
                    the sliding scale, and it must be admitted that the Ricardian theory of rent,
                    now become popular, gave them certain grave scientific reasons for the belief
                    which they entertained.</p>
                <p>The estimates which Sir Robert Peel formed suggested that, if the House would
                    accept his new system of finance, he should be in the possession of a surplus of
                    £1,800,000. The greater part of this sum he proposed to devote to the remission
                    of taxation, the particulars of which may be found in the works of Sir Stafford
                    Northcote, of Mr Tooke, and Mr MOulloch. The estimates, partly from some
                    singular oversights of Sir Robert Peel, partly from the fact that the distress
                    of the country was too serious to be cured by trifling remedies, were a failure,
                    for the receipts of the exchequer, notwithstanding the new taxes which Peel
                    imposed, were two millions less than he anticipated. The process by which the
                    minister sought to put the finances of the country on a sound basis, and to
                    provide a surplus in future years, was the income tax,—an impost which had been
                    decisively rejected in 1816, but was now reimposed for five years at 7d. in the
                    pound. The character of this tax of 1842 varied a little from the old tax of
                    1803, 1805, and 1808. The limit of exemption was fixed at £150 a year, the old
                    schedules were retained, but the farming classes were specially favoured. The
                    rate previously levied on these persons had been three-fourths of the tax
                    imposed on those who are comprised in the other schedules. In 1842 it was made
                    one-half. The income tax was not extended to Ireland, but a higher tax was put
                    on Irish spirits, and on the whole the Irish and English stamp duties were
                    equalized.</p>
                <p>The question has been raised, whether, in case the corn laws had been at once
                    repealed, it would have been necessary to impose the income tax. It is probable
                    that the answer should be in the negative. But apart from the difficulties in
                    the way of a measure which would certainly at this time, as it did four years
                    afterwards, have roused the most angry feelings, it may be safely stated that
                    Peel’s proper business was to establish a surplus, and to effect this in the
                    surest way possible. He could not have succeeded in imposing a just property
                    tax, for such a tax would have been nearly as unpopular among his supporters as
                    a repeal of the corn laws. He therefore imposed an income tax, and though the
                    scheme was criticized adversely, both in the Commons and the Lords, it was
                    carried by overwhelming majorities in both Houses, the arguments against the tax
                    being summed up with great precision in the protests of Lords Radnor and
                    Western. The income tax has since always figured in the budget, and it cannot be
                    denied that, whatever objections may be alleged against its equity, it secured
                    the end which Peel had before him, and has <pb break="no"

                    the deficiencies of revenue due to an increased expenditure.</p>
                <p>In 1843 and 1844 a few remissions of customs duties were effected. But the effect
                    of the tariff reforms was now visible. The excess of income over expenditure in
                    the first year was 2 millions, in the second 6⅜ millions. The wheat crop of 1843
                    was an average, that of 1844 was abundant; the price was low, and the imports of
                    foreign corn nearly ceased. In consequence, Peel was enabled to bring forward
                    his most considerable measure of tariff reform. He remitted no less than 3⅛
                    millions in the customs, and more than a million in the excise. The effect was
                    an increase of income over expenditure of nearly 2¾ millions. In 1846 the
                    remission was three-quarters of a million, but there was again a surplus of 2¾
                    millions. In the same year the repeal of the corn laws was effected, and a
                    modification was made in the sugar duties, followed in 1848 by an equalization
                    of these duties. A little later and the Navigation Acts were repealed; and,
                    finally, the last fragment of protection was extinguished in the abolition of
                    the differential duties on foreign timber. The detailed history of these changes
                    is best given in the last three volumes of Mr Tooke’s <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Prices,</hi> and in the annual summaries of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Economist</hi> newspaper, compiled by Mr Newmarch, who was the coadjutor of Mr
                    Tooke in the last three volumes of the history referred to. The process by which
                    the new system of finance was established is described and illustrated by Sir
                    Stafford Northcote in his <hi rend="italic">Twenty Years of Financial
                    Policy.</hi></p>
                <p>The principles of modern English finance are—(1) to impose as high a duty as is
                    consistent with the prosperity of the revenue on such articles of voluntary
                    consumption as may be dispensed with and may be taken in excess;—of these the
                    most notable are alcoholic liquors and tobacco; (2) to abandon taxation on all
                    articles which are used foí manufacture or food, the last tax of the latter kind
                    which has been extinguished being that on sugar; (3) to levy the lowest duties
                    possible, consistent with revenue purposes, on articles of voluntary consumption
                    and wholly innocent use, of which the best type is tea;—such are the customs and
                    excise, the only trades now under the control of the inland revenue officers
                    being those of the maltster, the brewer, and the distiller; (4) to attempt the
                    collection of as large a revenue as possible at the lowest possible rates on
                    transactions by the mechanism of stamp duties; (5) to simplify the assessed
                    taxes, some of which indeed, as the house duty, are objectionable, and some of
                    which have been perhaps imprudently remitted; and (6) to make use of the income
                    tax as a supplementary means of raising a revenue when the expenditure is
                    notably in excess of the income. Nothing, indeed, is simpler than the function
                    of the chancellor of the exchequer, if he is resolved not to modify the
                    established sources of the revenue or readjust its parts. All that is needed is
                    to impose an additional income tax, or to remit a portion of that which has been
                    imposed.</p>
                <p>It will be seen, however, that the continuity of the present system of British
                    finance depends upon a continuity in the habits of the people. The revenue
                    derived from alcoholic liquors and tobacco amounts annually to about 42
                    millions. That which is supplied from articles of voluntary consumption, the use
                    of which is wholly innocent, is about 4¾ millions, the principal contribution to
                    this head coming from tea. Purely direct taxation—the land, house, and income
                    tax on the one hand (the last-named at 3d. in the pound), and stamps, probate,
                    and legacy duties on the other —yield nearly equal sums, a little short of 8
                    millions each. The post office, which is <hi rend="italic">sui generis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a payment for a special service rendered, supplies a
                    further gross sum of 7 millions. The security, then, of the English revenue
                    depends on the extent to which the habits of consuming alcoholic liquors and
                    tobacco are permanent. The consumption of the former is threatened by a powerful
                    and apparently growing organization and agitation, and it can hardly be doubted
                    that, should those who demand that the control of the traffic in alcoholic
                    liquors ought to be transferred from the present licensing bodies to a direct
                    popular vote be successful, the dimensions of the trade would be curtailed and
                    the revenue diminished. One cannot otherwise account for the alarm which is felt
                    by those interested in the success of the trade at the activity of their
                    critics, and the process by which the advocates of restraint believe that they
                    can compass their ends. It is possible, also, that in the future the poorer
                    classes, whose consumption is the cause of so large a revenue, may imitate the
                    temperance or moderation of those who are better off, and whose habits are to
                    all appearance in marked contrast to those of their progenitors two or three
                    generations ago. Should such a change ensue, it is not easy to determine what
                    would be the direction taken by the financiers of the future; for though there
                    are some obvious sources of taxation, particularly real estate devised or
                    inherited, and property specially so called, yet the receipts from these sources
                    would necessarily be limited, and there is nothing more difficult, as we have
                    attempted to show, than the task of familiarizing a people with a new
                    impost.</p>
                <p>We need not be surprised that such a difficulty is felt and must be encountered
                    when the financier attempts new expedients; for, apart from the natural
                    dissatisfaction with which a new tax is paid, and the resistance which powerful
                    interests may make and have made to such imposts, such as we have seen to have
                    been successful when Pitt attempted to levy an equal charge on the succession to
                    personal and real estate, a tax may make a serious difference to values, or may
                    interfere fatally with an industry. Thus there can be no doubt that the
                    exemptions with which land is favoured in the devolution of real estate is a
                    cause why the rate of return to the purchase money of land is so low. Fixed
                    charges will, of course, in the long run make no difference to the rate of
                    interest derived from investments in land, though they would diminish the value
                    to the vendor. Thus the value of land in France is as high or nearly as high as
                    it is in England, and is much higher in Belgium, though in both countries there
                    is a heavy land tax. But freedom from an accidental tax, a tax which cannot be
                    computed beforehand, is a direct advantage to the vendor, and in the case of
                    land would add to the number of years’ purchase at which the land is sold.</p>
                <p>The taxes which have been laid on industry and consumption, apart from the
                    reckless manner in which they were imposed, were felt far more severely in their
                    first incidence than they were when they became familiar. There is a convenient
                    and suggestive example of the manner in which such taxes affect industry in a
                    matter of recent experience. Apart from the question whether Mr Lowe’s abortive
                    match tax was in itself a judicious impost,— a question which, it may be
                    affirmed, most persons would answer in the negative,—it became plain, when the
                    proposal was made, that two results would follow from its adoption. It would
                    seriously curtail the employment of a very large class of very ill-paid
                    labourers, and thereupon induce great distress on those who were already very
                    poor, and it would ultimately transfer the industry to those countries where no
                    excise is levied on the manufacture. Already, although matches are bulky in
                    proportion to their value, and are conveyed from the place of their origin to
                    the market of consumption at very high rates, owing to the dangerous character
                    of the goods, the competition of a place so distant as Jönköping in Sweden
                    against the English manufacturer is so sharp as to lower materially the profits
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n200/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0200-0191"/> of the home producer, and to make it necessary
                    that the manufacture should be carried on by low-priced labour. It is almost
                    certain that, had the scheme of taxing matches been adopted, the supply of these
                    articles would have rapidly been limited to foreign producers, or it would have
                    been necessary to have established, simultaneously with the impost, a really
                    protective duty on the foreign article.</p>
                <p>Manufactures, indeed, unless they are wholly ruined by taxation, or at least
                    confined to domestic supply, can be and are made to accommodate themselves to
                    circumstances. The amount of capital employed in supplying the taxed commodity
                    diminishes with the demand, competition between capitalists slackens, and in due
                    time the rate of profit in the particular industry reaches its old level. But
                    the process is undoubtedly accompanied by loss to both capitalist and labourer,
                    as well as followed by an enhancement of price to the consumer, together with a
                    still more serious depression of foreign, trade, however fully the duties levied
                    are allowed on export. In illustration of the effect which an erroneous system
                    of finance induces on industry, nothing can be more instructive than the history
                    of the revenue in the few years preceding Peel’s administration of 1841; the
                    effect of the reform in the tariff which that minister adopted; and the loss
                    which ensued from postponing the full effect of these reforms owing to the
                    hesitation which Peel showed in abolishing the corn laws, which could have been
                    much better repealed in 1843 than in 1846.</p>
                <p>It is said, and has been said for the last century, that it is inexpedient to tax
                    capital. To this we have already given the answer. A Government can tax nothing
                    but capital, actual or potential. For all wealth is of two kinds. The first is
                    that which is absolutely necessary for the continuity of industry, and which
                    cannot be taxed without destroying that industry. There can be no tax on
                    necessary consumption. The second is that which can be saved, which is in part
                    saved, in part consumed unproductively. This product of labour can be and can
                    alone be taxed. The English system of finance attempts to levy taxation on a
                    part of this, either directly on revenue, though it might be levied with
                    advantage on the wealth itself, instead of or concurrently with the revenue
                    derived from the wealth, or indirectly on consumption. Nor does the taxation of
                    capital diminish capital. It merely changes its direction. The tax may be
                    expended unwisely, even mischievously. But it undoubtedly calls labour into
                    activity, and may therefore give wider employment than it would if left in the
                    hands of those who are now mulcted of a portion of what they might have saved or
                    spent. It may even increase capital by increasing economy in expenditure, and
                    inducing those who are taxed to fill up the void in their own resources which
                    the tax has created. The expenditure of the Dutch in the palmy days of their
                    finance was enormous; the taxation to which the people submitted was searching
                    to an extent and minuteness which has had no parallel since; but,
                    notwithstanding the prodigious sacrifices which the people made, they
                    accumulated capital so rapidly by reason of parsimony, that those who watched
                    the financial condition of the republic made all sorts of guesses as to what
                    could be the reason why enormous taxation was accompanied by a singularly low
                    rate of interest, and at last some persons, absurdly enough, asserted that the
                    taxation was itself the cause of the low rate.</p>
                <p>Apart from imperial finance, the wealth of this country is liable to other levies
                    imposed for local purposes. Most local taxation is direct, and imposed on
                    occupation. Some, however, is indirect, and levied on consumption. Again, some
                    local taxation is imposed in satisfaction of a local duty, some in consideration
                    of a local service. Thus the duty on coals consumed within a particular radius
                    from St Paul’s cathedral, originally, w e are told, imposed in order to meet
                    some of the losses incurred by the great fire of London, is a tax on
                    consumption, analogous to the octroi duties imposed in Continental towns. The
                    county and borough rates imposed for the maintenance of roads and of police,
                    rates levied for the use of gas and water, are payments intended to be the
                    equivalents of public service, and capable, with greater or less exactness, of
                    being apportioned to the amount of benefit received by the taxpayer. Of late
                    years some large towns have made use of their local needs for the purpose of
                    creating capital on the security of rates, and of deriving some of the profits
                    of a joint-stock company from the sale of gas and water, with a view to
                    lightening other local burdens of a more general kind. Under proper safeguards,
                    such a form of local finance is beneficial and to be encouraged. It bears a
                    close analogy to the Government service of the post office.</p>
                <p>Local finance has followed in one particular the precedent supplied it by the
                    central Government, in anticipating its revenue by loans. Most of these loans,
                    however, are terminable, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> provision is made for
                    repayment of principal as well as interest. The amount of these loans is in
                    excess of 100 millions, and is likely to increase. But most of the increased
                    charge is to be put down to the head of remunerative outlay, there being, as we
                    have stated, an increased disposition—indeed from necessity— on the part of
                    local authorities to undertake the satisfaction of public services, or the
                    supply of public conveniences. The aggregate annual expenditure of the United
                    Kingdom for local and imperial taxation, including loans, is now about 125
                    millions.</p>
