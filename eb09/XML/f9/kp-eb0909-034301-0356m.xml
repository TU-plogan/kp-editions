                    Flour is the grain of wheat reduced to powder, and separated from the outer husk
                    or coverings in which the seed is enveloped. The name is also applied to the
                    grain of other cereals, and to the farinaceous seed of pulses similarly treated,
                    and it is used generally to indicate any finely powdered dry substance; but when
                    the term is employed without any qualification, it invariably means wheaten
                    flour. As preparations of flour form the staple food of all civilized
                    communities of the West, the cultivation of wheat and the manufacture of flour
                    are necessarily industries of the greatest magnitude and importance, rice being
                    the only other grain which rivals (and which indeed possibly surpasses) wheat in
                    the number of human beings it feeds.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of wheat was one of the earliest developments of human
                    civilization, and there are not wanting evidences that in making use of the
                    grain the primitive races submitted it to a coarse pounding or grinding, thereby
                    reducing it to a state resembling the meal of the present day. From remains
                    found on the sites of the ancient lake dwellings of Switzerland it is obvious
                    that the original form of corn-crushing or mealing apparatus consisted of a
                    roundish stone—generally very hard sandstone —about the size of a man’s fist,
                    with certain hollows or flattened surfaces on two opposite sides (figs. 1-3).
                    The rounded outline of the stone worked and fitted into a corresponding cavity
                    in another stone in which the grain to be crushed or pounded was placed. By the
                    deepening of the cavity in under stone and the addition of a wooden handle to
                    the upper stone-ball, would be formed the mortar and pestle; and in another
                    direction, by fitting the upper stone for a motion of rotation within the cavity
                    of the lower, the form of the quern would be produced, and the germ of the
                    modern flour-mill elaborated. In early times, and indeed amid rude forms of
                    society still, the preparation of meal and flour was a part of the domestic
                    operations of preparing bread and otherwise cooking of food. At a period so
                    remote as that of the patriarch Abraham it appears there was a distinction in
                    the qualities of the flour or meal which could be produced, as Sarah was
                    directed to “make ready quickly three measures of <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>
                    meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.” There is much probability in
                    the suggestion of Dr Livingstone that the grinding apparatus used by Sarah was
                    similar to that still used in Central Africa, and figured in the frontispiece of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Zambesi and its Tributaries.</hi> In that work the
                    apparatus is thus described :—</p>
                <p>“The mill consists of a block of granite, syenite, or even micaschist, 15 or 18
                    inches square, and 5 or 6 thick, with a piece of quartz or other hard rock,
                    about the size of a half brick, one side of which has a convex surface, and fits
                    into a concave hollow in the large and stationary stone. The workwoman kneeling
                    grasps this upper millstone with both hands, and works it backwards and forwards
                    in the hollow of the lower millstone, in the same way that a baker works his
                    dough when pressing it and pushing it from him. The weight of the person is
                    brought to bear on the movable stone, and while it is pressed and pushed
                    forwards and backwards, one hand supplies every now and then a little grain, to
                    be thus at first bruised, and then ground on the lower stone, which is placed on
                    the slope, so that the meal when ground falls on to a skin or mat spread for the
                    purpose. This is, pel haps, the most primitive form of mill, and anterior to
                    that in Oriental countries, where two women grind at one mill, and may have been
                    that used by Sarah of old when she entertained the angels.”</p>
                <p>That the two forms of grinding apparatus were familiar to the nations of
                    antiquity is obvious from the allusions made to both in the Pentateuch. In the
                    book of Numbers (xi. 8) we read that the Israelites gathered manna, “ground it
                    in mills, or beat it in a mortar;” and again in Deuteronomy (xxiv. 6) there is
                    an injunction that “no man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to
                    pledge, for he taketh a man’s life to pledge.” Numerous other allusions to
                    mills, mortars, and the grinding of corn are scattered throughout Scripture,
                    from which it is made clear that the grinding of corn was, among the Hebrews, a
                    domestic employment left entirely to women. Among the ancient Romans the mortar
                    and pestle were alone used for pounding wheat, and the work was similarly done
                    by women down to the year 173 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> At that date baking
                    was established as a separate occupation, the craftsmen being called <hi
                    rend="italic">pistores,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">pinsere,</hi> to pound, in
                    allusion to their manner of preparing flour. At a subsequent date mills were
                    introduced, of which the quern was the simplest and original form. It was called
                    the <hi rend="italic">mola</hi><hi rend="italic">manuaria,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">mola trusatilis,</hi> and was worked chiefly by slaves, the labour
                    being regarded as eminently degrading. Later the <hi rend="italic">mola</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">asinaria</hi> moved by animal power, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mola aquaria</hi> or water mill, were employed as a substitute for hand-worked
                    mills. Their <hi rend="italic">mola aquaria</hi> approached in form and
                    mechanism the rude small mills which existed in the more remote parts of
                    Scotland and Ireland down till the early part of the present century. At the
                    beginning of last century a pair of Roman millstones were found at Adel in
                    Yorkshire, and described in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi> One stone, 20 inches in diameter, was convex in outline,
                    while the other was concave, and retained traces of notching.</p>
                <p>The quern, and exceedingly rude water mills, were in use throughout Great Britain
                    for many centuries, and continued to be employed in outlying districts of
                    Scotland and Ireland till very recent times. Strutt, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle of England,</hi> says—“At what time mills were first used in Britain
                    cannot be determined; hand-mills, which without doubt were the most ancient of
                    any, we may conceive were known in the time of Ethelbert, king of Kent, who
                    ruled that nation from the year 560 to the year 616; for in his laws a
                    particular fine of twelve shillings is imposed upon any man who should corrupt
                    the king’s grinding maid;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Leges Ethelberti,</hi> apud Wilkins.</p></note> hence it
                    is also evident that they were turned and tended by women; but it is probable
                    that before the end of the heptarchy water-mills were erected, because in
                    ancient deeds and grants of lands we find mention made of mills, which are
                    generally said to be situated near the water.” Dr Johnson, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland,</hi> describes the
                    working of the quern as seen by himself. “There are water mills,” he says, “in
                    Sky and Raasa, but where they are too far distant the housewives grind their
                    oats with a quern or handmill, which consists of two stones <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0357-0344"/> about a foot and a half in diameter. The lower is
                    a little convex, to which the concavity of the upper must be fitted. In the
                    middle of the upper stone is a round hole, and on one side is a long handle. The
                    grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one hand, and works the
                    handle round with the other. The corn slides down the convexity of the lower
                    stone, and by the motion of the upper is ground in its passage.” The
                    accompanying woodcut (fig. 4) illustrates the leading forms of these primitive
                    mills,— <hi rend="italic">a</hi> representing a pair of rubbing stones, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> a pot quern, and c an ordinary quern with hole in the
                    centre of the upper stone into which the grain was fed, another hole towards one
                    side for receiving the handle, and in the lower stone a spout through which the
                    ground meal was delivered.</p>
                <p>The nature of the water mills which were formerly common in Great Britain and
                    Ireland, and which continued in use well into the present century, may be
                    gathered from the following description of one visited by Sir Walter Scott
                    during his voyage to the Shetland Islands, &amp;c., in 1814 (Lockhart’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life).</hi> “In our return, pass the upper end of the little lake
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cleik-him-in,</hi> which is divided by a rude causeway from
                    another small loch, communicating with it, however, by a sluice, for the purpose
                    of driving a mill. But such a mill! The wheel is horizontal, with the cogs
                    turned diagonally to the water; the beam stands upright, and is inserted in a
                    stone-quern of the old-fashioned construction. This simple machine is inclosed
                    in a hovel about the size of a pig-stye, and there is the mill! There are about
                    500 such mills in Shetland, each incapable of grinding more than a sack at a
                    time.”</p>
                <p>The ordinary flour mill of the present day is a structure of comparatively few
                    essential parts; but in the arrangement and mounting of these the greatest
                    amount of mechanical skill and experience has been exercised, and the
                    accessories of the mill have been elaborated with much care, with the view of
                    saving manual labour and perfecting the processes and results. Fully to
                    appreciate the various processes of modern milling, it is necessary to bear in
                    mind, not only that the wheat as delivered at the mill is dusty and mixed with
                    sand and other refuse, but that it contains many light grains and seeds of
                    foreign substances, which might be deleterious, and would certainly interfere
                    with the appearance of the finished flour. Again the structure of the wheat
                    grain itself must not be overlooked. A grain (caryopsis) of wheat is not a seed,
                    but a fruit consisting of a pericarp or outer envelope tightly adherent to its
                    contained single seed. The envelope consists of several layers of ligneous
                    tissue, within which are the embryo and a peculiar fermentive nitrogenous
                    principle termed cerealin, and finally a central mass of thin cells filled with
                    a white powdery substance largely composed of starch granules. The object of
                    ordinary milling is to grind as perfectly as possible, without breaking the
                    minute granules, the central substance of the grain, and to separate it from the
                    embryo and outer husks, the former constituting the flour, and the latter the
                    bran of the miller. Whole wheaten flour, on the other hand, consists of the
                    entire grain ground up to a uniform mass.</p>
                <p>The machines and processes by which flour is prepared are very numerous, and are
                    diverse in character; and it must further be said that, at the present moment,
                    the whole industry is in a peculiarly unsettled and transition state. The system
                    which has prevailed in the United Kingdom hitherto is what is known as ordinary
                    or flat grinding with millstones; but in the meantime a strong tendency is
                    developing in favour of the use, either partially or entirely, of granulating or
                    “high milling,” and of some of the various systems of roller grinding which have
                    been introduced. In Hungary and Austria the system of high milling prevails, in
                    which the action of the millstones consists more in granulating than grinding;
                    and in connexion with that system of milling, the use of rollers is a prominent
                    feature. To a limited extent also the principle of the disintegrator has been
                    brought into operation, in which the grain is broken by the violent impact of
                    studs or projections revolving in opposite directions with enormous velocity.
                    Thus we have these various systems :—(1) flat milling or grinding; (2) high
                    milling or granulation; (3) roller milling or crushing; and (4) disentegrator
                    milling or breaking.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flat or Ordinary Milling.'</hi> —In the ordinary or flat
                    millstone milling of the United Kingdom there are three main points to
                    consider—(1) the cleaning and preparation of the wſheat; (2) the grinding; and
                    (3) the bolting or dressing of the ground products. The ordinary cleaning or
                    screening apparatus through which the wheat, as received, passes, consists of a
                    kind of cylindrical sieve of wire cloth, mounted in a sloping position, and
                    having internal partitions so as to resemble an Archimedean screw. When the
                    apparatus is set in motion, the grain, fed in at its upper end, tumbles from one
                    division into another, thereby being freed from small refuse and sand, and as it
                    issues at the lower extremity is subjected to a fan blast. For cleaning grain
                    there are other kinds of apparatus, in which the principle of aspiration, or
                    drawing currents of air through the grain, is now extensively employed, the most
                    frequently used being Child’s aspirator. A further cleaning is sometimes given
                    by Child’s decorticator, an implement which can be adjusted at will, for simply
                    rubbing and scouring the grain, or for removing the thin bran and germ previous
                    to the operation of grinding. The “Victor” brush machine is a recently
                    introduced and highly approved apparatus for polishing and finishing wheat, its
                    peculiar feature being that the “opposed brushes are constructed and worked in
                    such a manner that they come in contact with every kernel of wheat in every
                    conceivable position, and with as much force as the miller chooses to use—thus
                    polishing it on the ends better than any other machine can do, and this not only
                    on one pair of brushes, but on several.” The prepared grain is next conveyed to
                    the grinding apparatus, and here it may be said that, in moving the grain or
                    flour horizontally, Archimedean screws working within an inclosed casing are
                    employed, while in lifting from one floor to another, small boxes mounted on an
                    endless band worked over pulleys and similarly encased are used. The grinding
                    machinery consists first of a bin containing the grain to be ground, from which
                    it passes by a spout to the hopper, whence it is delivered by a feeding
                    adjustment to the stones. These constitute the distinctive feature of the entire
                    mill, and upon their condition and delicate adjustment the whole success of the
                    milling operation turns. They consist of two flat cylindrical masses inclosed
                    within a wooden or sheet metal case, the lower or “bed-stone” being permanently
                    fixed, while the upper or “runner” is accurately pivoted and balanced over it.
                    The average size of millstones is about 4 feet 2 inches in diameter by 12 inches
                    in thickness; and they are made of a hard but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0358-0345"/> cellular siliciυus stone called buhr-stone, the
                    best qualities of which are obtained from La-Ferté-sous-Jouarre, department of
                    Seine-et-Maine, France. Millstones are generally built up of segments, bound
                    together around the circumference by an iron hoop, and backed with plaster of
                    Paris. The bedstone is dressed to a perfectly flat plane surface, and a series
                    of grooves or shallow depressions are cut in it, generally in the manner shown
                    in fig. 5, which represents the grinding surface of an upper or runner stone.
                    The grooves on both are made to correspond exactly, so that when the one is
                    rotated over the other the sharp edges of the grooves, meeting each other,
                    operate like a rough pair of scissors, and thus the effect of the stones on
                    grain submitted to their action is at once that of cutting, squeezing, and
                    crushing. The dressing and grooving of millstones is generally done by
                    hand-picking, but sometimes black amorphous diamonds (carbonado) are used, and
                    emery wheel dressers have likewise been suggested. The upper stone or runner is
                    set in motion by a spindle on which it is mounted, which passes up through the
                    centre of the bedstone, and there are screws and other appliances for adjusting
                    and balancing the stone. Further, provision is made within the stone case for
                    passing through air to prevent too high a heat being developed in the grinding
                    operation; and sweepers for conveying the flour to the meal spout are also
                    provided. The ground meal delivered by the spout is carried forward in a
                    conveyer or creeper box, by means of an Archimedean screw, to the elevators, by
                    which it is lifted to an upper floor to the bolting or flour-dressing machine.
                    The form in which this apparatus was formerly employed consisted of a cylinder
                    mounted on an inclined plane, and covered externally with wire cloth of
                    different degrees of fineness, the finest being at the upper part of the
                    cylinder where the meal is admitted. Within the cylinder, which was stationary,
                    a circular brush revolved, by which the meal was pressed against the wire cloth,
                    and at the same time carried gradually towards the lower extremity, sifting out
                    as it proceeded the mill products into different grades of fineness, and finally
                    delivering the coarse bran at the extremity of the cylinder. For the operation
                    of bolting or dressing, hexagonal or octagonal cylinders, about 3 feet in
                    diameter and from 20 to 25 feet long, are now commonly employed. These are
                    mounted horizontally on a spindle for revolving, and externally they are covered
                    with silk of different degrees of fineness, whence they are called “silks” or
                    silk dressers. Radiating arms or other devices for carrying the meal gradually
                    forward as the apparatus revolves are fixed within the cylinders, and there is
                    also an arrangement of beaters which gives the segments of cloth a sharp tap,
                    and thereby facilitates the sifting action of the apparatus. Like all other mill
                    machines, the modifications of the silk dresser are numerous. Mill products are
                    differently assorted and classified in various localities and different
                    mills—some distinguishing many qualities of flour and bran, and others making
                    only three or four divisions. The following (from Professor Church’s <hi

                <p>An additional proportion of fine flour is obtained by dressing and remilling
                    tailings and middlings, and the purification and regrinding of these products
                    have now become of much consequence in connexion with the changed systems of
                    milling rapidly coming into use. A great variety of middlings purifying machines
                    have been introduced and eagerly pushed within the last few years, showing that
                    this branch of economic milling is now receiving great attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Hungarian System, or High Milling.—</hi> The object of the
                    low or flat milling process, as practised in Great Britain, is to produce at one
                    grinding operation as large a proportion of good finished flour as possible. In
                    high milling, on the other hand, the stones are kept so far apart that grain is
                    merely bruised in the first operation, and by a series of such grindings or
                    bruisings, alternated with elaborate sifting, the bran and all the outer
                    envelopes with the cerealin are detached, and a nucleus of very pure semolina
                    only left. In this way a large proportion of very inferior branny flour is
                    obtained in these early millings, and the proportion of exceedingly fine strong
                    flour for which Austro-Hungarian millers are famous is comparatively small. It
                    is only to the hard brittle wheats that the Hungarian system of milling is
                    applicable, and the method is only practicable under circumstances where there
                    is a demand for the two extreme qualities of mill product which result from the
                    system. Within the last few years the Hungarian millers have very largely
                    adopted the roller mills, either to supplant entirely or to supplement the stone
                    grinding.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roller Mills.—</hi> In this form of mill a pair of horizontal
                    rollers rotate face to face, and the grain or other material is submitted to
                    their action by passing between them. The nature of that action varies according
                    to the modification of roller surfaces, the closeness of the rollers to each
                    other, and the equal or differential rate at which they revolve. Rollers of
                    metal, either steel or chilled iron, having a toothed surface, revolving at
                    different rates of speed and at definite distances apart, have a cutting action
                    on the grain submitted to them. Such rollers are employed in the Buchholz system
                    for reducing hulled wheat to the condition of semolina, and a similar
                    arrangement is employed in the machine of Ganz &amp; Co. of Buda-Pesth. Fig. 6
                    shows a section of the face of a pair of such rollers, where B revolving slowly
                    serves as a holder for the grain, which is cut by the sharp edges of A,
                    revolving at a speed three times <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0359-0346"/> greater than B. Smooth surface rollers are
                    mounted to press hard against each other, and are made in some cases of polished
                    chilled metal; and in other instances cylinders of porcelain are employed. Their
                    principal function is for the reduction of purified middlings and semolina, and
                    when no differential motion is given the action is simply that of squeezing, but
                    when the opposing rollers revolve at different rates of speed a grinding effect
                    is further superadded. A roller mill which has met great and sudden public
                    acceptance is that invented and patented by F. Wegmann, a miller of Naples. In
                    Wegmann’s mill, fig. 7, porcelain rollers are employed, there being two pairs
                    fed from opposite ends of one hopper in the machine figured.</p>
                <p>This machine possesses a self-acting pressure and a differential motion; but its
                    most valuable feature consists in the employment of porcelain for rollers, by
                    which a surface at once exceedingly hard and slightly rough or porous is
                    secured. It is claimed for these rollers that, acting on middlings, they
                    produce, with less expenditure of power, more and better flour than can be
                    obtained by either stones or metal rollers. For the grinding of fine middlings
                    English experience is, however, in favour of chilled iron rollers as the best.
                    The roller mills have not yet been long enough in operation in Great Britain to
                    enable any safe conclusion to be drawn as to their adaptability to British
                    milling; but though the system originated only within the last few years, it has
                    in the meantime practically superseded all other methods in the Austro-Hungarian
                    districts, where milling is carried to greater perfection than in any other part
                    of the world. To show the progress made in the introduction of roller mills in
                    Britain, it may be noted that, while in January 1877 there was only one
                    Wegmann’s machine in operation, there were by the close of the year 350 in
                    various mills throughout the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Disintegrator.—</hi> Under this name a form of machine was
                    invented and introduced a few years ago by the late Thomas Carr for, among other
                    purposes, the manufacture of flour. Carr’s disintegrator consists of a pair of
                    circular discs of metal set face to face, and studded with circles of projecting
                    bars so arranged that the circles of bars on the one disc alternate with those
                    of the other. The discs are mounted on the same centre, and so closely set to
                    each other that the projecting bars of the one disc come quite close to the
                    plane surface of the other; and they are inclosed within an external casing into
                    the centre of which a spout passes by which the grain is delivered into the
                    machine. The discs are caused to rotate in opposite directions with great
                    rapidity, making about 400 revolutions per minute, and as the outer circle of
                    bars is 6 feet 10 inches from the centre, they move at a rate of 140 feet a
                    second, or about 100 miles per hour. The grain in passing through the machine is
                    struck by the oppositely revolving studs with enormous force,—a force which
                    increases as the shattered grains approach the outer circles of studs, and it is
                    almost instantaneously reduced to a powder which falls under the discs and is
                    carried away by a spiral creeper. It is stated that one of these machines 7 feet
                    in diameter is capable of doing the work of as many as 27 pairs of millstones,
                    and they have been fully tested in the flour mills of Gibson and Walker,
                    Bennington, near Edinburgh, where two of them have been in operation for a
                    period of seven years. Notwithstanding this success, however, the disintegrator
                    has not met with general acceptance as a flour mill, having been introduced into
                    only a very limited number of establishments. The following is a statement of
                    the average results Messrs Gibson and Walker have obtained by the disintegrator
                    from old Scotch wheat and from a mixture of Baltic and Ghirka wheats
                    respectively:—</p>

                <p>The semolina is reground under stones, and yields a fine strong flour; but it may
                    be and sometimes is reduced by passing it again through the disintegrator.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Qualities of Flour.—</hi> There appears to be at present some
                    conflict between public demand, as indicated by the increasing attention paid to
                    the production of a fine strong white flour, and the current of scientific
                    opinion expressed, though with some hesitation and doubt, in favour of whole
                    meal or flour in which the richly nitrogenous outer portions of the wheat are
                    retained. The fact that the outer portions of the wheat are richest in
                    nitrogenous principle, and that also in a peculiarly active form, is
                    indisputable; but it has not been satisfactorily determined whether the
                    nutritive value of that portion of the grain is exactly measured by its chemical
                    composition. The condition of the nitrogenous substance, the amount and
                    irritating nature of the ligneous tissue which accompanies it, and its peculiar
                    influence on the other constituents of the wheat grain may and probably do
                    affect its value. It is certain also that white flour is deliberately preferred
                    by the labouring population, whose instinct is probably right, and it is also
                    preferred by and for many purposes indispensable to the baker and cook. Good
                    flour should present the appearance of a pure uniform white powder, only faintly
                    tinged with yellow, free from all grit and lumps; and when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"

                    amount of adhesiveness. It should be free from all smell of damp or mouldiness,
                    and it should have no acidity of taste. For the purposes of the baker its
                    strength is measured by the amount and quality of its gluten or nitrogenous
                    constituents, which may be roughly estimated by making up a little dough and
                    observing its tenacity when drawn out; but a more accurate means of measuring
                    its elasticity is provided by the aleurometer of Μ. Boland, a Parisian baker.
