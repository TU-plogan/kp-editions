                <p><label type="entry">FLOOR CLOTH</label> is a covering for the floors of lobbies,
                    halls, passages, and other situations where there is much traffic and heavy
                    wear. Originally floor-cloth consisted of a heavy canvas coated with painters’
                    colours and ornamented with patterns executed with the brush. At a later period
                    stencilled ornaments took the place of hand-painted patterns, and now ornamental
                    designs are applied solely by means of hand-blocks. Kirkcaldy, in Scotland, is
                    the leading centre of the oil floor-cloth manufacture, in which town it was
                    firmly established by the energy of the late Michael Nairn —the operations of
                    the firm founded by him being, it is understood, the most extensive in the
                    trade. The brief outline of the manufacture which follows represents the
                    processes as conducted in the extensive establishments of Shepherd and Beveridge
                    of Kirkcaldy, where the mechanical and other arrangements have reached the
                    highest perfection suggested by skill and experience.</p>
                <p>The size of the canvas operated on, which must be free from all seams and
                    joinings, is 8 yards wide by 25 yards long. The huge webs from which these
                    canvasses are cut are woven, chiefly in power-looms, in lengths of 150 yards,
                    from which six floor-cloth pieces are obtained. For the cheaper qualities of
                    floor-cloth jute canvas is employed, but in the best kinds the material is woven
                    of stout tow yarn. The pieces of canvas in sizes above indicated are mounted on
                    a series of stout wooden stretching frames, ranged about 30 inches apart from
                    each other in a lofty, well-ventilated hall. The back or under part of the
                    floorcloth is first dealt with, the first operation being to coat the whole
                    surface with thin size, which fills up the interstices and prevents the oil of
                    the pigment from penetrating and rotting the fibres. The paint, which is next
                    applied, is of the consistency of a thin plaster, and is made up of raw oil,
                    some turpentine, and ochre, umber, and other earthy pigments. It is laid on, not
                    with brushes, but with long trowels, the operation being called “trowelling,”
                    and the workmen go over a large surface with great expedition. When the
                    operation is complete, the iron doors of the hall are closed and streams of
                    heated, slightly moist air are blown by a fan blast into the apartment, a
                    temperature of from 78° to 90° Fahr, being then maintained. The moisture in the
                    heat is essential for keeping the paint while drying from shrinking, cracking,
                    and scaling off. When the paint is dry the whole surface is smoothed with
                    pumice, and the back is finished with a coat of thinner colour, in which boiled
                    oil without turpentine is employed, thereby securing a glossy surface and
                    finish. As soon as the back is dry the face or upper side has to be turned to
                    the workmen, an operation which demands great caution aud precision to prevent
                    the canvas from being torn and destroyed. The lower edge being carried up and
                    secured along the top of the frame, the upper part is suddenly detached and let
                    down to the floor. The face receives, in succession, a coat of size and three
                    “trowelling” coats, with pumicing between, and on the conclusion of these
                    operations it is ready for printing. The printing is a costly process, owing to
                    the great store of blocks which it is found necessary to provide and keep up;
                    and the colours used are also expensive, consisting as they do of the flue
                    bright pigments with a foundation of white lead. The blocks have a printing
                    surface of 18 square inches, cut either of pear tree or other wood, or with
                    faces of type metal cast in wood matrices, the interstices being filled up with
                    felt. The cost is further increased by the laborious and tedious nature of the
                    operations, the printing of an eight-colour pattern over a full piece requiring
                    no less than 7200 separate applications of the set of eight colour blocks and
                    one finishing block. The cloth is brought to the printing room by a kind of
                    overhead tramway arrangement, where it is passed over a long narrow table. At
                    the side of this stands the printer, and the colour table, on which is spread
                    the colour he is to print, is mounted on rails which run parallel to the table
                    over which the cloth is spread. Guide bars are arranged over the cloth to secure
                    that the various impressions fall on their proper places with the utmost
                    precision, and overhead are suspended from a spring beam screw presses which
                    travel from end to end of the table. The block having received the needful
                    amount of colour, and being laid in position over the cloth, receives by means
                    of the movable screw press a tight elastic squeeze, which secures a uniform
                    impression of the portion of the pattern brought out by one colour. The various
                    colours are so printed in in succession, and thereafter the whole is gone over
                    with a finishing block, the surface of which is cut into fine straight grooves
                    or lines. Finally, the finished cloth is moved to a drying room, where,
                    suspended by the two extremities face outwards, it is left to harden and
                    season.</p>
                <p>Oil floor-cloth is open to the∙objection that it has a hard, cold, and
                    uncomfortable surface, while it is almost as noisy to the tread as ordinary
                    wooden flooring. Many substances have been proposed to supplant it, in which
                    these objectionable features have been more or less overcome, while they retain
                    its advantages of resistance to wear, cleanness, and freedom from damp. Of these
                    bodies linoleum has proved most successful in experience, but various other
                    materials of a similar kind have been introduced and used to a considerable
                    extent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kamptulicon</hi> is a variety of floor-cloth, which, although
                    invented about 1843, did not receive prominent public notice till the London
                    International Exhibition of 1862. The materials and processes employed in its
                    manufacture vary considerably, but it is essentially a preparation of
                    india-rubber masticated up with ground cork, the preparation and mixture being
                    effected by repeated passing of the material between grooved rollers. When
                    thoroughly incorporated the preparation is rolled out into sheets, sometimes
                    over a backing of canvas, by passing it between pairs of wide and heavy
                    steam-heated rollers. In addition to the substances above mentioned,
                    gutta-percha, sawdust, peat-dust, ground leather, boiled oil, resins, pitch,
                    asphalt, tar, chalk, and fibrous residues have all been used in kamptulicon
                    making. The rolled sheets are ornamented by printing simple patterns on their
                    surface, but, as much of the peculiar advantages of kamptulicon w ould be lost
                    were its whole surface covered with oil pigments, the kamptulicon surface is, as
                    far as possible, left exposed. Kamptulicon forms a warm, pleasant, soft, and
                    noiseless floorcloth, but the higher qualities, in which india-rubber aud ground
                    cork are the main ingredients, are rather expensive, and the manufacture has
                    been curtailed since the introduction of linoleum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Linoleum.—</hi> This substance consists of oxidized linseed oil
                    combined with ground cork, treated and rolled very much in the same manner as
                    kamptulicon, to which, in appearance and properties, it bears a close
                    resemblance. The manufacture was first conducted under a series of patents
                    secured by Mr F. Walton, the essential feature of his process—his method of
                    oxidizing linseed oil—having been patented in January 1860. The oxidation was
                    effected by mixing the oil, perfectly clear and bright, with a suitable drier,
                    by preference from 5 to 10 per cent, of acetate of lead being used, and
                    spreading it in thin films on surfaces of considerable extent, which films were
                    exposed to currents of heated air. In this way a rapid oxidation was induced,
                    the oil being transformed into linoxein, a slightly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0341-0330"/> elastic semi-resinous body, having many
                    properties in common with india-rubber, with the advantage of a clear
                    semi-translucent yellow colour. In his patent of December 1863, dealing chiefly
                    with the production of coloured patterns on linoleum, Mr Walton specifies, as a
                    suitable composition for the body of the material, 4 cwt. of oxidized oil 1⅜
                    cwt. of resin, I cwt. of kaurie-gum and colouring matter, mixed together in a
                    steam-heated pan and cast into cakes. It was afterwards to be mixed with an
                    equal weight of cork dust, or a somewhat larger quantity of sawdust, and spread
                    on and pressed into a woven fabric between steam-heated rollers. The breadth of
                    the finished linoleum is determined by the breadth of the spreading rollers
                    through which it passes; at present that does not exceed six feet. The
                    manufacture of linoleum is rapidly extending, and since the expiry of Mr
                    Walton’s patent rights, it has been begun by the leading Kirkcaldy
                    floorclothmakers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boulinikon.—</hi> Under this name a kind of floor-cloth with a
                    linoleum-like surface is manufactured of waste materials, by a process patented
                    in January 1865 by John B. Wood. It is composed of about equal portions of raw
                    buffalo or other hide macerated and reduced to a pulp, pulped cotton or linen
                    rags, and coarse hair ground up short and fine. These are mixed into a common
                    pulp in a form of rag engine, and subsequently spread, drained, dried, and
                    pressed on a machine similar to that used in the paper manufacture. The
                    ornamentation is effected in the manner employed for kamptulicon and linoleum;
                    but the substance may be entirely covered with pigment and finished like oil
