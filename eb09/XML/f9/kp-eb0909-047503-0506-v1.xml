                    (1819-1868), a distinguished French physicist, was the son of a well-known
                    publisher at Paris, where he was born September 18, 1819.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n507/mode/1up"

                <p>After an education received chiefly at home, he studied medicine, which, however,
                    he speedily abandoned for physical science, the improvement of Daguerre’s
                    photographic processes being the object to which he first directed his
                    attention. During three years he was experimental assistant to Μ. Donné in his
                    course of lectures on microscopic anatomy. With Μ. Fizeau he carried on a series
                    of investigations on the intensity of the light of the sun, as compared with
                    that of carbon heated in the voltaic arc, and of lime in the flame of the
                    oxyhydrogen blowpipe; on the interference of heat rays, and of light rays
                    differing greatly in lengths of path; and on the chromatic polarization of
                    light. In 1849 he contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus</hi> of
                    the Academy of Sciences, t. xxviii,, a description of an electromagnetic
                    regulator for the electric lamp, and, in conjunction with Régnault, a paper on
                    binocular vision. By the use of a revolving mirror similar to that used by
                    Wheatstone for measuring the rapidity of electric currents, but having a concave
                    mirror centred in its axis, he was enabled in 1850 to demonstrate the greater
                    velocity of light in air than in water, and to establish the law deduced from
                    the undulatory theory that the velocity of light in different media is inversely
                    as the refractive indices of the media. In the same year he was created a
                    chevalier of the Legion of Honour. For his demonstration in 1851 of the diurnal
                    motion of the earth by the rotation of the plane of oscillation of a freely
                    suspended, long, and heavy pendulum in an E.S.W. direction, exhibited by him at
                    the Pantheon in Paris, and again in the following year by means of his invention
                    the gyroscope, he in 1855 received the Copley medal of the Royal Society of
                    London. He was also in 1855 made physical assistant in the imperial observatory
                    at Paris. In September of that year he discovered that the force required for
                    the rotation of a copper disc moving in its own plane becomes greater, the disc
                    at the same time growing hotter, when the disc is made to rotate with its rim
                    between the poles of a horse-shoe magnet. Foucault invented in 1857 the
                    polarizer which bears his name, and in the succeeding year a method of giving to
                    the speculum of reflecting telescopes the form of a spheroid or a paraboloid of
                    revolution. His reflector for the great telescope in the Paris observatory was
                    mounted in June 1859. With Wheatstone’s revolving mirror he in 1862 determined
                    the absolute velocity of light to be 298,000 kilometres (about 185,000 miles) a
                    second, or 10,000 kilom. less than that obtained by previous experimenters. He
                    was created iu that year a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and an officer of
                    the Legion of Honour, in 1864 a foreign member of the Royal Society of London,
                    and next year a member of the Mechanical Section of the Institute. In 1865
                    appeared his papers on a modification of Watt’s governor, upon which he had for
                    some time been experimenting with a view to making its period of revolution
                    constant, and on a new apparatus for regulating the electric light; and in the
                    following year <hi rend="italic">(Compt. Rend,</hi> lxiii.) he showed how, by
                    the deposition of a transparently thin film of silver on the outer side of the
                    object glass of a telescope, the sun could be viewed without injuring the eye by
                    excess of light. Foucault died of paralysis, February 11, 1868. From the year
