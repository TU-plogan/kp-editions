                    (1810-1877), a painter of mythological and fanciful subjects, was bom at
                    Wandsworth, near London, in September 1810. He showed at an early age
                    considerable talent for drawing, and his father placed him under as good
                    instruction as was available in the neighbourhood. About 1825 he was introduced
                    to Etty, who advised that he should attend a celebrated drawing school in
                    Bloomsbury Street. After several years’ study there, and in the sculpture rooms
                    at the British Museum, Frost was in 1829 admitted as a student in the schools of
                    the Royal Academy, where he was noted for steady and careful application, and
                    for success in competition. He won medals in all the schools, except the
                    antique, in which, he was beaten by Maclise, During those years, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n839/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0839-0804"/> and indeed until the time when more
                    imaginative work had brought, with fame, other means of subsistence, he
                    maintained himself by portrait painting. He is said to have painted, about this
                    time, over 300 portraits; but not one of them is now remembered as a work of any
                    artistic value. In 1839 he obtained the gold medal of the Royal Academy for his
                    picture of Prometheus bound by Force and Strength. At the cartoon exhibition at
                    Westminster Hall in 1843 he was awarded a third-class prize of 100 pounds, for
                    his cartoon of Una alarmed by Fauns and Satyrs. He exhibited at the Academy
                    Christ crowned with Thorns (1843), Nymphs dancing (1844), Sabrina (1845), Diana
                    and Actaeon (1846). In 1846 he was elected Associate of the Royal Academy. His
                    Nymph disarming Cupid was exhibited in 1847; Una and the Wood-Nymphs of the same
                    year was bought by the Queen. This was the time of Frost’s highest popularity.
                    Influences affecting the art of the country at the time led to the decline of
                    his reputation after 1850; and opinion on his work so changed in later years
                    that it was perhaps by courtesy only that he obtained the dignity of full
                    membership of the Royal Academy. His later pictures are simply repetitions of
                    earlier motives. Among them may be named Euphrosyne (1848), Wood-Nymphs (1851),
                    Chastity (1854), Il Penseroso (1855), The Graces (1856), Narcissus (1857),
                    Zephyr with Aurora playing (1858), The Graces and Loves (1863), Hylas and the
                    Nymphs (1867). After being for some years at the head of the list of associates,
                    Frost was elected to full membership of the Royal Academy in December 1871. This
                    dignity, however, he soon resigned, and his name appears in the lists issued
                    during the last years of his life among those of honorary retired Academicians.
                    There is something very flimsy about the productions of this painter. In work
                    after work is continued the same unvarying series of maidens and nymphs, having
                    the same smiles, gestures, graces. There is in these paintings no spontaneity
                    and little truth of feeling of any kind. Frost had no high power of design,
                    though some of his smaller and apparently less important works are not without
                    grace and charm. Technically, his paintings are, in a sense, very highly
                    finished, but they are entirely without mastery. The writings of Ruskin and the
                    rise of the pre-Raphaelites changed the regard in which such productions as
                    those of Frost were held; and his career was practically at an end some years
                    before his death. As a man he was highly esteemed by his friends for the
                    gentleness and modesty of his disposition. He died on the 4th of June 1877.</p>
