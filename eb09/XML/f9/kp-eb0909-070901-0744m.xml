                    the trunk of the tree, and below it a narrow strip of bark five inches in length
                    is peeled off. When the milk-like juice (“spuma pinguis,” Pliny) which exudes
                    has hardened by exposure to the atmosphere, the incision is deepened. In about
                    three months the resin has attained the required degree of consistency. The
                    season for gathering lasts from May until the first rains in September. Tlιe
                    large clear globules are scraped off into baskets, and the inferior quality that
                    has run down the tree is collected separately. The coast of South Arabia is
                    yearly visited by parties of Somalis, who pay the Arabs for the privilege of

                    was an import of Barbarike on the Sinthus (Indus). The idea held by several
                    writers, including Niebuhr, that frankincense was a product of India, would seem
                    to have originated in a confusion of that drug with benzoin and other
                    odoriferous substances, and also in the sale of imported frankincense with the

                    origin there is abundant evidence in the writings of classical authors. It was
                    Sabaean incense that was burnt on the altar of Venus at Paphos (Virg., <hi
                    rend="italic">Aen.,</hi> i. 416; <hi rend="italic">cf. Georg.,</hi> ii. 117),
                    and Arabia and the land of Thus were synonymous (çf. Plautus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trinummus,</hi> iv. 2. 89, and <hi rend="italic">Paenulus,</hi> v. 4. 6).
                    Herodotus (iii. 107) and Pliny <hi rend="italic">(loc. citſt</hi> speak of
                    Arabia as the only country that yields frankincense; Strabo (xvi. 4) and Arrian
                    more correctly mention it as an export also of the neighbouring African coast.
                    According to Diodorus Siculus (v. 41), the “Holy Island,” at the furthest point
                    of Arabia Felix, the habitation of the Panchaeans, was the source of
                    frankincense.</p>
                <p>In the Scriptures “incense,” or frankincense, is noticed as forming part of the

                    F. Wimmer, p. 143) relates that with other spices it was produced by the regions

                    to the Sabaean temple of the sun was purchased by merchants who came

                    107), was not improbably due to the fertile imaginations of Arabian
                    spice-monopolists. By their trade in frankincense and other aromatics the
                    Sabaeans and Gerrhaei, we are informed by Strabo, became the richest of all the
                    Arabian tribes; and it~was doubtless from their emporium at Petra that these,
                    with other articles of commerce, were by caravan conveyed into Egypt and Canaan
                    by the Edomites, Idumaeans, or, as they came to be called, Nabataeans, and into
                    the Mediterranean coast-regions by the Phoenician Arabs. (See Dr G. Birdwood’s

                    Chaldaeans on their great altar to Bel at Babylon (Herodotus, iii. 97, i. 183).
                    From the spoils of Gaza, in Syria, 500 talents’ weight of frankincense was sent

                <p>Frankincense, or olibanum, occurs in commerce in semiopaque, round, ovate, or
                    oblong tears or irregular lumps, which are covered externally with a white dust,
                    the result of their friction against one another. It has an amorphous internal
                    structure, a dull fracture; is of a yellow to yellowish-brown hue, the purer
                    varieties being almost colourless, or possessing a greenish tinge; and has a
                    somewhat bitter aromatic taste, and a balsamic odour, which is developed by
                    heating. Immersed in alcohol it becomes opaque, and with water it yields an
                    emulsion. It contains about 72 per cent, of resin soluble in alcohol (Kurbatow);
                    a large proportion of gum soluble in water, and apparently identical with
                    gum-arabic; and a small quantity of a colourless inflammable essential oil, one

                    leaving an ash consisting mainly of calcium carbonate, the remainder being
                    calcium phosphate, and the sulphate, chloride, and carbonate of potassium

                    sacrificially employed in Trojan times. It was used by the ancient Egyptians in
                    their religious rites, but, as Herodotus tells us (ii. 86), not in embalming. It
                    constituted a fourth part of the Jewish incense of the sanctuary (Ex. xxx. 34),
                    and is frequently mentioned in the Pentateuch. With other spices it was stored
                    in a great chamber of the house of God at Jerusalem (1 Chron. ix. 29, Neh. xiii.
                    5-9). On the sacrificial use and import of frankincense and similar substances

                <p>In the Red Sea regions frankincense is valued not only for its sweet odour when
                    burnt, but as a masticatory; and blazing lumps of it are not infrequently used
                    for illumination instead of oil lamps. Its fumes are an excellent insectifuge.
                    As a medicine it was in former times in high repute. Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nat. Hist.,</hi> xxv. 82) mentions it as an anti dote to hemlock. Avicenna
                    (ed. Plempii, lib ii. p 161, Lovanii, 1658, fol.) recommends it for tumours,
                    ulcers of the head and ears, affections of the breast, vomiting, dysentery, and
                    fevers. Dr Delioux of Toulon <hi rend="italic">(Bull. Gén. de Thérap.,</hi> Feb.
                    28, 1861) considers its curative properties equal to those of other balsamic
                    medicines, and that for cheapness it is preferable for hospital use to the
                    balsams of Peru and Tolu, and, being more agreeable to the stomach, to tar, As a
                    fumigating agent, he advocates its employment in bronchitis and chronic
                    laryngitis. In the East frankincense has been found efficacious as an external
                    application in carbuncles, blind boils, and gangrenous sores, and as an internal
                    agent is given in gonorrhoea. In China it was an old internal remedy for leprosy
                    and struma, and is accredited with stimulant, tonic, sedative, astringent, and
                    vulnerary properties. Its stimulant action appears to be directed chiefly to the
                    mucous surfaces of the body. (See Waring, <hi rend="italic">Pharm. of
