                    of Spanish mariners. It was placed by Linnaeus in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelecanus,</hi> and until lately its assignment to the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelecaniclae</hi> has hardly ever been doubted. Professor Mivart has, however,
                    now declared <hi rend="italic">{Trans. Zool.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> x.
                    p. 364) that, as regards the postcranial part of its axial skeleton, he cannot
                    detect sufficiently good characters to unite it with that family in the group
                    named by Professor Brandt <hi rend="italic">Steganopodes.</hi> There seems to be
                    no ground for disputing this decision so far as separating the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Fregata</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Pelecanidae</hi> goes, but
                    systematists will probably pause before they proceed to abolish the <hi
                    rend="italic">Steganopodes,</hi> and the result will most likely be that the
                    Frigate-Birds will be considered to form a distinct family <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Fregatidcf)</hi> in that group. In one very remarkable way the osteology of
                    <hi rend="italic">Fregata</hi> differs from that of all other birds known. The
                    furcula coalesces firmly at its symphysis with the carina of the sternum, and
                    also with the coracoids at the upper extremity of each of its rami, the anterior
                    end of each coracoid coalescing also with the proximal end of the scapula. Thus
                    the only articulations in the whole sternal apparatus are where the coracoids
                    meet the sternum, and the consequence is a bony framework which would be
                    perfectly rigid did not the flexibility of the rami of the furcula permit a
                    limited amount of motion. That this mechanism is closely related to the faculty
                    which the bird possesses of soaring for a considerable time in the air with
                    scarcely a perceptible movement of the wings can hardly be doubted, but the
                    particular way in which it works has yet to be explained.</p>
                <p>Two species of <hi rend="italic">Fregata</hi> are considered to exist, though
                    they differ in little but size and geographical distribution. The larger, <hi
                    rend="italic">F. aquila,</hi> has a wide range all round the world within the
                    tropics, and at times passes their limits. The smaller, <hi rend="italic">F.
                    minor,</hi> appears to be confined to the eastern seas, from Madagascar to the
                    Moluccas, and southward to Australia, being particularly abundant in Torres
                    Strait,—the other species, however, being found there as well. Having a spread
                    of wing equal to a Swan’s and a comparatively small body, the buoyancy of these
                    birds is very great. It is a beautiful sight to watch one or more of them
                    floating overhead against the deep blue sky, the long forked tail alternately
                    opening and shutting like a pair of scissors, and the head, which is of course
                    kept to windward, inclined from side to side, while the wings are to all
                    appearance fixedly extended, though the breeze may be constantly varying in
                    strength and direction. Equally fine is the contrast afforded by these birds
                    when engaged in fishing, or, as seems more often to happen, in robbing other
                    birds, especially Boobies, as they are fishing. Then the speed of their flight
                    is indeed seen to advantage, as well as the marvellous suddenness with which
                    they can change their rapid course as their victim tries to escape from their
                    attack. Before gales Frigate-Birds are said often to fly low, and their
                    appearance near or over land, except at their breeding-time, is supposed to
                    portend a hurricane.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    frail nests, and seemed to prefer the leeward side. The single egg laid in each
                    nest has a white and chalky shell very like that of a Cormorant’s. The nestlings
                    are clothed iu pure white down, and so thickly as to resemble puff-balls. When
                    fledged, the beak, head, neck, and belly are white, the legs and feet
                    bluish-white, but the body is dark above. The adult females retain the white
                    beneath, but the adult males lose it, and in both sexes at maturity the upper
                    plumage is of a very dark chocolate brown, nearly black, with a bright metallic
                    gloss, while the feet iu the females are pink, and black in the males—the last
                    also acquiring a bright scarlet pouch, capable of inflation, and being
                    perceptible when on the wing. The habits of <hi rend="italic">F. minor</hi> seem
                    wholly to resemble those of <hi rend="italic">F. aquila.</hi> According to
                    Bechstein, an example of this last species was obtained at the mouth of the
                    Weser in January 1792, and it has hence been included by some ornithologists
                    among European birds! <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
