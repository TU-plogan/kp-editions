                    (1814-1869), a Turkish statesman and author, was born at Constantinople in 1814.
                    His father, Izzet-Effendi Kitchegizadey, better known as Izzet-Mollah, was a man
                    of wealth and position, and had a hιgh'reputation as a poet; but he fell into
                    disgrace with the Turkish Government, and his estates were confiscated. Fuad
                    being therefore compelled to adopt a profession chose that of medicine; and
                    after studying from 1828 to 1832 at Galata-Serai, he was appointed in 1834
                    physician to the admiralty, and accompanied the expedition against Tripoli. On
                    his return to Constantinople he quitted the medical service and entered the
                    interpreters’ office, with the view of qualifying himself for a diplomatic post.
                    In 1840 he accompanied the Turkish embassy to London as first secretary, and in
                    1843 he was appointed to the office of second interpreter to the Turkish
                    Government, and subsequently to that of director of the translation office.
                    Shortly after he was sent to congratulate Isabella II. on her accession to the
                    throne of Spain. In 1845 he was appointed chief interpreter to the Porte; and in
                    1848, as grand-referendary of the imperial divan, he was named Ottoman
                    commissioner, to settle the revolutionary disputes in the principalities of
                    Moldavia and Wallachia. On his return from a special mission to Russia he was
                    named minister of the interior, and shortly afterwards minister of foreign
                    affairs. In 1853 he published a pamphlet on the question of the holy sepulchres,
                    which greatly irritated the czar of Russia, and led Prince Menschikoff to act in
                    such a manner that Fuad Pasha felt compelled, from self-respect, to tender his
                    resignation to the Turkish Government. Shortly afterwards war was declared
                    between Russia and Turkey, and he was appointed commissioner at the headquarters
                    of Omar Pasha. In 1855 he resumed his duties of foreign minister, and he
                    continued in that office till the close of the war. In 1857 he became president
                    of the council of tanzimat, in 1860 was appointed commissioner to Syria to
                    settle the disputes between the Druses and the Maronites; shortly after his
                    return he was named grand vizier; and in 1863 he became war minister, and a
                    little later returned to his old post of foreign minister. In 1867 he
                    accompanied the sultan to England and France. He died at Nice, whither he had
                    gone for the benefit of his health, February 12,1869. Fuad Pasha was one of the
                    first members of the Turkish Imperial Academy of Sciences and Belles-Letters,
                    founded in 1851. He is the author of a poem entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alhambra,</hi> written after his sojourn in Spain, and of a Turkish grammar.
                    The suave and genial manners of Fuad Pasha, and his diplomatic talents, stood
                    Turkey in good stead in connexion with the Crimean war and the various
                    negotiations in reference to Turkey’s relation to her Christian subjects, and
                    helped to inspire a faith in her capacity for reforms, which later events have
                    shown to have been largely misplaced. He endeavoured to secure to his country
                    the material ad vantages to be derived from the adoption of European
                    improvements, but his measures effected no lasting reform in her administration;
                    and by the adoption of a heedless system of credit, he largely increased her
                    financial difficulties.</p>
