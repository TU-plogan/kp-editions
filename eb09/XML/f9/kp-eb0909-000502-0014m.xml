                <p><label type="entry">FALCONRY</label>, the art of employing falcons and hawks in
                    the chase,—a sport the practice of which is usually termed hawking. Falconry was
                    for many ages of the Old World’s history one of the principal sports. Probably
                    it may be considered as having been always as purely a sport as it is at the
                    present day; for even in the rudest times man must have been possessed of means
                    and appliances for the capture of wild birds and beasts more <pb break="no"

                    notwithstanding the high state of efficiency to which, as we may still see,
                    well-trained hawks may be brought. The antiquity of falconry is very great. It
                    seems impossible to fix the exact period of its first appearance. There appears
                    to be little doubt that it was practised in Asia at a very remote period, for
                    which we have the concurrent testimony of various Chinese and Japanese works,
                    some of the latter being most quaintly and yet spiritedly illustrated. It
                    appears to have been known in China some 2000 years <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and the records of a King Wen Wang, who reigned over a province of
                    that country 689 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> prove that the art was at that
                    time in very high favour. In Japan it appears to have been known at least 600
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and probably at an equally early date in
                    India, Arabia, Persia, and Syria. Sir A. H. Layard, as we learn from his work on
                    <hi rend="italic">Nineveh and Babylon,</hi> considers that in a bas-relief found
                    by him in the ruins of Khorsabad “there appeared to be a falconer bearing a hawk
                    on his wrist,” from which it would appear to have been known there some 1700
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In all the above-mentioned countries of
                    Asia it is practised at the present day.</p>
                <p>Little is known of the early history of falconry in Africa, but from very ancient
                    Egyptian carvings and drawings it seems to have been known there many ages ago.
                    It was probably also in vogue in the countries of Morocco, Oran, Algiers, Tunis,
                    and Egypt, at the same time as in Europe. The older writers on falconry, English
                    and Continental, often mention Barbary and Tunisian falcons. It is still
                    practised in Africa; the present writer has visited two hawking establishments
                    in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the oldest records of falconry in Europe are supplied by the writings of
                    Pliny, Aristotle, and Martial. Although their notices of the sport are slight
                    and somewhat vague, yet they are quite sufficient to show clearly that it was
                    practised in their days—between the years 384 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and
                    40 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It was probably introduced into England from
                    the Continent about 860 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and from that time down
                    to the middle of the 17th century falconry was followed with an ardour that
                    perhaps no sport in our country has ever called forth, not even our grand
                    national sport of fox-hunting. Stringent laws and enactments, notably in the
                    reigns of William the Conqueror, Edward III., Henry VIII., and Elizabeth, were
                    passed from time to time in its interest. Falcons and hawks were allotted to
                    degrees and orders of men according to rank and station,—for instance, to
                    royalty the jerfalcons, to an earl the peregrine, to a yeoman the goshawk, to a
                    priest the sparrow-hawk, and to a knave or servant the useless kestrel. The
                    writings of Shakespeare furnish ample testimony to the high and universal
                    estimation in which it was held in his days. About the middle of the 17th
                    century falconry began to decline in England, to revive somewhat at the
                    Restoration. It never, however, completely recovered its former favour, a
                    variety of causes operating against it, such as enclosure of waste lands,
                    agricultural improvements, and the introduction of fire-arms into the sporting
                    field, till it fell, as a national sport, almost into oblivion. Yet it has never
                    been even temporarily extinct, and it is still very successfully practised at
                    the present day.</p>
                <p>In Europe the game or “quarry” at which hawks are flown consists of grouse
                    (confined to the British Isles), blackgame, pheasants, partridges, quails,
                    landrails, ducks, teal, woodcocks, snipes, herons, rooks, crows, gulls, magpies,
                    jays, blackbirds, thrushes, larks, hares, and rabbits. In former days geese,
                    cranes, kites, ravens, and bustards were also flown at. Old German works make
                    much mention of the use of the Iceland falcon for taking the great bustard, a
                    flight scarcely alluded to by English writers. In Asia the list of quarry is
                    longer, and, in addition to all the foregoing, or their Asiatic representatives,
                    various kinds of bustards, sand grouse, storks, ibises, spoonbills, pea-fowl,
                    jungle-fowl, kites, vultures, and gazelles are captured by trained hawks. In
                    Mongolia and Chinese Tartary, and among the nomad tribes of Central Asia, the
                    sport still flourishes; and though some late accounts are not satisfactory
                    either to the falconer or the naturalist, yet they leave no doubt that a species
                    of eagle is still trained in those regions to take large game, as antelopes and
                    wolves. Mr Atkinson, in his account of his travels in the country of the Λmoor,
                    makes particular mention of the sport, as does also Mr Shaw in his work on
                    Yarkand; and in a letter from the Yarkand embassy, under Mr Forsyth, C.B., dated
                    Camp near Yarkand, Nov. 27, 1873, the following passage occurs :—“Hawking
                    appears also to be a favourite amusement, the golden eagle taking the place of
                    the falcon or hawk. This novel sport seemed very successful.” It is questionable
                    whether the bird here spoken of is the golden eagle. In Africa gazelles are
                    taken, and also partridges and wildfowl.</p>
                <p>The hawks used in England at the present time are the three great northern
                    falcons, viz., the Greenland, Iceland, and Norway falcons, the peregrine falcon,
                    the hobby, the merlin, the goshawk, and the sparrow-hawk. In former days the
                    saker, the lanner, and the Barbary or Tunisian falcon were also employed. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Falcon.)</hi></p>
                <p>Of the foregoing the easiest to keep, most efficient in the field, and most
                    suitable for general use at the present day are the peregrine falcon and the
                    goshawk.</p>
                <p>In all hawks, the female is larger and more powerful than the male.</p>
                <p>Hawks are divided by falconers all over the world into two great classes. The
                    first class comprises “falcons,” “long-winged hawks,” or “hawks of the lure,”
                    distinguished by Eastern falconers as “dark-eyed hawks.” In these the wings are
                    pointed, the second feather in the wing is the longest, and the irides are
                    dark-brown. Merlins must, however, be excepted; and here it would seem that the
                    Eastern distinction is the best, for though merlins are much more falcons than
                    they are hawks, they differ from falcons in having the third feather in the wing
                    the longest, while they are certainly “dark-eyed hawks.”</p>
                <p>The second class is that of “hawks,” “short-winged hawks,” or “hawks of the
                    fist,” called by Eastern falconers “yellow (or rose) eyed hawks.” In these the
                    wings are rounded, the fourth feather is the longest in the wing, and the irides
                    are yellow, orange, or deep-orange.</p>

                <p>The training of hawks affords much scope for judgment, experience, and skill on
                    the part of the falconer, who must carefully observe the temper and disposition
                    as well as the constitution of each bird; and various practices are resorted to
                    which cannot be hero described. It is through <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0017-0008"/> the appetite principally that hawks, like most
                    wild animals, are tamed; but to fit them for use in the field much patience,
                    gentleness, and care must be used. Slovenly taming necessitates starving, and
                    low condition and weakness are the result The aim of the falconer must be to
                    have his hawks always keen, and the appetite when they are brought into the
                    field should be such as would induce the bird in a state of nature to put forth
                    its full powers to obtain its food, with, as near as possible, a corresponding
                    condition as to flesh. The following is an outline of the process of training
                    hawks, beginning with the management of a wild-caught peregrine falcon. When
                    first taken, a rufter hood should be put on her head, and she must be furnished
                    with jesses, swivel, leash, and bell. A thick glove or rather gauntlet must be
                    worn on the left hand (Eastern falconers always carry a hawk on the right), and
                    she must be carried about as much as possible, late into the night, every day,
                    being constantly stroked with a bird’s wing or feather, very lightly at first.
                    At night she should be tied to a perch in a room with the window darkened, so
                    that no light can enter in the morning. The perch should be a padded pole placed
                    across the room, about four and a half feet from the ground, with a canvas
                    screen underneath. She will easily be induced to feed in most cases by drawing a
                    piece of beefsteak over her feet, brushing her legs at the time with a wing, and
                    now and then, as she snaps, slipping a morsel into her mouth. Care must be taken
                    to make a peculiar sound with the lips or tongue, or to use a low whistle as she
                    is in the act of swallowing; she will very soon learn to associate this sound
                    with feeding, and it will be found that directly she hears it, she will gripe
                    with her talons, and bend down to feel for food. When the falconer perceives
                    this and other signs of her “coming to,” that she no longer starts at the voice
                    or touch, and steps quietly up from the perch when the hand is placed under her
                    feet, it will be time to change her rufter hood for the ordinary hood. This
                    latter should be very carefully chosen,—an easy fitting one, in which the braces
                    draw closely and yet easily and without jerking. An old one previously worn is
                    to be recommended. The hawk should be taken into a very dark room,—one
                    absolutely dark is best,—and the change should be made if possible in total
                    darkness. After this she must be brought to feed with her hood off; at first she
                    must be fed every day in a darkened room, a gleam of light being admitted. The
                    first day, the hawk having seized the food, and begun to pull at it freely, the
                    hood must be gently slipped off, and after she has eaten a moderate quantity, it
                    must be replaced as slowly and gently as possible, and she should be allowed to
                    finish her meal through the hood. Next day the hood may be twice removed, and so
                    on; day by day the practice should be continued, and more light gradually
                    admitted, until the hawk will feed freely in broad daylight, and suffer the hood
                    to be taken off and replaced without opposition. Next she must be accustomed to
                    see and feed in the presence of strangers and dogs, &amp;c. A good plan is to
                    carry her in the streets of a town at night, at first where the gaslight is not
                    strong, and where persons passing by are few, unhooding and hooding her from
                    time to time, but not letting her get frightened. Up to this time she should be
                    fed on lean beefsteak with no castings, but as soon as she is tolerably tame and
                    submits well to the hood, she must occasionally be fed with pigeons and other
                    birds. This should be done not later than 3 or 4 p.M., and when she is placed on
                    her perch for the night in the dark room, she must be unhooded and left so, of
                    course being carefully tied up. The falconer should enter the room about 7 or 8
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> next day, admitting as little light as possible,
                    or using a candle. He should first observe if she has thrown her casting; if so,
                    he will at once take her to the fist giving her a bite of food, and re-hood her.
                    If her casting is not thrown it is better for him to retire, leaving the room
                    quite dark, and come in again later. She must now be taught to know the
                    voice,—the shout that is used to call her in the field,—and to jump to the fist
                    for food, the voice being used every time she is fed. When she comes freely to
                    the fist she must be made acquainted with the lure. Kneeling down with the hawk
                    on his fist, and gently unhooding her, the falconer casts out a lure, which may
                    be either a dead pigeon or an artificial lure garnished with beefsteak tied to a
                    string, to a distance of a couple or three feet in front of her. When she jumps
                    down to it, she should be suffered to eat a little on it—the voice being
                    used—the while receiving morsels from the falconer’s hand; and before her meal
                    is finished she must be taken off to the hand, being induced to forsake the lure
                    for the hand by a tempting piece of meat. This treatment will help to check her
                    inclination hereafter to carry her quarry. This lesson is to be continued till
                    the falcon feeds very boldly on the lure on the ground, in the falconer’s
                    presence—till she will suffer him to walk round her while she is feeding. All
                    this time she will have been held by the leash only, but in the next step a
                    strong but light creance must be made fast to the leash, and an assistant
                    holding the hawk should unhood her, as the falconer, standing at a distance of 5
                    to 10 yards, calls her by shouting and casting out the lure. Gradually day after
                    day the distance is increased, till the hawk will come 30 yards or so without
                    hesitation; then she may be trusted to fly to the lure at liberty, and by
                    degrees from any distance, say 1000 yards. This accomplished, she should learn
                    to stoop at the lure. ' Instead of allowing the hawk to seize upon it as she
                    comes up, the falconer should snatch the lure away and let her pass by, and
                    immediately put it out that she may readily seize it when she turns round to
                    look for it. This should be done at first only once, and then progressively
                    until she will stoop backwards and forwards at the lure as often as desired.
                    Next she should be entered at her quarry. Should she be intended for rooks or
                    herons, two or three of these birds should be procured. One should be given her
                    from the hand, then one should be released close to her, and a third at a
                    considerable distance. If she take these keenly, she may be flown at a wild
                    bird. Care must, however, be taken to let her have every possible advantage in
                    her first flights,—wind and weather, and the position of the quarry with regard
                    to the surrounding country, must be considered.</p>
                <p>Young hawks, on being received by the falconer before they can fly, must be put
                    into a sheltered place, such as an outhouse or shed. The basket or hamper should
                    be filled with straw. A hamper is best, with the lid so placed as to form a
                    platform for the young hawks to come out upon to feed. This should be fastened
                    to a beam or prop a few feet from the ground. The young hawks must be most
                    plentifully fed on the best fresh food obtainable—good beefsteak and
                    fresh-killed birds; the falconer when feeding them should use his voice as in
                    luring. As they grow old enough they will come out, and perch about the roof of
                    their shed, by degrees extending their flights to neighbouring buildings or
                    trees, never failing to come at feeding time to the place where they are fed.
                    Soon they will be continually on the wing, playing or fighting with one another,
                    and later the falconer will observe them chasing other birds, as pigeons and
                    rooks, which may be passing by. As soon as one fails to come for a meal, it must
                    be at once caught with a bow net or a snare the first time it comes back, or it
                    will be lost. It must be borne in mind that the longer hawks can be left at hack
                    the better they are likely to be for use in the field,—those hawks being always
                    the best which have preyed a few times for themselves before being caught. Of
                    course there is great risk of losing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n18/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0018-0009"/> hawks when they begin to prey for themselves.
                    When a hawk is so caught, she is said to be “taken up” from hack. She will not
                    require a rufter hood, but a good deal of the management described for the
                    passage falcon will be necessary. She must be carefully tamed and broken to the
                    hood in the same manner, and so taught to know the lure; but, as might be
                    expected, very much less difficulty will be experienced. As soon as the eyas
                    knows the lure sufficiently well to come to it sharp and straight from a
                    distance, she must be taught to “wait on.” This is effected by letting the hawk
                    loose in an open place, such as a down. It will be found that she will circle
                    round the falconer looking for the lure she has been accustomed to see,—perhaps
                    mount a little in the air, and advantage must be taken of a favourable moment
                    when the hawk is at a little height, her head being turned in towards the
                    falconer, to let go a pigeon which she can easily catch. When the hawk has taken
                    two or three pigeons in this way, and mounts immediately in expectation, in
                    short, begins to wait on, she should see no more pigeons, but be tried at game
                    as soon as possible. Young peregrines should be flown at grouse first in
                    preference to partridges, not only because the season commences earlier, but
                    because, grouse being the heavier birds, they are not so much tempted to “carry”
                    as with partridges.</p>
                <p>The training of the great northern falcons, as well as that of merlins and
                    hobbies, is conducted much on the above principles, but the jerfalcons will
                    seldom wait on well, and merlins will not do it at all.</p>
                <p>The training of short-winged hawks is a simpler process. They must, like falcons,
                    be provided with jesses, swivel, leash, and bell. In these hawks a bell is
                    sometimes fastened to the tail. Sparrow-hawks can, however, scarcely carry a
                    bell big enough to be of any service. The hood is seldom used for short-winged
                    hawks,—never in the field. They must be made as tame as possible by carriage on
                    the fist and the society of man, and taught to come to the fist freely when
                    required—at first to jump to it in a room, and then out of doors. When the
                    goshawk comes freely and without hesitation from short distances, she ought to
                    be called from long distances from the hand of an assistant, but not oftener
                    than twice in each meal, until she will come at least 1000 yards, on each
                    occasion being well rewarded with some food she likes very much, as a
                    fresh-killed bird, warm. When she does this freely, and endures the presence of
                    strangers, dogs, &amp;c., a few bagged rabbits should be given to her, and she
                    will be ready to take the field. Some accustom the goshawk to the use of the
                    lure, for the purpose of taking her if she will not come to the fist in the
                    field when she has taken stand in a tree after being baulked of her quarry, but
                    it ought not to be necessary to use it.</p>
                <p>Falcons or long-winged hawks are either “flown out of the hood,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> unhooded and slipped when the quarry is in sight, or
                    they are made to “wait on” till game is flushed. Herons and rooks are always
                    taken by the former method. Passage hawks are generally employed for flying at
                    these birds, though we have known some good eyases quite equal to the work. For
                    heron-hawking a well-stocked heronry is in the first place necessary. Next an
                    open country which can be ridden over—over which herons are in the constant
                    habit of passing to and from their heronry on their fishing excursions, or
                    making their “passage.” A heron found at his feeding place at a brook or pond
                    affords no sport whatever. If there be little water any peregrine falcon that
                    will go straight at him will seize him soon after he rises. It is sometimes
                    advisable to fly a young falcon at a heron so found, but it should not be
                    repeated. If there be much water the heron will neither show sport nor be
                    captured. It is quite a different affair when he is sighted winging his way at a
                    height in the air over an open tract of country free from water. Though he has
                    no chance whatever of competing with a falcon in straightforward flight, the
                    heron has large concave wings, a very light body proportionately, and air-cells
                    in his bones, and can rise with astonishing rapidity, more perpendicularly, or,
                    in other words, in smaller rings, than the falcon can, with very little effort
                    As soon as he sees the approach of the falcon, which he usually does almost
                    directly she is cast off, he makes play for the upper regions. Then the falcon
                    commences to climb too to get above him, but in a very different style. She
                    makes very large circles or rings, travelling at a high rate of speed, due to
                    her strength and weight and power of flying, till she rises above the heron.
                    Then she makes her attack by stooping with great force at the quarry, sometimes
                    falling so far below it as the blow is evaded that she cannot spring up to the
                    proper pitch for the next stoop, and has to make another ring to regain her lost
                    command over the heron, -which is ever rising, and so on,—the “field” meanwhile
                    galloping down wind in the direction the flight is taking till she seizes the
                    heron aloft, “binds” to him, and both come down together. Absurd stories have
                    been told and pictures drawn of the heron receiving the falcon on its beak in
                    the air. It is, however, well known to all practical falconers that the heron
                    has no power or inclination to fight with a falcon in the air; so long as he is
                    flying he seeks safety solely from his wings. When on the ground, however,
                    should the falcon be deficient in skill or strength, or have been mutilated by
                    the coping of her beak and talons, as was sometimes formerly done in Holland
                    with a view to saving the heron’s life, the heron may use his dagger-like bill
                    with dangerous effect, though it is very rare for a falcon to be injured. It is
                    never safe to fly the goshawk at a heron of any description. Short-winged hawks
                    do not immediately kill their quarry as falcons do, nor do they seem to know
                    where the life lies, and seldom shift their hold once taken even to defend
                    themselves; and they are therefore easily stabbed by a heron. Rooks are flown in
                    the same manner as herons, but the flight is generally inferior. Although rooks
                    fly very well, they seek shelter in trees as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>For game-hawking eyases are generally used, though undoubtedly passage or
                    wild-caught hawks are to be preferred. The best game hawks we have seen have
                    been passage hawks, but there are difficulties attending the use of them. It may
                    perhaps be fairly said that it is easy to make all passage hawks “wait on” in
                    grand style, but until they have got over a season or two they are very liable
                    to be lost. Among the advantages attending the use of eyases are the
                    following:—they are easier to obtain and to train and keep; they also moult far
                    better and quicker than passage hawks, while if lost in the field, they will
                    often go home by themselves, or remain about the spot where they were liberated.
                    Experience, and, we must add, some good fortune also, are requisite to make
                    eyases good for waiting on for game. Slight mistakes on the part of the
                    falconer, false points from dogs, or bad luck in serving, will cause a young
                    hawk to acquire bad habits, such as sitting down on the ground, taking stand in
                    a tree, raking out wide, skimming the ground, or lazily flying about at no
                    height. A good game hawk in proper flying order goes up at once to a good pitch
                    in the air— the higher she flies the better—and follows her master from field to
                    field, always ready for a stoop when the quarry is sprung. Hawks that have been
                    successfully broken and judiciously worked become wonderfully clever, and soon
                    learn to regulate their flight by the movements of their master. Eyases were not
                    held in esteem by the old falconers, and it is evident from their writings that
                    these hawks have been very much better understood and man <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n19/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0019-0010"/> aged in the nineteenth century than in the Middle
                    Ages. It is probable that the old falconers procured their passage and
                    wild-caught hawks with such facility, having at the same time more scope for
                    their use in days when quarry was more abundant and there was more waste land
                    than we have now, that they did not find it necessary to trouble themselves
                    about eyases. We here quote a few lines from one of the best of the old writers,
                    which may be taken as giving a fair account of the estimation in which eyases
                    were generally held, and from which it is evident that the old falconers did not
                    understand flying hawks at hack. Simon Latham, writing in 1633, says of
                    eyases:—</p>
                <p>They will be verie easily brought to familiaritie with the man, not in the house
                    only, but also abroad, hooded or unhooded; nay, many of them will be more gentle
                    and quiet when unhooded than when hooded, for if a man doe but stirre or speake
                    in their hearing, they will crie and bate as though they did desire to see the
                    man. Likewise some of them being unhooded, when they see the man will cowre and
                    crie, shewing thereby their exceeding fondness and fawning love towards him. . .
                    .</p>
                <p>.... These kind of hawks be all (for the most part) taken out of the nest while
                    verie young, even in the downe, from whence they are put into a close house,
                    whereas they be alwaies fed and familiarly brought up by the man, untill they
                    bee able to flie, when as the summer approaching verie suddenly they are
                    continued and trained up in the same, the weather being alwaies warm and
                    temperate; thus they are still inured to familiaritie with the man, not knowing
                    from whence besides to fetch their relief or sustenance. When the summer is
                    ended they bee commonly put up into a house again, or else kept in some warm
                    place, for they cannot endure the cold wind to blow upon them But leaving to
                    speak of these kind of scratching hawks that I never did love should come too
                    neere my fingers, and to return unto the faire conditioned haggard faulcon</p>
                <p>The author here describes with accuracy the condition of unhacked eyases, which
                    no modern falconer would trouble himself to keep. Many of our falconers in this
                    century have had eyases which have killed grouse, ducks, and other quarry in a
                    style almost equalling that of passage hawks. Rooks also have been most
                    successfully flown, and some herons on passage have been taken by eyases. No
                    sport is to be had at game without hawks that wait on well. Moors, downs, open
                    country where the hedges are low and weak, are best suited to game hawking.
                    Pointers or setters may be used to find game, or the hawk may be let go on
                    coming to the ground where game is known to lie, and suffered, if an experienced
                    one, to “wait on” till game is flushed. However, the best plan with most hawks,
                    young ones especially, is to use a dog, and to let the hawk go when the dog
                    points, and to flush the birds as soon as the hawk is at her pitch. It is not by
                    any means necessary that the hawk should be near the birds when they rise,
                    provided she is at a good height, and that she is watching; she will come at
                    once with a rush out of the air at great speed, and either cut one down with the
                    stoop, or the bird will save itself by putting in, when every exertion must be
                    made, especially if the hawk be young and inexperienced, to “serve” her as soon
                    as possible by driving out the bird again while she waits overhead. If this be
                    successfully done she is nearly certain to kill it at the second flight. Perhaps
                    falcons are best for grouse and tiercels for partridges.</p>
                <p>Magpies afford much sport. Only tiercels should be used for bunting magpies. A
                    field is necessary—at the very least 4 or <hi rend="italic">5</hi> runners to
                    beat the magpie out, and perhaps the presence of a horseman is an advantage. Of
                    course in open flight a magpie would be almost immediately caught by a tiercel
                    peregrine, and there would be no sport, but the magpie makes up for his want of
                    power of wing by his cunning and shiftiness; and he is, moreover, never to be
                    found except where he has shelter under his lee for security from a passing
                    peregrine. Once in a hedge or tree he is perfectly safe from the wild falcon,
                    but the case is otherwise when the falconer approaches with his trained tiercel,
                    perhaps a cast of tiercels, waiting on in the air, with some active runners in
                    his field. Then driven from hedge to hedge, from one kind of shelter to another,
                    stooped at every instant when he shows himself ever so little away from cover by
                    the watchful tiercels overhead, his egg-stealing days are brought to an end by a
                    fatal stroke—sometimes not before the field are pretty well exhausted with
                    running and shouting. The magpie always manoeuvres towards some thick wood, from
                    which it is the aim of the field to cut him off. At first hawks must be flown in
                    easy country, but when they understand their work well they will kill magpies in
                    every enclosed country,—with a smart active field a magpie may even be pushed
                    through a small wood. Magpie hawking affords excellent exercise, not only for
                    those who run to serve the hawks, but for the hawks also; they get a great deal
                    of flying, and learn to hunt in company with men,—any number of people may be
                    present. Blackbirds may be hunted with tiercels in the same way. Woodcocks
                    afford capital sport where the county is tolerably open. It will generally be
                    found that after a hawk has made one stoop at a woodcock, the cock will at first
                    try to escape by taking the air, and will show a very fine flight. When beaten
                    in the air it will try to get back to covert again, but when once a hawk has
                    outflown a woodcock, he is pretty sure to kill it. Hawks seem to pursue wood
                    cocks with great keenness; something in the flight of the cock tempts them to
                    exertion. The laziest and most useless hawks—hawks that will scarcely follow a
                    slow pigeon—will do their best at woodcock, and will very soon, if the sport is
                    continued, be improved in their style of flying. Snipes may be killed by
                    first-class tiercels in favourable localities. Wild ducks and teal are only to
                    be flown at when they can be found in small pools or brooks at a distance from
                    much water,—where the fowl can be suddenly flushed by men or dogs while the
                    falcon is flying at her pitch overhead. For ducks, falcons should be used;
                    tiercels will kill teal well.</p>
                <p>The merlin is used for flying at larks, and there does not seem to be any other
                    use to which this pretty little falcon may fairly be put. It is very active, but
                    far from being, as some authors have stated, the swiftest of all hawks. Its
                    flight is greatly inferior in speed and pow’er to that of the peregrine. Perhaps
                    its diminutive size, causing it to be soon lost to view, and a limited
                    acquaintance with the flight of the wild peregrine falcon, have led to the
                    mistake.</p>
                <p>The hobby is far swifter than the merlin, but cannot be said to be efficient in
                    the field; it may be trained to Vvait on beautifully, and will sometimes take
                    larks; it is very much given to the fault of “carrying.”</p>
                <p>The three great northern falcons are not easy to procure in proper condition for
                    training. They are very difficult to break to the hood and to manage in the
                    field. They are flown, like the peregrine, at herons and rooks, and in former
                    days were used for kites and hares. Their style of flight is magnificent; they
                    are considerably swifter than the peregrine, and are most deadly “footers.” They
                    seem, however, to lack somewhat of the spirit and dash of the peregrine.</p>
                <p>For the short-winged hawks an open country is not required; indeed they may be
                    flown in a wood. Goshawks are flown at hares, rabbits, pheasants, partridges,
                    and wildfowl. Only very strong females are able to take hares; rabbits are easy
                    quarry for any female goshawk, and a little too strong for the male. A good
                    female goshawk may kill from 10 to 15 rabbits in a day, or more. For pheasants
                    the male is to be preferred, certainly for partridges; either sex will take
                    ducks and teal, but the falconer must get close to them before they are flushed,
                    or the goshawk will stand a poor chance of killing. Rabbit hawking may be
                    practised by ferreting, and flying the hawk as the rabbits bolt, but care must
                    be taken or the hawk will kill the ferret. Where rabbits sit out on grass or in
                    turnip fields, a goshawk may <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n20/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0020-0011"/> be used with success, even in a wood when the
                    holes are not too near. From various causes it is impossible, or nearly so, to
                    have goshawks in England in the perfection to which they are brought in the
                    East. In India, for instance, there is a far greater variety of quarry suited to
                    them, and wild birds are much more approachable; moreover, there are advantages
                    for training which we do not possess in England. Unmolested,—and scarcely
                    noticed except perhaps by others of his calling or tastes,—the Eastern falconer
                    carries his hawk by day and night in the crowded bazaars, till the bird becomes
                    perfectly indifferent to men, horses, dogs, carriages, and, in short, becomes as
                    tame as the domestic animals.</p>
                <p>The management of sparrow-hawks is much the same as that of goshawks, but they
                    are far more delicate than the latter. They are flown in England at blackbirds,
                    thrushes, and other small birds; good ones will take partridges well till the
                    birds get too wild and strong with the advancing season. In the East large
                    numbers of quails are taken with sparrow-hawks.</p>
                <p>It is of course important that hawks from which work in the field is expected
                    should be kept in the highest health, and they must be carefully fed; no bad or
                    tainted meat must on any account be given to them,—at any rate to hawks of the
                    species now used in England. Peregrines and the great northern falcons are best
                    kept on beefsteak, with a frequent change in the shape of fresh-killed pigeons
                    and other birds. The smaller falcons, the merlin and the hobby, require a great
                    number of small birds to keep them in good health for any length of time.
                    Goshawks should be fed like peregrines, but rats and rabbits are very good as
                    change of food for them. The sparrow-hawk, like the small falcons, requires
                    small birds. All hawks require castings frequently. It is true that hawks will
                    exist, and often appear to thrive, on good food without castings, but the seeds
                    of probable injury to their health are being sown the whole time they are so
                    kept. If there is difficulty in procuring birds, and it is more convenient to
                    feed the hawks on beefsteak, they should frequently get the wings and heads and
                    necks of game and poultry. In addition to the castings which they swallow,
                    tearing these is good exercise for them, and biting the bones prevents the beaks
                    from overgrowing. Most hawks, peregrines especially, require the bath. The end
                    of a cask, sawn off to give a depth of about 6 inches, makes a very good bath.
                    Peregrines which are used for waiting on require a bath at least twice a week.
                    If this be neglected, they will not wait long before going off in search of
                    water to bathe, however hungry they may be.</p>
                <p>The most agreeable and the best way, where practicable, of keeping hawks is to
                    have them on blocks on the lawn. Each hawk’s block should stand in a circular
                    bed of sand —about 8 feet in diameter; this will be found very convenient for
                    keeping them clean. Goshawks are generally placed on bow perches, which ought
                    not to be more than 8 or 9 inches high at the highest part of the arc. It will
                    be several months before passage or wild-caught falcons can be kept out of
                    doors; they must be fastened to a perch in a darkened room, hooded, but by
                    degrees as they get thoroughly tame may be brought to sit on the lawn. In
                    England (especially in the south) peregrines, the northern falcons, and goshawks
                    may be kept out of doors all day and night in a sheltered situation. In very
                    wild boisterous weather, or in snow or sharp frost, it will be advisable to move
                    them to the shelter of a shed, the floor of which should be laid with sand to a
                    depth of 3 or 4 inches. M erlins and hobbies are too tender to be kept much out
                    of doors. An eastern aspect is to be preferred,—all birds enjoy the morning sun,
                    and it is very beneficial to them. The more hawks confined to blocks out of
                    doors see of persons, dogs, horses, &amp;c., moving about the better, but of
                    course only when there is no danger of their being frightened or molested, or of
                    food being given to them by strangers. Those who have only seen wretched ill-fed
                    hawks in cages as in zoological gardens or menageries, pining for exercise, with
                    battered plumage, tom shoulders, and bleeding ceres, from dashing against their
                    prison bars, and overgrown beaks from never getting bones to break, can have
                    little idea of the beautiful and striking-looking birds to be seen pluming their
                    feathers and stretching their wings at their ease at their blocks on the
                    falconer’s lawn, watching with their large bright keen eyes everything that
                    moves in the sky, and everywhere else within the limits of their view. Contrary
                    to the prevailing notion, hawks show a good deal of attachment when they have
                    been properly handled. It is true that by hunger they are in a great measure
                    tamed and controlled, and the same may be said of all undomesticated and many
                    domesticated animals. And instinct prompts all wild creatures when away from
                    man’s control to return to their former shyness, but hawks certainly retain
                    their tameness for a long time, and their memory is remarkably retentive.
                    Wild-caught hawks have been re-taken, either by their coming to the lure or upon
                    quarry, from 2 to 7 days after they had been lost, and eyases after 3 weeks. As
                    one instance of retentiveness of memory displayed by hawks we may mention the
                    case of a wild-caught falcon which was re-captured after being at liberty more
                    than 3 years, still bearing the jesses which were cut short close to the leg at
                    the time she was released; in five days she was flying at the lure again at
                    liberty, and was found to retain the peculiar ways and habits she was observed
                    to have in her former existence as a trained hawk. It is useless to bring a hawk
                    into the field uuless she has a keen appetite; if she has not, she will neither
                    hunt effectually nor follow her master. Even wild-caught falcons, however, may
                    sometimes be seen so attached to their owner that, when sitting on their blocks
                    on a lawn with food in their crops, they will on his coming out of the house
                    bate hard to get to him, till he either go up to them and allow them to jump up
                    to his hand or withdraw from their sight. Goshawks are also known to evince
                    attachment to their owner. Another prevailing error regarding hawks is that they
                    are supposed to be lazy birds, requiring the stimulus of hunger to stir them to
                    action. The reverse is the truth; they are birds of very active habits, and
                    exceedingly restless, and the notion of their being lazy has been propagated by
                    those who have seen little or nothing of hawks in their wild state. The w ild
                    falcon requires an immense deal of exercise, and to be in wind, to exert the
                    speed and power of flight necessary to capture her prey when hungry; and to this
                    end instinct prompts her to spend hours daily on the wing, soaring and playing
                    about iu the air in all weathers, often chasing birds merely for play or
                    exercise. Sometimes she takes a siesta when much gorged, but unless she fills
                    her crop late in the evening she is soon moving again—before half her crop is
                    put over. Goshawks and sparrowhawks, too, habitually soar in the air at about 9
                    or 10 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.,</hi> and remain aloft a considerable time, but
                    these birds are not of such active habits as the falcons. The frequent bating of
                    thoroughly tame hawks from their blocks, even when not hungry or frightened,
                    proves their restlessness and impatience of repose. So does the wretched
                    condition of the caged falcon (before alluded to), while the really lazy
                    buzzards and kites, which do not in a wild state depend on activity or power of
                    wing for their sustenance, maintain themselves in confinement, if properly fed,
                    for years in good case and plumage. Such being the habits of the falcon in a
                    state of nature, the falconer should endeavour to give the hawks under his care
                    as much flying as possible, and he should avoid the very common mistake of
                    keeping too many hawks. In this <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n21/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0021-0012"/> case a favoured few are sure to get all the work,
                    and the others, possibly equally good if they had fair play, are spoiled for
                    want of exercise.</p>
                <p>The larger hawks may be kept in health and working order for several years—15 or
                    20—barring accidents. The writer has known peregrines, shaheens, and goshawks to
                    reach ages between 15 and 20 years. Goshawks, however, never fly well after 4 or
                    5 seasons, when they will no longer take difficult quarry; they may be used at
                    rabbits as long as they live. Shaheens may be seen in the East at an advanced
                    age, killing wild-fowl beautifully. The shaheen is a falcon of the peregrine
                    type, which does not travel, like the peregrine, all over the world. It appears
                    that the jerfalcons also may be worked to a good age. Old Simon Latham tells us
                    of these birds,—“I myself have known one of them an excellent Hearnor, and to
                    continue her goodnesse very near twentie yeeres, or full out that time.”</p>
                <p>It is hardly likely that falconry will ever recover such a position as to be
                    reckoned once more among the national sports of England. Yet in these days of
                    breech-loading and battue shooting, when even a well-broken retriever is a
                    rarity, from want of time to see him work or to give him fair play, there are
                    still some sportsmen who are, to quote the words of the authors of our best
                    modern book on falconry, in the dedication of their work, “those who love sport
                    for its own sake, and in the pursuit of it are willing to tread in the footsteps
                    of their forefathers.”</p>
                <p>The work just quoted is <hi rend="italic">Falconry in the British Isles,</hi> by
                    Salvin and Brodrick. A work to which we are very largely indebted for
                    information regarding the past history of falconry and its practice in foreign
                    countries is Schlegel’s <hi rend="italic">Traité de Fauconnerie.</hi> This
                    magnificent book, in the words of a very able writer in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Qτιarterly Review</hi> for July 1875, “is a worthy monument of the noble art it
                    describes; the extent and minuteness of the learned author’s antiquarian
                    resources are only equalled by his practical knowledge of the details of modern
                    usage, and the result is such as may be expected from such a combination.” It
                    contains a very large list of works on falconry in languages of all the
                    principal countries of the Old World. Other modern works are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Practical Falconry,</hi> by the Bev. G. E. Freeman, an excellent little book;
