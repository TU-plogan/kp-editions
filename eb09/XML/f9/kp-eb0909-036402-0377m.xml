                    (1757-1821), French poet and politician, was born at Niort, in Poitou, March 6,
                    1757. He was a descendant of a noble Protestant family of Languedoc, banished by
                    the revocation of the edict of Nantes, but afterwards converted to the Catholic
                    faith and restored to their native land. Having completed his education at the
                    college of Niort, he went in 1777, after the death of his father and brother, to
                    Paris. He had already made several attempts in verse; and in 1778 he published a
                    short descriptive poem entitled <hi rend="italic">La Forêt</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Navarre.</hi> This procured him the notice and friendship of Ducis, and he
                    was encouraged to persevere. During the next twelve years he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Cri de mon Coeur; Le Jour des Morts dans une Campagne,</hi> an
                    imitation of Gray’s <hi rend="italic">Elegy·,</hi> a translation of Pope’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> (1783), with an elegant introduction which
                    attracted more attention than the poem itself; <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Verger; La Chartreuse de Paris;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Essai</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Astronomie</hi> (1789). In this year appeared also his <hi
                    rend="italic">Èpltre</hi><hi rend="italic">sur VÉdit en Faveur des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">non-</hi><hi rend="italic">Catholiques,</hi> which was crowned by
                    the academy. The Revolution converted the poet into a journalist, and he took
                    part in the editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure François</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Modérateur.</hi> Compelled to leave Paris after the death of
                    the king, he withdrew to Lyons, where he married and remained till the arrival
                    of Collot d’Herbois in 1793. Driven again to lead a wandering life, he displayed
                    at once his literary power, his patriotism, and his intrepidity in the eloquent
                    petition on behalf of the Lyonnese victims of Collot d’Herbois and his
                    colleagues, which was presented to the convention in December of that year. For
                    this bold appeal he was proscribed, and he owed his protection in concealment to
                    the friendship of Madame Dufresnoy. After the fall of Robespierre, Fontanes was
                    appointed professor of belles lettres at the central school, and admitted a
                    member of the Institute. About the same time he was associated with La Harpe in
                    the conduct of the <hi rend="italic">Memorial.</hi> For one of his articles he
                    was condemned to banishment by the Directory and expelled from the Institute. He
                    escaped to England, and there renewed his acquaintance with Chateaubriand, also
                    an exile. Returning to France after the 18th Brumaire, he was soon after
                    commissioned by the first consul to write the funeral oration on Washington, and
                    this opened a new chapter in his life. Bonaparte, satisfied with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eloge,</hi> admitted Fontanes to frequent intercourse with him; he
                    was soon reinstated at the Institute, and became a member of the legislative
                    body, of which in 1804 he was made president. He was also one of the first
                    members of the Legion of Honour; and in 1808 he was made grand master of the
                    university. Fontanes was censured by the republican party for alleged servility
                    to the emperor; but apparently without reason. He was created count, and in 1810
                    was called to the senate. He voted for the deposition of Napoleon, retained his
                    offices under the provisional government, and was made a peer by Louis XVIII. In
                    February 1815 the post of grand master of the university was suppressed, and
                    Fontanes was promoted grand cordon of the Legion of Honour. He remained passive
                    during the Hundred Days, and after the second restoration of the Bourbons was
                    made a privy councillor. The title of marquis was conferred on him in 1817. In
                    January 1821 he was chosen president of the Société des Bonnes Lettres; but his
                    health had long been declining, and he died at Paris on the 17 th of March of
                    that year. He left unfinished a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">La Grèce
                    Délivrée,</hi> of which high expectations had been formed. A collected edition
                    of the works of Fontanes was first published by Sainte-Beuve, with a critical
                    and biographical memoir, in 1837.</p>
