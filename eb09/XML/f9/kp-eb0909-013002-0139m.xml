                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0140-0131"/> the verdict of a jury; and they serve as a rule
                    for ascertaining the value of the grain due to feudal superiors, to the clergy
                    or to lay proprietors of teinds, to landlords as a part or the whole of their
                    rents and in all cases where the price of grain has not been fixed by the
                    parties. It is not known when or how the practice of “striking the fiars,” as it
                    is called, originated. It probably was first used to determine the value of the
                    grain rents and duties payable to the crown. In confirmation of this view it
                    seems that at first the duty of the sheriff was merely to make a return to the
                    Court of Exchequer of the prices of grain within their counties, the court
                    itself striking the fiars; and from an old case it appears that the fiars were
                    struck above the true prices, being regarded rather as punishments to force the
                    king’s tenants to pay their rents than as the proper equivalent of the grain
                    they had to pay. Co-existent, however, with these fiars, which were termed
                    sheriffs’ fiars, there was at an early period another class called commissaries’
                    fiars, by which the values of teinds were regulated. They have been traced back
                    to the Reformation, and were under the management of the commissary or
                    consistorial courts, which then took the place of the bishops and their
                    officials. They have now been long out of use, but they were perhaps of greater
                    antiquity than the sheriffs’ fiars, and the model upon which these were
                    instituted. In 1723 the Court of Session passed an Act of Sederunt for the
                    purpose of regulating the procedure in fiars courts. Down to that date the
                    practice of striking the fiars was by no means universal over Scotland; and even
                    in those counties into which it had been introduced, there was, as the preamble
                    of the Act puts it, “a general complaint that the said fiars are struck and
                    given out by the sheriffs without due care and inquiry into the current and just
                    prices.” The Act in consequence provided that all sheriffs should summon
                    annually, between the 4th and the 20th of February, a competent number of
                    persons, living in the shire, of experience in the prices of grain within its
                    bounds, and that from these they should choose a jury of fifteen, of whom at
                    least eight were to be heritors; that witnesses and other evidence as to the
                    price of grain grown in the county, especially since the 1st of November
                    preceding until the day of inquiry, were to be brought before the jury, who
                    might also proceed on “their own proper knowledge”; that the verdict was to be
                    returned and the sentence of the sheriff pronounced by the 1st March; and
                    further, where custom or expediency recommended it, the sheriff was empowered to
                    fix fiars of different values according to the different qualities of the grain.
                    It cannot be said that this Act has remedied all the evils of which it
                    complained. The propriety of some of its provisions has been questioned, and the
                    competency of the court to pass it has been doubted, even by the court itself.
                    Its authority has been entirely disregarded in one county— Haddingtonshire—where
                    the fiars are struck by the sheriff alone, without a jury; and when thispractico
                    was called in question the court declined to interfere, observing that the fiar3
                    were better struck in Haddingtonshire than anywhere else. The other sheriffs
                    have in the main followed the Act, but with much variety of detail, and in many
                    instances on principles the least calculated to reach the true average prices.
                    Thus in some counties the averages are taken on the number of transactions,
                    without regard to the quantities sold. In one case, in 1838, the evidence was so
                    carelessly collected that the second or inferior barley fiars were 2s. 4d.
                    higher than the first. Formerly the price was struck by the boll, commonly the
                    Linlithgowshire boll; now the imperial quarter is always used.</p>
