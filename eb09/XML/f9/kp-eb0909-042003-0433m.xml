                    eastward in a direct course for above 100 miles, receiving in its progress the
                    Goodie, the Teith, and the Allan above Stirling, and below it the Devon, the
                    Carron, the Avon, the Almond, the Leith, the Esk, the Leven, the Tyne, and
                    others; and it discharges itself into the German Ocean in about 56° 10' N. lat.
                    The windings or “links” of the Forth above and below Stirling are extremely
                    tortuous. From its junction with the Teith to the “carse” or alluvial plain
                    below Gartmore they extend about 28 miles, although the distance in a direct
                    line is only about 20. From Stirling harbour to Alloa, where it widens into an
                    estuary, the length of the river is 10 j miles, though the distance in a
                    straight line is not more than 5. From Grangemouth to North Queensferry the
                    depth increases in the first mile from 10 to 15 feet, in the second to 25, and
                    in the third mile to 53 feet, while the remaining part of the distance—7 miles,
                    including the great anchorage of St Margaret’s Hope—has a depth generally of
                    about 60 feet at low water. At Queensferry the firth is 2 miles wide; between
                    Dysart and Aberlady about 12; and between St Abb’s Head and Fifeness, where it
                    joins the German Ocean, it is from 35 to 40 miles. Near Queensferry, between
                    Inchgarvie and the North shore, it deepens to 37 fathoms. The bed of the river
                    consists to a great extent of mud,—the depth of the deposit in some places being
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n434/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0434-0421"/> upwards of 200 feet; and there are extensive
                    alluvial formations along the lower part of its course, and in the upper reaches
                    of its estuary. The tides are felt 4¾ miles above Stirling, and at Stirling
                    harbour the spring tides rise 7 feet 9 inches. At Leith and Kinghorn their
                    average height is 17∣ feet. Steamers go as far up the river as Stirling,— the
                    only important obstructions to the navigation between that town and Alloa, the
                    “Town Ford” and the “Abbey Ford,” having been removed since 1843. The
                    shallowness of the channel seems to have been occasioned by the practice in
                    vogue from 1732 among the Stirlingshire proprietors of using the river to carry
                    off the peat from their lands; Mr Drummond of Blair-Drummond, for example,
                    between 1783 and 1839 floated away upwards of 1000 acres of this substance.
                    Further down in the firth the principal obstructions are the Drumsands near
                    Cramond and the Sand-end to the east of Burntisland harbour. The anchorages in
                    the firth are excellent; and it thus forms the most important harbour of refuge
                    to the north of the Humber. Several of its ports carry on a large foreign trade,
                    more especially Leith, Granton, Bo’ness, and Grangemouth. The fisheries of
                    herring, white fish, and salmon are all of great economical importance, not only
                    giving employment to a considerable local population, but attracting English and
                    even foreign fishermen. The traffic between the two sides of the firth has been
                    an object of legislation since 1467. Both the principal ferries—that between
                    North and South Queensferry, and that between Granton and Burntisland—are now in
                    the hands of the North British Railway Company. In connexion with their system
                    they have undertaken to construct a magnificent viaduct across the firth, the
                    foundation stone of which was laid on the 30th of September 1878. Thomas Bouch,
                    the engineer entrusted with the enterprise, has practically revived a plan
                    proposed as early as 1818 by James Anderson. The bridge is to cross a little to
                    the east of the present line of traffic between North and South Queensferry,
                    advantage being taken of the small island of Inchgarvie, which lies about mid
                    channel. Its most striking features will be two spans of 1600 feet, constructed
                    on the suspension principle, at a height of 150 feet above high water of spring
                    tides. In order to secure sufficient stability against the lateral pressure of
                    the winds, which sometimes blow with great violence in the firth, these central
                    portions will be split into two branches, each about 14 feet wide, which will
                    lie 100 feet apart, but be bound together by horizontal braces. Both the great
                    spans will be laid on a dead level, but the shoreward sections will have
                    gradients of about one in 77 and one in 80. The total cost is estimated at
                    £1,250,000, and it is expected that the works will be completed in 1882.</p>
