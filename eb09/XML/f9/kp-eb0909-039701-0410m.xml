                    A notice inserted in the <hi rend="italic">New Statistical Account</hi> of the
                    parish of Fordoun in Kincardineshire begins thus :—“John of Fordun, the
                    historian, was either a native of the parish or resident in it, when he wrote
                    his history of Scotland. He is called by Bede ‘venerabilis vir Dominus Joannes
                    Fordun, Presbyter.’” The writer’s notions of chronology must have been somewhat
                    peculiar. The statement generally made that the chronicler was boru at Fordoun
                    has apparently no better foundation than his name. It is certain that he was a
                    secular priest, and that he composed his history in the latter part of the 14th
                    century; and it is probable that he was a chaplain in the cathedral of Aberdeen.
                    The work of Fordun is the earliest attempt to write a continuous history of
                    Scotland; nothing existed previously except brief chronicles and genealogical
                    memoranda. It is divided into five books. The first three are almost entirely
                    fabulous, and form the groundwork on which Boece and Buchanan afterwards raised
                    the huge structure of historical and political fiction, which was first exposed
                    by Thomas Innes in his <hi rend="italic">Critical Essay.</hi> The 4th and 5th
                    books, though still mixed with fable, contain much valuable information, and
                    become more authentic the more nearly they approach the author’s own time. The
                    5th book concludes with the death of King David I. in 1153. Besides these five
                    books, Fordun wrote part of another book, and collected materials for bringing
                    down the history to a later period. These materials were used by a continuator
                    who wrote in the middle of the 15th century, and who is commonly, and no doubt
                    correctly, identified with Walter Bower, abbot of the monastery of Inchcolm. The
                    additions of Bower form eleven books, and bring down the narrative to the death
                    of King James I. in 1437. According to the custom of the time, the continuator
                    did not hesitate to interpolate Fordun’s portion of the work with additions of
                    his own, and the whole history thus compiled is known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scotichronicon.</hi> The first printed edition of Fordun’s work was that of
                    Thomas Gale in his <hi rend="italic">Scriptores Quindecim,</hi> which was
                    published in 1691. This was followed by Thomas Hearne’s edition in 1722. The
                    whole work, including Bower’s continuation, was published by Walter Goodall at
                    Edinburgh in 1759. In 1871 and 1872 Fordun’s chronicle, in the original Latin
                    and also in an English translation, was edited by Mr William F. Skene in the
                    series of <hi rend="italic">The Historians of Scotland.</hi> Mr Skene’s preface
                    to this valuable edition contains full information both in regard to the author,
                    the manuscripts of his work, and the printed editions. Reference may also be
