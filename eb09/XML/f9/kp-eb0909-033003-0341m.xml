                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Florentia),</hi> the capital of Tuscany, now a
                    province of the kingdom of Italy, is an archiépiscopal see. It is situated 125
                    miles north of Rome, 43° 50' N. lat., 11° 14' E. long., on both sides of the
                    river Arno, which here flows through a wide valley, bounded by spurs of the
                    Apennine range to the north, and by lower hills to the south of the city. The
                    bed of the river at Florence is 138 feet above the Mediterranean. The geological
                    formation of the surrounding country is Upper Cretaceous and Older Tertiary,
                    partially covered by the fossiliferous upper Arno beds of Newer Tertiary,
                    containing elephant bones. Pietra forte, belonging to the Cretaceous, a durable
                    sandstone with calcareous ingredients, is largely quarried south of Florence,
                    and has been used for centuries as paving-stones for the city, as well as in the
                    construction of the city walls, the palazzi, churches, &amp;c. North of
                    Florence, pietra serena or macigno, a pure sandstone belonging to the Tertiary
                    beds, is likewise worked for building purposes, its texture being finer than
                    that of the pietra forte; it has been adopted for the interior of churches and
                    houses.</p>
                <p>The soil is remarkably fertile: corn, vines, and olives cover hill and valley,
                    while the mountains, which rise above 3000 feet, have the cypress, ilex,
                    chestnut, and pine. The country is celebrated for the abundance of its flowers,
                    and presents a rich field for the botanist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Sanitary Condition.</hi> —The climate of Florence
                    is extremely variable, especially in the early spring, when the inhabitants are
                    liable to diseases of the trachea, to bronchitis, and affections of the lungs.
                    The summers are hot; but both the summers and autumns are peculiarly healthy,
                    when the city is entirely free from intermittent fever, while typhoid fever is
                    of rare occurrence. Eruptive diseases and all children’s complaints are
                    exceed-inglymild. Diphtheria appeared first in 1868, and continued as a severe
                    epidemic until 1872, since which time it has only occurred at intervals and in
                    isolated cases. Cholera has more than once visited Florence with severity, but
                    the last time it was in Italy this city escaped the calamity. The migliaria, so
                    much dreaded by the Florentines, is not confined to Italy, but here, as
                    elsewhere, is found to be an accompaniment of typhoid fever, pneumonia, and some
                    other diseases. The average temperature throughout the year is about 15°
                    centigrade (59° Fahr.). The greatest summer heat averages 36° centigrade (96 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8° Fahr.), but it has risen exceptionally to 39°
                    centigrade (102 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2° Fahr.). The greatest cold is
                    about 6° centigrade below zero (21 ’ 2° Fahr.). The <pb break="no"

                    8 hours 50 minutes. The average annual rainfall is about 9 inches. The drainage
                    of the city is imperfect, and it is ill supplied with water, which is largely
                    impregnated with carbonate of lime. The wells are shallow, not above 20 or 22
                    feet deep. The best drinking water is conveyed in pipes from a distance of seven
                    miles north of Florence to the Palazzo Pitti. The water of the Arno above the
                    town has latterly been filtered and pumped up to a reservoir for distribution in
                    the city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Buildings, Parks, and Charitable Foundations.—</hi>
                    Florence contains more than 170 churches, several of which are Italian
                    Evangelical, besides English, American, French, and German Protestant, and a
                    large Jewish synagogue lately erected. The most remarkable are the Badia or
                    ancient abbey, the cathedral with its campanile, and the baptistry, Sta Maria
                    Novella, San Marco, the SS. Annunziata, and Or San Michele, with San Miniato and
                    San Francesco beyond the walls. Of the palaces, whose construction of rough hewn
                    stone gives a peculiar character to the city, those of greatest interest are the
                    royal residence of the Pitti, the Palazzo Vecchio or municipal palace, and the
                    Palazzo Riccardi, once the mansion of the Medici, but now the palace of the
                    prefect. To these may be added the private palaces of the Strozzi, Rucellai,
                    Corsini, Corsi, Quaratesi, Gondi, Albizzi, and Alessandri. The streets of modern
                    Florence bear the names of many illustrious citizens of the past, and in the
                    older narrower streets which have been left standing, the former homes of Dante,
                    Macchiavelli, Guicciardini, &lt;fcc., have tablets with their names inscribed.
                    Some of the tabernacles, or frames containing pictures of sacred subjects, with
                    lamps burning before them, still remain, commemorating the ancient usage of
                    praying in the corners of the streets. The walls of Florence north of the Arno
                    have been demolished, leaving the gates isolated, huge monuments of the past.
                    South of the Arno the four gates of Romana, San Frediano, San Giorgio, and San
                    Nicolo, remain as of old.</p>
                <p>The city is intersected from S.E. to N.W. by the river, which is crossed by six
                    bridges. Two are suspension bridges, the remaining four of stone. The Ponte
                    Vecchio, or .jewellers’ bridge, alone retains its ancient form, and is still
                    flanked on both sides by goldsmiths’ shops; the bridge of the S. Trinità is
                    adorned with statues, and is remarkable for the perfect symmetry of the arches.
                    The fortresses of Belvedere and Del Basso are now only used as barracks for
                    soldiers. Since the annexation of Tuscany to the Italian kingdom the convents in
                    Florence have been suppressed. A few monks are allowed to remain in each
                    sanctuary, but the Government has prohibited any new monks or nuns to be added
                    to the present number. This prohibition is, however, constantly evaded, and some
                    of the schools for the young continue in their hands. There are twelve
                    hospitals, including those for the blind, deaf and dumb, and insane. The
                    hospital for the sick of Sta Maria Nuova, was founded by Folco Portinari, the
                    father of Dante’s Beatrice, and the institute for the relief of the poveri
                    vergognosi, or those ashamed to beg, by the good bishop Antonino, in the 15th
                    century. One of the most important and beneficial charities is that of the
                    Misericordia, or brothers of mercy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"

                <p>Florentines of all ranks belong to the society, and the members are equally bound
                    to lend their services without remuneration when summoned, either to convey sick
                    or wounded persons to the hospital, to nurse them in their homes, or to carry
                    the dead to burial. Next in antiquity is the Bigallo for the reception of
                    orphans or children abandoned by their parents, as well as the Innocenti or
                    Foundling Hospital. The most admirably conducted modern charity is the
                    work-house or Pia Casa di Lavoro of Monte Domini. The building comprises two
                    former convents; the Pia Casa is self-supporting, and independent of the
                    municipality. None are admitted who are able-bodied, or who have relations
                    capable of supporting them. An excellent education is provided for the boys, who
                    are taught a trade by being hound apprentices to one of the λvorkshops attached
                    to the establishment. The girls are provided with dowries when they leave the
                    Pia Casa.</p>
                <p>There are nine theatres, and several public parks or gardens. The Cascine, a
                    large extent of ground surrounding a fancy farm formerly belonging to the grand
                    dukes, and planted in long avenues of ilex and other trees, is the fashionable
                    resort of the Florentine nobility. The Strada dei Colli, outside the Porta
                    Romana, winds round the hills of Arcetri and San Miniato, affording a
                    magnificent prospect over Florence. The Boboli garden, behind the Pitti, and
                    belonging to the royal palace, is open twice a week to the public, and, with its
                    trim alleys, quaint terraces, statues, and fountains, is the delight of the
                    Florentines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Galleries of Art and Libraries.—</hi> Besides some excellent
                    private collections, such as those of the Torrigiani, Corsini, and Strozzi, the
                    Uffizi contains a very fine gallery of paintings, especially of the Tuscan
                    school, but including several of Raphael’s and Titian’s masterpieces. The
                    greatest treasures of the gallery are contained in one room called the Tribune,
                    where are also placed the most celebrated statues of antiquity. A suite of small
                    rooms contains some admirable specimens of other schools of painting. In one of
                    the larger rooms is the famous group of the Niobe; two others are filled with
                    portraits of artists, chiefly by their own hands; and there are, besides,
                    valuable collections of busts, coins, medals, gems, engravings, and drawings by
                    the old masters. The Pitti collection of paintings is perhaps the finest in the
                    world, not only from the <hi rend="italic">chefs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’oeuvre</hi> of the great masters, but from the small number of pictures which
                    may be considered of even mediocre merit. The Academy is assigned for the best
                    examples of early art down to the time of Fra Angelico and Perugino; and
                    connected with it are the cloisters of the former convent of the Scalzo or
                    barefooted friars, where are some of the finest works of Andrea del Sarto in
                    chiaroscuro. The Egyptian museum in the Via Faenza is small, but contains
                    several objects of interest, and the museum of Etruscan art under the same roof
                    is peculiarly important from a life-size bronze statue, a marble Greek
                    sarcophagus with a coloured representation of the battles between the Greeks and
                    Amazons, and a terra-cotta statue of a lady in the costume of the third century
                    before Christ. Here also is an interesting fresco of the Last Supper attributed
                    to Raphael, whilst the Convent de’ Pazzi possesses the finest work of his master
                    Perugino, a Crucifixion, now open to the public.</p>
                <p>There are three large and valuable libraries in the city. The National library,
                    which unites the former library of the Pitti with the Magliabecchian, the two
                    together containing 280,000 volumes: the Marucelliana, chiefly remarkable for
                    important works on art; and the Laurentian, founded by Lorenzo de’ Medici, and
                    attached to the convent of San Lorenzo. This last is rich in a collection of
                    more than 9000 valuable manuscripts, as well as illuminated bibles and missals,
                    and possesses about 20,000 volumes of print.</p>
                <p>The pride of the collection is an original and perhaps unique copy of the
                    Pandects of Justinian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">University and Schools.—</hi> The university of Florence, which
                    is rather an institute for advanced studies,—Istituti de’ Studi Superiori
                    Pratici e di Perfezionamento,—has its origin as far back as the year 1348. It
                    was divided into six “scholae,” viz., theology, jurisprudence, medicine, belles
                    lettres, Greek and Latin literature, and astrology or astronomy. To counteract
                    the effects of the plague,-which in the year just mentioned had decimated
                    Florence aud caused the city to be avoided by strangers, it was decreed that no
                    one living within the walls, or even in the territory of the republic, should be
                    allowed to seek an education abroad, and that those youths who were already
                    attending other lyceums should forthwith return to their native city. In 1421
                    there were already 42 professors, and although in 1472 the Medici desired to
                    revive the splendour of the Pisan university, and transferred several of the
                    chairs from the city to Pisa, Florence retained many distinguished professors.
                    The university underwent various changes, both in organization and name, but
                    continued to flourish under the Medicean grand dukes. It gave rise to several
                    academies, the most ancient of which was the Platonic, founded by Marsilio
                    Ficino, for the cultivation of Greek literature, the Florentine academy, and the
                    Accademia del Cimento (discussion) which had its rise with Galileo and his
                    scholars. The Accademia della Crusca—named from <hi rend="italic">crusca</hi>
                    (bran) to express sifting the language—was founded in 1552, and the agricultural
                    academy of the Georgofili in 1783. The taste for botany of Cosimo I. led to the
                    formation of a herbal garden (Giardino de’ Semplici)—and ultimately to the
                    botanic garden under the walls of the Boboli. Natural science first formed a
                    branch of study under the patronage of the Medici, who invited foreigners of
                    scientific distinction to Florence. A vast collection of objects of natural
                    science and physics having accumulated, the celebrated professor Giovanni
                    Targioni Tozzetti, in the 18th century, threw them open to the public. The
                    observatory, once attached to the museum, has been removed to a height
                    corresponding with that on which Galileo made his observations. The collection
                    in the museum was enriched by the valuable waxen anatomical preparations of
                    Giulio Zummo of Syracuse, aud by a unique collection of physical instruments,
                    most of which had belonged to the Accademia di Cimento. The university was
                    reorganized in 1859, when Baron Ricasoli presided over Tuscany. Several new
                    professorships were founded, in law, philosophy, and philology. In 1869 a chair
                    of anthropology was added. The medical school of Sta Maria Nuova has also been
                    attached to the university. At one time the students of law, medicine, and
                    natural science were expected to pursue their studies, first in Pisa, and the
                    last two years in Florence, where they received their degrees. This has again
                    been modified, and students in Florence have now the option of receiving degrees
                    in Florence, Siena, or Pisa. Natural science degrees are conferred at the
                    Specula, or institute of natural science, in the Via Romana.</p>
                <p>The communal or municipal schools, where the pupils are admitted gratis, have
                    increased enormously. From 4 schools under the last grand-duke, there are now,
                    besides 32 elementary schools, 15 lyceums, of which three are for girls, and one
                    of these a normal school for the training of teachers. The entire number of
                    pupils in the schools averages 7900.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi> are few and of small importance, that of
                    silk standing first. The cultivation of the silk-worm aud straw plaiting are the
                    usual occupations of the people. The porcelain manufacture of the Marchese
                    Ginori at Doccia, a few miles from Florence, has greatly fallen off in work as
                    well as reputation; but a successful attempt to <pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Florence is governed by a prefect or
                    representative of the chief government, who has a force of cιrabineers (mounted
                    police) at his disposal, besides guardie di sicurezza, partly paid by the
                    municipality, although there is also a city police. The ancient office of
                    gonfalonier is replaced by that of syndic, who is president of the junta or
                    municipal council. The city is divided into four electoral districts, and sends
                    four deputies to parliament. Every male inhabitant above twenty-five years of
                    age has the right of suffrage, although twenty-one is the usual age qualifying
                    for official posts in Italy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population of Florence is very
                    fluctuating. In 1854 the inhabitants numbered 115,675, but during the short
                    period when it was the capital of the new kingdom there was a large increase of
                    Italians as well as foreigners; this diminished as rapidly on the transference
                    of the capital to Rome. By the census taken December 31, 1871, the total
                    population, foreigners included, amounted to 167,093. On December 23, 1876, the
                    number had risen to 176,121. In 1871 there were 158,704 Italian Roman Catholics,
                    917 Italian Protestants, 2366 Jews, and 5106 of other sects.</p>
                <p>The Florentines are gentle and courteous in their manners, though retaining the
                    republican feeling of equality, and are well disposed towards all who treat them
                    with kindness and respect. They are justly proud of the traditions of their
                    native city, but are hardly conscious that centuries of misgovernment have left
                    them behind in the race of civilization. Though the advantages of a liberal
                    education are now open to them, and they are remarkably rapid in acquisition,
                    the more important moral training is still wanting,—a defect which, with the
                    absence of chivalrous respect for women, renders men of all classes, as is too
                    much the case also in other parts of Italy, tyrannical to their wives and
                    children, as well as indifferent to the sufferings of the lower animals, all
                    alike being regarded as property, over which they have an absolute control. From
                    their nervous physical organization the Florentines are defective in manly
                    courage, but peculiarly sensitive to the beautiful in art, and able to reproduce
                    all that is delicate and refined in decoration. As, however, with the decline of
                    the healthy vigour and simple lives of their ancestors they have lost much of
                    their originality, modern sculpture and painting are in general feeble, and
                    wanting in truth of expression and colour. Though indolent and incapable of
                    great exertion, the lower orders are industrious, and though impetuous, they
                    have displayed exemplary patience and moderation in times of adversity. Their
                    greatest misfortunes are the passion for gambling, with other vices remaining
                    from a corrupt state of society, and the extremes of superstition and
                    scepticism, which belong to the state of transition, political and religious, of
                    the present era in Italy (1878). The large middle class, however, besides
                    producing men eminent in literature and science, is rising in social and
                    political importance, and by their intelligence and domestic virtues may well
                    redeem faults in their fellow citizens, which are to be regarded rather as the
                    result of adverse circumstances, than as a constant factor in the character of
                    the Florentine people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Florence was originally a small trading village
                    belonging to the Etruscan city of Fiesole, whence merchandise was sent down the
                    Arno to Pisa, then a seaport. When colonized by the soldiers of Sulla, it
                    gradually attained.the dignity of a city, with the rank and privileges of a
                    municipium. The name Florentia may have been derived from Florinus, a Roman
                    general, or from Fluentia, because situated at the confluence of the Arno and
                    Mugnone, or from the profusion of flowers growing in the vicinity. In the reign
                    of Tiberius Caesar the Florentines sent an embassy to Romo to deprecate α decree
                    of the Roman senate, by which, in order to check the inundations caused by the
                    number of tributary streams flowing into the Tiber, it had been proposed to turn
                    the Chiano into the Arno. Christianity was first introduced in 313 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the most celebrated of early Florentine bishops
                    was Zanobius, who died in 417, and to whom various miracles are ascribed. During
                    his lifetime an invading army of barbarians approached Florence, but w ere
                    defeated and destroyed in the fastnesses near Fiesole by the Roman general
                    Stilicho. The Florentines, however, attributed the preservation of their city to
                    the prayers of Zanobius. The victory was won in 405 on the 8th October, a day
                    dedicated to a youthful saint, Reparata, who is said to have appeared in the
                    midst of the battle, bearing in her hand a blood-red banner with the device of
                    the white lily, which from that time became the badge of the city, whilst a new
                    cathedral, built on the site of the old church of San Salvador, received her
                    name. Florence had suffered the fate of other Italian cities at the hands of
                    northern invaders, when Charlemagne, on his way to Rome, rebuilt its walls.
                    Commerce began to flourish in the 10th century, when as yet German nobles or
                    their descendants, who held their castles in fief of the German emperors, dwelt
                    beyond the city. The pope, because an Italian sovereign, was regarded as the
                    representative of national independence, and when Tuscany fell to the
                    inheritance of the Countess Matilda, the Florentines found in her a patriotic
                    champion of their rights, as well as a staunch adherent of the reigning pope,
                    Gregory VII. A second circle of walls was built as a protection against the
                    imperialists, and Matilda obliged some of the powerful nobles in the
                    neighourhood to yield their lands to the canons of Sta Reparata. She died in
                    1115, leaving a name so beloved by the Florentines that their female children
                    were frequently christened Contessa, or Tessa, in remembrance of their
                    benefactress. As the Florentines conquered and destroyed the castles of the
                    robber chieftains who infested their neighbourhood, they obliged them to reside
                    within their city—an impolitic measure, which sowed the seeds of future discord
                    and civic war. The romantic story of the Buondelmonti, whoso assassination in
                    1215, for a breach of promise of marriage, occasioned a fierce outbreak of
                    strife, is an instance of the many feuds that caused bloodshed in Florence
                    during centuries.</p>
                <p>About 1240 the Paterini, a sect of Reformers, after the manner of the Albigenses
                    in France, had gained considerably in numbers and influence, especially among
                    the imperialists, who about this time assumed the name of Ghibellines. Their
                    adversaries, the Guelphic or papal party, called in Peter Martyr, a Dominican
                    friar of Verona, to rouse the multitude for the destruction of this heresy. Two
                    columns in Florence still mark the spots where the Paterini were massacred. A
                    few years later the Guelphic Florentines sustained a severe defeat from Manfred,
                    a natural son of the emperor Frederick IL, at Monteaperti near Siena; and the
                    Ghibellines, whom they had banished, re-entered Florence. The Ghibelline
                    conquerors proposed to level the city with the ground, but λvere deterred by the
                    bold and determined opposition of one of their own party, Farinata degli Uberti,
                    whose name has been immortalized by Dante. About this time a French pope,
                    Clement IV., invited Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX. of France, to take
                    possession of Naples and drive the imperialists from Italy; and after the defeat
                    and death of Manfred at Benevento, Charles complied with the request of the
                    Florentine Guelphs, to assume the lordship of their city. In 1282, however, the
                    wealthier guilds of Florence established a form of government or signory of
                    their own, consisting of members chosen among themselves with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0345-0334"/> title of priors. Not satisfied with having driven
                    their Ghibelline rivals into banishment, they sent an army to encounter them at
                    Campaldino, where the Ghibellines were defeated with great slaughter. To arrest
                    the power of the nobles within the city, a new code was framed in 1293, which
                    went so far as to exclude them from their rights as citizens, and an officer was
                    appointed—gonfaloniere di gius-tizia (standard-bearer of justice)—with a guard
                    of soldiers to enforce the laws. Seventy-two families were declared incapable of
                    holding office, and as they naturally combined in self-defence, peace seemed as
                    far removed as ever from the walls of Florence.</p>
                <p>The 13th century is one of the most important in the annals of the city. When
                    Boniface VIII. held his jubilee in 1300, twelve of the ambassadors representing
                    foreign powers were Florentines. So vast were the riches of Florence at this
                    period, that when a citizen of Verona beheld the yet unfinished campanile, and
                    exclaimed that the wealth of two monarchies would not suffice for such a
                    monument, he was shown the public treasury to convince him that were the
                    Florentines so inclined, they co ’ ιld build their whole city of marble. The
                    most illustrious of Florentine citizens, as well as poets, Dante Alighieri, born
                    in 1265, was present at the battle of Campaldino in 1289, and was chosen prior
                    of the republic in 1300. In his immortal poem, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia,</hi> he has preserved the names and
                    deeds of the great men who made Florence renowned by their works. The friend of
                    Dante, Guido Cavalcante, was considered no mean poet, and among the historians
                    or chroniclers Dino Compagni and Giovanni Villani have left faithful records of
                    their age. Cimabue commenced a new era in painting, and his pupil Giotto carried
                    the art still further. Pre-eminent also in sculpture and architecture, in which
                    Nicolo Pisano had led the way by his study of Greek art, Giotto built the
                    beautiful campanile of the cathedral. St Croce, founded in 1297, and the new
                    cathedral of St Maria del Fiore, were the work of the celebrated architect
                    Arnolfo di Cambio. The exquisite church of Sta Maria Novella was also begun in
                    this century. The bridge of Rubaconte or Delle Grazie, and that of Carraia, were
                    added to the Ponte Vecchio, and thus the two sides of the river were connected
                    by three thoroughfares, although before the 13th century there had been no
                    houses of importance south of the Arno.</p>
                <p>With the commencement of the 14th century the parties which contended for power
                    in Florence had assumed new names. On one side were the Bianchi, including the
                    remnant of the old Ghibelline faction, but now representing the popular party;
                    on the other, the Neri or Guelphs, who, under their leader, Corso Donati,
                    represented the nobles or aristocracy of the city. Each party as it gained the
                    ascendency sent its opponents into exile, until Pope Boniface VIII. again
                    resorted to the fatal expedient of sending for a French prince, Charles of
                    Valois, to restore order, and establish papal supremacy in the peninsula. When
                    Charles arrived in Florence, he gave full licence to the Neri to pillage the
                    city, and avenge their wrongs. The signory endeavoured to conciliate him by
                    bribes, a measure to <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> vhich Dante, then a prior,
                    refused his consent, thus leading to his own banishment. A few years later the
                    emperor Henry of Luxembourg descended into Italy, and the Florentines, whilst
                    boldly preparing to resist his pretensions, added a third circuit of walls to
                    their city. His death in 1313 put an end to this danger.</p>
                <p>In a war with Castruccio Castracani, the tyrant of Lucca and Pisa, the
                    Florentines sought the assistance of Robert, king of Naples, the son of Charles
                    of Valois; but soon becoming jealous of the foreign power they had themselves
                    invited, they created a new officer of justice, called the Bargello or head of
                    police, who exercised his authority with so much cruelty that for a few months
                    Florence was subjected to a reign of terror. During another war with Lucca, the
                    Florentines again applied to Robert of Naples, who sent them his son, the duke
                    of Calabria. He was accompanied by Walter de Brienne, duke of Athens, who,
                    acting as lieutenant for the young prince, set aside the government of the
                    priors, and ruled Florence with a rod of iron. The people could not long endure
                    his acts of savage cruelty, and drove him from their city, after having put his
                    minions to death in a manner so barbarous as to rival the deeds of the tyrant
                    they had expelled. Tumults, a famine, and lastly the plague, devastated the
                    land; and as a culmination of disasters, the mercenary troops employed
                    everywhere in Italy roamed over the country and spread desolation wherever they
                    came.</p>
                <p>In 1378 occurred the famous rebellion of the Ciompi (Wooden Shoes), in which the
                    artisans of Florence, led by a wool-carder, Michele di Lando, gained possession
                    of the Palazzo Vecchio, aud turned out the signory. Lando proved himself a man
                    of sense and courage; he finally quelled the riot in which he had been engaged
                    but had not roused, and restored the authority of the government. It was about
                    this period that Salvestro de’ Medici, Bettino Ricasoli, and Gino Capponi were
                    among the leading men of the republic. From the riot of the Ciompi to the year
                    1390 Florence enjoyed the rare blessing of peace. This was broken by the
                    ambitious thirst for universal dominion of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, lord of
                    Milan, and Florence owed her preservation to her general, Sir John Hawkwood, an
                    Essex tailor, who had joined the mercenary bands on the Continent, and earned
                    himself wealth and celebrity as one of the greatest commanders of the age. The
                    death of Gian Galeazzo in 1402 terminated the war. In 1406 the Florentines
                    gained possession of their ancient rival Pisa after a long and cruel siege. The
                    fall of Pisa put an end to the power of the Ghibelline or feudal party in
                    Tuscany. In 1414, at the council of Constance, Pope John XXIII. was deposed, and
                    came to reside in Florence, where his monument in the baptistry is one of the
                    finest works of Donatello.</p>
                <p>The wealth of the city was meantime always increasing, and manufactures of silk
                    and woollen articles flourished within her walls. The richest of her citizens,
                    Giovanni de’ Medici, was chosen gonfalonier in 1426, but the popularity of this
                    family had begun to excite the apprehension of all true patriots. When Giovanni
                    introduced the “catasta,” or inquiry into the possessions of every citizen, with
                    a view to taxation according to their means—a measure favourably viewed by the
                    lower orders,—it raised loud opposition on the part of the wealthy; for, however
                    great their riches, none could compete with the Medici, and they saw in the
                    “catasta” another stepping stone to raise their rival to greater power and
                    authority. At Giovanni’s death his popularity descended to his eldest son
                    Cosimo, who lived to be called (however undeservedly) the father of his country.
                    From him.descended Lorenzo the Magnificent, Popes Leo X. and Clement VII.,
                    Catharine de’ Medici queen of Henry II. of France, and Alexander, the first duke
                    of Florence. From Giovanni’s younger son Lorenzo descended the grand-dukes from
                    Cosimo I. to Gian Gastone. Cosimo de’ Medici and Rinaldo dei Albizzi represented
                    the two great families who aspired to rule Florence. The Albizzi for a short
                    time gained the ascendency, and Cosimo was sent into exile. Before a year he was
                    recalled, and was created gonfalonier, and the Albizzi were banished.</p>
                <p>In 1441 an oecumenical council was held in Florence by Pope Eugenius IV., to
                    settle the claims of the Latin and Greek Churches, when learned men arrived from
                    the East, and introduced the study of Greek classical authors. Neri Capponi
                    alone ventured to oppose the ambition of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n346/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0346-0335"/> the Medici, and it was said of him that, if
                    Cosimo was the wealthiest man, Neri was the wisest in Florence; but the death of
                    Capponi in 1457 left the Medici without a rival. The death of Cosimo’s favourite
                    son Giovanni in 1463 cast a gloom over the few remaining months of his own life,
                    for his surviving son Pietro was a man enfeebled by disease. At the death of
                    Pietro in 1469, his young son Lorenzo relates how the principal men of the city
                    and of the state came to their house to condole with them on their loss, and to
                    encourage him to take on himself the care of the city and government, as his
                    grandfather and father had done. In 1470 Lorenzo was created syndic, and the
                    next year he entertained with the utmost magnificence Galeazzo Sforza, duke of
                    Milan. In 1472 Volterra was added to the Florentine dominions. Such horrible
                    atro cities were committed during the siege and sack of this city, that the
                    crime lay heavy on Lorenzo’s conscience in his dying hour. In the Pazzi
                    conspiracy of 1478 Lorenzo narrowly escaped with his life, whilst his brother
                    Giovanni was murdered before the altar of the cathedral. The conspirators were
                    put to death with great barbarity, and Lorenzo’s popularity rose higher than
                    ever. Surrounded by men of genius and learning whom his wealth could buy, or the
                    charms of his manners and accomplishments could attract, Lorenzo added to the
                    honours of his native city by reviving Greek taste and culture.</p>
                <p>The appearance of Girolamo Savonarola, or the “Frate,” as he was called in
                    Florence, awoke a new spirit. His denunciation of the immoral lives of the
                    citizens, and of books and works of art which tended to lower rather than exalt
                    human nature, including the writings of Lorenzo himself, were listened to by
                    crowded audiences. Such was his influence that even Lorenzo, when on his
                    death-bed in 1492, sent for the “Frate” to receive his confession, and grant him
                    absolution. That absolution Savonarola refused, unless Lorenzo repented of his
                    usurpations, and promised to restore a free government to Florence; but to this
                    Lorenzo would not consent, and he died unshriven. The dawn of art and literature
                    in the 13th century had attained its greatest brilliancy in the 14th and 15th.
                    Before the Medici had risen to power, the city had been embellished by the works
                    of Andrea Orcagna, Taddeo Gaddi, Fra Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Andrea
                    Castagno, Donatello, and Desiderio di Settignano; Ghiberti had designed his
                    Gates of Paradise for the baptistry; Brunelleschi had added a cupola to the
                    cathedral; and Maso Finiguerra had led by his niello work to the discovery of
                    copperplate engraving. It was in the 15th century that Bernardo Cennini
                    introduced the art of printing into Florence. Filippino Lippi, Fra Bartolommeo
                    and his friend Mariotto Albertinelli, Baccio d’Agnolo, Baldovinetti, Sandro
                    Botticelli, the Ghirlandai, the Peselli, Benedetto da Rovezz∣ιno and Benedetto
                    da Majano, Mino da Fiesole, Andrea Verocchio, and Leonardo da Vinci were the
                    precursors, and some of them the contemporaries, of Michelangelo, the glory of
                    his fellow citizens. With Andrea del Sarto and Raphael—who, though from Urbino,
                    painted some of his finest works in Florence— painting reached its highest
                    perfection. Among the men of literature were Boccaccio, Guicciardini,
                    Macchiavelli, Poliziano, Marsilio Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola. Lorenzo’s
                    eldest son Piero succeeded to his honours; his second son Giovanni, already a
                    cardinal, became afterwards Leo X., and his youngest son Giuliano, duke of
                    Nemours, perhaps the only virtuous man among the Medici, died young.</p>

                    Moro lord of Milan, into Italy, Piero de’ Medici, to conciliate the goodwill of
                    the French king, visited him in his camp, and offered to yield the fortresses of
                    Tuscany into his hands. On Piero’s return to Florence he found himself condemned
                    as a traitor, and had to escape from the city, followed by the rest of his
                    family. Charles VIII. entered Florence in 1494, intending to restore the Medici,
                    but the signory refused to comply with his request, and when the king, affecting
                    to play the part of a conqueror in a vanquished city, dictated terms which he
                    expected the Florentines to accept, Piero Capponi, one of that family of staunch
                    republicans, tore the obnoxious paper in his presence. Charles angrily declared
                    he would summon his troops by the call of the trumpet. “And we,” replied
                    Capponi, “will sound our bells”—the old war signal of the Florentines. Charles
                    was forced to yield, but still lingered in Florence, until Savonarola, whose
                    courage and sacred character appear to have overawed even this proud monarch,
                    went to him and bade him begone. The influence of the “Frate” daily increased as
                    well as the number of his followers; and eager to restore a free constitution to
                    Florence, which he believed could only exist with virtue in her citizens, he
                    persuaded the signory to call a grand council or parliament of the people.
                    Charles VIII. had restored independence to Pisa, but the Florentines were eager
                    to recover possession of that city, and since Pisa was the ally of Pope
                    Alexander VI., the Borgia of infamous memory, and the greatest enemy of
                    Savonarola, the “Frate” sanctioned the act. Piero Capponi perished during the
                    course of this short war, and the Medici made a fresh attempt to re-enter
                    Florence. The tide of popular favour was turning against Savonarola; step by
                    step he lost ground with the people, till after a violent tumultuary attack on
                    his convent of St Mark in 1498, he was dragged to prison, torture, and
                    execution.</p>
                <p>Early in the 16th century Louis XII. of France having entered Italy to claim the
                    duchy of Milan, by right of his grandmother Valentina, a Milanese princess, Pope
                    Julius IL, who had placed himself at the head of the league to drive him from
                    the country, insisted on the Florentines joining the enemies of the French king
                    and recalling the Medici. Piero had met his death by accidental drowning, but
                    his son Lorenzo, duke of Urbino, returned to Florence, and after a short life of
                    vicious indulgence, died in 1519, leaving an infant daughter, Catharine,
                    afterwards married to Henry II. of France. Two illegitimate scions of the
                    family, Ippolito and Alexander, now occupied the Medici palace in Florence.
                    Clement VII., also a Medici, who had succeeded Pope Julius, was at this time
                    besieged in his castle of St Angelo by the Constable Bourbon, general of the
                    emperor Charles V.; and in the year 1527 Rome was taken and sacked, to the
                    consternation of all Europe, whilst the party in Florence hostile to the Medici
                    alone perceived a gleam of hope in the destruction of a Medicean pope. Niccolo
                    Capponi, a weak though amiable man, was the leader of this party, and Clarice,
                    the sister of Lorenzo of Urbino and wife of Filippo Strozzi, one of the most
                    unprincipled of Florentine citizens, appealed to Niccolo for aid to drive out of
                    Florence the two youths Ippolito and Alexander, whom she refused to accept as
                    belonging to her family. Meantime Clement had been reconciled to the emperor,
                    and both approached Florence with a large army. After enduring all the
                    protracted sufferings of a siege, and after the gallant but vain attempts of the
                    patriot Feruccio to relieve his fellow citizens, Florence fell by treachery into
                    the hands of the enemy; the Medici entered the.city in triumph, and Alexander
                    was created its duke (1530). Ippolito died by poison, administered, it is
                    supposed, by his cousin Alexander, who, after a reign rendered detestable by his
                    vices, was murdered in his bed by his cousin Lorenzino, in 1537. Cosimo de’
                    Medici, son of Giovanni delle Bande Nere, a brave soldier and captain of
                    mercenary troops, and descended from Lorenzo the brother of Cosimo the “father
                    of his country,” succeeded to the dukedom.</p>

                <p>The conquest of Siena added to his wealth and power; and in 1569 the pope created
                    him grand-duke of Tuscany. Though accused of the murder of two of his sons and
                    of a daughter, Cosimo had the force of character and ability to command fear, if
                    not respect, from the people over whom he tyrannized. He was a patron of art,
                    and this hereditary taste was continued in his son the grand-duke Francis I.
                    (1575).</p>
                <p>The school of art founded by Michelangelo had degenerated into feeble
                    exaggerations, without the genius of the great master. Giovanni Bologna and
                    Benvenuto Cellini alone struck out new and original paths; and the elegance and
                    grace of their works in bronze and marble still adorn the public places of
                    Florence, eclipsing the clumsy productions of their contemporaries. Francis was
                    married first to Joanna of Austria, and secondly to a beautiful Venetian lady,
                    Bianca Capello, whose first husband was assassinated to make way for the
                    grand-duke. Francis and Bianca died on the same day, 1587, not without suspicion
                    of having been poisoned by his brother and successor Ferdinand, who resigned a
                    cardinal’s hat for the dukedom, and married Princess Christina of Lorraine. A
                    double alliance was formed with France by the union in marriage of his niece
                    Alarie de’ Medici, daughter of Francis, with King Henry IV. Cosimo II. succeeded
                    Ferdinand in 1609. The day of his accession Galileo Galilei discovered the
                    satellites of Jupiter, which, in compliment to the young sovereign, he named
                    “Stelle Medicei.” See <hi rend="smallcaps">Galileo.</hi></p>
                <p>Ferdinand II. was still a child when he ascended the throne in 1621. He married
                    Vittoria della Rovere, heiress of Urbino; and though her lands were claimed by
                    the church, she brought a rich dowry to Florence. Ferdinand and his brother
                    Cardinal Leopold added greatly to the art treasures in the galleries, ajιd
                    founded academies of art and science. Cosimo III., who succeeded in 1670, was a
                    narrowminded bigot, whose marriage with a gay young princess of the court of
                    Louis XIV. of France ended in separation, ∏e died in 1713, leaving one son, Gian
                    Gastone, whose mild character, aversion to the punishment of death, and
                    abolition of oppressive taxes made him popular with his subjects. Commerce,
                    industry, and agriculture flourished during the reign of this last of the
                    Medici. At his death in 1737 he left no male heirs to the throne. Tuscany had
                    been already assigned by a European agreement—the celebrated Pragmatic
                    Sanction—to Francis duke of Lorraine in compensation for his duchy, which had
                    been annexed to France. In 1753 an edict gave Tuscany to the second son of
                    Francis and the empress Maria Theresa; and two years later, on the death of his
                    father, Pietro Leopoldo of Austria arrived in Florence to take possession of the
                    throne. His short reign marked a new era of progress and reform. The Inquisition
                    was abolished, privileges set aside, and plans proposed for draining and
                    colonizing the Maremma. In 1790 Leopold was called to Vienna to succeed his
                    brother Joseph II. as emperor, and left his younger son Ferdinand III.
                    grand-duke of Tuscany. By an article of the Pragmatic Sanction, Tuscany had been
                    declared a separate and independent sovereignty; therefore, when, after the
                    outburst of the French Revolution, the emperor Francis II. claimed the
                    assistance of a Tuscan army to restore the Bourbons in France, the great
                    minister Fossombroni refused, declaring that Tuscany was on terms of peace and
                    amity with the French republic. But in 1796 Ferdinand, yielding to the
                    importunity of the court at Vienna, joined in the war against France, and two
                    years later Florence was occupied by a French army. The first consul, Napoleon
                    Bonaparte, conquered Tuscany, and whilst Ferdinand renounced his rights on
                    condition of a compensation in Germany, one of the Bourbons of Parma was placed
                    on his throne as king of Etruria. Tuscany was annexed to the French empire in
                    1808, but in 1809 the grand-duchy was restored in favour of Eliza Bonaparte
                    Bacciochi, sister of the emperor Napoleon.</p>
                <p>Her reign lasted only five years, and after Napoleon had been exiled to Elba,
                    Ferdinand resumed his sovereignty. On this occasion an Austrian, Prince
                    Rospigliosi, was sent to Florence to announce his arrival, and in his
                    proclamation he declared Tuscany to be an inheritance and patrimony of the
                    imperial house of Austria. The vain attempt of Lombardy in 1820 to shake off the
                    Austrian yoke, an attempt in which the crown prince of Piedmont, Carlo Alberto,
                    was secretly implicated, ended in the incarceration of some of the noblest
                    Italian patriots in Austrian fortresses for a period of from 16 to 20 years. It
                    was vain for Fossombroni to protest, and declare that the Tuscan Government did
                    not require Austrian soldiers to play the masters; Austrian soldiers arrived to
                    occupy Tuscany as well as the other Italian states, and the aulic counsellor
                    Menz wrote to Prince Metternich that “the Tuscan Government, led to reflect on
                    its dangers, had assumed a firmer attitude, and constituted a more active and
                    vigilant police, and, at all events, the respect inspired by Austrian bayonets
                    placed at the gates of Tuscany were sufficient to dispel revolutionary ideas.”
                    Ferdinand died in 1833, and was succeeded by his son Leopold IL, who had married
                    a Neapolitan princess. Alarmed by the revolutionary movements of 1847, Leopold,
                    like other Italian princes, granted his people a constitution, but when they
                    further demanded to be led against the Austrians, to assist in driving the
                    foreigner from Italy, he reluctantly permitted the Tuscan army, chiefly
                    consisting of young volunteers, to depart. The enthusiastic youths who fought
                    for the independence of their country displayed unwonted valour at Curtalone and
                    Montanara; but the grand-duke signified his displeasure by withdrawing titles
                    and pensions from even the surgeons who attended the wounded on the field of
                    battle. Among the liberals in Florence who had long been seeking an opportunity
                    to shake off foreign interference in the government of their country, were men
                    of the greatest moderation and virtue,— Baron Bettino Ricasoli, the Marchese
                    Cosimo Ridolfi, the poets Niccolini and Giusti, Salvagnoli, the Marchese Neri
                    Corsini, and the Marchese Gino Capponi, the last of that family illustrious for
                    virtue, for genius, and for patriotism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the principles of his family, or had not courage to place himself at the head of
                    the distinguished men who coincided with the view of the Piedmontese minister
                    Cavour, invited Austrian troops in 1850 again to occupy his dominions, and
                    though Leopold affected to submit to necessity, the Austrian general declared he
                    would not have come uninvited. This occupation lasted six years, during which
                    time the power of life and death of Tuscan subjects was delivered into the hands
                    of the Austrian commanders. When Victor Emmanuel, king of Piedmont and Sardinia,
                    with the assistance of France, made war against Austria for the independence of
                    Italy in 1859, a vain hope was still entertained that Leopold would have
                    consented to unite his army with that of Piedmont; but the proclamation of war
                    went forth without a sign from Tuscany. On the 27th April 1859 the Tuscan troops
                    unanimously declared their intention to throw down their arms unless they were
                    allowed to join the War of Independence. The liberals insisted on the abdication
                    of Leopold in favour of his son, and on an offensive and defensive alliance with
                    Piedmont. Leopold declined these proposals, and quitted Florence with his
                    family, amidst the silence of the assembled multitudes, never to return.</p>
