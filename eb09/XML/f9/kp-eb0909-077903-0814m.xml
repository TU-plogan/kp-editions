                    discovered by Tasman in 1643. It lies in the South Pacific, on the S.W. limits
                    of the area occupied by the Polynesian race, about 350 miles S.S.W. from Samoa,
                    and 250 E.S.E. from Fiji. The long chain of islands, numbering about 150, though
                    with a collective area hardly exceeding 400 square miles, extends from 18° 5' to
                    22 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> 29' S. lat., and 173° 52' to 176° 10' W.
                    long., and is broken into three groups, viz., the Tonga to the S., Habai (which
                    again is divided into three clusters) in the centre, and Haafulahao or Vavau, to
                    the N. Along the W. side of the N. half of this chain is a line of volcanic
                    action, where the islands (of which three are active volcanoes) are high and
                    wooded, one peak rising over 5000 feet. But the great majority of the islands
                    are level, averaging 40 feet high, with hills rising to 600 feet; their sides
                    are generally steep; they are formed of coral limestone, in some places a
                    compact white rock, and in Vavau occasionally crystalline, and containing
                    stalactitic caves of great beauty. The surface is covered, which is unusual in
                    coral islands, with a deep rich mould, mixed towards the sea with sand, and
                    having a substratum of red or blue clay. The soil is thus very productive,
                    although water is scarce and bad. Running streams are very rare, but streams and
                    basins of clear water occur in the limestone rock below the surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reefs.—</hi> Barrier reefs are rare; fringing reefs are
                    numerous, except on the E. side, which is nearly free, and there are many small
                    isolated reefs and volcanic banks among the islands. If the reefs impede
                    navigation they form some good harbours. The best is on the S.W. side of Vavau;
                    another is on the N. of Tonga at Bangaimotu.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Islands.</hi> — The most considerable island is <hi
                    rend="italic">Tonga,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tonga-tabu</hi> (the Sacred
                    Tonga), in the S. group, about 21 by 12 miles, and 128 square miles in area,
                    which contains the capital, Nukualofa. The vegetation is rich and beautiful, but
                    the scenery tame, the land seldom rising above 60 feet. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eoa,</hi> 9 miles to the S.E. and nearly 12 by 5 miles, is 600 feet high, and
                    much more picturesque, diversified by rocks and woods. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vavau,</hi> in the N. group, is next to Tonga in size, 42 miles in
                    circumference and 300 feet high. Next to these come <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nomuka</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lefuka</hi> in the Habai group, about 19
                    miles in circumference; <hi rend="italic">Tofua,</hi> 2846 feet. <hi
                    rend="italic">Late,</hi> 1820 feet, and <hi rend="italic">Kao,</hi> 5080 feet
                    high, which are volcanic, and smaller. Vavau and the neighbouring islands are
                    higher and more varied in contour than those to the S. The islands of the
                    central group are numerous and very fertile. Earthquakes are frequent; from 1845
                    to 1857 volcanic eruptions were very violent, and islands once fertile were
                    devastated and nearly destroyed. A new island rose from the sea, and was at once
                    named “Wesley,” but disappeared again.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is enervating; it is damp, with
                    heavy dews and frequent alternations of temperature, which averages 75°-77° F.,
                    though considerably higher in Vavau. Cool S.E. trade winds blow, sometimes with
                    great violence, from April to December. During the rest of the year the winds
                    blow from W.N. W. and N., with rain and occasional destructive hurricanes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fl&lt;∕τa.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The vegetation is
                    similar to that of Fiji, but more definitely Indo-Malayan in character; it
                    embraces all the plants of the groups to the E., with many that are absent
                    there. Ferns abound, some of them peculiar, and tree ferns on the higher
                    islands. There are 4 palms, among them the <hi rend="italic">Kentia</hi> of
                    Fiji. For the rest, Gramineae, Rubiaceae, Ficoideae, Myrtaceae, Euphorbiae,
                    Malvaceae, and Leguminosae predominate. All the usual fruit trees and cultivated
                    plants of the Pacific are found. The most valuable timber trees are the tamanu
                    <hi rend="italic">{Calophyllum</hi><hi rend="italic">Bur-</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> The only indigenous land mammalia are a small rat,
                    and a few curious species of bats. The dog and the pig were no doubt introduced
                    by man. Sheep and cattle imported of late years by Europeans do not multiply,
                    owing to insufficient space and pasture. Of birds some 30 kinds are known, an
                    owl being the only bird of prey; parrots, pigeons, kingfishers, honey-suckers,
                    rails, ducks, and other water birds are numerous. There are snakes and small
                    lizards, but no frogs or toads. Of insects there are relatively few kinds; but
                    ants, beetles, and musquitoes abound. The fishes, of an Indo-Malay type, are
                    varied and numerous. Turtle and sea-snakes abound, as do mollusca, of which a
                    few are peculiar, and zoophytes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">People.—</hi> The inhabitants are, intellectually, perhaps the
                    most advanced of the Polynesian race, and exercise an influence over distant
                    neighbours, especially in Fiji, quite out of proportion to their numbers, which
                    do not exceed 20,000 or 25,000. Their conquests have extended as far as Niue, or
                    Savage Island, 200 miles to the E., and to various other islands to the N. In
                    Cook’s time Poulaho, the principal chief, considered Samoa to be within his
                    dominions. This pre-eminence may perhaps be due to an early infusion of Fijian
                    blood: Pritchard <hi rend="italic">{Polynesian Reminiscences)</hi> observed such
                    crosses to be always more vigorous than the pure races in these islands; and
                    this influence seems also traceable in the Tongan dialect, and appears to have
                    been partially transmitted thence to the Samoan. Various customs, traditions,
                    and names of places point to a former relation with Fiji, but Fijian influence
                    in Tonga is insignificant compared with that of Tonga in Fiji (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fiji).</hi> Their prior conversion to Christianity gave the
                    people material as well as moral advantages over their neighbours, and King
                    George, a very remarkable man, and far in advance of his people, has, during a
                    long reign, made the most of these.</p>
                <p>Until recently there were, as in Japan, two sovereigns; the higher of these,
                    called Tui Tonga (Chief of Tonga), was greatly reverenced, but for at least the
                    last 200 years has enjoyed little power. The real ruler, and the chief officers
                    of the state, were members of the Toubo family, from which also the wife of the
                    Tui Tonga was always chosen, whose descendants through the female line had,
                    under the title of “tamaha,” special honours and privileges, recalling the
                    “vasu” of Fiji.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    similar institution (“tamasa”) exists at Samoa.</p></note> Below these came the
                    Eiki or chiefs, and next to them the class called Matabulé. These were the
                    hereditary counsellors and companions of the chiefs, and conveyed to the people
                    the decisions formed at their assemblies. They also directed the national
                    ceremonies, and preserved the popular traditions. During the long civil wars in
                    the early part of this century, the institution of Tui Tonga lapsed, and various
                    chiefs became independent, but they were gradually subdued, and the whole group
                    united by King George. He commuted for a money payment the service due from the
                    common people to their chiefs, whom he assembles in a sort of parliament, having
                    in 1862 established a “constitutional government” Taxation is heavy: a poll tax
                    of 4 dollars is levied and strictly enforced.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0815-0780"/>
                <p>The limited extent and resources of the islands tend to minimize foreign
                    settlement and interference, but missionary influence is, directly or
                    indirectly, supreme. The régime is accordingly somewhat strained and severe, and
                    restless spirits have to seek a vent for their energies in Fiji or elsewhere.
                    Crime, however, is infrequent, and morality, always above the Polynesian
                    average, is improving; nearly every one can read, and there is a general
                    appearance of order and comfort. The people have strict notions of etiquette and
                    gradations of rank; their natural independence and self-esteem is perhaps
                    fostered by their frequent employment,as the teachers of others, for which,
                    however, they show much aptitude; otherwise they are amiable and (especially in
                    the upper ranks) courteous. They are arrogant, lively, inquisitive, and inclined
                    to steal,—their attacks, in earlier days, on Europeans, when not caused by
                    misunderstandings, being due probably to their desire to obtain property which
                    to them was of immense value. They are brave and not devoid of energy, though
                    the soft climate and the abundance of food are against sustained exertion or
                    great industrial progress. They value children, and seldom practise infanticide,
                    and cannibalism only in exceptional cases. Their women are kindly treated, and
                    only do the lighter work. Agriculture, which is well understood, is the chief
                    industry. They are bold and skilful sailors and fishermen; other trades, as boat
                    and house building, carving, cooking, net and mat making, are usually
                    hereditary. Their houses are slightly built, but the surrounding ground and
                    roads are laid out with great care and taste.</p>
                <p>There are some ancient stone remains here, as in the Caroline Islands, burial
                    places (feitoka) built with great blocks, and a remarkable monument consisting
                    of two large blocks with a transverse one, containing a circular basin in the
                    centre.</p>
                <p>The principal diseases are leprosy and elephantiasis, tona (the thoko of Fiji),
                    influenza, ulcers, scrofula, consumption, and ophthalmia. Owing to the absence
                    of swamps, fever of a severe type is rare.</p>
                <p>The chief articles of export are cocoa-nut oil and copra; a little sugar, cotton,
                    and coffee, the cultivation of which is encouraged by the king; and fresh
                    provisions for ships, as yams, pigs, and poultry. The chief imports are cloth,
                    cotton prints, hardware, mirrors, &lt;fcc,, but these are not on the increase.
                    Whale fishing (once extensive) is still carried on among the islands by European
                    and American vessels.</p>
