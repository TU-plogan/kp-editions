                <p><label type="entry">FLEA</label>, an Anglo-Saxon name, probably derived from
                    fleogan,” to fly, typically applied to <hi rend="italic">Pulex irritans,</hi> a
                    blood-sucking insect-parasite of man and other mammal =≈, remarkable for its
                    powers of leaping, and unfortunately too well known, even in our own temperate
                    climate. Its position in classification has long been somewhat undecided; a
                    separate order was erected for it and its allies under the various names of <hi
                    rend="italic">Suctoria, Siphonaptera, Ropfhoteira,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphaniptera,</hi> by De Geer, Latreille, Clairville, and Kirby respectively;
                    and it is included in the <hi rend="italic">Aptera</hi> of Lamarck, MacLeay, and
                    others, and in the <hi rend="italic">Rlιyngota</hi> of Fabricius. Various
                    affinities have also been attributed to the group, which has been supposed to
                    have relations with the <hi rend="italic">IIymenoptera,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemfiptera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anoplura,</hi> and even with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> (beetles). As regards the latter order, it is
                    noteworthy that a recently discovered allied group, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Platypsyllidae,</hi> founded upon a parasite on the beaver (and considered as a
                    separate order by Westwood, under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Achreioptera'),</hi> has been with considerable show of reason referred to the
                    beetles by so sound an entomologist as Dr Leconte. As regards the flea, however,
                    it is now generally accepted that its true affinities are with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diptera</hi> or two-winged flies, as suggested by Lamarck and
                    Strauss Durckheim. In that order, it is by some held to occupy, as a family <hi
                    rend="italic">PuUcidae</hi> (with the <hi rend="italic">Platypsyllidai),</hi>
                    the position of a sub-order, at the end, under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aplιaniptera</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Diptera,</hi> vol. vii. p. 2δ6);
                    but by others it is placed <pb break="no"

                    at the head of the tribo <hi rend="italic">Encephala</hi> of the Nematocerous
                    section of the great division <hi rend="italic">Orthorhapha.</hi> The community
                    of parasitic habits with the <hi rend="italic">Ilippoboscidae</hi> (forest-flies
                    and sheep-ticks) is to a certain extent the reason for the former position; but
                    the earlier transformations seem to indicate a stronger relationship with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Encephala.</hi> The general characters have been given under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Diptera;</hi> but the structure of the mouth of the perfect
                    insect may be specified. The labrum is obsolete; the mandibles are represented
                    by two flat and long processes, strengthened by a mid rib, and having very
                    finely toothed edges, and uniting with the slender central lingua to form a
                    puncturing lancet. When not in use, this is protected by the labial palpi, which
                    form a sort of tube. The maxillae are small leathery plates, and their palpi,
                    which are four-jointed and large, have been mistaken for antenuae. The power of
                    leaping, as well known, is very great; but there is no apparent development of
                    the hind femora to account for it (as in many jumping beetles), although the
                    posterior legs are saltatorial. The great muscular power of fleas has been long
                    turned to account by public exhibitors in all countries, who have, under the
                    pretence of taming or educating these miuute creatures, made use of various
                    contrivances to render the natural efforts of the insect to escape assume the
                    appearance of trained action. An account of the methods employed will be found
                    in the <hi rend="italic">American Naturalist,</hi> vol. xî. p. 7, from the pen
                    of Mr W. H. Dall. In some cases the steady carriage of the flea is to be traced
                    to fracture of its jumping legs. The female flea lays a few oblong white eggs,
                    in dirty places on floors frequented by domestic animals. The larvae, before
                    hatching, have a frontal point, used in breaking the shell of the egg. They are
                    long and worm-like, without feet, but with two small hooks at the tail, and
                    short antennae and mouth organs at the head. They are very active, and
                    apparently feed upon animal substances, forming, when full grown, a silky
                    cocoon. Many species are known, parasitic upon various animals aud birds. They
                    have been recorded as infesting the inside of rabbits’ ears, and the neck of a
                    fowl, from hedgehog, marmot, cat, dog, bat, squirrel, dormouse, ferret, weasel,
                    hare, rabbit, rat, mouse, field-mouse, shrew, moor-hen, jackdaw, thrush,
                    missel-thrush, blackbird, jay, bullfinch, chaffinch, yellow-hammer, pipit,
                    blackcap, whitethroat, skylark, willow-wren, long-tailed titmouse, siskin,
                    stock-dove, woodpigeon, common pigeon, starling, swallow, &amp;c. (though it is
                    by no means certain that these are all necessarily of distinct specific value);
                    and a species has been described from the common fowl in Ceylon. A large species
                    is often found in sandy pits, near the openings of the nests of sand-martins,
                    and a very large one sometimes occurs in wet and marshy places, probably living
                    upon the mole. For the latter parasite, and others in which the antennae exhibit
                    certain supposed peculiarities, a separate genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceratopsyllus,</hi> has been proposed. In another flea, also found on the mole,
                    no trace of eyes could be found, even under a high power. A very large species
                    has been found on the Australian porcupine iu Tasmania; and Kirby, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fauna Boreali-Americana,</hi> described as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pulex</hi><hi rend="italic">gigas</hi> a flea two lines long, which he believed
                    to be the largest known. This was taken in 65° N. lat. Westwood has recorded 17
                    British species; and oddly enough the same number are noted from the Netherlands
                    by Ritsema. Any notice of these parasites would be incomplete without a
                    reference to the “jigger,” “chigoe,” “bicho de pé,” “nigua,” or “earth-flea,”—
                    <hi rend="italic">Dermatophilus, Sarcopsyllus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhynchoprion penetrans,</hi> so well known as a burrower into the naked feet of
                    men, in sandy localities in the West Indies and South America. So great is this
                    pest, that serious trouble has been occasioned by it even to military
                    expeditions in South America; and the French army in Mexico was much troubled by
                    it. The entry is effected usually under the nail, by the impregnated female,
                    which thereupon becomes enormously distended with an immense number of eggs.
                    Inflammation and ulceration follow this attack, and unless great care is taken
                    in extracting the insect, serious illness and even death result. A good plate of
                    the metamorphoses of this species is given in the volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">American Naturalist</hi> above quoted, p. 754. For an account of
                    the medical aspects, see Dr Laboulbène’s article on the.“Chique,” in the <hi
