                    rend="italic">fanie,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">fonts),</hi> the vessel used in
                    churches to hold the water for Christian baptism. The modes of administering
                    baptism have varied at different periods of the existence of the Christian
                    churches, causing corresponding changes in the forms and auxiliaries of the
                    receptacle of the consecrated water. There is reason to believe that in the
                    times of the apostles and early missionaries the rite was administered by
                    sprinkling, as whole multitudes of people, and even whole kingdoms were baptized
                    in one day. But a very general method in early times was no doubt that of total
                    immersion, the catechumens being received by the priest in the water. As
                    Christianity became more general of course fewer adults would present themselves
                    for baptism, and consequently the size of the vessel would not need to be beyond
                    what would allow of the total immersion of an infant. In fact down to the time
                    of the Reformation fonts continued to be made quite large enough to allow of the
                    total immersion of infants, and there is little doubt that down to that date the
                    method was occasionally employed. Baptism by infusion and by aspersion followed
                    this method, though they were no doubt used concurrently, and in a sense
                    combined, for in certain representations of the rite in illuminations and
                    stained glass the infant is represented as seated naked in the font, while from
                    a vessel the priest pours the water upon the head. Originally used only for sick
                    or infirm persons, the method of baptism by infusion became gradually the
                    established practice, and all doubts as to its validity were removed by appeal
                    to papal and other high authority.</p>
                <p>In early times the font was placed in the baptistery, a structure often entirely
                    separate from the body of the church, of which the celebrated Baptistery at
                    Florence is the finest example. In these the well or basin for containing the
                    water was usually reached by descending steps. The baptisteries were round,
                    square, octagonal, or crosslike in form, and in design bear the impress of the
                    period to which they belong. Few are found of late date, and the only existing
                    structure at all recalling them in English churches is found at Luton in
                    Bedfordshire. The font at Luton belongs to the Decorated style of English art,
                    and is inclosed in an octagonal structure of freestone, consisting of eight
                    pillars about 25 feet in height, supporting a canopy. The space around the font
                    is large enough to hold comfortably half a dozen people. At the top of the
                    canopy is a vessel for containing the consecrated water, which when required was
                    let down into the font by means of a pipe. The space around the font in the
                    ancient baptisteries was of size to admit several catechumens at the same time;
                    and not only was the whole rite of baptism performed within them, but that of
                    the holy eucharist likewise, and even the baptism of infants. As baptism was
                    administered in early times by bishops only, baptisteries were rare except at
                    the principal church of the diocese. Easter, Whitsuntide, and Epiphany were the
                    principal seasons of its administration. In the 9th century fonts became general
                    in all churches, and baptism was performed at all times by priests of all
                    ranks.</p>
                <p>Of fonts still in existence few are older than the 11th century. The material in
                    the Western Church was generally stone, and the outsides and accessories are
                    frequently ornamented with some of the loveliest and most characteristic of the
                    national arts of the Middle Ages. In the Eastern Church it was different. “The
                    font, <hi rend="italic">κoλvpβηθρaf</hi> says Neale <hi rend="italic">(Eastern
                    Church,</hi> i. 214), “in the Eastern Church is a far less conspicuous object
                    than it is in the west. Baptism by immersion has been retained; but the font
                    seldom or never possessed any beauty. The material is usually either metal or
                    wood. In Russia the columbethra is movable, and only brought out when wanted.”
                    The <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0375-0362"/> proper material for fonts in the Western Church
                    was hard stone, as marble, porphyry, or granite. Fonts of bronze and lead are,
                    however, sometimes found, and the basins of many stone fonts were lined with
                    lead to prevent the absorption of the water by the porous stone. A font shaped
                    from one block of oak is in the church at Evenechtyd, Denbighshire. Continental
                    fonts bear distinctly the impress of the time to which they belong. They appear
                    very early, ornamented with bas-reliefs, columns, and arches, as well as with
                    the characteristic details of the ornamentation of their period. Representations
                    of St John the Baptist are very common. At Pont-à-Mousson on the Moselle, one
                    bears bas-reliefs of that saint preaching in the wilderness, and of the baptism
                    of Christ, executed with that simple sincerity which is more valuable than the
                    highest refinement and finish in design and execution. In the 11th and 12th
                    centuries cup-shaped and cylindrical forms were most common, either as simple
                    cylinders and truncated cones or supported by one or more pillars. Frequently
                    the basin is hollowed out of one large square or oblong slab, supported at the
                    centre by a broad column, with auxiliary columns at the corners, all bearing the
                    mouldings and ornaments characteristic of the period. Caryatids sometimes take
                    the place of the pillars, and sculptured animals and other grotesques of curious
                    design sometimes form the bases. Octagonal forms are not altogether absent from
                    this period, and even hexagons have been occasionally found. Pentagons are very
                    rare. The font, however, at Cabourg, on the north coast of France, is formed of
                    a pentagonal block rather bare of ornamentation, and supported by a group of
                    columns. In the 13th century octagonal forms became more prevalent, although the
                    earlier kinds were not discontinued.</p>
                <p>The very remarkable font at Hildesheim in Hanover belongs to the 13 th century,
                    and is in complete preservation. The basin rests upon the shoulders of four
                    kneeling figures, each bearing a vase from which water is running, emblematic of
                    the four rivers of Paradise. Above is an inscription which explains the
                    connexion of these rivers with the virtues temperance, courage, justice, and
                    prudence. On the sides of the cup itself are bas-reliefs representing the
                    Passage of the Jordan, the Passage of the Red Sea, the Baptism of Christ, and
                    the Virgin and Child. These are separated by columns, by scrolls bearing
                    inscriptions, and by medallions with figurative heads of the abstract virtues
                    named above, and with heads of the prophets. The font has a conical lid,
                    similarly ornamented, and bearing also four bas-reliefs. A cast of this font is
                    now in the South Kensington Museum. At Mayence the font, which belongs to about
                    the year 1328, is of lead, and bears images of the Saviour, the Virgin, St
                    Martin, and the Twelve Apostles.</p>
                <p>Cylindrical fonts become much more rare in the 14th century, the almost universal
                    shape being the octagon. In the l5thand 16th centuries the most elaborate and
                    remarkable of Continental fonts were produced, and some are indeed works of the
                    highest art in sculpture. This superiority is probably more due to increased
                    delicacy and moderation of design, than to any great change in the shape or in
                    the mode of attaching ornament. In early fonts, though the exterior is
                    polygonal, the cup itself is generally circular; but it is characteristic of the
                    15th century fonts that the octagonal form is carried out even in the cup. The
                    fonts at Strasburg, Freiburg, and Basel are examples of this. Few if any English
                    fonts date from before the Conquest, but a great number of Norman fonts, perhaps
                    more than of any other period before the Reformation, are still in existence,
                    and form some of the most characteristic of the architectural remains of the
                    time. In form circular or square, they are generally supported on one or more
                    columns, and are ornamented with bas-reliefs, net-work of columns and arches,
                    grotesques, rude foliage, niches with figures, and many other forms. Good
                    examples of Norman fonts may be seen at Lincoln Cathedral; Iffley, Oxon;
                    Newenden, Kent; Coleshill, Warwickshire; East Meon, Hants; and Castle Frome,
                    Herefordshire. In the Late Norman and Early English periods, octagonal fonts
                    became common, and with few exceptions this form continued in use until the
                    Reformation. Early English fonts are comparatively rare. They bear the moulding,
                    foliage, and toojh ornament in the usual style of the period. A good example of
                    an Early English font is at All Saints, Leicester; others may be seen at St
                    Giles, Oxford, and at Lackford, Suffolk. Fonts of the Decorated period are also
                    less common than those of the precedent Norman or subsequent Perpendicular
                    periods, but are superior in detail and execution to those of any other stage of
                    our art. Fonts of the Perpendicular period are very common, and are generally
                    raised upon steps, which, together with the body of the font, are frequently
                    richly ornamented with panneling. It was also the custom during this period to
                    ornament the font with shields and coats of arms, and other heraldic insignia,
                    as at Herne, Kent.</p>
                <p>Leaden fonts of Norman date are found at Dorchester, Oxon, at Avebury, Wilts, and
                    other places. In Holyrood Chapel there was a brazen font in which the royal
                    children of Scotland were baptized. It was carried off in 1544 by Sir R. Lea,
                    and given by him to the church at St Alban’s, and was afterwards destroyed by
                    the Puritans. A silver font was at Canterbury, which was sometimes brought to
                    Westminster on the occasion of a royal baptism. At Chobham, Surrey, there is a
                    leaden font covered with oaken panels of the 16th century.</p>
                <p>In 1236 it was ordered by Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, that baptismal fonts
                    should be kept under lock and key, as a precaution against sorcery: “Fontes
                    baptismales sub sera clausi teneantur propter sortilegia.” The lids appear at
                    first to have been quite simple and flat. They gradually, however, partook of
                    the ornamentation of the font itself, and are often of pyramidal and conical
                    forms, highly decorated with finials, crockets, mouldings, and grotesques. Some
                    very rich font covers may be seen at Ewelme, Oxon; St Gregory, Sudbury; North
                    Walsingham, Norfolk; Worlingworth, Suffolk. The ordinary position of the font in
                    the church was near the entrance, usually to the left of the south door.</p>
