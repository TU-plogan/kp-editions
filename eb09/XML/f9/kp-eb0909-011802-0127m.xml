                    possessing the object so endowed.</p>
                <p>Religions have not, as yet, been scientifically classified in anything like a
                    final manner. Even the most rigorous of minds would hardly assert that the time
                    has yet arrived for such a classification. But it is possible, even now, to
                    collect roughly those beliefs which, whether still existing among savages and
                    uneducated people of all classes or traceable only among the records of the
                    past, bear a general resemblance to each other, and to give a general name
                    marking that resemblance. Such a name wehave in “fetichism.” The word <hi
                    rend="italic">feitiço,</hi> corresponding to our “fetich,” seems to have been
                    first applied by Portuguese traders on the west coast of Africa to savage
                    objects of worship, which were noticed from their resemblance to the talismans
                    and charms common in Europe, and popular with sailors and travellers above all
                    men.</p>
                <p>In Purchas’s <hi rend="italic">Pilgrimage</hi> (1614) is a chapter translated
                    from a Dutch author relating to the customs and rites of the negroes of Guinea,
                    in which <hi rend="italic">fetissos</hi> and∕⅛weros, or priests, are frequently
                    mentioned. “When the king will sacrifice to <hi rend="italic">fetisso,</hi> he
                    commands the <hi rend="italic">fetissero</hi> to enquire of a tree whereto he
                    ascribeth Divinity, what he will demand and so the author goes on to describe
                    the manner of questioning tlιis remarkable tree. The word fetich was, however,,
                    first used in a general sense by a thoughtful scholar of the 18th century, the
                    president Charles de Brosses, who, in his work <hi rend="italic">Hu Cuite Hes
                    Hieux</hi><hi rend="italic">Fétiches,</hi> strung a number of facts relating to
                    savages on a theory tracing fetichism in Egyptian and classic mythology and in
                    modern life. Comte, the French philosopher, gave great currency to the term by
                    employing it to characterize what he regarded as a great and necessary stage in
                    the theological development of humanity, —a state “plus ou moins prononcé, mais
                    ordinairement tres durable, de pur fétichism, constamment characterisé par
                    l’essor libre et direct de tendance primitive à concevoir tous les corps
                    extérieurs quelconques, naturels ou artificiels; comme animés d’une vie
                    essentiellement analogue à la nôtre, avec des simples differences mutuelles
                    d’intensité” <hi rend="italic">(Philosophie Positive,</hi> V. 30). In England,
                    and at present among anthropologists generally, the word bears a far more
                    restricted meaning than the one here given to it by Comte. It is applied, not to
                    a belief ascribing volition and will to all objects, to all matter, but to a
                    belief in the peculiar power of certain objects, which power may be discovered
                    and tested by experiment, any success, of course, confirming the hypothesis and
                    giving reputation to the chance-chosen object as a great and potent fetich. Sir
                    J. Lubbock defines fetchism “as that stage of religious thought in which man
                    supposes he can force the deities to comply with his desires.” He regards it as
                    the next stage above pure atheism in the religious progress which passes from
                    it, through totemism and shamanism, into idolatry <hi rend="italic">(Origin of
                    Civilization,</hi> 199). Tylor defines it as “the doctrine of spirits embodied
                    in, or attached to, or conveying influence through certain material
                    objects.”</p>
                <p>Both natural and artificial objects are used as fetiches. To the savage nothing
                    seems too great to serve his individual purposes, nothing too insignificant or
                    commonplace to be the centre of his ideas of power and devotion.</p>
                <p>Generally upon beginning an expedition the negro of Guinea chooses the first
                    object that presents itself to his eyes upon issuing forth, and vows to worship
                    that as a god if the work in hand prove successful; if not, it is cast aside as
                    useless or worse. Stones, trees, twigs, pieces of bark, roots, corn, claws of
                    birds, teeth, skins, feathers, human and animal remains of all kinds—anything
                    that may strike the savage as in any way peculiar—are used in this manner; even
                    whole species of animals, rivers, the sea, the moon, and the sun. Articles of
                    costume, tools, weapons, boats, and other articles of human manufacture are not
                    objected to.</p>
                <p>Museums of such of these things as may have accompanied success in any expedition
                    are kept, and are regarded as sacred places, not to be entered without
                    reverence. Other such objects are the property of private individuals, household
                    gods, and are consulted upon all occasions of importance. If the wishes of the
                    worshipper be not granted, all a savage’s rather powerful vocabulary of abuse is
                    exhausted upon the fetich. It is kicked, stamped upon, dragged through the mud.
                    Change of luck, however, produces apologies, and promises of future regard and
                    worship. Savages who have taken trees as their fetiches, if they are unlucky,
                    cut down trees in revenge. The actions seem rather to be tentatives for the
                    discovery of hidden power than those of any formulated and dogmatic cultus.</p>
                <p>In considering the state of mind which all this kind of action implies, we must
                    remember thatnotonly human beings, not only animate beings, are regarded by
                    savages as possessing spirits, but that they attribute spirits to inanimate
                    objects also. The sight of the figures of departed friends and ancestors in
                    dreams gives notice of a world of spirits, but each appearing “in his habit as
                    he lived” seems to imply that garments, weapons, and other objects of human
                    social environment must have spirits also. When a chief dies wives and slaves
                    are slain, weapons broken, garments rent to pieces,—for what reason, but that
                    the warrior should not go naked and alone to the world of spirits? As a deadly
                    blow sets free the spirits of animate, so fracture and destruction set free the
                    spirits of inanimate objects.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0128-0119"/>
                <p>But the belief in the efficacy of peculiar objects upon a person’s welfare is not
                    by any means confined to savages. Witchcraft is a form of fetichism, and it can
                    hardly be said to be dead from among us even now. Others than children may be
                    found who will keep a crooked sixpence, a curious stone, a hard potato, for
                    luck,—prompted by exactly those instincts, which, although long superseded in
                    some races, are perhaps the highest the savage possesses. The power of the
                    fetich seems in many cases, however, to be regarded not as super human, but as
                    extra-human. The tendency to believe that what precedes, accompanies, or follows
                    a thing or accident must be somehow causally connected with it is ever
                    prevalent; and to palliate our wonder at the gross superstitions of the savage
                    we must remember how many people we have met in the heart of modern civilization
                    who are careful about lucky and unlucky days and numbers. As the fetich becomes
                    more and more endowed with personality and will, so the belief passes
                    imperceptibly into what is called idolatry.</p>
