                    and prescribing for him every detail of bis conduct. So great was Frederick
                    William’s horror of everything which did not seem to him practical, that he
                    strictly excluded Latin from the list of his son’s studies. Frederick, however,
                    had free and generous impulses which could not be restrained by the sternest
                    system. Encouraged by his mother, and under the influence of his governess
                    Madame de Roucoulle, and of his first tutor Duhan, a French refugee, he acquired
                    an excellent knowledge of French and a taste for literature and music. He even
                    received secret lessons in Latin, which his father had invested with all the
                    charms of forbidden fruit. As he grew up he became extremely dissatisfied with
                    the dull and monotonous life he was compelled to lead; and his discontent was
                    heartily shared by his sister, Wilhelmina, a bright and intelligent young
                    princess for whom Frederick had a warm affection. Frederick William, seeing the
                    divergence of his son’s tastes from his own, gradually conceived for him an
                    intense dislike, which often found expression in violent outbursts of anger. So
                    harsh was his treatment that Frederick frequently thought of running away and
                    taking refuge at the court of his uncle, George II. of England; and he at last
                    resolved to do so during a journey which he made with the king to South Germany
                    in 1730, when he was eighteen years of age. He was helped by his two friends,
                    Lieutenant Katte and Lieutenant Keith; but by the imprudence of the former the
                    secret was found out. Frederick was placed under arrest, and the king abused him
                    so cruelly on board a yacht at Frankfort that some courtiers had to interfere,
                    and to separate them. Warned by Frederick, Keith escaped; but Katte delayed his
                    flight too long, and a court martial decided that he should be punished with two
                    years’ fortress arrest. The king changed this sentence into one of death, and
                    the young soldier was executed outside the fortress of Cüstrin, in which
                    Frederick was kept a close prisoner. On the way to the place of execution Katte
                    had to pass the crown prince’s window. “Pardonnez moi, mon cher Katte,” cried
                    Frederick, who was broken-hearted at the fate he had brought upon his friend.
                    “La mort est douce pour un si aimable prince,” replied Katte. The same court
                    martial which had judged him decided that, as a lieutenant-colonel attempting to
                    desert, the crown prince had incurred the legal penalty of death. For some time
                    the king actually thought of giving effect to the sentence; and he at last
                    relented only in consequence of grave expostulations from the emperor and the
                    kings of Sweden and Poland.</p>
                <p>For about fifteen months Frederick now lived in the town of Cüstrin, having an
                    establishment of his own, but serving as the youngest councillor at the
                    Government board there. He took great care not to offend his father, and was
                    partially restored to favour. In 1732 he was made colonel commandant of a
                    regiment in Ruppin, and in the following year he married, in obedience to the
                    king’s orders, the Princess Elizabeth Christina, daughter of the duke of
                    Brunswick-Bevern. The palace of Rheinsberg in the neighbourhood of Ruppin was
                    built for him, and there he lived until he succeeded to the throne. These years
                    were perhaps the happiest of his life. He discharged his duties with so <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0771-0736"/> much spirit and so conscientiously that he
                    ultimately gained the esteem of Frederick William, who no longer feared that he
                    would leave the crown to one unworthy of wearing it. At the same time the crown
                    prince was able to indulge to the full his personal tastes. He carried on a
                    lively correspondence with Voltaire and other French men of letters, and was a
                    diligent student of philosophy, history, and poetry. Two of his best known works
                    were written at this time,— <hi rend="italic">Considérations sur l’état présent
                    du corps politique de l'Europe</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anti-Macchiavel.</hi> In the former he calls attention to the growing strength
                    of Austria and France, and insists on the necesssity of some third power, by
                    which he clearly means Prussia, counterbalancing their excessive influence. The
                    second treatise, which was issued by Voltaire in Hague in 1740, contains a
                    generous exposition of some of the favourite ideas of the 18th century
                    hilo-sophers respecting the duties of sovereigns.</p>
                <p>In 1740 he became king. He maintained all the forms of government established by
                    his father, but ruled in a far more liberal and enlightened spirit; he tolerated
                    every form of religious opinion, granted considerable freedom to the press even
                    in political discussion, was most careful to secure an exact and impartial
                    administration of justice, and allowed every one with a genuine grievance free
                    access to his presence. The Potsdam regiment of giants was disbanded, but the
                    real interests of the army were as carefully studied by Frederick as by
                    Frederick William. On the year of his accession, the emperor Charles VI. died.
                    Frederick at once began to make extensive military preparations, and it was soon
                    clear to all the world that he intended to enter upon some serious enterprise.
                    He had made up his mind to take possession of Silesia. For this resolution he is
                    often abused still by historians, and at the time he had the approval of hardly
                    any one out of Prussia. He himself, writing of the scheme in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> laid no claim to lofty motives, but candidly
                    confessed that “it was a means of acquiring reputation and of increasing the
                    power of the state.” He firmly believed, however, that he had inherited lawful
                    claims to the Silesian principalities; and although his father had recognized
                    the Pragmatic Sanction, whereby the hereditary dominions of Charles VI. were to
                    descend to his daughter, Maria Theresa, Frederick insisted that this sanction
                    could refer only to lands which rightfully belonged to the house of Austria. He
                    could also urge that, as Charles VI. had not fulfilled the engagements by which
                    Frederick William’s recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction had been secured,
                    Prussia was freed from her obligation. Frederick cannot fairly be charged with
                    having let loose the elements of war which desolated Europe during the next few
                    years, for, independently of him, the elector of Bavaria instantly protested
                    against the Pragmatic Sanction, and there can be no doubt that in any case
                    France would have taken advantage of so favourable a chance of breaking the
                    power of Austria.</p>
                <p>Frederick sent an ambassador to Vienna, offering, in the event of his rights in
                    Silesia being conceded, to aid Maria Theresa against her enemies. The queen of
                    Hungary, who regarded the proposal as that of a mere robber, haughtily declined;
                    whereupon Frederick immediately invaded Silesia with an army of 30,000 men. His
                    first victory was gained at Mollwitz on the 10th of April, 1741. Under the
                    impression, in consequence of a furious charge of Austrian cavalry, that the
                    battle was lost, he rode rapidly away at an early stage of the struggle,—a
                    mistake which gave rise for a time to the groundless idea that he lacked
                    personal courage. A second Prussian victory was gained at Chotusitz, near
                    Czeslau, on the 17th May 1742, by which time Frederick was master of all the
                    fortified places of Silesia. Maria Theresa, in the heat of her struggle with
                    France and the elector of Bavaria, now Charles VII., and pressed by England to
                    rid herself of Frederick, concluded with him, on the 11th June 1742, the peace
                    of Breslau, conceding to Prussia Upper and Lower Silesia as far as the Oppa,
                    together with the county of Glatz. Frederick made good <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> use of the next two years, fortifying his new territory’, and repairing
                    the evils inflicted upon it by the war. By the death of the prince of East
                    Friesland without heirs, he also gained possession of that country. He knew well
                    that Maria Theresa would not, if she could help it, allow him to remain in
                    Silesia; accordingly, in 1744, alarmed by her victories, he arrived at a secret
                    understanding with France, and pledged himself, with Hesse-Cassel and the
                    palatinate, to maintain the imperial rights of Charles VII., and to defend his
                    hereditary Bavarian lands. Frederick began the second Silesian war by entering
                    Bohemia in August 1744, and taking Prague. By this brilliant but rash venture he
                    put himself in great danger, and soon had to retreat; but in 1745 he gained the
                    battles of Hohenfriedberg, Sorr, and Hennersdorf; and Leopold of Dessau (“Der
                    alte Dessauer”) won for him the victory of Kesselsdorf in Saxony. The latter
                    victory was decisive, and the peace of Dresden (December 25, 1745) assured to
                    Frederick a second time the possession of Silesia.</p>
                <p>Frederick had thus, at the age of thirty-three, raised himself to a great
                    position in Europe, and henceforth he was the most conspicuous sovereign of his
                    time. He was a thoroughly absolute ruler, his so-called ministers being mere
                    clerks whose business was to give effect to his will. To use his own famous
                    phrase, however, he regarded himself as but “the first servant of the state;”
                    and during the next eleven years he proved that the words expressed his inmost
                    conviction and feeling. All kinds of questions were submitted to him, important
                    and unimportant; and he is frequently censured for having troubled himself so
                    much with mere details. But in so far as these details related to expenditure he
                    was fully justified, for it was absolutely essential for him to have a large
                    army, and with a small state this was impossible unless he carefully prevented
                    unnecessary outlay. Being a keen judge of character, he filled the public
                    offices with faithful, capable, energetic men, who were kept up to a high
                    standard of duty by the consciousness that their work might at any time come
                    under his strict supervision. The Academy of Sciences, which had fallen into
                    contempt during his father’s reign, he restored, infusing into it vigorous life;
                    and he did more to promote elementary education than any of his predecessors. He
                    made canals between the Oder and the Elbe, and the Oder and the Havel, and all
                    kinds of manufacture, particularly silk manufacture, owed much to his
                    encouragement. To the army he gave unremitting attention, reviewing it at
                    regular intervals, and sternly punishing negligence on the part of the officers.
                    Its numbers were raised to 1G0,000 men, while fortresses and magazines were
                    always kept in a state of readiness for war. The influence of the king’s example
                    was felt far beyond the limits of his immediate circle. The nation was proud of
                    his genius, and displayed something of his energy in all departments of life.
                    Lessing, who as a youth of twenty came to Berlin in 1749, composed enthusiastic
                    odes in his honour, and Gleim, the Halberstadt poet, wrote of him as of a kind
                    of demi-god. These may be taken as fair illustrations of the popular feeling
                    long before tbe Seven Years’ War.</p>
                <p>He despised German as the language of boors, although it is remarkable that at a
                    later period, in a French essay on German literature, he predicted for it a
                    great future. He habitually wrote and spoke French, and had a strong ambition to
                    rank as a distinguished French author. Nobody can now read his verses, but his
                    prose writings have a certain calm simplicity and dignity, without, however,
                    giving evidence of the splendid mental qualities which he revealed in <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0772-0737"/> practical life. To this period belongs his <hi

                    l'histoire de Brandebourg,</hi> and his poem <hi rend="italic">L’Art de la
                    Guerre.</hi> The latter, judged as literature, is intolerably dull; but the
                    former is a narrative of seme value, throwing considerable light on his personal
                    sympathies as well as on the motives of important epochs in his career. He
                    continued to correspond with French writers, and induced a number of them to
                    settle in Berlin, Maupertuis being president of the Academy. In 1752 Voltaire,
                    who had repeatedly visited him, came at Frederick’s urgent entreaty, and
                    received a truly royal welcome. The famous Hirsch trial, and Voltaire’s vanity
                    and caprice, greatly lowered him in the esteem of the king, who, on his side,
                    irritated his guest by often requiring him to correct bad verses, and by making
                    him the object of rude banter. The publication of <hi rend="italic">Doctor
                    Akakia,</hi> which brought down upon the president of the Academy a storm of
                    ridicule, finally alienated Frederick; while Voltaire’s wrongs culminated in the
                    famous arrest at Frankfort, the most disagreeable elements of which were due to
                    the misunderstanding of an order by a subordinate official.</p>
                <p>The king lived as much as possible in a retired mansion, to which he gave the
                    name of Sanssouci,—not the palace so called, which was built after the Seven
                    Years’ War, and was never a favourite residence. He rose regularly in summer at
                    five, in winter at six, devoting himself to public business till about eleven.
                    During part of this time, after coffee, he would aid his reflections by playing
                    on the flute, of which he was passionately fond, being a really skilful
                    performer. At eleven came parade, and an hour afterwards, punctually, dinner,
                    which continued till two, or later, if conversation happened to be particularly
                    attractive. After dinner he glanced through and signed cabinet orders written in
                    accordance with his morning instructions, often adding marginal notes and
                    postscripts, many of which were in a caustic tone. These disposed of, he amused
                    himself for a couple of hours with literary work; between six and seven he would
                    converse with his friends or listen to his reader (a post held for some time by
                    La Mettrie); at seven there was a concert; and at half-past eight he sat down to
                    supper, which might go on till midnight. He liked good eating and drinking,
                    although even here the cost was sharply looked after, the expenses of his
                    kitchen mounting to no higher figure than £1800 a year. At supper he was always
                    surrounded by a number of his most intimate friends, mainly Frenchmen; and he
                    insisted on the conversation being perfectly free. His wit, however, was often
                    cruel, and any one who responded with too much spirit was soon made to feel that
                    the licence of talk was to be complete only on one side.</p>
                <p>At Frederick’s court ladies were seldom seen, a circumstance that gave occasion
                    to much scandal for which there seems to have been no foundation. The queen he
                    visited only on rare occasions. She had been forced upon him by his father, and
                    he had never loved her; but he always treated her with marked respect, and
                    provided her with a generous income, half of which she gave away in charity.
                    Although without charm, she was a woman of many noble qualities; and, like her
                    husband, she wrote French books, some of which attracted a certain attention in
                    their day. She survived him by eleven years, dying in 1797.</p>
                <p>Maria Theresa had never given up hope that she would recover Silesia; and as all
                    the neighbouring sovereigns were bitterly jealous of Frederick, and somewhat
                    afraid of him, she had no difficulty in inducing several of them to form a
                    scheme for his ruin. Russia and Saxony entered into it heartily; and France,
                    laying aside her ancient enmity towards Austria, joined the empress against the
                    common object of dislike. Frederick, meanwhile, had turned towards England,
                    which saw in him a possible ally of great importance against the French. A
                    convention between Prussia and Great Britain was signed in January 1756, and it
                    proved of incalculable value to both countries, leading as it did to a close
                    alliance during the administration of Pitt. Through the treachery of a clerk in
                    the Saxon foreign office, Frederick was made aware of the future which was being
                    prepared for him. Seeing the importance of taking the initiative, and, if
                    possible, of securing Saxony, he suddenly, on the 24th August 1756, crossed the
                    frontier of that country, and shut in the Saxon army between Pirna and
                    Königstein, ultimately compelling it, after a victory gained over the Austrians
                    at Lowositz, to surrender. Thus began the Seven Years’ War, in which, supported
                    by England, Brunswick, and Hesse-Cassel, he had for a long time to oppose
                    Austria, France, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. Virtually, the whole Continent was
                    in arms against a small state which, a few years before, had been regarded by
                    most men as beneath serious notice. But it happened that this small state was
                    led by a man of high military genius, capable of infusing into others his own
                    undaunted spirit, while his subjects had learned both from him and his
                    predecessors habits of patience, perseverance, and discipline. In 1757, after
                    defeating the Austrians at Prague, he was himself defeated by them at Kolin; and
                    by the shameful convention of Closter-Seven, he was freely exposed to the attack
                    of the French. In November 1757, however, when Europe looked upon him as ruined,
                    he rid himself of the French by his splendid victory over them at Rossbach, and
                    in about a month afterwards, by the still more splendid victory at Leuthen, he
                    drove the Austrians from Silesia. From this time the French were kept well
                    employed in the west by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, who defeated them at
                    Crefeld in 1758, and at Minden in 1759. In the former year Frederick triumphed,
                    at a heavy cost, over the Russians at Zorndorf; and although, through lack of
                    his usual foresight, he lost the battle of Hochkirchen, he prevented the
                    Austrians from deriving any real advantage from their triumph, Silesia still
                    remaining in his hands at the end of the year. The battle of Kunersdorf, fought
                    on August 12, 1759, was the most disastrous to him in the course of the war. He
                    had here to contend both with the Russians and the Austrians; and although at
                    first he had some success, his army was in the end completely broken. “All is
                    lost. Save the royal family,” he wrote to his minister Friesenstein; “the
                    consequences of this battle will be worse than the battle itself. I shall not
                    survive the ruin of the Fatherland. Adieu for ever !” But he soon recovered from
                    his despair, and in 1760 gained the important victories of Liegnitz and Torgau.
                    He had now, however, to act on the defensive, and, fortunately for him, the
                    Russians, on the death of the czarina Elizabeth, not only withdrew in 1762 from
                    the compact against him, but for a time became his allies. On October 29 of that
                    year he gained his last victory over the Austrians at Freiberg. Europe was by
                    that <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> time sick of war, every power being more or
                    less exhausted. The result was that, on February 15, 1763, a few days after the
                    conclusion of the peace of Paris, the treaty of Hubertusburg was signed, Austria
                    confirming Prussia in the possession of Silesia.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult to overrate the importance of the contribution thus made by
                    Frederick to the politics of Europe. Prussia was now universally recognized as
                    one of the great powers of the Continent, and she definitely took her place in
                    Germany as the rival of Austria. From this time it was inevitable that there
                    should be a final struggle between the two nations for predominance, and that
                    the smaller German states should group themselves around one or the other.
                    Frederick himself acquired both in Germany and Europe the indefinable influence
                    which springs from the recognition of great gifts that have been proved by great
                    deeds.</p>

                <p>His first care after the war was, as far as possible, to enable the country to
                    recover from the terrific blows by which it had been almost destroyed; and he
                    was never, either before or after, seen to better advantage than in the measures
                    he adopted ſor this end. Although his resources had been so completely drained
                    that he had been forced to melt the silver in his palaces and to debase the
                    coinage, his energy soon brought back the national prosperity. Pomerania and
                    Neumark were freed from taxation for two years, Silesia for six months. Many
                    nobles whose lands had been wasted received corn for seed; his war horses were
                    within a few months to be found on farms all over Prussia; and money was freely
                    spent in the re-erection of houses which had been destroyed. The coinage was
                    gradually restored to its proper value, and trade received a favourable impulse
                    by the foundation of the Bank of Berlin. All these matters were carefully looked
                    into by Frederick himself, who, while acting as generously as his circumstances
                    would allow, insisted on everything being done in the most efficient manner at
                    the least possible cost. Unfortunately, he adopted the French ideas of excise,
                    and the French methods of imposing and collecting taxes,—a system known as the
                    Regie. This system secured for him a large revenue, but it led to a vast amount
                    of petty tyranny, which was all the more intolerable because it was carried out
                    by French officials. It was continued to the end of Frederick’s reign, and
                    nothing did so much to injure his otherwise immense popularity. He was quite
                    aware of the discontent the system excited, and the good-nature with which he
                    tolerated the criticisms directed against it and him is illustrated by a well
                    known incident. Riding along the Jäger Strasse one day, he saw a crowd of
                    people. “See what it is,” he said to the groom who was attending him. “They have
                    something posted up about your Majesty,” said the groom, returning. Frederick,
                    riding forward, saw a caricature of himself: “King in very melancholy guise,”
                    says Preuss (as translated by Carlyle), “seated on a stool, a coffee-mill
                    between his knees, diligently grinding with the one hand, and with the other
                    picking up any bean that might have fallen, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Hang
                    it lower,’ said the king, beckoning his groom with a wave of the finger; ‘lower,
                    that they may not have to hurt their necks about it.’ No sooner were the words
                    spoken, which spread instantly, than there rose from the whole crowd one
                    universal huzzah of joy. They tore the caricature into a thousand pieces, and
                    rolled after the king with loud <hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lebe</hi><hi rend="italic">Hoch,</hi> our Frederick for ever,’ as
                    he rode slowly away.” There are scores of anecdotes about Frederick, but not
                    many so well authenticated as this.</p>
                <p>There was nothing about which Frederick took so much trouble as the proper
                    administration of justice. He disliked the formalities of the law, and in one
                    instance, “the Miller-Arnold case,” in connexion with which he thought injustice
                    had been done to a poor man, he dismissed the judges, condemned them to a year’s
                    fortress-arrest, and compelled them to make good out of their own pocket the
                    loss sustained by their supposed victim,—not a wise proceeding, but one
                    springing from a generous motive. He once defined himself as “l’avocat du
                    pauvre,” and few things gave him more pleasure than the famous answer of the
                    miller whose windmill stood on ground which was wanted for the king’s garden.
                    The miller sturdily refused to sell it. “Not at any price?” said the king’s
                    agent; “could not the king take it from you for nothing, if he chose?” “Have we
                    not the Kammergericht at Berlin ?” was the answer, which became a popular saying
                    in Germany. Soon after he came to the throne Frederick began to make
                    preparations for a new code. In the year 1749-51 his grand-chancellor, Von
                    Cocceji, a man of wide knowledge and solid judgment, finished “The Project of
                    the Corporis Juris Fridericiani,” which was afterwards made the basis of a legal
                    system drawn up by the grand-chancellor Von Cramer—a system that came into
                    operation in 1794 under Frederick’s successor.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead after the Seven Years’ War, Frederick saw no means of securing
                    himself so effectually as by cultivating the good will of Russia. In 1764 he
                    accordingly concluded a treaty of alliance with the empress Catherine for eight
                    years. Six years afterwards, unfortunately for his fame, he joined in the first
                    partition of Poland, by which he received Polish Prussia, without Dantzic and
                    Thorn, and Great Poland as far as the Netzefluss. Prussia was then for the first
                    time made continuous with Brandenburg and Pomerania. Frederick would have run
                    great risks had he refused to take part in this arrangement; but it was none the
                    less a shameful violation of international law, the full penalty for which has
                    perhaps not even yet been paid.</p>
                <p>F∙ ∙The emperor Joseph II., being of an ardent and impulsive nature, greatly
                    admired Frederick, and visited him at Neisse, in Silesia, in 1769, a visit which
                    Frederick returned, in Moravia, in the following year. The young emperor was
                    frank and cordial; Frederick was more cautious, for he detected under the
                    respectful manner of Joseph a keen ambition that might one day become dangerous
                    to Prussia. Ever after these interviews a portrait of the emperor hung
                    conspicuously in the rooms in which Frederick lived, a circumstance on which
                    some one remarked, “Ah yes,” said Frederick, “I am obliged to keep that young
                    gentleman in my eye.” Nothing came of these suspicions till 1777, when, after
                    the death of Maximilian Joseph, elector of Bavaria, without children, the
                    emperor took possession of the greater part of his lands. The elector palatine,
                    who lawfully inherited Bavaria, came to an arrangement, which was not admitted
                    by his heir, the duke of Zweibrücken, afterwards King Maximilian I. of Bavaria.
                    The latter appealed to Frederick, who, resolved that Austria should gain no
                    unnecessary advantage, took his part, and brought pressure to bear upon the
                    emperor. Ultimately, greatly against his will, Frederick felt compelled to draw
                    the sword, and in July 1778, crossed the Bohemian frontier at the head of a
                    powerful army. No general engagement was fought, and after a great many delays,
                    the treaty of Teschen was signed on the 13th May 1779. . Austria received the
                    circle of Burgau, and consented that the king of Prussia should take the
                    Franconian principalities. Frederick never abandoned his jealousy of Austria,
                    whose ambition he regarded as the chief danger against which Europe had to
                    guard. He seems to have had no suspicion that evil days were coming in France.
                    It was Austria which had given trouble in his time; and if her pride were
                    curbed, he fancied that Prussia at least would be safe. Hence one of the last
                    important acts of his life was to form, in 1785, a league of princes (the
                    “Fürstenbund”) for the defence of the imperial constitution, believed to be
                    imperilled by Joseph’s restless activity. The league came to an end after
                    Frederick’s death; but it is of considerable historical interest, as the first
                    open attempt of Prussia to take the lead in Germany.</p>
                <p>Frederick’s chief trust was always in his treasury and his army. By continual
                    economy'he left in the former the immense sum of 70 million thalers; the latter,
                    at the time of his death, numbered 200,000 men, disciplined with all the
                    strictness to which he had throughout life accustomed his troops. He died at
                    Sanssouci on the 17th August 1786; his death being hastened by exposure to a
                    storm of rain, stoically borne, during a military review. He passed away on the
                    eve of tremendous events, which for a time obscured his fame; but now that he
                    can be impartially estimated, he is seen to have been in many respects one of
                    the greatest figures in modern history.</p>
                <p>He was rather below the middle size, in youth inclined <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0774-0739"/> to stoutness, lean in old age, but of vigorous
                    and active habits. An expression of keen intelligence lighted up his features,
                    and his large, sparkling, grey eyes darted penetrating glances at every one who
                    approached him. In his later years an old blue uniform with red facings was his
                    usual dress, and on his breast was generally some Spanish snuff, of which he
                    consumed large quantities. He shared many of the chief intellectual tendencies
                    of his age, having no feeling for the highest aspirations of human nature, but
                    submitting all things to a searching critical analysis. Of Christianity he
                    always spoke in the mocking tone of the “enlightened” philosophers, regarding it
                    as the invention of priests; but it is noteworthy that after the Seven Years’
                    War, the trials of which steadied his character, he sought to strengthen the
                    church for the sake of its elevating moral influence. He cannot be truly
                    described as an atheist, for he regarded the world as probably the creation of a
                    demiurgus,—of a demiurgus, however, who could not be supposed to take interest
                    in the petty affairs of men. In his judgments of mankind he often talked as a
                    misanthrope. He was once conversing with Sulzer, who was a school inspector,
                    about education. Sulzer expressed the opinion that education had of late years
                    greatly improved. “In former times, your Majesty,” he said, “the notion being
                    that mankind were naturally inclined to evil, a system of severity prevailed in
                    schools; but now, when we recognize that the inborn inclination of men is rather
                    to good than to evil, schoolmasters have adopted a more generous procedure.”
                    “Ah, my dear Sulzer,” replied the king, “you don’t know this damned race” (“Ach,
                    mein lieber Sulzer, er kennt nicht diese verdammte Race ”). This fearful saying
                    unquestionably expressed a frequent mood of Frederick’s; and he sometimes acted
                    with great harshness, and seemed to take a malicious pleasure in tormenting his
                    acquaintances. Yet he was capable of genuine attachments. He was beautifully
                    loyal to his mother and his sister Wilhelmina; his letters to the duchess of
                    Gotha are full of a certain tender reverence; the two Keiths found him a devoted
                    friend. But the true evidence that beneath his misanthropical moods there was an
                    enduring sentiment of humanity is afforded by the spirit in which he exercised
                    his kingly functions. Taking his reign as a whole, it must be said that he
                    looked upon his power rather as a trust than as a source of personal advantage;
                    and the trust was faithfully discharged according to the best lights of his day.
                    He has often been condemned for doing nothing to encourage German literature;
                    and it is true that he was supremely indifferent to it. Before he died a tide of
                    intellectual life was rising all about him; yet he failed to recognize it,
                    declined to give Lessing even the small post of royal librarian, and thought <hi
                    rend="italic">G'òtz von Berlichingen</hi> a vulgar imitation of vulgar English
                    models. But when his taste was formed, German literature did not exist; the
                    choice was between Racine and Voltaire on the one hand and Gottsched and Gellert
                    on the other. He survived into the era of Kant, Goethe, and Schiller, but he was
                    not of it, and it would have been unreasonable to expect that he should in old
                    age pass beyond the limits of his own epoch. As Germans now generally admit, it
                    was better that he let their literature alone, since, left to itself, it became
                    a thoroughly independent product. Indirectly he powerfully promoted it by
                    deepening the national life from which it sprang. At a time when there was no
                    real bond of cohesion between the different states, he stirred among them a
                    common enthusiasm; and in making Prussia great he laid the foundation of a
                    genuinely united empire.</p>
                <p>In 1846-57 Frederick William IV. caused a magnificent edition of Frederick’s
                    writings to be issued by the Berlin Academy, under the supervision of Preuss. It
