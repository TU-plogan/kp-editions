                <p><label type="entry">FLYCATCHER</label>, a name introduced in ornithology by Kay,
                    being a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Muscficapa</hi> of older authors,
                    and applied by Pennant to an extremely common English bird, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. grisola</hi> of Linnaeus. It has since been used in a general
                    and very vague way for a great many small birds from all parts of the world,
                    which have the habit of catching flies on the wing, and thus ornithologists who
                    have trusted too much to this characteristic and to certain merely superficial
                    correlations of structure, especially those exhibited by a broad and rather flat
                    bill and a gape beset by strong hairs or bristles, have associated under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Muscicapidae</hi> an exceedingly heterogeneous
                    assemblage of forms that, though much reduced in number by later systematists,
                    has scarcely yet been sufficiently revised. Great advance has been made,
                    however, in establishing as independent Families the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Todidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">EurylaemiAae,</hi> as well as in excluding
                    from it various members of the <hi rend="italic">Åmpelidae, Cotingidae,
                    Tyrannidae, Vireondae, Mniotiltidae,</hi> and perhaps others, which had been
                    placed within its limits. These steps have left the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscicapidae</hi> a purely Old-World family of the Order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres,</hi> and the chief difficulty now seems to lie in separating it from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Campephagidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laniidae.</hi> Every ornithologist must own that its precise definition is at
                    present almost impossible, and must await that truer knowledge which comes of
                    investigating structural characters more deeply seated than any afforded by the
                    epidermis. But here want of space forbids the pursuit of this kind of inquiry,
                    and for the same reason only a very few of the forms of Flycatchers (which,
                    after all the deductions above mentioned, may be reckoned to include some 60
                    genera or subgenera, and perhaps 250 species) can be even named.<note

                    which Swainson included in his <hi rend="italic">Raturai</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    1838), at least 19 do not belong to the <hi rend="italic">Muscicapidae</hi> at
                    all, and one of them, <hi rend="italic">Todies,</hi> not even to the Order <hi
                    rend="italic">Passeres.</hi> It is perhaps impossible to name any ornithological
                    work whose substance so fully belies its title as does this treatise. Swainson
                    wrote it filled with faith in the so-called “Quinary System”—that fanciful
                    theory, invented by Macleay, which misled and hindered so many of the best
                    English zoologists of his generation from the truth,—and, unconsciously swayed
                    by his bias, his judgment was warped to fit his hypothesis.</p></note></p>
                <p>The best known bird of this Family is that which also happens to be the type of
                    the Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic">Muscicapa—</hi> the Spotted or Grey
                    Flycatcher (JZ^. <hi rend="italic">grisolaſt</hi> already mentioned. It is a
                    common summer-visitant to nearly the whole of Europe, and is found throughout
                    Great Britain, though less abundant in Scotland than in England, as well as in
                    many parts of Ireland, where, however, it seems to be but locally and sparingly
                    distributed. It is one of the latest of our migrants to arrive, and seldom
                    reaches these islands till the latter part of May, when it may be seen, a small
                    dust-coloured bird, sitting on the posts or railings of our gardens and fields,
                    ever and anon springing into the air, seizing with an audible snap of its bill
                    some passing insect as it flies, and returning to the spot it has quitted, or
                    taking up some similar station to keep watch as before. It has no song, but
                    merely a plaintive or peevish call-note, uttered from time to time with a
                    jerking gesture of the wings and tail. It makes a neat nest, built among the
                    small twigs which sprout from the bole of a large tree, fixed in the branches of
                    some plant trained against a wall, or placed in any hole of the wall itself that
                    may be left by the falling of a brick or stone. The eggs are from four to six in
                    number, of a pale greenish-blue, closely blotched or freckled with rust-colour.
                    Silent and inconspicuous as is this bird, its constant pursuit of flies in the
                    closest vicinity of our houses makes it a familiar object to almost everybody. A
                    second British species is the Pied Flycatcher (3/. <hi rend="italic"
                    >atriaeapilla)</hi> —called by some writers the Coldfinch—a much rarer bird, and
                    in England not often seen except in the hilly country extending from the Peak of
                    Derbyshire to Cumberland, and more numerous in the lake district than elsewhere.
                    It is not common in Scotland, and has only once been observed in Ireland. More
                    of a woodland bird than the former, the brightly-contrasted black and white
                    plumage of the cock, together with his agreeable song, readily attracts
                    attention where it occurs. It is a summer visitant to all Western Europe, but
                    further eastward its place is taken by a nearly allied species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">collaris)</hi> in which the white of the throat and
                    breast extends like a collar round the neck. A fourth European species <hi
                    rend="italic">(Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">parva),</hi> distinguished by its very
                    small size and red breast, has also strayed some three or four times to the
                    extreme south-west of England. This last belongs to a group of more eastern
                    range, which has received generic recognition (possibly well deserved) under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Erythrosterna,</hi> and it has several relations in
                    Asia and particularly in India, while the allies of the Pied Flycatchers <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ficedula</hi> of Brisson) are chiefly of African origin, and
                    those of the Grey or Spotted Flycatcher <hi rend="italic">(Muscicapa</hi>

                    common to the two continents.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable groups of <hi rend="italic">Muscicapidae</hi> is that
                    known as the Paradise^Flycatchers,-forming the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tchitrea</hi> of Lesson. In nearly all the species the males are distinguished
                    by the growth of exceedingly long ^feathers in their tail, and by their putting
                    on, for some part of the year at least, a plumage generally white, but almost
                    always quite different from that worn by the females, which is of a more or less
                    deep chestnut or bay colour, though in both sexes the crown is of a glossy
                    steel-blue. They are found pretty well throughout Africa and tropical Asia to
                    Japan, and seem to affect the deep shade of forests rather than the open
                    country. The best-known species is perhaps the Indian <hi rend="italic">T.
                    paradisi</hi> ∖ but the Chinese <hi rend="italic">T. incii,</hi> and the
                    Japanese <hi rend="italic">T. princeps,</hi> from being very commonly
                    represented by the artists of those nations on screens, fans, and the like, are
                    hardly less so; and the cock of the last named, with his bill of a pale
                    greenish-blue and eyes surrounded by bare skin of the same colour—though these
                    are characters possessed in some degree by all the species—seems to be the most
                    beautiful of the genus. <hi rend="italic">T. bourbonnensis,</hi> which is
                    peculiar to the islands of Mauritius and Réunion, appears to be the only species
                    in which the outward difference of the sexes is but slight. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">corvina</hi> of the Seychelles, the adult male is
                    wholly black, and his middle tail-feathers are not only very long but very
                    broad. In 7 <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>. <hi rend="italic">mutata</hi> of
                    Madagascar, some of the males are found in a blackish plumage, though with the
                    elongated median rectrices white, while in others white predominates over the
                    whole body; but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0365-0352"/> whether this sex is here actually dimorphic, or
                    whether the one dress is a passing phase of the other, is at present
                    undetermined. Some of the African species, of which many have been described,
                    seem always to retain the rufous plumage, but the long tail-feathers serve to
                    mark the males; and the whole group deserves far more investigation than it has
                    ever received, as it is likely to reveal facts of the highest importance in
                    regard to the theory of “Sexual Selection.”</p>
                <p>On the other groups of the Family there is not room to descant. A few are
                    distinguished by the brilliant blue they exhibit, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myiagτa</hi><hi rend="italic">azurea,</hi> and others as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monarcha</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Arses)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chrysomela</hi> by their golden-yellow. The Australian forms assigned to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Muscicapidae</hi> are very varied, and probably require much
                    further scrutiny. <hi rend="italic">Sisura inquieta,</hi> for instance, has some
                    of the habits of a Water-Wagtail <hi rend="italic">(Motacüla),</hi> and hence
                    has received from the colonists the name of “Dishwasher,” bestowed in many parts
                    of England on its analogue; and the many species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhipidura</hi> or Fantailed Flycatchers, which occur in various parts of the
                    Australian Region, have manners still more singular—turning over in the air, it
                    is said, like a Tumbler Pigeon, as they catch their prey; but concerning the
                    mode of life of the majority of the <hi rend="italic">Muscicapidae,</hi> and
                    especially of the numerous African forms, hardly anything is known. <hi
