                    he reached his thirteenth year, when, in accordance with a vow, he was taken by
                    his father to the Franciscan convent of San Marco in Calabria. Here he learned
                    to read, and distinguished himself by his austerities; but at the close of a
                    probationary year he, for some reason that is not mentioned, left San Marco,
                    and, after a pilgrimage to Assisi and Rome, retired to the neighbourhood of his
                    native town, where in a cave by the sea-shore he gave himself wholly to a hermit
                    life, after the example of the great St Francis, having no bed but the bare
                    rock, and no other food than the herbs which he gathered in the neighbouring
                    wood, or which were sometimes brought to him by his friends. In the course of
                    time he was joined by some others like-minded with himself, and the building of
                    a chapel in 1436 is generally considered as marking the first beginning of the
                    Minimite order. At that time, however, and for many years afterwards, they were
                    mere “Eremites of St Francis,” and did not claim to be distinguished from other
                    Franciscans unless by a stricter fidelity to the common principles of the order.
                    In eighteen years the little community had increased so much in numbers and in
                    popularity that, with the help of a friendly neighbourhood, it was able to build
                    a large church and monastery in 1454. In 1469, owing to reports which he had
                    received, Pope Paul II. sent one of his chamberlains into Calabria to ascertain
                    the actual condition of matters at Paola; the account brought back by him was
                    highly favourable, and the result was that in 1474 the order of the Eremites was
                    incorporated by a bull of Sixtus IV., and Francis appointed its first
                    “corrector” or superior-general. In addition to the usual vows, there was a
                    special rule, which pledged the members to the observance of a perpetual Lent
                    Several new convents were founded in Calabria and Sicily during the following
                    years; and the fame of Francis for sanctity and miraculous powers increased
                    daily. When Louis XL.of France was seized with his last illness, he despatched a
                    special message to beg of the holy man that he would come and restore him to
                    health. Not until he had been commanded by Pope Sixtus IV. could Francis
                    overcome his reluctance to undertake so long a journey on so doubtful an errand;
                    and on his arrival at Plessis-lès-Tours, in April 1482, to the king’s entreaties
                    for his intervention to prolong his life he simply replied that the lives of
                    kings had their appointed limits, that God’s decree was unchangeable, and that
                    for his Majesty nothing remained to be done but to resign himself to the divine
                    will <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> and prepare for death. At the request of Louis,
                    Francis remained at Plessis; where he was treated with great respect by that
                    sovereign, and also by his successor Charles VIII. In particular, the latter
                    built two convents for the order, one near Plessis and another at Amboise; and
                    on his triumphant arrival in Rome in 1495, he caused a third to be erected
                    there. In 1501-2 a new and stricter constitution was granted to the order by
                    Alexander VI., who at the same time conceded all the privileges and immunities
                    enjoyed by the other mendicant orders, and bestowed, at the urgent request of
                    Francis, the distinctive name of Minimi, which has ever since been retained. At
                    the same time a lay order of Tertiaries was sanctioned, under a special rule. In
                    1506 the fourth vow (to observe a perpetual Lent) was made more definite and
                    stringent in its character by Julius II. The death of Francis took place in his
                    ninety-first year, at Plessis, on the 2d of April 1507. He was canonized by Leo
                    X. in 1519,—his day in the calendar being April 2 (Duplex).</p>
                <p>A graphic incidental notice of Francis occurs in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> of Philip de Comines (b. vi. c. 7), who says, “1 never saw any man
                    living so holy, nor out of whose mouth the Holy Ghost did more manifestly
                    speak.'* A brief sketch of his life occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Breviarium
                    Romanum</hi>; and his miracles and prophecies are related at considerable length
                    by the Bollandists. Reference may also be made to Butler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives of the Saints.</hi> The order of Minims, called also Les Bons Hommes in
                    France, Los Padres de la Vitoria in Spain, and Paulaner or Pauliner in Germany,
                    never attained to any great prominence by the side of the great societies of
                    Dominic and Francis of Assisi. Their cloisters never exceeded 450, and at
                    present are very much fewer. The principal establishment is in Rome.</p>
