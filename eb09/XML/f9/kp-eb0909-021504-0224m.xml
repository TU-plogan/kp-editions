                    and Flèche flow northward to the sea. South of the Noires range, the Odet, Aven,
                    Ioste, and Elie flow southward; while the region inclosed by the two chains
                    having a declination westward, the waters of the Aulne and the Elorn flow into
                    the Brest roads. The rivers are all small, and none of the hills attain a height
                    of 900 feet. The coasts are generally steep and rocky, and indented with
                    numerous bays and inlets, affording some excellent harbours, the principal being
                    those of Brest, La Forest, Morlaix, Landernau, Quimper, and Douarnenez. The only
                    navigable rivers are the Aulne, Elorn, and Odet. Off the coast lie a number of
                    islands and rocky islets, the principal of which are Ushant and Bas. The climate
                    is temperate, but rather humid; the prevailing winds are the W., S.W., aud N.W.
                    More than a third of the soil is under cultivation, and about an equal
                    proportion is heath or waste land, rather the larger proportion of the remainder
                    being pasturage, and the rest woods and forests. Though so small a portion of
                    the land is under cultivation, the produce of corn is more than sufficient for
                    the population, and might be greatly increased if the primitive agricultural
                    implements and methods still in use were superseded by the introduction of
                    modern improvements. The chief crops are oats, rye, wheat, and barley; flax,
                    hemp, and pulse are also produced. The farm and dairy produce, though plentiful
                    in quantity, is indifferent in quality; but great attention is paid to the
                    breeding and feeding of cattle. In the department there are a large number of
                    orchards and gardens, and vegetables are largely grown for exportation. The
                    fisheries of the coast, particularly the pilchard fishery, employ a great many
                    hands, and render this department an excellent nursery of seamen for the French
                    navy. Finistère is rich in minerals: iron, coal, lead, bismuth, and zinc mines
                    are worked; and there are quarries of granite, slate, marble, and porphyry. The
                    lead mines of Poullaouen and Huelgoat, which yielded a considerable quantity of
                    silver, have not been worked since 1869. The manufactures are linens, woollens,
                    sailcloth, ropes, paper, leather, earthenware, soda, soap, candles, sugar,
                    &amp;c. Shipbuilding is carried on at Brest and other seaports. Finistère is
                    divided into the arrondissements of Quimperlé, Brest, Châteaulin, Morlaix, and
                    Quimper, the town of Quimper being the capital of the department, The population
                    of Finistère in 1872 was 642,963, and in 1876 it was 666,106.</p>
