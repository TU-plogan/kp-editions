                    age he made his mark as an orator in a panegyric of St Louis, delivered before
                    the French Academy. For some time he was engaged as tutor to the children of the
                    marquis of Choiseul, a brother of the famous minister of Louis XVI.; and he was
                    afterwards nominated grand-vicar of the archbishop of Bourges, preacher to the
                    king, and abbé of Montfort-Lacarre in Brittany. The influence of the new
                    philosophy was clearly seen in his discourses, and the political tone of his
                    sermon, <hi rend="italic">Discours sur les moeurs rurales,</hi> at the festival
                    of La Rosiere at Surènes, especially exposed him to censure. As he was proof
                    against remonstrance, he was deprived of his office as preacher to the king.
                    This occurred in 1788; and when in the following year the Revolution broke out,
                    Abbé Fauchet was ready to fight with the foremost in the great cause. His
                    speeches fired the primary assemblies and the sections of Paris, and on the
                    memorable 14th of July he was one of those who led the people to the attack on
                    the Bastille, displaying, it is said, not only courage under fire, but skill
                    worthy of an accomplished officer. He was elected a member of the commune of
                    Paris, figured in the clubs, blessed the tricolor flag for the National Guard,
                    and by all means helped forward with a passionate zeal the revolutionary
                    movement. He contributed to the reorganization of the church by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Discours</hi><hi rend="italic">sur la religion</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nationale;</hi> and in May 1791 he was appointed constitutional
                    bishop of Calvados. During the same period he had delivered three discourses on
                    liberty, a discourse on the harmony of religion and liberty, tbe funeral oration
                    of the Abbé de l’Épée, and an <hi rend="italic">Éloge civique</hi> of Franklin.
                    The last of these was spoken in the rotunda of the corn-market in the course of
                    the festivities of the federation in July 1790. In these pieces the swift
                    progress of the Revolution was reflected in a growing intensity of sympathy and
                    enthusiasm on the part of the orator; and hostility to the church carried him
                    well nigh to a denial of the faith of which he was a minister. In the winter of
                    1790-91 Fauchet organized, in the precincts of the Palais Royal, his “Cercle
                    Social,” with regenerative intent, to be carried out chiefly by means of fluent
                    oratory. He presided in the meetings under the self-assumed title of “Procureur
                    général de la Vérité.” Condorcet was one of his coadjutors, and “ten thousand
                    persons of respectability” flocked to hear them,—a noisy and phantasmal affair,
                    which came to a speedy end. In 1791 Fauchet was elected deputy to the
                    legislative assembly, and afterwards to the convention. He wrote in favour of an
                    agrarian law, voted against payment of priests who refused the oath to the
                    constitution, and was one of the first to submit to the decree for suppression
                    of ecclesiastical costume. The excesses of the Jacobins, however, alarmed him,
                    and he began to incline towards the Girondists. On the trial of the king he
                    spoke earnestly and courageously against the proposal to put him to death, and
                    voted for the appeal to the people, imprisonment, and banishment. The execution
                    of the king drove him still nearer to the party of the Girondists, and thus made
                    him an object of the wrath of the Mountain. His name was one of those included
                    in the proscription list, but he continued to act as secretary of the assembly
                    till May 31, 1793, when the decree of accusation against the Girondists was
                    passed. On the 18th July he was accused, not only as a Girondist, but also, and
                    without ground, as an accomplice of Charlotte Corday, the murderer of Marat. He
                    was sent to the Conciergerie, was condemned with the Girondist deputies by the
                    revolutionary tribunal on October 30, and with them executed on the 31st.</p>
