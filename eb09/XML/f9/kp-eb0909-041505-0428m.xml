                <p><label type="entry">FORMOSA</label>, in Chinese <hi rend="italic">Taiwan,</hi> a
                    large island in the Pacific lying between what the Chinese call Nan-hai and
                    Tong-hai, or the Southern and the Eastern Sea, and separated from the Chinese
                    mainland by the strait of Fokien, which has a width of about 91 miles in its
                    narrowest part. It extends from 121° 15' to 122° 5' E. long.; Foki, its most
                    northern point, lies in 25° 19', and its most southern, Lin-hai-shan or South
                    Cape, in 21° 54' N. lat. Its area is estimated at 14,978 square miles, or about
                    half the size of Ireland. It forms part of the long line of islands which, in
                    the words of Mr Bridge, are interposed as a protective fortification between the
                    Asiatic coast and the broad expanse of the Pacific, and produces that happy
                    immunity from the typhoon which is enjoyed by the ports of China from Amoy to
                    the Yellow Sea. A chain of mountains, called simply Ta-shan or Great Mountain by
                    the Chinese, traverses the island from N. to S., and attains in several of its
                    summits no inconsiderable elevation. The loftiest point is usually said to be Mu
                    Kang-shan or the “Wooded Mountain,” which has been named Mount Morrison by the
                    English, “after the captain of one of the early vessels trading to Taiwanfu,”
                    and is said to be 12,850 feet in height; but it is not improbable that this
                    estimate is too high, and that the range really culminates elsewhere. Towards
                    the north the English maps show a Mount <pb break="no"

                    summit in the Middle, Western, or Dodds range, 12,800 <hi rend="italic"
                    >feet.</hi> Be this as it may, Formosa, as far as its vertical relief is
                    concerned, is divided into three regions,—the mountains proper, the broad
                    western versant with its alluvial plains, and the narrow eastern versant
                    terminating in a high and {&gt;recipitous coast. The formation of the island
                    appears to ιave been due in part at least to volcanic agency; the Chinese
                    accounts mention a mountain called Ho-shan or Fire Mountain, said to be a small
                    volcano about 20 miles south of Kagee; and European explorers have described the
                    jets of steam and sulphur-springs which occur among the calcareous rocks near
                    Tam-sui. Coal, sulphur, and petroleum are the only mineral productions of
                    Formosa which are known to exist in quantities sufficient to make them of
                    economical importance. The principal coal-fields are in the north of the island,
                    near Kelung and Tam-sui; and the coal is all shipped in Kelung harbour. Till
                    1877 mining operations were conducted after the simple Chinese fashion; but in
                    that year Mr Tyzack, an English engineer, engaged by the Chinese Government,
                    opened a pit with a regular shaft 300 feet deep, and all the necessary machinery
                    and engines for the proper working of the mine. The bed of coal is 3 feet thick.
                    The mineral is highly bituminous, and bums very fast, but can be used for
                    steamers ou short voyages. It is regularly employed by many foreign vessels, as
                    well as in the Chinese men-of-war, and in the arsenal at Fuh-chow. In 1873,
                    45,000 tons were shipped in foreign ships; in 1874, 15,221 tons; in 1875, 27,665
                    tons; and in 1876, 31,593 tons. In the plains the soil is generally of sand or
                    alluvial clay, covered in the valleys with a rich vegetable mould. As might be
                    inferred from what has been already said, the streams that flow eastward are
                    little better than torrents; but the western region is traversed by several
                    rivers of moderate development—the Taiwanfu and Pakan rivers, the Black river,
                    the Lokan, the Taika, the Heon-lang, the Tion-kan, the Tonk-shan, and the
                    Tam-sui. Of these the Black river is the widest, but the Tam-sui or
                    Tang-shui-khi alone is navigable, allowing sea vessels to proceed about 3 miles
                    inland, and junks of considerable size about 10 miles farther. There is a fine
                    lake 4 miles long by 2 broad called the Tsui-sia-hai, or Lake of the Water
                    Savages, not far from Posia. The scenery of Formosa is frequently of majestic
                    beauty; and to this it is indebted for its European name, happily bestowed by
                    the early Spanish navigators. As seen from the eastern coast “the outline of the
                    mountains is at once beautiful and fantastic; domes and peaks and walllike
                    precipices succeed each other in striking variety; a brilliant verdure clothes
                    their sides, down which dash cascades that shine like silver in the tropical
                    sunlight” (Bridge in <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review,</hi> 1876). The
                    climate, though a tropical one, is agreeable and healthy, being tempered by the
                    influences both of the sea and the mountains. According to thermometric
                    observations made at Kelung in 1874, the hottest months are June, July, August,
                    and September, with an average of from 81 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 76° to
                    82 ’ 81° F. in the shade, and the coldest month is January, with an average of
                    57 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 70°. The thermometer almost reached 90° in the
                    early part of July, and in January was frequently about 52° or 55°. For the same
                    year the rainfall amounted to 118 inches, of which the most fell in January,
                    February, March, and May. The vegetation of the island is characterized by
                    tropical luxuriance,—the mountainous regions being clad with dense forest, in
                    which various species of palms, the camphor-tree <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Laurus</hi><hi rend="italic">Camphora),</hi> and the aloe are conspicuous. Mr
                    Swinhoe obtained no fewer than 65 different kinds of timber from a large yard in
                    Taiwanfu; and his specimens are now to be seen in the museum at Kew. The tree
                    which supplies the materials for the pith paper of the Chinese is not uncommon,
                    and Mr Pickering found the cassia tree in the mountains. Travellers are
                    especially struck with the beauty of some of the wild flowers, more especially
                    with the lilies and convolvuluses; and our European greenhouses have been
                    enriched by several Formosan orchids and other ornamental plants. The pine apple
                    grows in abundance. In the lowlands of the western portion, the Chinese have
                    introduced a large number of cultivated plants and fruit trees. Rice is grown in
                    such quantities as to procure for Formosa the title of the “granary of China”;
                    and the sweet potato, taro, millet, barley, wheat, and maize are also
                    cultivated. Sugar, tea, indigo, ground pea-nuts, jute, hemp, oil, and ratans are
                    all articles of export, and some of them produce no inconsiderable trade. The
                    principal tea district is about Banka, but the area devoted to this valuable
                    crop is rapidly increasing. A large part of the tea finds its way to America. In
                    some parts of the island it is probable that coffee may be grown with advantage.
                    The Formosan fauna has been but partially ascertained; but at least three kinds
                    of deer, wild boars, bears, goats, monkeys (probably <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macacus</hi><hi rend="italic">speciosus),</hi> squirrels, and flying squirrels
                    are fairly common, and panthers and wild cats are not unfrequent. A poisonous
                    but beautiful green snake is often mentioned by travellers. Pheasants, ducks,
                    geese, and snipe are abundant; and Dr Collingwood in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturalist's Rambles in the China Seas</hi> mentions <hi rend="italic"
                    >Árdeaprasino-sceles</hi> and other species of herons, several species of
                    flycatchers, kingfishers, shrikes, and larks, the black drongo, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cotyle sinensis,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Prinia
                    sonitans.</hi> Dogs are kept even by the savages for hunting. The horse is
                    hardly known, and his place is taken by the ox, which is regularly bridled and
                    saddled and ridden with all dignity. The rivers and neighbouring seas seem to be
                    well stocked witn fish, and especial mention must be made of the turtles,
                    flying-fish, and brilliant coral-fish which swarm in the waters warmed by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kurosiwo</hi> current, that gulfstream of the Pacific.
                    Shell-fish form an important article of diet to both the Chinese and the
                    aborigines along the coast—a species of Cyrena, a species of Tapes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cytheraa petechiana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Modifia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">teres</hi> being most abundant.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Formosa may be divided into three classes :—the Chinese, many
                    of whom have immigrated from the neighbourhood of Amoy and speak the dialect of
                    that district, while others are Hakkas from the vicinity of Swatow; the
                    subjugated aborigines, now largely intermingled with the Chinese; and the
                    uncivilized aborigines of the eastern region, who refuse to recognize the
                    Chinese authority, and carry on raids as opportunity occurs. The semi-civilized
                    aborigines, who have adopted the Chinese language, dress, and customs, are
                    called Pe-pa-hwan <hi rend="italic">(Anglice</hi> Peppo-hoans), while ,their
                    wilder brethren bear the name of Che-hwan or green savages. They appear to
                    belong to the Malay stock, and their language, according to Gabelentz’s
                    investigations in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Morgenland.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gesellschaft,</hi> 1859, bears out the
                    supposition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare

                    1873, and in Collingwood’s Appendix.</p></note> They are broken up into almost
                    countless tribes and clans, many of which number only a few hundred individuals,
                    and their language consequently presents a variety of dialects, of which no
                    classification has yet been effected: in the district of Posia alone, says Dr
                    Dickson, of the Presbyterian mission, there are “eight different mutually
                    unintelligible dialects.” Mr Corner of Amoy describes the people themselves as
                    of “middle height, broad-chested, and muscular, with remarkably large hands and
                    feet, the eyes large, the forehead round, and not narrow or receding in many
                    instances, the nose broad, the mouth large and disfigured<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n430/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0430-0417"/> with betel.” The custom of tattooing is
                    universal. In the north of the island at least, the dead are buried in a sitting
                    posture under the bed on which they have expired. Petty wars are extremely
                    common, not only along the Chinese frontiers, but between the neighbouring
                    clans; and the heads of the slain are carefully preserved as trophies. In some
                    districts the young men and boys sleep in the skull-chambers, in order that they
                    may be inspired with courage. Many of the tribes that have had least intercourse
                    with the Chinese show a considerable amount of skill in the arts of
                    civilization. The houses, for instance, of the village of Ka-fri-ang in the
                    south are described by Rev. W. Campbell as “built of stone, tiled with immense
                    slabs of a slaty kind of rock, and fitted up within with accommodation for
                    sleeping comfortably as well as for cooking, and for storing up abundance of
                    materials for personal and household use.” Manchester prints and other European
                    goods are in pretty general use; and the women, who make a fine native cloth
                    from hemp, introduce coloured threads from the foreign stuffs, so as to produce
                    ornamental devices. The office of chieftain is sometimes held by women.
                    Intermarriage between the Chinese and the natives is very common.</p>
                <p>The Chinese portion of the island was till 1876 divided into the districts of
                    Komalan, Tam-sui, Chang-hua, Kia-i, Tai-wan, Feng-shan, of which Komalan or
                    Kapsiulangting was the only one on the eastern side; but the districts of
                    Komalan and Tam-sui have been abolished, and a department of North Formosa
                    established with three dependent magistracies. A highway runs from Bangka in the
                    north to Pangliavu in the south. Beginning at the north we find the following
                    places of importance :—Kelung, the ancient Pe-Kiang, a treaty port in the
                    neighbourhood of the mines; Tam-sui, or properly Howei or Hobay, also a treaty
                    port with 100,000 inhabitants, on the harbour of the same name, which is formed
                    by hills upwards of 2000 feet high and has a depth of 3∣ fathoms and a bar of 7⅜
                    feet; Twa-tu-tia, about 13 miles up the Tam-sui river in a tea district, and
                    possessing a population of 20,000; Mengka, Bangka, or Banca, a little higher up
                    the river, one of the most flourishing commercial towns in the north, with
                    30,000 inhabitants; Teukcham or Teuxham, a walled town at the head of the
                    Tam-sui district, with a population of 40,000 inhabitants; Heong-san and
                    Tiong-Kang, both near the coast; Oulan and Suikang, both inland; Changhwa the
                    capital of a district, and the second city in the island, with a population of
                    60,000 or 80,000; Chip-Chip, a large town inhabited solely by Chinese; Kagee, or
                    Chin-la-san, and Ung-Kan-bay; Kok-si-Kong, with a small harbour; Taiwanfu, the
                    capital of the island, with 30,000 inhabitants (or, according to another
                    statement, 100,000), a treaty port, and the remains of the Dutch port of
                    Zelandia; Takao or Takow, also a treaty port, in 22° 37' N. lat., 120° 16' E.
                    long., to the south of Ape’s Hill; Pataou or Pitau, a few miles inland, the
                    Feng-shan-hsien of ancient documents; and Tang-Kang, a town of 20,000
                    inhabitants. Besides these there are many places of several thousands of a
                    population, and the whole of the Chinese territory is dotted . with villages and
                    hamlets. The whole island is estimated to contain from one and a half to two
                    million souls, the smaller number being probably nearer the truth. The Chinese
                    influence is rapidly spreading, and the island is more and more attracting the
                    attention of foreigners.</p>
                <p>The island of Formosa must have been known from a very early date to the Chinese
                    who were established in the Pescadores. The inhabitants are mentioned in the
                    official works of the Yuan dynasty as Tung-fan or southern barbarians; and under
                    the Ming dynasty the island begins to appear as Kilung. In the beginning of the
                    16th century it began to be known to the Portuguese and Spanish navigators, and
                    the latter at least made some attempts at establishing settlements or missions.
                    The Dutch were the first, however, to take footing in the island; in 1624 they
                    built a fort, Zelandia, on the east coast, where has since risen the town of
                    Taiwan, and the settlement was maintained for thirty-seven years. On the
                    expulsion of the Ming dynasty in China a number of their defeated adherents came
                    over to Formosa, and, under a leader called in European accounts Coxinga,
                    succeeded in expelling the Dutch and taking possession of a good part of the
                    island. In 1682 the Chinese of Formosa recognized the emperor Kanghi, and since
                    then it has formed part of the empire. In 1714 the Jesuit mathematicians from
                    the court visited the island. In 1782 occurred a most destructive storm, which
                    laid the public buildings in ruins and wrecked twenty-seven of the imperial
                    war-ships; and in 1788 there broke out a violent rebellion, which was put down
                    only after the loss, it is said, of 100,000 (?) men by disease and sword, and
                    the expenditure of 2,000,000 taels of silver. In the early part of the present
                    century the island was principally known to Europeans on account of the wrecks
                    which took place on its coasts, and the dangers that the crews had to run from
                    the cannibal propensities of the aborigines, and the almost equally cruel
                    tendencies of the Chinese. Among the most notable cases was the loss in 1842 of
                    the British brig “Ann,” with fiftyseven persons on board, of whom forty-three
                    were executed at Taiwan. By the treaty of Tientsin (1860) Taiwan was opened to
                    European commerce, but Mr Swinhoe found the place quite unsuitable for a port of
                    trade, and the harbour of Tam-sui was selected instead. Shortly afterwards a
                    rebellion broke out, to which several of the Chinese authorities fell victims;
                    and for some time the condition of the foreign settlers was rather precarious,
                    while the trade of the new port was so small that it was proposed to relinquish
                    the consulate. In 1865 Dr Maxwell of the English Presbyterian Church established
                    a medical mission first at Taiwan and afterwards at Takao; and the organization
                    thus originated comprised in 1877 thirteen churches among the Chinese, and as
                    many among the aborigines of the southern provinces, with upwards of 1000
                    baptized converts and 3000 attendants at worship. The northern provinces are in
                    the hands of the Presbyterian Church of Canada, which commenced its operations
                    in 1872, and had nine stations in 1877. A Roman Catholic mission has also been
                    in existence in the island since 1859. In 1867 the United States consul at Amoy
                    made a treaty with Tok-a-Tok, a chief of the aborigines of the southern part of
                    the island, by which the safety of foreigners was secured in that district. An
                    attack made on the Protestant and Roman Catholic missions at Feng-shan-hsien in
                    1868 led the British consul to authorize the occupation of Fort Zelandia and
                    Amping by Colonel Gordon; but his action was afterwards disapproved by the home
                    Government, and the indemnity demanded from the Chinese restored. In 1872 the
                    crew of a Japanese vessel shipwrecked on the coast being murdered by the
                    savages, the Japanese Government sent an expedition to punish the assassins, and
                    a war between China and Japan would have been the consequence if Wade the
                    English ambassador had not succeeded in bringing them to terms,—China agreeing
                    to pay 500,000 taels as compensation to the friends of the murdered men and to
                    purchase the houses, &amp;c., erected by the Japanese, and the Japanese on their
                    side withdrawing their troops and giving up all claims to occupation. According
                    to Mr Hewlett’s report for 1872, the political state of the island is very bad;
                    the official classes, he says, have a proverb “every three years an outbreak,
                    every five a rebellion,” and the reason of this instability is to be found in
                    their own rapacity and glaring violations of justice. A more hopeful account is
                    given by Mr Morrison in 1877; under the enlightened government of Ting, formerly
                    <hi rend="italic">futai</hi> of Fuhchow, roads are being constructed throughout
                    the Chinese territory, and other measures adopted for the development of its
                    resources. A telegraph has been laid between Taiwanfu and Takao; and the
                    proposal to make a railway from the south to the north of the island is being
                    seriously discussed. A fort was built at Anping (the port of Taiwanfu) between
                    1874 and 1876, and two others at Takow. A scheme is in operation for the
                    military reduction of the east coast districts, and a road is being pushed south
                    from Sauo.</p>
