                <p><label type="entry">FLAG</label>. It is probable that almost as soon as men began
                    to collect together for common purposes some kind of conspicuous object was
                    used, as the symbol of the common sentiment, as the rallying point of the common
                    force. In military expeditions where any degree of organization and discipline
                    prevailed, objects of such a kind would be necessary to mark out the lines and
                    stations of encampment, and to keep in order the different bands when marching
                    or in battle. And, in addition to all this, it cannot be doubted that flags or
                    their equivalents have often served, by reminding men of past resolves, past
                    deeds, past heroes, to rally to enthusiasm those sentiments of <hi rend="italic"
                    >espιfit</hi><hi rend="italic">de corps,</hi> of family pride and honour, of
                    personal devotion, patriotism, or religion, upon which, as well as upon good
                    leadership, discipline, and numerical force, success in warfare depends.</p>
                <p>Among the remains of that people which has left the earliest traces of
                    civilization, the records of the forms of objects used as ensigns are frequently
                    to be found. From their carvings and paintings, supplemented by ancient writers,
                    it appears that the several companies of the Egyptian army had their own
                    particular standards. These were formed of such objects as there is reason to
                    believe were associated in the minds of the men with feelings of awe and
                    devotion. Sacred animals, boats, emblems, or figures, a tablet bearing a king’s
                    name, fan and feathershaped symbols, were raised on the end of a staff as
                    standards, and the office of bearing them was looked upon as one of peculiar
                    privilege and honour (fig. 1). Some-vſhat similar seem to have been the customs
                    of the Assyrians and Jews. Among the sculptures unearthed by Layard and others
                    at Nineveh, only two different designs have been noticed for standards; one is
                    of a figure drawing a bow and standing on a running bull, the other of two bulls
                    running in opposite directions (fig. 2). These, says Layard, Mr Birch supposes
                    may resemble the emblems of war and peace which were attached to the yoke of
                    Darius’s chariot. They are borne upon and attached to chariots, which method of
                    bearing these objects was the custom also of the Persians, and prevailed during
                    the Middle Ages. No representations of Egyptian or Assyrian naval standards have
                    been found, but the sails of ships were embroidered and ornamented with devices,
                    which was also a custom during the Middle Ages. In both Egyptian and Assyrian
                    examples, the staff bearing the emblem is frequently ornamented immediately
                    below with flag-like streamers. Rabbinical writers have assigned the different
                    devices of the different Jewish tribes, but the authenticity cf their testimony
                    is extremely doubtful. Banners, standards, and ensigns are frequently mentioned
                    in the Bible. “Everyman of the children of Israel shall pitch by his standard,
                    with the ensign of their father’s house” (Num.</p>
                <p>ii. 2). “Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as
                    the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?” (Cant. vi. 10). See also Num.
                    ii. 10, x. 14; Ps. XX. ö, lx. 4; Cant. ii. 4; Is. v. 26, x. 18, lix. 19; Jer.
                    iv. 21.</p>
                <p>The Persians bore an eagle fixed to the end of a lance, and also represented the
                    sun, as their divinity, upon their standards, which appear to have been formed
                    of some kind of textile, and were guarded with the greatest jealousy by the
                    bravest men of the army. The Carian soldier who slew Cyrus, the brother of
                    Artaxerxes, was allowed the honour of carrying a golden cock at the head of the
                    army, it being the custom of the Carians to wear that bird as a crest on their
                    helmets. The North American Indians carried poles fledged with feathers from the
                    wings of eagles, and similar customs seem to have prevailed among other
                    semi-savage peoples.</p>
                <p>The Greeks bore a piece of armour on a spear in early times; afterwards the
                    several cities bore sacred emblems or letters chosen for their particular
                    associations,—the Athenians the olive and the owl, the Corinthians a pegasus,
                    the Thebans a sphinx, in memory of Oedipus, the Messenians their initial Μ, and
                    the Lacedaemonians A. A purple dress was placed on the end of a spear as the
                    signal to advance. The Dacians carried a standard representing a contorted
                    serpent, while the dragon was the military sign of many peoples,—of the Chinese,
                    Dacians, and Parthians among others,—and was probably first used, by the Romans
                    as the ensign of barbarian auxiliaries (see fig· <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi>)∙</p>
                <p>The question of the <hi rend="italic">signa</hi><hi rend="italic">militaria</hi>
                    of the Romans is a wide and very important one, having direct bearing on the
                    history of heraldry, and on the origin of national, family, and personal
                    devices. With them the custom was reduced to system. “Each century, or at least
                    each maniple,” says Meyrick, “had its proper standard and standard-bearers.” In
                    the early days of the republic a handful of hay was borne on a pole, whence
                    probably came the name <hi rend="italic">manipulus.</hi> The forms of standards
                    in later times were very various; sometimes a cross piece of wood was placed at
                    the end of a spear and surmounted by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0288-0277"/> figure of a hand in silver, below round or oval
                    discs, with figures of Mars or Minerva, or in later times portraits of emperors
                    or eminent generals (fig. 3). Figures of animals, as the wolf, horse, bear, and
                    others, were borne, and it was not until after the time of Marius that the eagle
                    became the special standard of the legion; the <hi rend="italic">vexillum</hi>
                    was a square piece of cloth fastened to a piece of wood fixed crosswise to the
                    end of a spear, somewhat resembling the mediaeval <hi rend="italic"
                    >gonfalon.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">labarum</hi> of later emperors was similar
                    in shape and fixing, and after Constantine bore the monogram of Christ (fig. 5,
                    A). The Roman standards were guarded with religious veneration in the temples at
                    Rome; and the reverence of this people for their ensigns was in proportion to
                    their superiority to other nations in all that tends to success in war. It was
                    not unusual for a general to order a standard to be cast into the ranks of the
                    enemy, to add zeal to the onset of his soldiers by exciting them to recover what
                    to them was perhaps the most sacred thing the earth possessed. The Roman soldier
                    swore by his ensign.</p>
                <p>Although in earlier times drapery was occasionally used for standards, and was
                    often appended as ornament to those of other material, it was probably not until
                    the Middle Ages that it became the special material of military and other
                    ensigns; and perhaps not until the practice of heraldry had attained to definite
                    nomenclature and laws does anything appear which is in the modern sense a
                    flag.</p>
                <p>The Bayeux tapestry, commemorating the Norman conquest of England, contains
                    abundant representations of the flags of the period borne upon the lances of the
                    knights of William’s army. They appear small in size, and pointed, frequently
                    indented into three points, and bearing pales, crosses, and roundels. One, a
                    Saxon pennon, is triangular, and roundly indented into four points; one banner
                    is of segmental shape and rayed, and bears the figure of a bird which has been
                    supposed to represent the raven of the warflag of the Scandinavian vikings (fig.
                    4). These flags and their charges are probably not really significant of the
                    people bearing them; for even admitting that personal devices were used at the
                    time, the figures may have been placed without studied intention, and so give
                    the general figure only of such flags as happened to have come under the
                    observation of the artists. The figures are probably rather ornamental and
                    symbolic than strictly heraldic,—that is, personal devices, for the same
                    insignia do not appear on the shields of the several bearers. The dragon
                    standard which he is known to have borne is placed near Harold; but similar
                    figures appear on the shields of Norman warriors, which fact has induced a
                    writer in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the Archaeological Association
                    (vol. xiii. p. 113) to suppose that, on the spears of the Saxons, they represent
                    only trophies torn from the shields of the Normans, and that they are not
                    ensigns at all. Standards in form much resembling these dragons appear on the
                    arch of Titus and the Trajan column as the standards of barbarians.</p>
                <p>At the battle of the Standard in 1138, the English standard was formed of the
                    mast of a ship, having a silver pyx at the top, and bearing three sacred
                    banners, dedicated severally to St Peter, St John of Beverley, and St Wilfred of
                    Ripon, the whole being fastened to a wheeled vehicle. Representations of
                    three-pointed, cross-bearing pennons are found on seals of as early date as the
                    Norman era, and the warriors in the first crusade bore three-pointed pennons. It
                    is possible that the three points with the three roundels and cross, which so
                    often appear on these banners, have some reference to the faith of the bearers
                    in the Trinity and in the crucifixion, for in contemporary representations of
                    Christ’s resurrection and descent into hell he bears a three-pointed banner with
                    cross above. The triple indentation so common on the flags of this period has
                    been supposed to be the origin of one of the honourable ordinaries—the pile.</p>
                <p>The powerful aid of religion seems ever to have been sought to give sanctity to
                    national flags, and the origin of many can be traced to a sacred banner, as is
                    notably the case with the oriflamme of France. The banner of William the
                    Conqueror was sent to him by the pope, and the early English kings fought under
                    the banners of Edward the Confessor and of St Edmund; while the clumsily blended
                    crosses of St George, St Andrew, and St Patrick still form the national ensign
                    of the three united kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, whose patron
                    saints they severally were. More secular characters were, however, not uncommon.
                    In 1244 Henry III. gave order for a “dragon to be made in fashion of a standard,
                    of red silk sparkling all over with fine gold, the tongue of which should be
                    made to resemble burning fire and appear to be continually moving, and the eyes
                    of sapphires or other suitable stones. The <hi rend="italic">Siege of
                    Carlaverock,</hi> an Anglo-Norman poem of the 14th century, describes the
                    heraldic bearings on the banners of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0289-0278"/> the knights present with Edward I. at the siege
                    of that fortress. Of the king himself the writer says—</p>
                <p>“En sa bannière trois luparte De or tin estoient mis en rouge;” and he goes on to
                    describe the kingly characteristics these may be supposed to symbolize. A MS. in
                    British Museum (one of Sir Christopher Barker’s Heraldic Collection, Hart 4632)
                    gives drawings of the standards of English kings from Edward III. to Henry
                    VIII., which are roughly but artistically coloured.</p>
                <p>The terms for describing a flag are the same as those applied in heraldry to the
                    corresponding parts of a shield. The part of a flag furthest from the point of
                    suspension is cιlled the “fly.” The principal varieties of flags borne during
                    the Middle Ages were the pennon, the banner, and the standard; guydhommes,
                    banderolls, pennoncells, streamers, &lt;fcc., may be considered as minor
                    varieties. The pennon (fig. 5, B) was a small personal ensign, pointed or
                    swallow-tailed, borne below the lance-head of its owner, and charged with his
                    armorial bearings in such a manner that they were in true position when the
                    lance was held horizontally for action. It was a strictly personal flag, and was
                    borne by every knight. Pennons were sometimes charged with the cross of St
                    George in place of the personal bearings. A manuscript of the 16th century
                    (Harl. 2358) in the British Museum, which gives minute particulars as to the
                    size, shape, and bearings of standards, banners, pennons, guidhommes, pencells,
                    &amp;c., says—“A pennon must be two and a half yards long, made round at the
                    end, and conteyneth the armes of the owner,” and warns that “from his standard
                    or streamer a man may flee, but not from his banner or pennon bearing his
                    arms,”</p>
                <p>The banner (fig. 5, C) was generally about square in form, charged in a manner
                    exactly similar to the shield of the owner, and borne by knights bannerets, and
                    all above them in rank. The rank of knights bannerets was higher than that of
                    ordinary knights, and they could be created on the field of battle only. It was
                    the custom, after a battle, for the king or commander in person to honour a
                    knight who had distinguished himself in the conflict, by tearing off the fly of
                    his knightly pennon, thus creating it a banner and its bearer a banneret. The
                    banner was not a personal ensign but that of a troop. Every baron, who in time
                    of war had furnished the proper number of men to his liege, was entitled to
                    charge with his arms the banner which they followed.</p>
                <p>The standard (fig. 5, D) was a large, long flag, gradually tapering towards the
                    fly, varying in size according to the rank of the owner, and generally divided
                    fesse-wise. The shape was not, however, by any means uniform during the Middle
                    Ages, nor were there any definite rules as to its charges It seems to have been
                    first used by Edward III., the head of whose standard was charged as his shield
                    of arms, and the fly powdered with <hi rend="italic">fleurs-de-lis</hi> and
                    lions. The Tudor manuscript mentioned above says of the royal standard of that
                    time—“The standard to be sett before the king’s pavillion or tente, and not to
                    be borne in battayle; to be in length eleven yards.” “Every standard and guydon
                    to have in the chief the cross of St George, the beast or crest with his devyce
                    and word, and to be slitt at the end.” The standard was always borne by an
                    eminent person, aud that of Henry V. at Agincourt is supposed to have been
                    carried upon a car, and to have preceded the king. The guidon borne by a leader
                    of horse “must be two yards and a half or three yards long, and therein shall no
                    armes be put, but only the man’s crest, cognizance, and devyce.” A streamer was
                    a long, tapering flag, and “shall stand in the top of a ship or in the
                    forecastle, and therein be put no armes but a man’s conceit or devyce, and may
                    be of length 20, 30, 40, or 60 yards, and is slitt as well as a guydhomme or
                    standard.” A pencil was a small streamer-like flag borne by an esquire.</p>
                <p>The present royal standard of England was hoisted on the Tower, January 1, 1801,
                    and is thus described:— Quarterly: first and fourth, gules, three lions passant
                    gardant, in pale, or, for England; second, or, a lion rampant, gules, within a
                    double tressure, flory counter flory of the last, for Scotland; third, azure, a
                    harp or, stringed argent, for Ireland. On an escutcheon of pretence were charged
                    the arms of the sovereign’s German dominions; but after the accession of Queen
                    Victoria these were removed. This flag is displayed at the main whenever the
                    sovereign or a member of the royal family is on board a ship, and is also
                    hoisted over the royal residence. The Admiralty flag stands next to this in
                    importance, and is red charged, fesse-wise, with an anchor and cable. The
                    national ensign of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack, is the not altogether
                    admirable result of an attempt to combine the several ensigns of the three
                    countries. St George had long been the patron saint of England, and his banner,
                    argent, a cross gules, its national ensign (fig. 6, A). St Andrew in the same
                    way was the patron saint of Scotland, and his banner, azure, a saltire argent,
                    the national ensign of Scotland (fig. 6, B), On the union of the two crowns,
                    James I. issued a proclamation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0290-0279"/> that “all subjects of this isle and the kingdom
                    of Great Britain should bear in the main-top the red cross commonly called St
                    George’s cross and the white cross commonly called St Andrew’s cross, joined
                    together according to the form made by our own heralds.” This was the first
                    Union Jack (fig. 6, D). After the union with Ireland in 1801 a new ensign was
                    ordered to be prepared which should combine the cross of St Patrick, a saltire
                    gules on a field argent (fig. 6, C), with the other two. The result was the
                    “meteor flag of England,” the present Union Jack (fig. 6, E). It seems to have
                    been produced in considerable contempt of heraldic rules, but excites no less
                    enthusiasm, respect, and obedience on that account. The flag of the lord
                    lieutenant of Ireland is the Union Jack, having in .the centre a blue shield
                    charged with a golden harp.</p>
                <p>The flags of the United States of America were very various before and after the
                    Declaration of Independence; and even after the introduction of the stars and
                    stripes, these underwent many changes in the manner of their arrangement before
                    taking the position at present established. Historical events have also caused
                    great changes in the standards and national ensigns of France. The ancient kings
                    bore the blue hood of St Martin upon their standards, and this was succeeded by
                    the oriflamme, which, originally, was simply the banner of the abbey of St Denis
                    At what precise period it became the sacred banner of all France is not known,
                    and even its appearance is very differently described in different writers.
                    Guillaume Guiart in his chronicle says—</p>
                <p>“Oriflambe est une bannière De cendal roujoiant et simple Sanz portraiture
                    d’autre affaire.”</p>
                <p>The oriflamme was succeeded in the 15th century by the white standard powdered
                    with <hi rend="italic">fleurs-de-lis,</hi> which itself gave place to the
                    standard of the empire, and is the “cornette blanche” for which Chambord
                    contends. The imperial standard was blue, bearing a golden eagle, and powdered
                    with golden bees. The tricolor was introduced at the time of the Revolution, and
                    is divided vertically into three parts, coloured blue, white, and red—the red to
                    the fly, and the white in the middle. The origin of this flag and its colours is
                    a disputed question. It is said by some to have been intended to combine the
                    colours of the St Martin’s banner, of the oriflamme, and of the white flag of
                    the Bourbons; by others the colours are said to be those of the city of Paris;
                    and other authorities assert that the flag is copied from the shield of the
                    Orleans family as it appeared after Philip Égalité had knocked off the <hi
                    rend="italic">fleurs-de-lis.</hi> The present standards and ensigns of existing
                    states are shown in Plate 1</p>
                <p>In the British army the standards of the cavalry are the same in colour as the
                    regimental facings; they bear the insignia, cipher, number, and honours of the
                    regiment, and are richly ornamented. Those of the household cavalry bear on a
                    crimson field the royal insignia. The colours of each infantry regiment are two
                    in number—the queen’s colour and the regimental colour. The former is the Union
                    Jack variously charged, the latter is in colour like the regimental facings, and
                    is charged with the honours, &lt;fcc., of the corps. The queen’s colour of
                    the-foot guards, however, is crimson, and its regimental colour the Union Jack.
                    The royal artillery and the rifles have no colours.</p>
                <p>Until 1864 the ships of the British navy bore three different ensigns. In that
                    year, however, her Majesty prescribed the discontinuance of the division of flag
                    officers into those of the red, blue, and white squadrons, and ordered that the
                    white ensign, with its broad and narrow pendants, should be thenceforward
                    established as the colours of the royal naval service, reserving the use of the
                    red and blue colours for special occasions. The white flag with St George’s
                    cross is borne by admirals, vice-admirals, and rear-admirals on their respective
                    masts. The blue ensigu is borne by ships in the service of public offices, and
                    also under certain restrictions by such ships as are commanded by officers of
                    the naval reserve. The red ensign is borne by all other British ships. Yacht
                    clubs are allowed, however, certain privileges; they mostly carry the blue
                    ensign with characteristic burgees. An admiral’s flag is displayed at the main,
                    a vice-admiral’s at the fore, and a rear-admiral’s at the mizen truck. Flag
                    officer is another name for admiral, and the flag ship in a fleet is the one
                    carrying the admiral’s flag.</p>
                <p>At sea the striking of the flag denotes surrender, and the flag of one country
                    being placed over that of another denotes the victory of the former. A yellow
                    flag denotes quarantine. The universally understood flag of truce is pure
                    white.</p>
                <p>Flags would obviously suggest themselves for use as siguals, and have no doubt
                    always more or less served for the purpose. The numerical systems of Sir Hume
                    Popham and Captain Marryatt were very serviceable but limited in application,
                    the sentences to which the numbers referred being arranged as in a dictionary.
                    By the new commercial code the signals represent consonants, and by means of
                    about a score of flags all the requisite communications can be made. A universal
                    international code of signals would no doubt be a benefit. (w. <hi
