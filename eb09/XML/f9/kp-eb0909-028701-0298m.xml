                    his commander lw was appointed propraetor of Tarentum and the neighbouring
                    district. His administrative abilities were recognized even in this subordinate
                    post, and in 202 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he was appointed one of a
                    commission of three to supplement the colony of Venusium, whose numbers had been
                    drained by the war with Hannibal. In 199 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he was
                    made quaestor, and the next year, skipping the regular stages of aedile and
                    praetor, he obtained the consulship, notwithstanding the opposition of the
                    tribunes on account of his youth. The scanty records of his early years furnish
                    nothing which will adequately account for this marvellously rapid promotion, but
                    it is explained and justified by his subsequent career. Flamininus was one of
                    the first and most successful of the rising school of Roman statesmen, the
                    opponents of the narrow and almost provincial patriotism of which Cato was the
                    type, the disciples of Greek culture, and the advocates of a wide imperial
                    policy. His winning manners, his polished address, his knowledge of men, and the
                    personal fascination which was mainly owing to these qualities, and lastly his
                    knowledge of Greek, which, according to +lutarch, he spoke like his native
                    language, all marked him out as the fittest representative of Rome in the East,
                    and it was an auspicious lot for ’Rome which assigned to the consul the province
                    of Macedonia, and the conduct of the war with Philip. No sooner was he appointed
                    than he set to work to collect new levies, selecting the picked veterans who had
                    served in the Spanish and African campaigns. His predecessors in the province,
                    Sulpicius and Publius, had been dilatory and incompetent, not quitting Rome till
                    their year of office had nearly expired. Flamininus sailed in the early spring,
                    and, leaving his troops at Corcyra to follow him, crossed in a single galley to
                    the mainland and hurried to the Roman camp in Epirus, dismissed his predecessor
                    Publius Villius, and in a council of war determined to storm the pass of
                    Antigonea, a narrow gorge a little below Clissoura, which was occupied by the
                    enemy. Repulsed in the direct attack, he consented to parley with Philip, and
                    the two commanders met on the banks of the Aous and conversed across the narrow
                    stream. Flamininus at once revealed his intended policy, and in stern and
                    uncompromising terms demanded the liberation of Greece and Thessaly. Philip
                    indignantly broke up the conference, exclaiming that harder terms could not have
                    been proposed to him had he been conquered. This bold attitude of defiance and
                    assertion of the claims of oppressed nationalities was in a great measure the
                    secret of Flamininus’s success. The news soon spread that a Roman had come, not
                    to transfer the yoke of slavery, but to vindicate the liberties of Greece.
                    Charops, an Epirot chieftain, revealed to Flamininus a by-path across the
                    mountains by which the pass could be turned; a signal fire showed that the
                    expedition had succeeded; and a simultaneous attack in front and rear completely
                    routed the Macedonians, who were only saved from total destruction by the nature
                    of the ground, which rendered pursuit impossible. Flamininus found himself
                    master of Epirus, and he cemented a lasting friendship with the Epirots by his
                    mildness and moderation, which contrasted with the extortions and ravages of
                    Philip. From Epirus he passed into Thessaly, and took Phaloria, though he was
                    obliged to raise the siege of Atrax on the Peneus. Thence he marched into
                    Locris, where Anticyra served him as a basis for further operations, and enabled
                    him to communicate with the fleet, which was commanded by his brother Lucius.
                    Many towns in Phocis opened their gates to him, and Elatea the capital was taken
                    after a long resistance. His principal efforts were now directed to win over the
                    Achaean league, and in this he was so far successful that a conference of the
                    Greeks was held near Nicaea on the Meliac gulf, under his presidency, to treat
                    with Philip. A truce of two months was agreed to, on condition of the evacuation
                    of all the towns of Phocis and Locris, to enable both parties to send deputies
                    to Rome. The Greek deputies were instructed to demand the expulsion of
                    Macedonian garrisons from Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth, as the only guarantee
                    for the freedom of Greece. When the senate demanded of Philip’s ambassadors
                    whether he was ready to grant these terms, they replied that they had no
                    instructions, and were sent back and told to treat directly with Flamininus,
                    whose command, which was just expiring, they <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0299-0288"/> extended for a second year. Flamininus, having
                    thus secured his own object, showed no disposition to temporize with Philip, and
                    the negotiations were abruptly broken off. The perfidy of Nabis, the tyrant of
                    Sparta, secured him a valuable ally and the help of Argos, which Philip had
                    delivered over to Nabis to garrison. Thebes, and with it Baeotia, was gained
                    over partly by persuasion and partly by stratagem, and in the ensuing spring,
                    197 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Flamininus took the field with nearly all
                    Greece at his back. After a cavalry skirmish near Pherae, the main armies met at
                    Cynoscephalae, a low range of hills so called from a fanciful resemblance to
                    dogs’ heads. It was the first time that the Macedonian phalanx and the Roman
                    legion had met in open fight, and the day decided which nation was to be master
                    of Greece and perhaps of the world. It was a victory of intelligence over brute
                    force, and, where numbers and courage were equally matched, the superior
                    strategy and presence of mind of the Roman general turned the scale. The left
                    wing of the Roman army was retiring in hopeless confusion before the deep and
                    serried ranks of the Macedonian right led by Philip in person, when Flamininus,
                    leaving them to their fate, boldly charged the left wing under Nicanor, which
                    was forming on the heights. The phalanx was like a steam hammer, irresistible if
                    it hit its object, but moving only in one direction, and easily thrown out of
                    gear. Before the left wing had time to form, Flamininus was upon them, and a
                    massacre rather than a fight ensued. This defeat was turned into a general rout
                    by a nameless tribune who collected twenty companies and charged in rear the
                    victorious Macedonian phalanx, which in its pursuit had left the Roman right far
                    behind. 8000 Macedonians were killed and 5000 taken prisoners, while the Romans
                    lost only 700. Macedonia was now at the mercy of Rome, and Flamininus might have
                    dictated what terms he liked, but he showed his usual moderation and
                    farsightedness in disregarding the root-and-branch politics of his Aetolian
                    allies, whose heads were turned by the part they had taken in the victory, and
                    contenting himself with his previous demands. Philip lost all his foreign
                    possessions, but retained his Macedonian kingdom almost entire. Such a valuable
                    bulwark against the outer world of Thracians and Celts was not lightly to be
                    removed. Ten commissioners arrived from Rome to regulate the final terms of
                    peace, and at the Isthmian games which were celebrated at Corinth in the spring
                    of 196 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a herald proclaimed to the assembled
                    crowds that “the Roman people, and T. Quinctius their general, having conquered
                    King Philip and the Macedonians, declare all the Greek states which had been
                    subject to the king henceforward free and independent.” A shout of joy arose so
                    loud that it was heard by the sailors in the harbour, and in Plutarch’s time the
                    legend told how birds flying over the course had dropped down stunned by the
                    noise. The games were forgotten, and all crowded round the proconsul eager to
                    kiss the hands of the liberator of Greece, who was almost smothered with
                    chaplets and garlands. This day was indeed the climax of Flamininus’s career, of
                    which even the stately triumph that two years later he obtained at Rome must
                    have seemed but a pale reflection.</p>
                <p>Of the rest of his public life, which was mainly occupied iα consolidating the
                    fruits of the victory of Cynoscephalae, we can only give the barest outline; but
                    we will first attempt to estimate his work, and discuss how far he merited the
                    proud title of benefactor of Greece, which Greeks and Romans alike bestowed on
                    him. That he was animated by an ardent love of the Greek name and race, as
                    genuine as that of Byron, of Canning, or of Kanaris, admits of no reasonable
                    doubt. To attribute to Flamininus a Macchiavel-lian policy, as if he could have
                    foreseen Corinth overthrown and Achaia turned into a Roman province, is not only
                    disingenuous but absurd. There is more force in the charge which Mommsen brings
                    against him, that his Hellenic sympathies prevented him from seeing the innate
                    weakness and mutual jealousies of the Greek states of that period, whose only
                    hope of peace and safety lay in submitting to the protectorate of the Roman
                    republic. But if the event proved that the liberation of Greece was a political
                    mistake, it was a noble and generous mistake, and reflects nothing but honour on
                    the name of Flamininus.</p>
                <p>The only military enterprise that remained after the conquest of Philip was to
                    crush Nabis, who still held Argos, as well as his own tyranny of Sparta. In
                    allowing the conquered tyrant to retain his native possessions, Flamininus was
                    probably influenced by consideration for the Spartans, who would never, except
                    under compulsion, have submitted to the Achaean league.</p>
                <p>His last act before returning home is characteristic of the man. Of the Achaeans,
                    who vied with one another in showering upon him honours and rewards, he asked
                    but one personal favour, the redemption of the Italian captives who had been
                    sold as slaves in Greece during the Hannibalic war. These to the number of 1200
                    were presented to him on the eve of his departure, and formed the chief ornament
                    of his triumph.</p>
                <p>In 192 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> on the rupture between the Romans and
                    Antiochus, Flamininus returned to Greece, this time as the civil representative
                    of Rome. His personal influence and skilful diplomacy secured the wavering
                    Achaean states, cemented the alliance with Philip, and contributed mainly to the
                    Roman victory of Thermopylae. Chalcis and Naupactus, which had joined the enemy,
                    owed their preservation to his interposition with the consul Glabrio. In 189 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he was made censor. In this office his fair fame was
                    sullied by an unseemly quarrel with Cato. Brotherly affection tempted him to
                    shield from just punishment a dissolute and brutal ruffian. In 183 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he undertook an embassy to Prusias, to induce the
                    king of Bithynia to deliver up Hannibal. Hannibal forestalled his fate by taking
                    poison, and his dying words justly stigmatized this pitiful victory over a
                    defenceless and destitute old man. The only excuse for his conduct is that it
                    was prompted not by wanton cruelty or love of revenge,—motives which were wholly
                    alien to his character,—but by restless ambition and an inordinate love of
                    glory, the infirmities of a truly noble nature. The history of his later years
                    is a blank, and we only learn from his biographer Plutarch that his end was
                    peaceful and happy. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. s.)</hi></p>
