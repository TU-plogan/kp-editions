                <p><label type="entry">FERDINAND VI</label>. (1713-1759), king of Spain, sometimes
                    called the Sage, the younger son of Philip V. and Maria Louisa of Savoy, was
                    born at Madrid, September 23, 1713. On the death of his elder brother Louis in
                    172 5, Ferdinand was proclaimed prince of the Asturias; and in 1729 he was
                    betrothed to Barbara, daughter of J ohn V. of Portugal. He succeeded his father
                    on July 9,1746. Since 1739 Spain had been involved in protracted war, first with
                    England in consequence of disputes relative to British interests in the West
                    Indies, and afterwards, since 1740, with Austria on the accession of Maria
                    Theresa. It was Ferdinand’s first endeavour on coming to the throne to secure
                    peace for his exhausted country, and one of the earliest acts of his government
                    was to order the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Italy (August 1746). Soon
                    afterwards negotiations were opened for peace with England; and these, though
                    frequently interrupted, ultimately resulted in the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
                    which terminated the war of the Austrian succession, thus restoring peace to
                    Europe (October 1748). Weak in health and despondent in temperament, Ferdinand
                    had no inclination thenceforward to take an active part in European affairs, and
                    the management of the public business he abandoned almost entirely to his
                    ministers Ensenada, <pb break="no"

                    found it necessary to take into their counsels the queen, to whom Ferdinand was
                    much attached, the royal confessor Rabago, and the singer Farinelli, whose
                    musical powers had given him extraordinary influence. During this reign the
                    condition of Spanish finance was much improved; agriculture, commerce, and the
                    arts were encouraged; by a concordat with Pope Benedict XIV., in 1753, many
                    abuses of ecclesiastical patronage were reformed; nor were the affairs of the
                    army and navy neglected. On the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War in 1756, Spain
                    steadfastly maintained a strict neutrality, notwithstanding the repeated efforts
                    both of France and of England to secure her intervention, the former offering
                    Minorca and the latter Gibraltar as the price of her assistance. On the death of
                    his consort in 1758, Ferdinand fell into a profound melancholy, which issued in
                    a confirmed insanity, under which he died at Villaviciosa on the 10th of August
                    1759. Leaving no issue, he was succeeded, in terms of the treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, by his half-brother Charles IIL Though he was in no sense an
                    able sovereign, and was remarkable for nothing unless for a pacific and kindly
                    disposition, his reign was an exceptionally prosperous one for Spain, and
                    critics generally concur in the observation of Coxe that, “since the elevation
                    of the house of Bourbon to the throne of Spain, no period occurs in which the
                    interests and independence of the kingdom were so well and so consistently
                    supported as during the reign of Ferdinand VL”</p>
