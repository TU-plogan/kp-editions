                    botanist Leonhard Fuchs <hi rend="italic">(v. supra),</hi> a genus of plants of
                    the natural order <hi rend="italic">Onagracece,</hi> characterized by entire,
                    usually opposite leaves; pendent flowers; a funnel-shaped, brightly coloured,
                    quadripartite, deciduous calyx; 4 petals, alternât-ing with the calycine
                    segments; 8, rarely 10, exserted stamens, a long and filiform style, and
                    inferior ovary; and fleshy, ovoid, many-seeded berries or fruit. All the members

                    America,—occurring in the interior of forests, or in damp and shady mountainous
                    situations. The various species differ not a little in size as well as in other
                    characters; some, as <hi rend="italic">F. verrucosa,</hi> being dwarf shrubs;

                    a species of fuchsia from Chili, which is described, though not evidently so
                    figured, as having a pentamerous calyx. The <hi rend="italic">F. coccinea</hi>
                    of Aiton (see Dr J. D. Hooker, <hi rend="italic">J. Proc. Linnean</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> Botany, vol. x. p. 458, 1867), the first species of
                    fuchsia cultivated in England, where it was long confined to the greenhouse, was
                    brought from South America by Captain Firth in 1788, and placed in Kew Gardens.
                    Of this species Mr Lee, a nurseryman at Hammersmith, soon afterwards obtained an
                    example, and procured from it by means of cuttings several hundred plants, which
                    he sold at a guinea each. In 1823 <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    of interest began to make their appearance. The numerous hybrid forms now
                    existing are the result chiefly of the intercrossing of that or other
                    long-flowered with globose-flowered plants. <hi rend="italic">F. Venus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">victrix,</hi> raised by Mr Gulliver, gardener to the Rev. S.
                    Marriott of Horsemonden, Kent, and sold in 1822 to Messrs Cripps, was the
                    earliest white-sepalled fuchsia, and is one of the best of its kind for
                    hybridization. The first fuchsia with a white corolla w as produced about 1853
                    by Mr Storey. In some varieties the blossoms are variegated, and in others they
                    are double. There appears to be very little limit to the number of forms to be
                    obtained by careful cultivation and selection. To hybridize, the flower as soon
                    as it opens is emasculated, and it is then fertilized with pollen from some
                    different flower. As seed in the high-bred varieties of fuchsia is produced in
                    but small quantity, it is worth, if it will germinate, at least 50 guineas an
                    ounce (see H. Cannel, <hi rend="italic">Gardeners Mag.,</hi> 1875, p. 251). To
                    procure the seed, which when good is firm and plump, the ripe pods are sun-dried
                    for a few days, and then crushed between the finger and thumb; the seed is next
                    cleansed in water from the surrounding pulp, dried in saucers, and wrapped in
                    paper for use. It is sown about February or March in light, rieh, well-drained
                    mould, and is thinly covered with sandy soil, and watered. A temperature of
                    70°-75° Fahr, has been found suitable for raising. The seedlings are pricked off
                    into shallow pots or pans, and when 3 inches in height are transferred to 3-inch
                    pots, and are then treated the same as plants from cuttings (v. <hi
                    rend="italic">infſt.</hi> Fuchsias may be grafted as readily as camellias,
                    preferably by the splice or whip method, the apex of a young shoot being

                    propagation is by cuttings. As one of the most expeditious ways of procuring
                    these, Loudon recommends to put plants in heat in January, and to take their
                    shoots when three inches in length. For summer flowering in England they are
                    best made about the end of August, and should be selected from the
                    shortest-jointed young wood. Coarse brown sand intermixed with a little
                    leaf-mould, with a surface-layer of silver-sand, affords them a good soil for
                    striking. In from two to three weeks they may be put into 3∙inch pots containing
                    a compost of equal parts of rich loam, silver-sand, and leafmould. They are
                    subsequently moved from the frame or bed, first to a warm and shady, and then to
                    a more airy part of the greenhouse. In January a little artificial heat may be
                    given, to be gradually increased as the days lengthen. The side-shoots are
                    generally pruned when they have made three or four joints, and for bushy plants
                    the leader is stopped soon after the first potting. Care is taken to keep the
                    plants as near the glass as possible, and shaded from bright sunshine, also to
                    provide them plentifully with water, except at the time of shifting, when the
                    roots should be tolerably dry. For the second potting a suitable soil is a
                    mixture of well-rotted cow-dung or old hotbed mould with leaf mould and sandy
                    peat, and to promote drainage a little peat-moss may be placed immediately over
                    the crocks in the lower part of the pot. Weak liquid manure greatly promotes the
                    advance of the plants, and should be regularly supplied twice or thrice a week
                    during the flowering season. After this, water is gradually withheld from them,
                    and they may be placed in the open air to ripen their wood. The common garden

                    down and covered with 4-6 inches of dry ashes (Smee), and many other species may
                    be grown in the open air if afforded a little protection from frosts. <hi

                    p. 284). The nectar of fuchsia flowers has been shown by Mr A. S. Wilson <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rep. Brit. Assoc.,</hi> 1878) to contain nearly 78 per cent, of
                    cane sugar, the remainder being fruit sugar. The berries of some fuchsias are
                    subacid or sweet, and edible. From certain species a dye is obtainable. The
                    so-called “native fuchsias” of Southern and Eastern Australia are plants of the
