                    Huguenot family, the Greniers of Languedoc. The titles of Comte de Hautserre et
                    de Fonblanque were conferred by Henry IV. on the sons of the famous Sieur Pierre
                    de Grenier, known in history by his gallant defence of the castle of Cessenau
                    against the Due de Montmorenci in 1584. After the revocation of the edict of
                    Nantes, the Greniers underwent severe persecutions on account of their devotion
                    to the Huguenot cause; and in 1740, Abel de Grenier, Comte de Fonblanque, sent
                    his two sons, Antoine and Jean, to England that they might be educated in the
                    Protestant faith. John became nationalized in this country under the name of
                    Fonblanque; and his son, John Samuel Martin Fonblanque, a distinguished equity
                    lawyer, and the author of a standard legal work, a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Equity,</hi> became the father of the most brilliant journalist of his day. The
                    father of Albany Fonblanque was, like his son, a staunch Liberal; he represented
                    the borough of Camelford in parliament; and throughout his career was remarkable
                    for the integrity and courage, as well as for the ability, with which he
                    supported Liberal principles.</p>
                <p>The subject of the present notice was born in London in 1793. At fourteen he was
                    sent to Woolwich to prepare for the Royal Engineers. His health, however,
                    failed, and for two years his studies had to be suspended. Upon his recovery, he
                    studied for some time with Chitty, the eminent special pleader, with a view to
                    being called to the bar. Fonblanque had no inclination for law, but he valued
                    very highly the course of training he thus obtained, and in after life
                    maintained that a study of law should be included in a liberal education. At the
                    age of nineteen (1812) he commenced writing for the newspapers, and very soon
                    attracted notice both by the boldness and liberality of his opinions, and by the
                    brilliance of his style. Fonblanque’s manner of working might have lent some
                    colour to the definition of genius as an infinite capacity for taking trouble.
                    His nephew, Mr Edward Fonblanque, to whose biography we are indebted for the
                    details given in this notice, tells us that in his earlier days he frequently
                    wrote an article ten times before sending it to press, and this not from
                    timidity or anxiety, for from the first his popularity was assured, but because
                    his own ideal of political thought and composition was infinitely higher than
                    that of the public.</p>
                <p>As a result of this arduous and earnest cultivation he soon obtained sufficient
                    popularity as a journalist to be able to renounce all idea of following law as a
                    profession; but at the same time that he was eagerly taking his share in all the
                    political struggles of this eventful period, he was also continuing his studies,
                    devoting no less than six hours a day to the study of classics and political
                    philosophy. Under this severe mental training his health once more broke down.
                    At the age of twenty-one he had a long and dangerous illness, and continued weak
                    and subject to nervous depression for the remainder of his life. His energy,
                    however, was not impaired. He became a regular contributor to the newspapers and
                    reviews, realizing a fair income, which, as his habits were simple and
                    temperate, secured him against pecuniary anxieties. From 1820 to 1830 Albany
                    Fonblanque was successively employed upon the staff of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle,</hi> whilst he
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >London Magazine,</hi> and to the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review.</hi> In
                    1828 the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> newspaper, which had been purchased by
                    the Rev. Dr Fellowes, the learned and amiable author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Religion of the Universe,</hi> &lt;fcc., was given over to Fonblanque’s
                    complete control; and for a period of seventeen years (1830 to 1847) he not only
                    sustained the high character for political independence and literary ability
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> had gained under the direction of
                    Leigh Hunt and his brother John Hunt, but even compelled his political opponents
                    to acknowledge a certain delight in the boldness and brightness of the wit
                    directed against themselves. When it was proposed that the admirers and
                    supporters of the paper should facilitate a reduction in its price by the
                    payment of their subscription ten years in advance, not only did Mr Edward
                    Bulwer (Lord Lytton) volunteer his aid, but also Mr Disraeli and Mr Clay, M.P.,
                    who were thus voluntarily prolonging the reign and spreading the influence of
                    the representative Radical organ. But the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> under
                    the direction of Fonblanque did not confine itself to the sphere of politics;
                    the fine arts, literature, and the drama occupied a due share of its attention.
                    Amongst its contributors were such men as Thackeray, Marmion Savage, John Stuart
                    Mill, Walter Savage Landor, Charles Dickens, &amp;c., names which do not belong
                    exclusively to any political party, but which, associated in the work of
                    criticism, give firm assurance that the “discovery of the best that is known and
                    thought in the world” (Mr Arnold’s admirable definition of the true function of
                    literary criticism) was for once at any rate in competent and impartial hands.
                    During his connexion with the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> Fonblanque had
                    many advantageous offers of further literary employment; but he devoted his
                    energies and talents almost exclusively to the service of the paper he had
                    resolved to make a standard of literary excellence in the world of journalism.
                    Whatever he wrote was as carefully prepared and revised as when he was only an
                    aspirant to fame; every reference made and every anecdote used as an
                    illustration he was careful to verify, and in Mr E. Fonblanque’s biography of
                    his distinguished relative are given several racy answers he received from Count
                    d’Orsay and others, concerning some witty story or saying which had taken his
                    fancy, but which he was too scrupulous to repeat from memory. Foublanque was
                    offered the governorship of Nova Scotia; but although he took great interest in
                    colonial matters, and had used every effort to advocate the more generous
                    political system which had colonial self-government for its goal, he decided not
                    to abandon his beloved <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> even for so sympathetic
                    an employment. In 1847, however, domestic reasons induced him to accept the post
                    of Statistical Secretary of the Board of Trade. This of course compelled him to
                    resign the editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> but he still
                    continued to contribute largely to the paper, which, under the control of John
                    Forster, continued to sustain its influential position. During the later years
                    of his life, Fonblanque took no prominent part in public affairs; and when he
                    died at the age of seventy-nine (1872) he seemed, as his nephew rightly
                    observes, “a man who had lived and toiled in an age gone by and in a cause long
                    since established.” The present generation, in the full enjoyment of those
                    reforms he had laboured so bravely and unweariedly to promote, found it
                    difficult to realize how much had been effected by Liberals of the stamp of
                    Albany Fonblanque, in days not so remote from our own after all, before the
                    passing of the Reform Act, when, to quote his own words—“The Test Acts were
                    unrepealed; the Catholics were excluded from the legislature; slavery existed in
                    our colonies; the prestige of the perfection of the law was unbroken, and the
                    sanguinary character of the criminal code unmitigated; the corporations were
                    sinks of corruption; a few individuals nominated nearly half the members of the
                    House of Commons; and a parliamentary reformer was in common acceptation another
                    word for a visionary.”</p>
                <p>The character of Albany Fonblanque’s political activity may be judged of by a
                    study of his <hi rend="italic">England under Seven Administrations,</hi> in
                    comparison with the course of social and political events in England from 1826
                    to 1837.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0374-0361"/>
                <p>Although these volumes contain only articles reprinted from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Examiner,</hi> they give a vivid and spirited history of one of the most
                    important and stormy phases of Parliamentary Reform. Fonblanque, although an
                    ardent upholder of popular rights and an uncompromising opponent of bigotry and
                    oppression, will never be found upon the side of violence or licence. The
                    Chartists received from no source more complete condemnation than from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> which consistently advocated the principle that
                    moral force was in every case to be relied upon, and that the liberties of the
                    constitution were to be enlarged by means which were also constitutional. “In
                    describing Lord Durham’s politics,” says Mr Edward Fonblanque, “he unconsciously
                    depicted himself. He was not a reformer of the republican class, but he occupied
                    as it were the frontier line of constitutional reform.” In a word, Fonblanque
                    was an honourable example of the constitutional Radical who follows after
                    liberty, but uses the pathway of the law. As a journalist, he must also be
                    regarded in the light of a reformer. Journalism before his day was regarded as a
                    somewhat discreditable profession: men of true culture were shy of entering the
                    hot and dusty arena lest they should be confounded with the ruder combatants who
                    fought there before the public for hire. But the fact that Fonblanque, a man not
                    only of strong and earnest political convictions but also of exceptional
                    literary ability, did not hesitate to choose this field as a worthy one in which
                    both a politician and a man of letters might usefully as well as honourably put
                    forth his best gifts, must have helped, in no small degree, to correct the old
                    prejudice.</p>
