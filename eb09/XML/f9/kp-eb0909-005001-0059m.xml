                    district of British India in the Allahâbâd division, under the jurisdiction of
                    the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, lies between 25° 26' 15"
                    and 26° 13' 0"N. lat., and 80° 19' 0" and 81° 25' 0" E. long. It is bounded on
                    the N. by Râi Bareli and Sultânpur, E. by Allahâbâd, S. by Harnirpur and Bandâ,
                    and W. by Cawnpur. Fathipur district is situated in the extreme south-eastern
                    corner of the <hi rend="italic">dudb</hi> or tract of the country between the
                    Ganges and the Jumna, which respectively mark its northern and southern
                    boundary. The whole district consists of an alluvial plain formed by the
                    deposits of the two great rivers. The central part is almost perfectly level,
                    and consists of highly cultivated land, interspersed with tracts impregnated
                    with saltpetre (tisαr) and jungle. A ridge of higher land, forming the watershed
                    of the district, runs along it from east to west at an average distance of about
                    five miles from the Ganges. Fathipur therefore consists of two inclined planes,
                    the one five miles broad, sloping down rapidly to the Ganges, and the other,
                    from fifteen to twenty miles broad, falling gradually to the Jumna. The country
                    near the banks of the two rivers is cut up into ravines and <hi rend="italic"
                    >nalas</hi> running in all directions, and is almost entirely uncultivable.
                    Besides the Ganges and Jumna, the only rivers of importance are the Pâudù, a
                    tributary of the Ganges, and the Rind and Νύη, which both fall into the Jumna.
                    The census of 1872 returned the population of Fathipur at 663,877, of whom
                    593,256 were Hindus, 70,554 Mahometans, and 5 Christians. The area of the
                    district is 1586 square miles, of which 871 are returned as cultivated, and 172
                    as cultivable. Two harvests are gathered during the year, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kharif or</hi> autumn crop, consisting chiefly of rice, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jοdr,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ba</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">jrd,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">rabi or</hi> spring crop,
                    consisting principally of wheat, barley, gram, oats, pease, &amp;c. The
                    principal lines of road are the'grand trunk road, which runs through the whole
                    length of the district from east to west, the Mughâl road to Khajwâ, and the
                    Bandâ road. The East Indian railway runs through the district parallel to the
                    grand trunk roads, having stations at Khâga, Barhampur, Fathipur, Malwa, and
                    Mohar.</p>
                <p>The civil station and principal town is Fathipur, situated on the grand trunk
                    road in 25° 57' N. lat. and 80° 54' E. long.; population 19,879. It is also
                    constituted a municipality, the municipal income in 1875 amounting to £1314, and
                    the expenditure to £1196. The town carries on a considerable trade in grain,
                    hides, grease, and soap. The other important trading towns are—Binki, the
                    largest grain and cattle mart in the district; Khajwâ, noted for its brass and
                    copper work; Korah, with a trade in metal <pb break="no"

                    market for grain and local produce. The revenue of the district in
                    1876was£165,409; the expenditure on civil administration, £54,404. The force for
                    the protection of person and property in 1875 consisted of 522 regular police,
                    costing £6732, and 1898 village watchmen, costing £6898. The schools in the
                    district numbered 260 in 1875, attended by 6416 pupils, and costing £2662 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l·</hi> The Fathipur charitable dispensary afforded medical
                    relief in 1875 to 410 indoor and 4863 outdoor patients. The climate is more
                    humid than in the other districts of the <hi rend="italic">dιιdb,</hi> and
                    although fevers are common, it is not considered an unhealthy district. The
                    average annual rainfall is 35 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 7 inches.</p>
                <p>The tract in which this district is comprised was conquered in 1194 by the
                    Pathâns; but subsequently, after a desperate resistance, it wa3 wrested from
                    them by the Mughals. In the 18th century it formed a part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">subah</hi> of Korah, and was under the government of the vizir of
                    Oudh. In 1765, by a treaty between the East India Company and the nawâb, Korah
                    was made over to the Delhi emperor, who retained it till 1772, when it was again
                    restored to the nawâb vizir’s dominions. Finally, in 1801, the nawâb, by treaty,
                    reconveyed it to the company in commutation of the amount which he had
                    stipulated to pay in return for the defence of his country. In June 1857, the
                    district rose in rebellion, and the usual murders of Europeans took place. Order
                    was established after the fall of Lucknow, on the return of Lord Clyde’s army to
                    Cawnpur.</p>
