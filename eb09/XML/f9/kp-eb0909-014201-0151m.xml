                <p><label type="entry">FIELDFARE</label>, Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Fealo-for
                    (</hi> = Fallow-farer), a largo species of Thrush, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turdus</hi><hi rend="italic">pilaris</hi> of Linnaeus— well known as a regular
                    and common autumnal visitor throughout the British Islands and a great part of
                    Europe, besides Western Asia, and even reaching Northern Africa. It is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Veldjakkeτ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Velddyster</hi> of the
                    Dutch, the <hi rend="italic">Wachholderdrossel</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kramtsvogel</hi> of Germans, the <hi rend="italic">Litorne</hi> of the French,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Cesena</hi> of Italians. This bird is of all Thrushes
                    the most gregarious in habit, not only migrating in large bands and keeping in
                    flocks during the winter, but even commonly breeding in society—200 nests or
                    more having been seen within a very small space. The birch-forests of Norway,
                    Sweden, and Russia are its chief resorts in summer, but it is known also to
                    breed sparingly in some districts of Germany. Though its nest has been many
                    times reported to have been found in Scotland, there is perhaps no record of
                    such an incident that is not open to doubt; and unquestionably the
                    Mistletoe-Thrush <hi rend="italic">(T. visciυorus)</hi> has been often mistaken
                    for the Fieldfare by indifferent observers. The head, neck, upper part of the
                    back, and the rump are grey; the wings, wing-coverts, and middle of the back are
                    rich hazel-brown; the throat is ochraceous, and the breast reddish-brown—both
                    being streaked or spotted with black, while the belly and lower wing-coverts are
                    white, and the legs and toes very dark brown. The nest and eggs resemble those
                    of the Blackbird (7 <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >merula),</hi> but the former is usually built high up in a tree, The
                    Fieldfare’s call-note is harsh and loud, sounding like <hi rend="italic"
                    >echaid</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">chat:</hi> its song is low, twittering, and
                    poor. It usually arrives in Britain about the middle or end of October, but
                    sometimes earlier, and often remains till the middle of May before departing for
                    its northern breeding-places. In hard weather it throngs to the berry-bearing
                    bushes which then afford it sustenance, but in open winters the flocks spread
                    over the fields in search of animal food—worms, slugs, and the larvae of
                    insects. In very severe seasons it will altogether leave the country, and then
                    return for a shorter or longer time as spring approaches. From the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">William of Palerne</hi> to the writers of our own day the
                    Fieldfare has occasionally been noticed by British poets with varying propriety.
                    Thus Chaucer’s association of its name with frost is as happy as true, while
                    Scott was more than unlucky in his well-known reference to its “lowly nest” in
                    the Highlands.</p>
                <p>Structurally very like the Fieldfare, but differing greatly in many other
                    respects, is the bird known in North America as the “Robin”—its ruddy breast and
                    familiar habits reminding the early British settlers in the New World of the
                    household favourite of their former homes. This bird, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turdus</hi><hi rend="italic">migratoriτιs</hi> of Linnaeus, has a wide
                    geographical range, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from
                    Greenland to Guatemala, and, except at its extreme limits, is almost everywhere
                    a very abundant species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is recorded as having occurred a few times in Europe and once even in
                    England <hi rend="italic">(Zook,</hi> 1877, p. 14); hut whether in any case it
                    has been a voluntary visitor may be regarded as doubtful.</p></note> As its
                    scientific name imports, it is essentially a migrant, and gathers in flocks to
                    pass the winter in the south, though a few remain in New England throughout the
                    year. Yet its social instincts point rather in the direction of man than of its
                    own kind, and it is not known to breed in companies, while it affects the
                    homesteads, villages, and even the parks and gardens of the large cities, where
                    its fine song, its attractive plumage, and its great services as a destroyer of
                    noxious insects, combine to make it justly popular, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
