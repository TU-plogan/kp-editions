                <p>Feudalism in a broad sense may be taken to mean a social organization based on
                    the ownership of land, and personal relations created by the ownership of
                    land,—a state of things in which public relations are dependent on private
                    relations, where political rights depend on landed rights, and the land is
                    concentrated in the hands of a few. Feudalism in this sense has existed, and
                    perhaps may still exist, in various parts of the world; but the feudal system
                    <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> is always understood to mean that special
                    form of feudalism which was developed on the soil of Gaul by the conquering
                    Franks. England had a feudalism of its own, developed simultaneously but
                    independently through the operation of similar causes. Just as the insular
                    feudalism had reached its maturity, the continental feudalism was brought over
                    ready-made by the Normans, and superimposed on the basis of the domestic
                    product. Thus our social state exhibits elements derived from both forms of
                    feudalism, in conjunction with fossil relics of still earlier institutions. Both
                    varieties of feudalism may be regarded as transition states, intervening between
                    the rough wild liberty of primitive society based on individualism and the
                    carefully organized liberty of modern society based on the effectual supremacy
                    of the law.</p>
                <p>Both forms of feudalism had their roots in the organization of primitive Germany.
                    A glance at that system is desirable for a thorough comprehension of our
                    subject; it will help us to realize what feudalism was, if not to discern how it
                    grew up. The leading characteristics of the Teutonic polity were individual
                    liberty and tribal autonomy. Each tribe or canton is theoretically independent,
                    and entitled to manage its own concerns; within the tribe all free heads of
                    houses are politically equal, and entitled to a voice in the affairs of the
                    community. Each free villager has his share of the tribe lands,—his homestead,
                    his propor tion of the arable land, with corresponding rights over the forest
                    and pasture lands. The shares are not necessarily equal, as social distinctions
                    exist, and are fully recognized by the law; but whether large or small, the
                    shares are held on the like terms of participation in all public duties, chief
                    of which are the obligations of attendance in the communal meetings and in the
                    host. The shares so held “bore among the northern nations the name of Odal or
                    Edhel.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Also known as

                    but their signification as applied to land is the same: the alod is the
                    hereditary estate derived from primitive occupation, for which the owner owes no
                    service except the personal obligation to appear in the host and in the
                    council.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stubbs, <hi

                    was not held incompatible with social inequality; the population was divided
                    into three classes, rated at different values in the legal tariff. First came
                    the <hi rend="italic">nobilis,</hi><hi rend="italic">eorl,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">oetheling,</hi> the man distinguished by ancestral wealth and

                    >ceorl;</hi> at the bottom of the social scale stood the serf or slave <hi

                    >servus,</hi><hi rend="italic">theow).</hi> An injury done to an <hi
                    rend="italic">eorl</hi> or his property would cost the offender twice or three

                    equal distance below the <hi rend="italic">ceorl</hi> ranks the slave, but the
                    compensation for injury done to him of course goes to his master. The official
                    magistracy <hi rend="italic">(principes)</hi> are selected from the ranks of the
                    nobility; very distinguished parentage will at times entitle a mere lad to high
                    office, but this is rare.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    gives weight and precedence in the national councils; above all, where a
                    powerful tribe or confederation of tribes think fit to exalt their dignity by
                    conferring regal honours on their chief, care is taken to select the king from
                    the family of noblest birth. But in critical times the instinct of a free people
                    taught that the claims of birth must give place to more weighty considerations:
                    whoever might be allowed to rule in time of peace, on the field of battle only
                    the man of tried ability could take the lead.<note anchored="true"

                    This, however, would hardly apply to the case of a monarchical tribe.</p></note>
                    Judicial and political business was transacted in the various national
                    assemblies held at fixed times, “generally at the new or full moon.” Local
                    questions and matters of police were determined in the meetings of the mark or
                    township <hi rend="italic">(vicus,</hi><hi rend="italic">dorff)</hi>; the higher
                    criminal jurisdiction and questions of a political nature were reserved for the
                    <hi rend="italic">malls</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gemotes</hi> of the hundred,
                    canton, or tribe <hi rend="italic">(gau,</hi><hi rend="italic">pagus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gens)·,</hi> “there was no distinction of place; all were free,
                    all appeared in arms.” The order of business was settled beforehand by the
                    chiefs in committee , a leading elder would open the debate; others followed as
                    the spirit moved them; the people decided as they thought fit. “Opposition was
                    expressed by loud shouts, assent by the striking of spears, enthusiastic
                    applause by the clash of spear and shield.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The analogy of popular meetings in other ages and countries will warrant the
                    belief that under ordinary circumstances the people would be greatly swayed by
                    the policy of their leaders, but the fact remains that the ultimate appeal was
                    to the people. So with the local judicial meetings: the position of the elected
                    <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> is “rather that of president than of judge;” all
                    the free men sit as his assessors. “Doubtless they both declared the law and
                    weighed the evidence.” The authority of the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> was
                    in all cases limited: “De minoribus rebus principes consultant; de majoribus
                    omnes.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tacitus, <hi
                    rend="italic">sup.</hi></p></note> Even the prerogatives of the monarchical
                    chiefs were subject to strict limitations. Their position was one of high honour
                    but not of irresponsible power. The practical influence of the chief, whether
                    exalted to royal dignity or not, depended largely upon the strength of his <hi
                    rend="italic">comitatus,</hi> or household retinue. This institution, “one of
                    the strangest but most lasting features” of early Aryan civilization, was an
                    arrangement “partly private and partly public in its character,” which served to
                    furnish “a sort of supplement to an otherwise imperfect organization.”<note

                    bond of partial vassalage, intended for mutual protection and support, by which
                    a freeman, even a man of noble birth, attached himself to a more powerful lord

                    the lord at his death. In return he was bound to espouse the cause of his lord
                    as against all men and by all means. The position of a favoured gesith was one
                    of comfort and social importance; but involving, as it did, the surrender of all
                    freedom of individual action, it probably entailed a certain diminution of
                    political status<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Britain, so in Gaul—the Germanic tribes came over as “nations in arms,” “with
                    their flocke and their herds, their wives and their little ones;” that they
                    brought their Germanic social and political organization with them; and that the
                    Merwing kingdom was mainly constructed on that basiβ—subject to modifications
                    introduced perforce by the circumstances of the conquest. In Britain it is clear
                    that the primitive political institutions were introduced <hi rend="italic">en
                    bloc,</hi> and took root; of the agrarian settlement effected, evidence is
                    lacking during the first centuries of the new order. When trustworthy data begin
                    to appear feudalism has already made large inroads on primitive alodialism. In
                    Gaul the chain of evidence is continuous, and it is beyond doubt that under the
                    first dynasty the tenure of land was still mainly alodial; that all the people
                    were bound to be faithful to the king as a national duty, and not by virtue of
                    special land tenure; that “the gift of an estate by the king involved no defined
                    obligation of service,” all the nation being still bound to military service;
                    that “the only comi tee were the <hi rend="italic">antrusl·ions,</hi> and these
                    few in number;” and that the supposed larger class of comites, the <hi
                    rend="italic">leudes,</hi> were in fact the whole body of the king’s good
                    subjects, in Anglo-Saxon phrase, his “hold.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>If we pass to the close of the 10th century, and take a survey of the social
                    condition of western Europe, we shall find all the principles of the primitive
                    Germanic society inverted. Political organization from being personal has become
                    territorial; “the ideas of individual freedom and political right” have * become
                    so much bound up with the relations created by the possession of land as to be
                    actually subservient to them.”</p>
                <p>Everything belongs either to the king or the lord. Thus in England the national
                    peace is now the king’s peace; the βtate domain—the folkland—is <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">regis.</hi> The township has become
                    the lord’s manor, the township waste the lord’s waste, the township court the
                    lord’s court. “Land has become the sacramental tie of all public relations; the
                    poor man depends on the rich, not as his chosen patron, but as the owner of the
                    land that he cultivates, the lord of the court to which he does suit and
                    service, tbe leader whom he is bound to follow to the host.”<note

                    >sup.,</hi> 167.</p></note> This dreary result was not acomplished in a day. But
                    the causes began to operate from a very early period. Even if each free
                    immigrant received his due family portion of land, a much larger allotment would
                    certainly be assigned to the leader, who might be considered to have contributed
                    most to the success of the undertaking; whole townships in a dependent position
                    might thus be established from the very first. The leaders of the migration of

                    military colonists encamped on the lands of others, led to a prolongation of
                    those powers. Strong government was an absolute necessity; consequently royalty,
                    previously unknown to the Anglo-Saxon tribes, makes its appearance as an
                    immediate consequence of the conquest. Five years after his landing the</p>

                    crushed, political wars and wars of succession between the invaders themselves
                    ensued, each struggle adding to the private possessions and political influence
                    of the victorious chief. “Everything, in fact, which disturbs the peaceful order
                    of the village system tends to the aggrandizement of the leading family and its

                    however, sprang from two great sources, tho beneficiary system and the practice
                    of “commendation.” “On Gallic 6θil it was specially fostered by the existence of
                    a subject population, which admitted of any amount of extension in the methods
                    of dependence.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stubbs,

                <p>The system of benefices had its origin partly in grants of land made by kings and

                    kinsmen, and servants, on terms of special fidelity,—analogous to, if not

                    >Beneficialwesen,</hi> 385, regards commendation as “placing a man in the
                    relation of comitatus to his lord;” and he makes the Frank antrustionship a link
                    between the primitive comitatus and later feudalism.</p></note> the weaker man
                    placed himself under the personal protection of a superior “without altering his
                    title or divesting himself of his estate: he became a vassal and did homage. The
                    placing of his hands between those of his lord was the typical act by which the
                    connexion was formed. And the oath of fealty was taken at the same time. The
                    union of the beneficiary tie with that of commendation completed the idea of
                    feudal obligation.” Both lord and “man” have a hold on the land; each has his
                    duty to the other,—the one to protect, the other to support. “A third ingredient
                    was supplied by the grants of immunity by which the dwellers on a feudal
                    property were placed under the tribunal of the lord, and the rights which had
                    belonged to the nation or its 6hosen head were devolved upon the receiver of a

                <p>The system so formed was of mingled origin. The beneficium “is partly of Roman
                    partly of German origin;” commendation might be traced up to the comitatus or
                    the Roman clientship, or possibly to Celtic usages of kindred ancestry.<note

                    All these elements, the benefice proper, the surrendered alod, the personal
                    commendation, the private jurisdiction, find their place in English as well as
                    in French history, but the elements were blended in different proportion, and
                    under external conditions of a different character. In England the tie of the
                    comitatus played an important part, and became the basis of the later
                    Anglo-Saxon nobility. On the Continent the comitatus was soon lost in “the

                    commendation was fostered by edicts of the central Government, requiring, for

                <p>“The weakness of the Karoling kings gave room tor the speedy development of
                    disruptive tendencies in a territory so extensive and so little consolidated.
                    The duchies and counties of the 8th and 9th centuries were still official
                    magistracies, the holders of which discharged the functions of imperial judges
                    or generals. Such officers were of course men whom the kings could trust, in
                    most cases Franks, courtiers or kinsmen, who at an earlier date would have been
                    <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> or <hi rend="italic">antrustions,</hi> and who
                    were provided for by feudal benefices. The official magistracy had in itself the
                    tendency to become hereditary, and when the benefice was recognized as
                    heritable, the provincial governorship became so too. But the provincial
                    governor had many opportunities of improving hisposition, especially if he could
                    throw himself into the manners and aspirations of the people he ruled. By
                    marriage or inheritance he might accumulate in his family not only the old
                    alodial estates which, especially on German soil, still continued to subsist,
                    but the traditions and local loyalties which were connected with the possession
                    of them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Abundant proof
                    of this position will be found in German history. The rise of the successive
                    families of Saxon dukes and the whole history of Bavaria under the Saxon
                    emperors furnish illustrations. The Saxon dukes of Bavaria carry out the
                    Bavarian policy in opposition to their near kinsmen on the imperial throne. The
                    growth of the Swabian Welfs into perfect identification with the Saxons whom
                    they governed affords another striking instance. In a less degree, but still to
                    some extent, this was the case in France also; but the Gallic populations had
                    lost before the Karoling period most of their national aspirations; nor did the
                    Frank governors identify themselves at any time with the people. Hence the great
                    difference in social results between French and German feudalism.”</p></note> So
                    in a few years the Frank magistrate could unite in his own person the
                    beneficiary endowment, the imperial deputation, and the headship of the nation
                    over which he presided. And then it was only necessary for the central power to
                    be a little weakened, and the independence of duke or count was limited by his
                    homage and fealty alone,—that is, by obligations that depended on conscience
                    alone for fulfilment. It is in Germany that the disruptive tendency most
                    distinctly takes the political form; Saxony and Bavaria assert their national
                    independence, under Swabian and Saxon dukes who have identified the interests of
                    their subjects with their own. In France, where the ancient tribal divisions had
                    long been obsolete, and where the existence of the alod involved little or no
                    feeling of loyalty, the process was simpler still; the provincial rulers aimed
                    at practical rather than political sovereignty; the people were too weak to have
                    any aspirations at all; the disruption was due more to the abeyance of central
                    attraction than to any centrifugal force existing in the provinces. But the
                    result was the same; feudal government, a graduated system of jurisdiction based
                    on land tenure, in which every lord judged, taxed, and commanded the class next
                    below him; in which abject slavery formed the lowest, and irresponsible tyranny
                    the highest grade; in which private war, private coinage, private prisons, took
                    the place of the imperial institutions of government.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>This was the social system under which William the Conqueror and his barons had
                    been brought up. English indigenous feudalism had reached its height in 1017,
                    when Cnut “dealt”all England into four earldoms—“tohimself the West Saxons, to
                    Thorkell the East Anglians, to Eadric the Mercians, and to Eric the
                    Northumbrians.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,</hi> in anno.</p></note> The four
                    jurisdictions are spoken of as co-ordinate. Such a system, with time, might
                    easily have ripened into continental feudalism. But William had no mind to
                    encourage feudalism as a system of government; on the contrary, he took care to
                    introduce that which England never before had enjoyed, a real central
                    administration, and in that aspect he arrested the growth of feudalism in
                    England. As a system of land tenure it was the only arrangement that he could
                    have conceived or understood; and England was already so extensively feudalized
                    in fact that it seemed the merest change of theory to make all subjects tenants,
                    and the king the universal lord and sole alodial owner. The barons were allowed
                    to take up the hereditary jurisdictions already existing on the estates on which
                    they entered; but the administrative functions of the Anglo-Saxon earls were
                    transferred to the king’s sheriffs. The barons resisted, but William’s strong
                    arm kept them down; again and again under his two sons the struggle was renewed.
                    “The English, who might never have struggled against native lords, were roused
                    by the fact that their lords were strangers as well as oppressors, and the
                    Norman kings realized the certainty that if they would retain the land they must
                    make common cause with the people.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Stephen feudalism burst out in all its horrors; fortunately the conflagration
                    burnt itself out. The English rallied again round Henry II.; the great houses of

                    extinction;” the other Normans became Englishmen; and the legal and

                <p>In France the royal authority had been reduced to a shadow. But</p>
                <p>“the shadow is still the centre round which the complex system, in spite of
                    itself, revolves. It is recognized by that system as its solitary safeguard
                    against disruption, and its witness of national identity; it survives for ages,
                    notwithstanding the attenuation of its vitality, by its incapacity for mischief.
                    In course of time the system itself loses its original energy, and the central
                    force gradually gathers into itself all the members of the nationality in
                    detail, thus concentrating all the powers which in earlier struggles they had
                    won from it, and incorporating in itself those very forces which the feudatories
                    had imposed as limitations on the sovereign power. So its character of feudal
                    suzerainty is exchanged for that of absolute sovereignty. The only checks on the
                    royal power had been the feudatories; the crown has outlived them, absorbed and
                    assimilated their functions; but the increase of power is turned, not to the
                    strengthening of the central force, but to the personal interest of its
                    possessor. Actual despotism becomes systematic tyranny, and its logical result
                    is the explosion which is called revolution. The constitutional history of
                    France is thus the summation of the series of feudal development in a logical
                    sequence which is indeed unparalleled in the history of any great state, but
                    which is thoroughly in harmony with the national character, forming it and
                    formed by it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Remains of Feudalism in English Land Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>Feudalism, although it has ceased to exist as a system of political and social
                    relations, still survives as the basis of the law relating to land, both in
                    England and Scotland. The most elementary conceptions of real property carry us
                    back to the relations of lord and vassal, and cannot be understood without
                    reference to them. Ownership of land, in the full sense of the phrase, is
                    unknown to the law of England. There is no such thing as absolute property in
                    land, says the chief English writer on that subject; a man can only have an
                    estate or interest in land. Every landowner, in the popular sense of the phrase,
                    is, in the eye of the law, a tenant only; and such is the case with the largest
                    and most unlimited interest known to the law—that of an estate in fee-simple.
                    The owner in fee is the tenant of some one else, who in his turn is the tenant
                    of another, and so on, until the last and only absolute owner is reached, viz.,
                    the king, from whom directly or indirectly all lands are held. The spirit of
                    feudalism has, of course, entirely gone out of the system; only the skeleton is
                    left. Between a tenant in feesimple and his lord there is no connexion whatever
                    except in legal theory; in point of fact, it is for the most part unknown who
                    the lord of a particular tenant may be. There are, however, new contingencies,
                    in which the feudal theory may still yield positive results. Such, for instance,
                    is the case of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eschjjat</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi>
                    in which, on the failure of heirs of freeholders dying intestate, the land would
                    go to the next lord, and in the absence of a mesne-lord to the crown. In the
                    case of <hi rend="smallcaps">Copyholds</hi> (y.v.), the incidents of feudal
                    tenure survive in a more marked degree than in any other class of estates. They
                    sprang from an inferior kind of feudal holding, and remained subject to the
                    custom of the manor to which they belonged. With the exception of such cases,
                    the feudal obligations and restrictions in which the virtue of the system
                    resided have long disappeared. The establishment of the right of alienation, and
                    at a later time of the testamentary disposition of fee-simple estates, the
                    acquisition by collusive processes of the right of breaking entail, and <pb

                    Charles II. of the most onerous class of feudal obligations—those relating to
                    chivalry—are the most important steps in this process. These tenures in
                    chivalry, by knight-service, or military tenures, as they were variously called,
                    retained the feudal spirit in its most oppressive form. The rights of <hi
                    rend="italic">wardship</hi> and <hi rend="italic">marriage</hi> were perhaps the
                    most valuable and the most burdensome of all the rights of the lord. They
                    enabled him to seize the estate of his tenant when he was under age, to exact a
                    fine from him on his coming of age, and to marry him or her to whomsoever he
                    chose. By the 12 Charles II. c. <hi rend="italic">24</hi> these tenures, with
                    all their oppressive incidents, were abolished and turned into tenures “in free
                    and common socage,” i.e., the ordinary non-military tenure, feudal like the
                    other in its origin, but not subject to the obligations imposed by the military
                    character of the tenure by knight’s service. The law of real property is,
                    however, still feudal in the sense that its main lines were laid in the times of
                    feudalism. Its most general terms are all feudal in their original meaning. The
                    fee (feudum) is the feudal estate descendible to a man’s heirs. The <hi
                    rend="italic">freeholder</hi> is the tenant of an estate worthy of a free man,
                    the smallest in quantity being an estate for his own life. To this day a gift to
                    A.B., without other words,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Unless in a will, in which case the obvious meaning of the testator will be
                    adopted.</p></note> means a gift of an estate for life only, because feudal
                    holdings were originally granted to the tenant for his own life, and in return
                    for his own services. And feudal conceptions have overrun and transformed large
                    classes of rights, which in their origin were anterior to feudalism. Thus the
                    independent rights of commoners were ignored, and their privileges were treated
                    as favours granted to them by some lord.</p>
