                        da</hi></label>, better known as Ambrogio Borgognone, or simply II
                    Borgognone, was the foremost painter of the Milanese school, so far as it is
                    possible to speak of a Milanese school independently of Leonardo da Vinci. It is
                    well known how, when Leonardo left Florence to settle at Milan, the influence of
                    his powerful genius presently transformed and dominated the art of those parts
                    of Lombardy. Borgognone was approximately contemporary with Leonardo, but
                    represented, at least during a great part of his career, the tendencies of
                    Lombard art anterior to the arrival of that master—the tendencies which he had
                    adopted and perfected from the hands of his predecessors Foppa and Zenale. We
                    are not precisely <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"

                    the birth of Borgognone. His fame is principally associated with that of one
                    great building, the Certosa, or church and convent of the Carthusians at Pavia,
                    for which he worked much and in many different ways. It is certain, indeed, that
                    there is no truth in the tradition which represents him as having designed, in
                    1473, the celebrated façade of the Certosa itself. His residence there appears
                    to have been of eight years’ duration, from 1486, when he furnished the designs
                    of the figures of the virgin, saints, and apostles for the choir-stalls,
                    executed in <hi rend="italic">tarsia</hi> or inlaid wood work by Bartolommeo
                    Pola, till 1494, when he returned to Milan. Only one known picture, an
                    altar-piece at the church San Eustorgio, can with probability be assigned to a
                    period of his career earlier than 1486. For two years after his return to Milan
                    he worked at the church of San Satiro in that city. From 1497 he was engaged for
                    some time in decorating with paintings the church of the Incoronata in the
                    neighbouring town at Lodi. Our notices of him thenceforth are few and far
                    between. In 1508 he painted for a church in Bergamo; in 1512 his signature
                    appears in a public document of Milan; in 1524—and this is our last authentic
                    record—he painted a series of frescoes illustrating the life of St Sisinius in
                    the portico of San Simpliciano at Milan. Without having produced any works of
                    signal power or beauty, Borgognone is a painter of marked individuality. He
                    holds an interesting place in the most interesting period of Italian art. The
                    National Gallery of London has two fair examples of his work—the separate
                    fragments of a silk banner painted for the Certosa, and containing the heads of
                    two kneeling groups severally of men and women, and a large altar-piece of the
                    marriage of St Catherine, painted for the chapel of Rebecchino near Pavia. But
                    to judge of his real powers and peculiar ideals —his system of faint and clear
                    colouring, whether in fresco, tempera, or oil—his somewhat slender and pallid
                    types, not without something that reminds us of northern art in their Teutonic
                    sentimentality as well as their Teutonic fidelity of portraiture—the conflict of
                    his instinctive love of placidity and calm with a somewhat forced and borrowed
                    energy in figures where energy is demanded— his conservatism in the matter of
                    storied and minutely diversified backgrounds—to judge of these qualities of the
                    master as they are, it is necessary to study first the great series of his
                    frescoes and altar-pieces at the Certosa, and next those remains of later
                    frescoes and altar-pieces at Milan and Lodi, in which we find the influence of
                    Leonardo and of the new time mingling with, but not expelling, his first
                    predilections.</p>
