                <p><label type="entry">FRICTION</label> is the resistance which every material
                    surface presents to the sliding of any other such surface upon it. This
                    resistance is due to the roughness of the surfaces; the minute projections upon
                    each enter more or less into the minute depressions on the other, and when
                    motion occurs these roughnesses must either be worn off, or continually lifted
                    out of the hollows into which they have fallen, or both, the resistance to
                    motion being in either case quite perceptible and measurable. Friction is
                    preferably spoken of as “resistance” rather than “force,” ſor a reason exactly
                    the same as that which induces us to treat stress rather as molecular resistance
                    (to change of form) than as force, and which may be stated thus :—although
                    friction can be utilized as a moving force at will, and is continually so used,
                    yet it cannot be a primary moving force; it can transmit or modify motion
                    already existing, but cannot in the first instance cause it. For this some
                    external force, not friction, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0813-0778"/> is required. The analogy with stress appears
                    complete; the motion of the “driving link” of a machine is communicated to all
                    the other parts, modified or unchanged as the case may be, by the stresses in
                    those parts; but the actual setting in motion of the driving link itself cannot
                    come about by stress, but must have for its production force obtained directly
                    from the expenditure of some form of energy. It is important, however, that the
                    use of the term “resistance” should not be allowed to mislead. Friction resists
                    the motion of one surface upon another, but it may and frequently does confer
                    the motion of the one upon the other, and in this way causes, instead of
                    resists, the motion of the latter. This may be made more clear, perhaps, by an
                    illus-stration. Suppose we have a leather strap A passing over a fixed
                    cylindrical drum B, and let a pulling force or effort be applied to the strap.
                    The force applied to A can act on B only at the surfaces of contact between
                    them. There it becomes an effort tending either to move A upon B, or to move the
                    body B itself, according to the frictional conditions. In the absence of
                    friction it would simply cause A to slide on B, so that we may call it an effort
                    tending to make A slide on B. The friction is the resistance offered by the
                    surface of B to any such motion. But the value of this resistance is not in any
                    way a function of the effort itself,—it depends chiefly upon the pressure normal
                    to the surfaces and the nature of the surfaces. It may therefore be either less
                    or greater than the effort. If less, A slides over B, the rate of motion being
                    determined by the excess of the effort over the resistance (friction). But if
                    the latter be greater, no sliding can occur, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> A
                    cannot, under the action of the supposed force, move upon B. The effort between
                    the surfaces exists, however, exactly as before,— and it must now tend to cause
                    the motion of B. But the body B is fixed,—or, in other words, we suppose its
                    resistance to motion greater than any effort which can tend to move it,—hence no
                    motion takes place. It must be specially noticed, however, that it is not the
                    friction between A and B that has prevented motion, this only prevented A moving
                    on B,—it is the force which keeps B stationary, whatever that may be, which has
                    finally prevented any motion taking place. This can be easily seen. Suppose B
                    not to be fixed, but to be capable of moving against some third body C (which
                    might, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> contain cylindrical bearings, if B were a
                    drum with its shaft), itself fixed,—and further, suppose the frictional
                    resistance between B and C to be the only resistance to B’s motion. Then if this
                    be less than the effort of A upon B, as it of course may be, this effort will
                    cause the motion of B. Thus friction causes motion, for had there been no
                    frictional resistance between the surfaces of A and of B, the latter body would
                    have remained stationary, and A only would have moved. In the case supposed,
                    therefore, the friction between A and B is a necessary condition of B receiving
                    any motion from the external force applied to A.</p>
                <p>Without entering here on the mathematical treatment of the subject of friction,
                    some general conclusions may be pointed out which have been arrived at as the
                    results of experiment. The “laws” first enunciated by Coulomb (1781), and
                    afterwards confirmed by Morin (1830-34), have been found to hold good within
                    very wide limits. These are— (1) that the friction is proportional to the normal
                    pressure between the surfaces of contact, and therefore independent of the area
                    of those surfaces (⅜'.e., of the intensity of the pressure), and (2) that it is
                    independent of the velocity with which the surfaces slide one on the other. For
                    many practical purposes these statements are sufficiently accurate, and they do
                    in fact sensibly represent the results of experiment for the pressures and at
                    the velocities most commonly occurring. Assuming the correctness of these,
                    friction is generally measured in terms simply of the total pressure between the
                    surfaces, by multiplying it by a “coefficient of friction” depending on the
                    material of the surfaces and their state as to smoothness and lubrication. But
                    beyond certain limits the “laws” stated are certainly incorrect, and are to be
                    regarded as mere practical rules, of extensive application certainly, but
                    without any pretension to be looked at as really general laws.</p>
                <p>Coulomb pointed out long ago that the resistance of a body to be set in motion
                    was in many cases much greater than the resistance which it offered to continued
                    motion; and since his time writers have always distinguished the “friction of
                    rest,” or static friction, from the “friction of motion,” or kinetic friction.
                    He showed also that the value of the former depended often both upon the
                    intensity of the pressure and upon the length of time during which contact had
                    lasted, both which facts quite agree with what we should expect from our
                    knowledge of the physical nature, already mentioned, of the causes cf friction.
                    It seems not unreasonable to expect that the influence of time upon friction
                    should show itself in a comparison of very slow with very rapid motion, as well
                    as in a comparison of starting <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> motion after a long
                    time of rest) with continued motion. That the friction at the higher velocities
                    occurring in engineering practice is much less than at common velocities has
                    been shown by several modern experiments, most recently by those of Captain
                    Douglas Galton (Brit. Assoc., Dublin Meeting, 1878, and Inst. Meeh. Eng., Paris
                    and Manchester Meetings, 1878) on the friction between brakeblocks and wheels,
                    and between wheels and rails. Until quite lately, however, no increase in the
                    coefficient of friction had ever been detected at slow speeds, but the recent
                    experiments of Prof. Fleeming Jenkin <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1877,
                    pt. 2) have shown conclusively that at extremely low velocities (the lowest
                    measured was about O002 feet per second) there is a sensible increase of
                    frictional resistance in many cases, most notably in those in which there is the
                    most marked difference between the friction of rest and that of motion. These
                    experiments distinctly point to the conclusion, although without absolutely
                    proving it, that in such cases the coefficient of kinetic friction gradually
                    increases as the velocity becomes extremely small, and passes without
                    discontinuity into that of static friction. We know that both at very high and
                    very low pressures the coefficient of friction is affected by the intensity of
                    pressure, and that, just as with velocity, it can only be regarded as
                    independent of the intensity and proportional simply to the total load within
                    more or less definite limits. Recent experiments have not, however, been
                    directed so much to this point as to the influence of velocity, which we have
                    already mentioned. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. b. w. k.)</hi></p>
