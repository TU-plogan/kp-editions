                <p><label type="entry">FERNS</label>, a large group of cryptogamie plants forming in
                    a wide sense a very naturally limited group. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Biology</hi> (vol. iii. p. 694) it has been shown that the subkingdom
                    Cormophyta includes three well-marked series, <hi rend="italic">Bryoρhyta,
                    Pteridoρhyta,</hi><hi rend="italic">Phanerogamoe.</hi> Of the second of these,
                    Fems, in the most restricted acceptation of the word, are the most conspicuous
                    representatives. It will be convenient, however, to give some account under the
                    present head, not merely of ferns proper, but also of the other smaller groups,
                    closely related to ferns and often spoken of in familiar language as
                    Fern-allies, which are included in the <hi rend="italic">Pteridoρhyta.</hi></p>
                <p>The life-history of all these is divisible into two distinct stages or
                    generations, in which not only are the external morphological characters
                    extremely different, but the physiological functions are also sharply
                    contrasted. These stages have been termed in the article already referred to the
                    <hi rend="italic">sporophore</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">oophore.</hi></p>
                <p>The vigorous vegetative forms which are what are familiarly understood when fems
                    are spoken of are only one phase of their complete life-cycle. They are the
                    sporophores; <pb break="no"

                    germinate without any process of fertilization, and are therefore not to be
                    compared with seeds. The same thing is equally true of the other members of the
                    series <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta,</hi> viz., horse tails, club mosses,
                    selaginellas, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A spore on germination produces a structure which, compared with its immediate
                    parent, is relatively very small, and bears no resemblance to it in form or
                    texture. It is called the prothallium; it is green and membranous, and attached
                    to the surface of the ground by root hairs in ferns and horse tails; in adder's
                    tongues and club mosses it is tuberous and subterranean, while in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhizοcarpece</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Selaginella</hi> it always
                    remains more or less included within the cavity of the parent spore. The
                    function of the prothallium is entirely reproductive; it develops sexual organs
                    of two kinds, archegonia and antheridia, either upon the same or different
                    prothallia. Hence, in contradistinction to the sporophore—the function of which
                    in this group of plants is purely vegetative—the prothallial generation is
                    termed the oophore.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The older botanists, starting from the study of
                    flowering plants, endeavoured to recognize in all other cases the same
                    characteristic points of structure. They did not doubt therefore, arguing from
                    analogy, that ferns were provided with true seeds. Gerarde (1597), remarking
                    theappearance of young plants of <hi rend="italic">NephroHum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dilatatum</hi> in the neighbourhood of old ones, attributed this
                    to the dissemination of seeds, “for I believe all plants have seeds in
                    themselves to produce their kindes.” No one, however, at this time could say
                    anything definite about the “seeds” of ferns, and they came to be regarded as
                    highly mysterious. It was supposed that they were of an invisible sort, and by a
                    transference of properties it came to be believed that the possessor of fern
                    seed would be invisible too. Shakespeare makes Chamberlaine say, “We have the
                    receit of fern-seed, we walke invisible.” Ray ridicules Tragus for spreading
                    linen clothe upon the ground to catch the seed of ferns on the eve of midsummer
                    night, when, as Ray properly observed, it would be indeed astonishing if any
                    fell, seeing that it is not mature till the autumn.</p>
                <p>Columna in 1648 compared the fern frond to butcher’s broom, and identified the
                    fructification in the one case with the flowers in the other. Caesius came to
                    his help, and, having examined the <hi rend="italic">sori</hi> of a polypody,
                    “telescopii adjumento,” detected what he supposed to be seeds, but which were
                    probably only the spore cases. W. Cole appears to have been the first to
                    microscopically observe the spores themselves (1669), and Ray himself described
                    the hygroscopic movements of the spore-cases which assist the dispersion of the
                    spores. Morison (1715) seems to have been the first to put the matter to the
                    test of actual experience. He sowed the spores of hart’s tongue, and in due
                    course, without, however, distinguishing clearly the two stages, raised plants
                    from them. This important observation fell completely into oblivion, and when in
                    1789 Dr Lindsay, a Scotch physician settled in Jamaica, responded to a request
                    of Sir Joseph Banks for fern plants from that island by suggesting that spores
                    would be much more convenient to send, the latter was quite unprepared for the
                    suggestion, which he treated as a great discovery. Dr Lindsay accordingly wrote
                    a paper on the subject (which was published in the <hi rend="italic">Linnean
                    Transactions</hi> a few years afterwards), in which he figured the prothallial
                    stages of <hi rend="italic">Polypodium lycopodioides.</hi> The spores of ferns
                    were still, however, regarded as equivalent to seeds, t.c., as the result of a
                    process of fertilization similar to that which precedes the development of seeds
                    in flowering plants. A variety of attempts were made to see in hairs or glands
                    upon the young fronds, &amp;c., something that would do duty for an anther. As
                    late as 1832 De Candolle maintained the analogy of the prothallium to a
                    cotyledon. In 1844 Nägeli discovered the <hi rend="italic">antherozoids,</hi>
                    motile bodies which are set free from the <hi rend="italic">antheridium,</hi>
                    and which perform in fems the function of pollen grains. All previous observers
                    had tried to find fertilizing bodies on the vegetative generation, the
                    sporophore, which produces only spores. In 1844 the final step was reached when
                    Suminski found upon the prothallia the <hi rend="italic">archegonia,</hi>
                    flaskshaped bodies containing a central cell (oosphere) which, when fertilized
                    by the antherozoids, develops into a sporebearing plant similar to that from
                    which the cycle started. In 1850 Mettenius discovered the details of the
                    reproduction in <hi rend="italic">Isoetes.</hi> Since that time the researches
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> have been very numerous, and are to
                    be found quoted in Sachs’s <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch.</hi></p>
                <p>The whole group of the <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> may be classified as

                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Filicinae.</hi> —1. The <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> or
                    ferns proper deserve consideration at greater length, both on account of their
                    numerical preponderance over the other groups, and the popular favour which
                    deservedly attaches to their great beauty and variety of form.</p>
                <p>Commencing with the vegetative generation or <hi rend="italic">sporophore,</hi>
                    the following remarks briefly touch upon the most essential points in their
                    organization.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">general habit,</hi> although with a certain characteristic
                    appearance which, to the experienced eye, is an almost unfailing distinctive
                    character, ferns are as various in stature and aspect as flowering plants. One
                    genus, <hi rend="italic">Cerαtopteris,</hi> is remarkable for its aquatic habit.
                    The terrestrial forms vary from the <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllaceae,</hi>
                    which have the small size and delicate texture of mosses, to the larger forms
                    vzhich attain the size of shrubs, while some belonging to the tropics and the
                    southern hemisphere havo a palm-like habit, and are called tree-ferns. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyathea</hi><hi rend="italic">medullaris</hi> reaches 80 feet in
                    New Zealand, and <hi rend="italic">Alsophila australis</hi> even greater heights
                    in Australia. The stem creeps on or beneath the surface of the ground as in the
                    common bracken, or climbs up rocks and the trunks of trees <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Davalliα canariensis).</hi> In the latter case it is usually densely coated
                    with imbricated membranous scales. In stems of this type the internodes or
                    spaces between the insertion of successive leaves (fronds) is considerable, and
                    the growing point is often far in advance of the youngest frond. In a large
                    number of herbaceous ferns, of which the common male and lady fems are good
                    examples, the stem is short and erect or slightly inclined (fig. 1). The fronds
                    are developed spirally, and in close contiguity without obvious internodes; they
                    form, viewed from above, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0111-0102"/> a large rosette with the growing point in the
                    centre. Between the ordinary herbaceous ferns with short erect stems and the
                    tree-ferns there is no hard and sharp line of demarcation. Most of the ferns of
                    decidedly arborescent habit belong to the sub-order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyatheaceae,</hi> which has a sporangium and receptacle a little different from
                    that of the typical <hi rend="italic">Polypodiaceae,</hi> but in many of the
                    genera of <hi rend="italic">Poly</hi><hi rend="italic">podiaceae,</hi>
                    especially <hi rend="italic">Dicksonia,</hi> there are species that assume a
                    more or less decidedly arborescent habit Nearly all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filices</hi> are perennial, but we have an instance of annual duration in <hi
                    rend="italic">Gymnogramme leptophylla.</hi><hi rend="italic">Growing
                    Point.—</hi> The apex of the stem, whatever the dimensions of the mature plant,
                    is always occupied by a single apical cell, and the whole growth is entirely
                    dependent upon the repeated segmentation of this cell. In form it is either
                    wedge-shaped with a transverse section like that of a bi-convex lens, or it has
                    the form of a three-sided pyramid with a convex base forming the outer face. In
                    the former case the segments are produced from the cell alternately right and
                    left, and the stem, which is gradually built up by the repeated subdivision of
                    the segments so formed, is always distinctly bilateral, and produces its fronds
                    in two rectilinear series. In the latter case the segments are derived in spiral
                    succession from the three interior faces of the apical cell, and the leaves,
                    which are developed from the masses of tissue to which these segments give rise,
                    are gradually displaced from the simple triseriate arrangement due to the
                    segmentation of the apical cell into more complicated forms of phyllotaxis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Branching</hi> is effected by the partition of the growing
                    point; the single stem therefore bifurcates. This scarcely ever happens in ferns
                    with erect stems, such as <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Filix-mas,</hi> or in tree-ferns. New shoots are, however, sometimes formed
                    from the bases of the leaf-stalks, just as in some species they are normally
                    produced from the fronds themselves. When the terminal point is injured, lateral
                    shoots are often formed in this way. A specimen of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dick</hi><hi rend="italic">sonia</hi><hi rend="italic">antarctica</hi> has been
                    described with as many as twenty-nine crowns, due doubtless to such a cause.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">the
                    Stem.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The repeated subdivision of the cells of the
                    growing point gives rise to a mass of tissue, at first uniform in character, but
                    which is subsequently differentiated. Particular tracts of cells are modified in
                    the process of growth to form the fibro-vascular bundles. These are more or less
                    flattened plates irregularly elliptical in transverse section. As in all the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pterιdophyta</hi> they are closed, and incapable, when once
                    formed, of further increase in diameter. They consist of a mass of “xylem”
                    surrounded by “phloem.” The xylem consiste, in addition to a few spiral vessels
                    at the foci of the elliptical tranverse section, of scalariform vessels—cells of
                    comparatively large diameter, with oblique ends, and with their walls
                    intermittently thickened by transverse projecting ridges (fig. 2). Amongst the
                    vessels are oblong cells containing starch in winter (woodparenchyma). The
                    phloem contains sieve-tubes, and external to these thick-walled bast fibres. The
                    whole fibro-vascular bundle is bounded first by one or two layers of oblong
                    starch-containing cells (phloem-sheath), and external to these by a single layer
                    of narrower cells, often thickened externally and darker in colour—the vascular
                    bundle sheath. In very slender stems the fibro-vasculαr bundles form a central
                    axis <hi rend="italic">tflymenophyllaceae),</hi> but when the stems attain any
                    size they are arranged in an anastomosing cylindrical network (fig. 3), in which
                    a mesh corresponds to the base of a frond. This cylinderseparates the remaining
                    or fundamental tissues of the stem into two portions, an internal central
                    medulla and an externaΓcortex. This is shown in fig. 4; the dark lines, however,
                    do not belong to the bundles which correspond to the light spaces enclosed by
                    them; the dark lines themselves consist of a mass of thickened elongated cells
                    termed “sclerenchyma,” which form protecting sheaths to the fascicular tissue.
                    The medulla and cortex are in the main formed of parenchymatous tissue, often
                    loaded with starch. In <hi rend="italic">Cyathea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >medullaris</hi> this starchy pith was used by the Maoris as an article of food.
                    The medulla is not, however, entirely parenchymatous; it is usually permeated by
                    a number of anastomosing filiform bundles (usually also invested with a
                    sclerenchymatous sheath), which eventually pass into the leaves through the
                    meshes in the fibro-vascular cylinder. The greater part of the fibro-vascular
                    tissue of the leaves is, however, continuous with the lower portion of the
                    margins of the meshes, which runs out into bundles arranged round the outer
                    circumference of the leaf stalk, and surrounding therefore the bundles which
                    pass through the meshes from the medulla of the stem. In some cases, however,
                    these medullary bundles contract an adhesion to the margins of the meshes as
                    they pass through them. The surface of the stem, and also of the

                <p>13 usually strengthened by the sclerenchymatous development of the superficial
                    portions of the fundamental tissue. This coats the surface with a layer which
                    would be impervious to air were it not interrupted by spaces filled with soft
                    parenchyma, by which the internal tissues of the stem are brought into relation
                    with the atmosphere. In <hi rend="italic">Pteris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aquilina,</hi> the rhizome or horizontal subterranean stem is marked laterally
                    by two lines where the colourless cortical parenchyma is not covered in, and. in
                    many tree-ferns the bases of the petioles have their sclerenchymatous investment
                    perforated by pits filled in the living plant by a soft-celled tissue which
                    speedily becomes pulverulent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">roots</hi> of ferns are always slender and wiry. They are
                    continually formed during the growth of the stem in acropetal succession. In
                    tree-ferns they consequently accumulate on the lower portion as they grow
                    downward, giving it a large apparent diameter. In creeping species they at once
                    attach themselves. They are cylindrical in all cases, scarcely exceeding
                    one-eighth of an inch in diameter, dark-brown approaching black in colour, and
                    clothed with root-hairs.</p>
                <p>In ferns the occurrence of a special form of “trichomes” is noticeable in the
                    flat multicellular membranous scales, to which the name of “paleae” is given.
                    They are found in the greatest abundance on the stem and lower part of the
                    stipes, but they often extend to the rachides of the frond, and sometimes to the
                    foliar surfaces, especially in young fronds. There is no definite correlation in
                    the character of these paleae with other points of structure. The most
                    characteristic are the long thread-like bright-brown paleae of <hi rend="italic"
                    >EiLdicksonia,</hi> which are so abundant that those of <hi rend="italic"

                    paleae, dull brown in colour and permeated by a distinct lattice-work of thicker
                    cells, which occur in <hi rend="italic">Vittama, Antroρhyum,</hi> and some
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Asplénium.</hi> By their abundance, position, size,
                    shape, and texture, the paleae often furnish great help in characterizing
                    species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stipes.</hi> —Although generally distinguished by this special
                    name, the stipes is simply the petiole of the leaf. It is very rare to find a
                    fern in which the blade of the leaf does not possess a distinct stalk. In about
                    two-thirds of the <hi rend="italic">Filices,</hi> including not only those with
                    erect, but many with creeping stems, the stipes is continuous with the stem,
                    without any articulation at the point of junction; and when the old fronds die,
                    they do not become disjointed, after the fashion of the leaves of a deciduous
                    tree. In about one-third of the <hi rend="italic">Filices,</hi> on the contrary,
                    there is a distinct joint at the point of junction between the stipes and the
                    stem, and when the fronds fade, they fall away from the stem spontaneously,
                    leaving a clean scar. In the classification proposed by John Smith, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polypodiaceae</hi> are subdivided by this character. The ferns in

                    that the <hi rend="italic">Eremobrya</hi> show greater tenacity of life, and

                <p><hi rend="italic">Fronds.—</hi> Iu <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> we get a more

                    some of the most beautiful and complicated types that exist. In size the fronds

                    of a compound frond are called pinnae, the secondary divisions pinnules. In a
                    deltoid frond, as in <hi rend="italic">Cystopteris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >montana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pteris</hi><hi rend="italic">palmata,</hi>
                    the pinnae grow regularly smaller from the lower to the upper, and the lower
                    pinnae have the pinnules of the under side exaggerated. A decrescent frond, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Nephrodiτιm</hi><hi rend="italic">conterminum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Asplénium</hi><hi rend="italic">Trichomanes,</hi> has the pinnae
                    largest at the centre of the frond, and gradually smaller both towards its top
                    and bottom. There is no regular relation between the frond and its
                    fructification. Species with fronds similar in texture, cutting, and veining are
                    often found, when the fructification is examined, to stand widely apart in
                    systematic position. · The growth of the fronds is very slow. The whole of the
                    fronds of a rosette of <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium Filix-mas</hi> have been in
                    course of formation two years before the lamina begins to unroll. The
                    development is basifugal, and often the fronds continue growing at the top a
                    long time after they are fully unfolded and producing fructification at the
                    base. This may be seen iu <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sericeum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gymnogramme elongata;</hi> iu <hi
                    rend="italic">Lygodium</hi> the leaf-stalk resembles a twining stem, growing for
                    a long time. Iu many cases the fronds are of two kinds, developing from the
                    first in a conspicuously different manner, one kind remaining permanently
                    barren, and the other alone producing fructification. Wo have instances of this
                    in <hi rend="italic">Lomaria</hi><hi rend="italic">Spicant</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cryptogramme crispa,</hi> and dimorphism is shown still more
                    conspicuously in <hi rend="italic">Platycerium,</hi> in which the barren fronds
                    are uncut and spread out flat over the surface on which the plant grows, and the
                    fertile ones are much larger, and stand erect, and are forked, from which it
                    takes its common name of elk’s-horn fern. There is another striking instance of
                    dimorphism in the section <hi rend="italic">Dryηaria</hi> of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Polypodium,</hi> in which the barren fronds are brown in colour,
                    rigid in texture, small in size, and lobed like the leaf of the common oak, and
                    the fertile ones are several feet long, with elongated segments like those of
                    <hi rend="italic">Polypodium</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgare.</hi> In some ferns
                    the fronds have a habit of taking root at the tip, and thus producing new
                    plants. This is well shown in the walking-leaf of North America <hi
                    rend="italic">{Scolopendrium rhizophyllum),</hi> and amongst tropical ferns in
                    <hi rend="italic">Asplénium</hi><hi rend="italic">rhizoplωrwn</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Acrostichum flagelliferum.</hi> Some species develop copious
                    adventitious buds, from which the plant may be reproduced, sometimes scattered
                    over the surface of the frond, as in <hi rend="italic">Asplénium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">viviparum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. bulbiferum,</hi> sometimes

                    rend="italic">proliferwm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium
                    cicutarium.</hi><hi rend="italic">Venation.—</hi> In the arrangement of the
                    veins of the fronds of <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> there is an extraordinary
                    amount of variety. The different types, and the extent to which they prevail,
                    and the use that may be made in the systematic arrangement of fems of the
                    characters they furnish, were carefully worked out by Presl and John Smith. The
                    two principal leading types are veins that, after once branching, do not again
                    unite, and veins that, on the contrary, after branching, join one another so as
                    to inclose areolae like the meshes of a net. Ferns that exhibit the first plan
                    are said to be free-veined; the other kind are said to have anastomosing
                    venation. The free-veined ferns form far more than half of the order. In the
                    whole frond or its ultimate divisions there may be a midrib alone, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Monogramme</hi><hi rend="italic">graminea</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymenoρhyllum tuηbridgense;</hi> or the veining may be simply
                    pinnate, that is to say, a midrib <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> with a series
                    of parallel simple branches on each side, as in <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium
                    patens</hi> or <hi rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">prolixum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> or there may be a regular midrib from the base to the top
                    of the frond or segment, with the side-branches branched again, a very common
                    type shown in <hi rend="italic">Pteris</hi><hi rend="italic">aquilina</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium Filix-mas;</hi> or there may be no regular midrib,
                    but the veins arranged like the rays of a fan, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adiantum</hi><hi rend="italic">Capillus-Veneris</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asplénium</hi><hi rend="italic">cuneatum.</hi> Whether the veins are produced
                    to the margin, or end abruptly without reaching it, as Î3 common in the

                    >Polypodium,</hi> is a point to be noted. Of anastomosing venation the following
                    are the principal types :—</p>
                <p>1. "Where the veins are free nearly to the edge, but connected by an arch just

                <p>3. Where the veins of contiguous segments are copiously pinnate and free, but the

                <p>4. Where the veins imite in regular hexagonal meshes the sori borne at the tip cf

                    rend="italic">Acrostichum.</hi></p>
                <p>Many of the large genera, as characterized by the shape and position of the sori,
                    contain groups which show several of these different plans of veining <hi
                    rend="italic">; Polypodium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acrostichum</hi> show them
                    nearly all. One school of systématiste, represented in England by J. Smith and
                    Moore, regard a decided difference in veining as a character important enough in
                    itself to mark a genus; and if this plan be followed the number of genera is
                    enormously increased. Our estimate of 50 for the genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypodiaceae</hi> is a large one, if genera founded upon fructification be
                    understood; but Moore, using venation in addition, reckons the genera at 143,
                    and John Smith at 194. From this different scale upon which genera have been
                    planned arises the large number of different generic names which have often been
                    used for the same plants, so that the synonymy of ferns has become extremely
                    complicated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sporangia</hi> of ferns are morphologically trichomes or
                    modified hairs. They originate from epidermal cells, and in the mature state
                    consist of stalked capsules, the walls of which are one cell thick. A ring of
                    cells differently placed in different genera is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >annulus,</hi> and by its unequal contraction in drying effects the disruption
                    of the capsule and the dispersion of the spores (fig. 5). In some genera the
                    same object 13 effected by a group of cells instead of a ring. The separate
                    clusters, of few or many individual sporangia, are called sori (fig. 6), and the
                    membranous excrescence of the epidermis which covers a sorus is called an
                    indusium or involucre (fig. 7).</p>
                <p>The orders of <hi rend="italic">FUices</hi> are founded upon differences in the
                    structure of the individual sporangium. Genera of the same order depend upon
                    differences in the shape and position of the sori and shape and position of the
                    indusium. In a few genera, such as <hi rend="italic">0smunda, Anemia,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Schizaea,</hi> the parenchyma of the lamina is entirely
                    absorbed in the fertile parts of the frond, and the sporangia form distinct
                    panicles or spikes. In <hi rend="italic">Acrostichum</hi> the sporangia cover
                    the whole of the under surface of the frond, both veins and interspaces. In many
                    genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Pteris,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitiaria,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Lind-saya</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> the sori
                    run in a line along the very edge of the frond, connecting the tips of numerous
                    veinlets. In <hi rend="italic">Blechnum</hi> they form a similar line close to
                    the midrib. The commonest type of all is when they form round dots on the veins
                    of the back of the frond, as in <hi rend="italic">Polypodium, Aspidium,
                    Woodsia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gyathea.</hi> A type only less common than
                    the last is where they run in linβ3 along the veins of the back of the frond, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Aspleηium, Scolopendrium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnogramme.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Lygodium</hi> the sporangia form spikes
                    on the edge of the leafy segments, each sporangium inclosed in a little pocket.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Dichsonia, Hymenophyllum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trichomanes,</hi> the sori form round clusters at the tip of a vein on the edge
                    of the lamina. Characters taken from the indusium separate the genera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Polypodiaceae</hi> into four tolerably well-marked groups. In a
                    large series of genera, including <hi rend="italic">Polypodium</hi> with not
                    less than 400 species, <hi rend="italic">Acrostichum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnogramme,</hi> there is no indusium at all. In another series, including <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic">teris,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pellaea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cheilaηthes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypolepis,</hi> there is what is called a spurious indusium, which consists
                    simply of the edge of the frond modified in texture and more or less completely
                    recurved, so as to protect the sorus in an early stage. The true indusia are
                    distinct scales, and are of two kinds,—those called inferior, which originate
                    beneath the sorus, and may be distinctly cup-shaped, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Woodsia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gyathea,</hi> or may be one-sided, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cystopteris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Daυallia;</hi> and those
                    called superior, as in <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aspidium</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> which are extended over the
                    sorus. As has been already indicated, all the genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypodiaceae,</hi> which include in the aggregate not less than 2000 species,
                    agree with one another in the structure of the sporangia, so that the great
                    majority of existing forms of <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> are very closely
                    allied. The classification of ferns is based at present upon characters entirely
                    drawn from the sporophore generation, and takes no account of the oophore. It is
                    undoubtedly to a great extent artificial, but until the development of the
                    prothallium has been carefully worked out in all the different orders, no more
                    satisfactory or more natural arrangement than the following appears
                    attainable.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ooρhore,</hi> or sexual generation of ferns, not having
                    been studied to any great extent from the comparative point of view, can only be
                    described in general terms. It is a membranous structure furnished with root
                    hairs, and the cells of which contain chlorophyll; it is therefore capable of
                    obtaining its nourishment independently, and in many respects has a striking
                    resemblance to the simpler <hi rend="italic">Hepaticae.</hi> When the spores
                    (for example) of any Polypodiaceous fern are sown, the outer covering bursts,
                    and the inner coat protrudes as a filament, which soon divides and continues to
                    grow into a short row of cells. Cell division next begins to take place
                    laterally as well as longitudinally, and a small cellular plate is formed (fig.
                    8), which gradually attains a kidney-shaped outline, the growing point being
                    situate in the notch. From the under side are developed the root hairs,
                    antheridia and archegonia.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n114/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0114-0105"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">antheridium</hi> is morphologically a trichome, and is an
                    outgrowth of a superficial cell. The wall when mature consists of a single layer
                    of cells, inclosing a central cell, from which the antherozoids are developed in
                    separate mother cells. The antheridium eventually bursts owing to the absorption
                    of water, and the spirally-twisted motile ciliated antherozoids (fig. 9) are set
                    free (fig. 10).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">archegonia</hi> are produced on a cellular cushion
                    immediately behind the notch. They are developed by repeated divisions from a
                    superficial cell, and, when mature, each is a bottle-shaped structure (fig. 11),
                    the rounded base of which is buried in the prothallium, and contains a central
                    cell, the oosphere. The canal of the neck is at first filled by a cell, which
                    eventually deliquesces, and leaves the passage open for the access of the
                    antherozoids to the oosphere, which, after fertilization by blending with them,
                    becomes the oospore. The oospore first divides by a division-wall oblique to the
                    prothallium, and then divides again so as to form four cells. Two of these give
                    rise to a mass of tissue which remains in contact with the prothallium, and is
                    called the foot. Of the other two, one develops into the stem (first leaf), the
                    other into the root. As soon as the young fern-plant (sporophore) is fairly
                    established (fig. 12) the prothallium (oophore) disappears. Its existence is
                    therefore remarkably contrasted by its brevity with the oophore stage in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bryophyta.</hi> There are, however, cases in which the conditions
                    of the one group are approached by the other. In <hi rend="italic">0smunda</hi>
                    the prothallia admit of vegetative reproduction by the detachment of marginal
                    shoots. In <hi rend="italic">Gymnogramme leptophylla,</hi> Goebel has shown that
                    the prothallium vegetates in a persistent way, comparable to that of the oophore
                    stage in a moss. The sporophore is very transient in its existence, only living
                    for a few months, and being entirely devoted to the production of spores.
                    Amongst <hi rend="italic">Bryophyta,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Anthoceros</hi>
                    the sporophore exhibits a continued production of spores, which places it nearly
                    on a level with <hi rend="italic">Gymnogramme.</hi> Farlow has made the
                    remarkable observation that the sporophore may in some cases originate from the
                    prothallium without the intervention of a sexual process, by a process of
                    budding.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Stipulatoe</hi> include two orders often included among
                    ferns, but differing from them in some very important points. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophioglossaceae</hi> include <hi rend="italic">Ophioglossum</hi> (adder’s
                    tongues) and <hi rend="italic">Botrychium</hi> (moon-worts), both widely
                    distributed, and <hi rend="italic">HelmintJωstachys,</hi> which is found from
                    the Himalayas to Queensland. The leaves as soon as they have attained a certain
                    age bear a fertile branch from the axial side. The sporangia are developed in a
                    manner totally different from those of other <hi rend="italic">Filicinae.</hi>
                    Instead of being pro ducts of single epidermal cells their origin resembles that
                    of the pollen-sacs of anthers. The sexual generation (oophore) is tuberous and
                    subterranean.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Marattiaceae</hi> is a group of ferns including about four
                    genera. All are essentially tropical, but run more into the south than the north
                    temperate zone. <hi rend="italic">Hanaea</hi> is exclusively American, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaulfussia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Angiopteτis</hi> Old World,
                    <hi rend="italic">Marattia</hi> cosmopolitan. The sporangia are placed on
                    lateral veins of the pinnae, and contain two rows of loculi, each of which
                    corresponds to a single sporangium of <hi rend="italic">Ophioglossum,</hi> and
                    produces a number of spores originating from many primary mother-cells. The
                    development of the sporangia in <hi rend="italic">Angiopteris,</hi> which
                    differs from other <hi rend="italic">Marattiaceae</hi> in the sporangia not
                    being confluent, is still a desideratum for the determination of its
                    affinities.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Bdùzocarpeae</hi> are plants whose affinities have long been
                    obscure, but which are now gradually being seen to be related in many essential
                    points to ferns, though departing from them in other respects. In the growth of
                    the roots, mode of branching, and circinate vernation there is entire agreement,
                    and the fructification, though apparently very different, clearly admits of
                    comparison with the true fern type. For a detailed account of their structure
                    reference must be made to the works referred to below. It will be sufficient
                    here to briefly refer to the fructification. <hi rend="italic">Rhizo-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">carpeae</hi> include two orders, <hi rend="italic">Marsileae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Salvinieae.</hi> The former consists of the two genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Pilulama</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Marsilea.</hi> The former
                    consists of three species of small creeping plants with filiform leaves, one of
                    which is not uncommon in marshy places in Britain; the fruit (sporocarp) is
                    globular, shortly stalked, and springs from the axile of the leaves. The
                    sporocarp is divided by partitions into from one to four cavities, and each of
                    these bears on its outer wall a projecting ridge to which the sporangia are
                    attached. The species of <hi rend="italic">Marsilea</hi> are widely distributed
                    mostly in hot countries <hi rend="italic">; M. macropus</hi> is the nardoo of
                    Australia. They all agree in having leaves and long stalks and two pairs of
                    leaflets arranged cross-wise; one pair is developed by lateral branching, the
                    other pair by dichotomy of the growing point. The sporocarp is variously placed,
                    but always in relation to a leaf. Sachs considers that in both <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marsilea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pilularia</hi> the sporocarps are modified
                    leaves bearing the sporangia on their upper sides in definite relation to the
                    fibro-vascular bundles. With regard to position he compares them to the fertile
                    fronds of <hi rend="italic">Ophioglossaceae</hi> In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marsilea</hi> the sporocarp is bean shaped, and the sporangia are attached to
                    transverse ridges in small compartments which are torn away in the peculiar
                    dehiscence of the sporocarp (fig. 13).</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0115-0106"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Salvinieae</hi> include <hi rend="italic">Salvinia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Azolla. Salvinia</hi> is a cosmopolitan genus of five or six
                    species of floating plants distributed over the tropical and warm temperate
                    zones. The sporocarps are developed from teeth of the fertile leaves round which
                    in each case a circular wall grows up covering in the tooth on which the
                    sporangia are developed. This arrangement has been compared to the cup-shaped
                    “involucre” of <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllum.</hi> The sporangia are in all
                    the genera trichomes, and their mode of development is very similar to that in
                    <hi rend="italic">Polypodiaceae.</hi> The central mother-cell divides ultimately
                    into eight spore mother-cells. The further progress, however, of these varies
                    according as microspores or macrospore3 are to be formed, each of the eight
                    cells dividing into four in the one case, while in the latter only one does so,
                    and only one of the four daughter-cells attains maturity.</p>
                <p>The oophore or prothallial generation in <hi rend="italic">Phizocarpeae</hi> is
                    dioecious from the first, the macrospore alone producing archegonia. This,
                    however, only carries to an extreme point a differentiation of which there are
                    indications amongst ferns. In <hi rend="italic">Qsmunda</hi> all the spores from
                    a sporangium sometimes produce prothallia with antheridia alone. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Phizocarpeae</hi> the differentiation is carried back to the
                    spores themselves. The microspores are male (fig.</p>
                <p>14); in <hi rend="italic">Salvinia</hi> there is a rudimentary prothallium which
                    produces antheridia, and in <hi rend="italic">Marsilea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Salvinia</hi> there is a last trace of such a structure. The
                    macrospores also develop a prothallium from a portion of their contents, which,
                    however, is always for the most part included in the parent spore, which
                    ruptures to expose the archegonia (fig.</p>
                <p>15) , and allow of the fertilization of one of them.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Equisetinae</hi> are plants the habit of which in the
                    asexual stage (sporophore) is very singular. The stems are furrowed and jointed,
                    the joints being hollow and closed at each node by a transverse septum (fig.
                    16). The leaves are reduced to a whorl of membranous teeth which form a sheath
                    at each node, perforated by the slender branches, which also form a verticil.
                    The teeth of each successive node alternate. The fibro-vascular bundles also
                    alternate in each successive internode, since they are arranged in a ring, and
                    correspond to the ridges between the furrows which above are continuous into the
                    teeth of a leaf-sheath (fig. 17). Each fibro-vascular bundle contains an
                    air-canal, and another series of air-canals alternate with these and correspond
                    to the furrows (fig. 18). The spore-bearing shoots are usually a good deal
                    different in appearance from the barren stems; they terminate in a kind of cone
                    (fig. 19), composed of closely approximated whorls of modified leaves, which are
                    peltate in form, and bear from 5 to 10 sporangia on their under surface (fig.
                    20). The spores are furnished with an external coat which splits up into four
                    strips, the hygroscopic movements of which actively assist their dispersion
                    (figs. 21, 22). The oophore consists of a prothallium, which is curiously lobed
                    and curled, but otherwise differs little 'from that of ferns.</p>

                    Sachs).—With a considerable range of morphological variation the different
                    genera agree in some important points. The leaves are always simple and
                    unbranched, and contain only a single fibro-vascular bundle. The branching of
                    stems and roots is always dichotomous, and the dichotomies, with some
                    exceptions, succeed one another in planes at right angles. In their reproductive
                    processes <hi rend="italic">Lycopodiaceae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ligulatae</hi> are related in the same manner as <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Phizocarpeae.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lycopodiaceae,</hi> besides the club-mosses <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lycopodium),</hi> includes three other small genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Psilotum, Tmesiptems,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylloglossum.</hi> The first belongs to the warm countries of the new world,
                    and is a singular plant with slender dichotomizing stems, very small leaves, and
                    no true roots. <hi rend="italic">Phylloglosmιm</hi> is a minute Australian
                    plant, with a small tuber which produces a rosette of a few long leaves and a
                    stalked spike of sporangia. The species of <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium</hi>
                    (fig. 23) attain a more vigorous vegetative development, some almost reaching
                    the size of small shrubs. Their stems contain an axial cylinder, formed by the
                    greater or less coalescence of a number of fibro-vascular bundles forming
                    transverse bands in cross-section. These bands are composed of xylem, with wide
                    scalariform vessels and spiral vessels at each end; between the xylem plates are
                    the phloem common to each, and containing sieve-tubes. The whole surface is
                    surrounded by a phloem-sheath and a fibro-vascular<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0116-0107"/> bundle sheath. The cortical tissue surrounding
                    the axial cylinder is often largely converted into sclerenchyma. The sporangia
                    of <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium</hi> make their appearance upon the upper
                    surface of the fertile leaves (fig. 24), and, according to Sachs, are developed
                    from the sub-epidermal tissue. The spores are only of one kind (fig. 25), and on
                    germination, according to the observations of Fankhauser, produce a subterranean
                    prothallium, resembling that of <hi rend="italic">Ophioglossaceae,</hi> and
                    bearing antheridia and archegonia.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Ligulatae</hi> includes two orders markedly different in
                    vegetative characters. In both the leaves are furnished at the base with a small
                    appendage called a ligule, wanting in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycopodiaceae.</hi><hi rend="italic">Selaginelleae.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> The ramification of <hi rend="italic">Selaginella</hi> often produces
                    flat frond-like systems of branches, owin~ to the regular suppression of one
                    side of the dichotomies. The leaves, which are arranged in four longitudinal
                    rows, are in these cases often unequal, those attached to the under side of the
                    horizontally spreading stem being larger than those on the upper side. The
                    structure of the stem differs from that of <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium</hi> in
                    having no axial cylinder, the fibro-vascular bundles being distinct from one
                    another although transversely expanded like those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycopodium.</hi> In details of structure they agree with the bundles of ferns.
                    Each is often surrounded by a system of air-cavities. The roots branch
                    dichotomously. The sporangia of <hi rend="italic">Selaginella</hi> are shortly
                    stalked, and are inserted in the axil or even in the base of a leaf; the
                    fibro-vascular bundle runs beneath it without sending a branch into it.
                    Macrosporangia (fig. 26), containing usually four macrospores, occur in the same
                    spike with the microsporangia. For a detailed account of the prothallial stage
                    (oophore) of <hi rend="italic">Selaginella</hi> reference may be made to Sach’s
                    text-book.</p>
                <p>The female prothallium is more distinctly endogenous than even in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhizocarpeae.</hi> It is formed from a portion of the contents of
                    the macrospore (fig. 27), which ruptures partially, exposing the prothallium
                    with its first archegonium. The remaining part of the cavity of the spore
                    becomes filled with a cellular tissue, which may be compared to the endosperm of
                    phanerogams. This is not the only point in which the reproduction of <hi
                    rend="italic">Selaginella</hi> approaches that of flowering plants. The oospore
                    first divides transversely, in which respect it differs widely from <hi
                    rend="italic">Filices</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhizοcarpeae.</hi> The upper
                    half forms the <hi rend="italic">suspensor,</hi> a structure wanting in all
                    other cryptogams, but characteristic of phanerogams. The lower half forms the
                    embryo, which by the elongation of the suspensor is at first carried down into
                    the endosperm (fig. 28), the cells of which it partially absorbs in its further
                    development. The microspores produce the antherozoids, containing, in addition,
                    traces of a rudimentary prothallium.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Isoeteae</hi> consist of the species of the monotypic genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Isoetes,</hi> which, almost always aquatic in habit, are found
                    all over the world. They are all remarkable for the extraordinarily slow growth
                    in length and absence of branching in the stem, which consists of a small
                    tuberous body bearing the rosette of leaves without internodes. It has the
                    unique peculiarity amongst the vascular cryptogams of increasing in diameter by
                    additions to the parenchymatous cortical tissue external to the central
                    fibro-vascular axis. The sporangia of <hi rend="italic">Isoetes</hi> are
                    produced at the bases of the leaves, and are unquestionably foliar products; the
                    outer leaves of the rosette produce only macrosporangia, the inner only
                    microsporangia. The macrospores are entirely filled by the female prothallium,
                    the wall being finally ruptured at the apex, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Selaginella.</hi></p>
