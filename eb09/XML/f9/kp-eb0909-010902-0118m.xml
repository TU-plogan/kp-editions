                    weasel, regarded by some as the descendant of a wild species originally brought
                    from Africa, and now only known in the domesticated state, and by others, as a

                    which it is said to interbreed freely. It differs, however, from the polecat in
                    the colour of its fur, which is usually yellowish-white, and of its eyes which
                    are pinky-red. A more important difference, as bearing on the question of its
                    specific distinctness, lies in the fact that while the polecat thrives in the
                    severe climate of northern Europe, the ferret is peculiarly intolerant of cold,
                    and only survives the English winter by means of the artificial warmth to which,
                    under domestication, it is accustomed. The ferret attains a length of about
                    fourteen inches, exclusive of the tail, which measures about five inches.
                    Although exhibiting considerable tameness, it seems incapable of attachment, and
                    when not properly fed or when otherwise irritated is apt to give painful
                    evidence of its native ferocity. Tempted by the opportunity of the mother’s
                    absence it has been known to attack the child in the cradle, and having once
                    tasted blood it seems to lose all its acquired shyness, and will then boldly
                    attack any one interfering with the gratification of its bloodthirsty
                    propensity. It is chiefly employed in destroying rats and other vermin, and in
                    driving rabbits from their burrows into nets spread for their reception. For the
                    latter purpose it is usually muzzled, to prevent it devouring its prey and
                    thereafter going to sleep at the bottom of a burrow until roused by hunger to
                    renewed exertion. The ferret is remarkably prolific, the female bringing forth
                    two broods annually, each numbering from six to nine young. It is said to devour
                    its young occasionally immediately after birth, and in this case it produces
                    another brood soon after. The ferret was well known to the Romans, Strabo
                    stating that it was brought from Africa into Spain, and Pliny that it was
                    employed in his time in rabbit hunting, under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Viverra,</hi> of which the English name is probably a corruption.</p>
