                    range. It is one, of the stations on the railway between Basel and Mannheim, and
                    lies about 40 miles northwards from the former city. The town is for the most
                    part well built, having several wide and handsome streets and a number of
                    spacious squares. It is kept clean and cool by the waters of the Dreisam, which
                    flow through the streets in open channels; and its old fortifications have been
                    replaced by public walks, and, what is more unusual, by vineyards. Since 1827
                    Freiburg has been the seat of an archbishop who has authority over the bishops
                    of Mainz, Fulda, Rottenberg, and Limberg; and it possesses a famous Catholic
                    university, the <hi rend="italic">Ludovico Albertina,</hi> which owes its origin
                    to Albert VI., archduke of Austria, and dates from 1454, 1456, or 1457. This was
                    at one time a very wealthy institution, having been endowed by its founder with
                    extensive lands in the Breisgau, Upper Alsatia, and Wurtemberg; but since the
                    French Revolution it has lost nearly all its estates, and the revenue derived
                    from those still held in Baden is not sufficient for its expenses. In 1876 it
                    had 41 professors, ordinary and extraordinary, and 9 privat-docenten, and the
                    students numbered 290, of whom 141 were foreigners. The library contains upwards
                    of 250,000 volumes; and among the other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0800-0765"/> auxiliary establishments are an anatomical hall
                    and museum and bo anical gardens. The Freiburg minster is considered one of the
                    finest of all the Gothic churches of Germany, being remarkable alike for the
                    symmetry of its proportions, for the taste of its decorations, and for the fact
                    that it may mor <hi rend="smallcaps">j</hi> correctly be said to be finished
                    than almost any other building of the kind. The period of its erection probably
                    lies for the most part between 1122 and 1252; bat the choir was not built till
                    1513. The tower, which rises above the western entrance, is 386 feet in height,
                    and it presents a skilful transition from a square base into an octagonal
                    superstructure, which in its turn is surmounted by a pyramidal spire of the most
                    exquisite open work in stone. In the interior of the church are some beautiful
                    stained glass windows, both ancient and modern, the tombstones of several of the
                    dukes of Zähringen, statues of archbishops of Freiburg, and paintings by Holbein
                    and by Hans Balding, surnamed Grün. Among the other noteworthy buildings of
                    Freiburg are the palaces of the grand duke and the arch bishop, the town hall,
                    the theatre, the <hi rend="italic">Kaufhaus</hi> or merchants’ hall, a
                    16th-century building with the front painted red, the Protestant church,
                    formerly the church of the abbey of Thennenbach, removed thither in 1839, the
                    hall of art and harmony, and the barracks, erected by the Austrian Government in
                    1776, and capable of containing 5000 men. The charitable institutions include a
                    foundling hospital, an orphan asylum, a blind asylum, and a military hospital.
                    In the centre of the fishmarket square is a fountain surmounted by a statue of
                    Duke Berthold III. of Zähringen, the founder of the city; in the Franciskaner
                    Platz there is a monument to Schwarz, the traditional discoverer of gunpowder;
                    the Rotteck Platz takes its name from the monument of Rotteck, the historian,
                    which formerly stood on the site of the Schwarz statue; and in Kaiser Wilhelm
                    Strasse a bronze statue was erected in 1876 to the memory of Herder, who in the
                    early part of the 19th century founded in Freiburg an institute for draughtsmen,
                    engravers, and lithographers, and carried on a famous bookselling business. On
                    the Schlossberg above the town there are massive ruins of two castles which were
                    destroyed by the French in 1744; and about two miles to the N.E. stands the
                    castle of Zähringen. the original seat of the famous family of counts. Situated
                    on the ancient road which runs by the Höllenpass between the valleys of the
                    Danube and the Rhine, Freiburg early acquired commercial importance, and it is
                    still the principal centre of the trade of the Black Forest. It manufactures
                    chicory, chemicals, starch, leather, tobacco, silk thread, paper, and hempen
                    goods, as well as beer and wine. The population is rapidly increasing. In 1864
                    it numbered 19,085, inclusive of the suburbs of Herdern and Wiehre, and in 1875
                    no less than 30,531. About a sixth of the whole are Protestants.</p>
                <p>Freiburg was founded, as has been already stated, by Count Berthold 111. of
                    Zähringen. In 1120 it became a free town, with privileges similar to those of
                    Cologne; but in 1219 it fell into the hands of a branch of the family of Urach.
                    After it had vainly attempted to throw off the yoke by force of arms, it
                    obtained its freedom in 1366 for a sum of 20,000 silver marks; but as it was
                    unable to reimburse the creditors who had advanced the money, it was, in 1368,
                    obliged to recognize the supremacy of the house of Haρsburg. In the 17th and
                    18th centuries it played a considerable part as a fortified town. It was
                    captured by the Swedes in 1632, 1634, and 1638; and in 1644 it was seized by the
                    Bavarians, who shortly after, under General Marcey, defeated in the
                    neighbourhood the French forces under Enghien and Turcnne. The French were in
                    possession from 1677 to 1697, and again in 1713-14 and 1744 , and when they left
                    the place in 1748, at the peace of Aix-la∙ Chapelle, they dismantled the
                    fortifications. The Baden insurgents gained a victory at Freiburg in 1848, and
                    the revolutionary Government took refuge in the town in June 1849, but in the
                    following July the Prussian forces took possession, and did not leave till
                    1851.</p>
