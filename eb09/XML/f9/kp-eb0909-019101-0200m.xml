                    must be regarded as being uncertain. Many writers have included in it the
                    Buntings <hi rend="italic">(Emberizidae),</hi> though these seem to be quite
                    distinct, and the grounds of their separation have been before assigned (c∕. <hi

                    some systematists have placed among the Finches the Mouse-birds <hi

                    slight study of osteological characters would have proved to be unsound; and a

                    rend="italic">Fringülidae</hi> arises from our ignorance of the anatomical
                    features, especially those of the head, possessed by many exotic forms.</p>
                <p>Taken as a whole, the Finches, concerning which no reasonable doubt can exist,
                    are not only little birds with a hard bill, adapted in most cases for shelling
                    and eating the various seeds that form the chief portion of their diet when
                    adult, but they appear to be mainly forms which predominate in and are highly
                    characteristic of the Palaearctic Region; moreover, though some are found
                    elsewhere on the globe, the existence of but very few in the Notogaean
                    hemisphere can as yet be regarded as certain.</p>
                <p>But even with this limitation, the separation of the undoubted <hi rend="italic"

                    the superficial character of the form of the bill, the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loxia</hi> (in its modern sense) would be easily divided not only from the
                    other Finches, but from all other birds. The birds of this genus—the
                    Crossbills—when their other characters are taken into account, prove to be
                    intimately allied on the one hand to the Grosbeaks <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pin,icfila)</hi> and on the other through the Redpolls <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Aegiothus)</hi> to the Linnets <hi rend="italic">{Linota)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> if indeed these two can be properly separated. The Linnets,

                    through the Siskins <hi rend="italic">{Chryso-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mitris)</hi> to the Goldfinches <hi rend="italic">{Carduelis)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and these last again to the Hawfinches, one group of which
                    <hi rend="italic">{Coccothraustes)</hi> is apparently not far distant from the
                    Chaffinches <hi rend="italic">{Fringilla</hi> proper), and the other <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hesperiplιona)</hi> seems to be allied to the Greenfinches <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ligurinus).</hi> Then there is the group of Serins <hi
                    rend="italic">{Serinus),</hi> to which the Canary-bird belongs, that one is in
                    doubt whether to refer to the vicinity of the Greenfinches or that of the
                    Redpolls. The Mountain-Finches (before named) may be regarded as pointing first
                    to the Rock-Sparrows <hi rend="italic">{Petronia)</hi> and then to the true
                    Sparrows <hi rend="italic">{Passer);</hi> while, returning to the Grosbeaks, we
                    find them passing into many varied forms which regard to space forbids our here
                    naming, and throwing out a very well marked form—the Bullfinches <hi
                    rend="italic">{Pyrrhτda).</hi> But our readers must be prepared to take all this
                    as problematical. Some of the modifications of the Family are very gradual, and
                    therefore conclusions founded on them are likely to be correct; others are
                    further apart, and the links which connect them, if not altogether missing, can
                    but be surmised. To avoid as much as possible prejudicing the case, we shall
                    therefore take the different groups of <hi rend="italic">Fringillidae</hi> which
                    it is convenient to consider in this article in an alphabetical arrangement.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Bullfinches</hi> thus present themselves first. Of these
                    the best known to our readers will be the familiar bird <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pyrrhula</hi><hi rend="italic">europaea),</hi> which hardly needs description.
                    The varied plumage of the cock—his bright red breast and his grey back, set off
                    by his coal-black head and quills—is naturally attractive; while the facility
                    with which he is tamed, with his engaging disposition in confinement, makes him
                    a popular cage-bird,—to say nothing of the fact (which in the opinion of so many
                    adds to his charms) of his readily loaming to “pipe” a tune, or some bars of
                    one, though this perversion of his natural notes is hardly agreeable to the
                    ornithologist. By gardeners the Bullfinch has long been regarded as a deadly
                    enemy, from its undoubted destruction of the buds of fruit-trees in spring-time,
                    though whether the destruction is really so much of a detriment is by no means
                    so undoubted. Northern and Eastern Europe is inhabited by a larger form <hi
                    rend="italic">{P.</hi><hi rend="italic">major),</hi> which differs in nothing
                    but size and more vivid tints from that which is common in the British Isles and
                    Western Europe. A very distinct species <hi rend="italic">{P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">murina),</hi> remarkable for its dull coloration, is peculiar to
                    the Azores, and several others are found in Asia from the Himalayas to Japan.
                    Recently a Bullfinch <hi rend="italic">{P.</hi><hi rend="italic">cassini)</hi>
                    has been discovered in Alaska, being the first recognition of this genus in the
                    New World.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Canary-Bird</hi><hi rend="italic">{Serinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">canarius)</hi> is indigenous to the islands whence it takes its
                    name, as well, apparently, as to the neighbouring groups of the Madeiras and
                    Azores, iu all of which it abounds. It seems to have been imported into Europe
                    at least as early as the first half of the 16th century,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The earliest published description seems to
                    be that of Gesner in 1555 (0rn., p. 234), but he had not seen the bird, an
                    account of which was communicated to him by Raphael Seiler of Augsburg, under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Suckeruögele.</hi></p></note> and has, as
                    everybody knows, since become the commonest of cage-birds. The wild stock is of
                    an olivegreen, mottled with dark brown, above, and greenish-yellow beneath. All
                    the bright-hued examples we now see in captivity have been induced by carefully
                    breeding from any chance varieties that have shewn themselves; and not only the
                    colour, but the build and stature of the bird have in this manner been greatly
                    modified. Of late the ingenuity of “the fancy,” which might seem to have
                    exhausted itself in the production of topknots, feathered feet, and so forth,
                    has brought about a still further change from the original type. It has been
                    found that by a particular treatment, in which the mixing of large quantities of
                    cayenne-pepper with the food plays an important part, the ordinary “canary
                    yellow” may be intensified so as to verge upon a more or less brilliant flame
                    colour. Birds which have successfully undergone this forcing process, and hence
                    called “hot canaries,” command a very high price, for a large proportion die
                    under the discipline, though it is said that they soon become exceedingly fond
                    of the exciting condiment. But it is impossible here to treat of this species in
                    its domesticated state. A small library of books has been written on the
                    subject.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Those most to

                    late years pushed its way towards the north, and has even been several times
                    taken in England (YarrelΓs <hi rend="italic">Brit. Birds,</hi> ed. 4, ii. pp.
