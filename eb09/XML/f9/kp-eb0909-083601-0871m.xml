                <p><label type="entry">FUR</label>. Certain animals, which inhabit the colder
                    climates, have a covering upon the skin called fur, lying alongside of another
                    and longer covering, called the overhair. The fur differs from the overhair in
                    that it is soft, silky, curly, downy, and barbed lengthwise, while the overhair
                    is straight, smooth, and comparatively rigid. These properties of fur constitute
                    its essential value for felting purposes, and mark its difference from wool and
                    silk; the first, after some slight preparation by the aid of hot water, readily
                    unites its fibres into a strong and compact mass; the others can best be managed
                    by spinning and weaving.</p>
                <p>On the living animal the overhair keeps the fur filaments apart, prevents their
                    tendency to felt, and protects them from injury—thus securing to the animal an
                    immunity from cold and storm; while, as a matter of fact, this very overhair,
                    though of an humbler name, is most generally the beauty and pride of the pelt,
                    and marks its chief value with the furrier. We arrive thus at two distinct and
                    opposite uses and values of fur. Regarded as useful for felt it is denominated
                    staple fur, while with respect to its use with and on the pelt it is called
                    fancy fur. For the one purpose the Russian hare skin is more valuable than the
                    Russian sable, while for the other the sable may be valued at one thousand times
                    the former.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The manufacture of fur into a felt is of
                    comparatively modern origin, while the use of fur pelts as a covering for the
                    body, for the couch, or for the tent is coeval with the earliest history of all
                    northern tribes and nations. They were not simply a barbarous expedient to
                    defend man from the rigours of an arctic winter; woven wool alone cannot, in its
                    most perfect form, accomplish this. The pelt or skin is requisite to keep out
                    the piercing wind and driving storm, while the fur and overhair ward off the
                    cold; and they are as much a necessity to-day among more northern peoples as
                    they ever were in the days of barbarism. With them the providing of this
                    necessary covering became the first purpose of their toil; subsequently the
                    article grew into an object of barter and traffic, at first among themselves,
                    and afterwards with their neighbours of more temperate climes; and with the
                    latter it naturally became an article of fashion, of ornament, and of luxury.
                    This, in brief, has been the history of its use in China, Tartary, Russia,
                    Siberia, and North America, and at present the employment of fancy furs among
                    the civilized nations of Europe and America has grown to be more extensive than
                    at any former period. The supply of this demand in earlier times led to such
                    severe competition as to terminate in tribal pillages and even national wars;
                    and in modern times it has led to commercial ventures on the part of individuals
                    and companies, the account of which, told in its plainest form, reads like the
                    pages of a romance. Furs have constituted the price of redemption for royal
                    captives, the gifts of emperors and kings, and the pecular badge of state
                    functionaries. At the present day they vie with precious gems and gold as
                    ornaments and garniture for wealth and fashion; but by their abundance, and the
                    cheapness of some varieties, they have recently come within the reach of men of
                    moderate incomes. The history of furs can be read in Marco Polo, as he grows
                    eloquent with the description of the rich skins of the khan of Tartary; in the
                    early fathers of the church, who lament their introduction into Rome and
                    Byzantium as an evidence of barbaric and debasing luxury; in tho political
                    history of Russia, stretching out a powerful arm over Siberia to secure her rich

                    the St Lawrence to its source in Lake Superior, and the subsequent contest to
                    retain possession against England; in the early settlements of New England, New
                    York, and Virginia; in Irving’s <hi rend="italic">Astoria,</hi>; in the records
                    of tho Hudson’s Bay Company; and in the annals of the fairs held at
                    Nijni-Novgorod and Leipsic. Here it may suffice to give some account of the
                    present condition of the trade in fancy furs. The collection of skins is now
                    chiefly a matter of private enterprise. Few, if any, monopolies exist. The
                    Alaska Commercial Company, now about ten years old, enjoys some special
                    privilege for the taking of seal skins on the Pribiloff Islands, and some
                    peculiar restrictions exist in Russia in relation to certain peltries, but
                    beyond this, the trade in furs is a free one the world over. Individual
                    enterprise, skill, forecast, and capital, have an open field. The Hudson’s Bay
                    Company, with its chief office in London, still maintains its organization, but
                    conducts its affairs in North America under no special or royal grant, and
                    competes in the open market with individual traders throughout Canada, Labrador,
                    Manitoba, and Columbia. Its collection of peltries is offered to the highest
                    bidder at public auction in London, in January, March, and September of each
                    year.</p>
                <p>Private collectors and dealers throughout Canada and the United States forward
                    their furs to the seaboard, chiefly to New York, for sale there, or for
                    consignment principally to London and to Leipsic. The latter town still
                    maintains the custom of spring and autumn fairs, at which most kinds of wares
                    are sold or exchanged with dealers from Turkey, Austria, and Russia.
                    Nijni-Nυvgorod is the chief fair for European Russia, though very important
                    fairs are also held in Kasan and in Irbit among the Ural Mountains. The most
                    important fair for eastern Siberia is held at Kiachta, on the borders of China,
                    where an extensive exchange of furs is carried on with the Celestials. Japan has
                    added but little to the activity or extension of the fur trade, though her
                    northern shores have furnished many a fine fur seal and sea otter to the hardy
                    navigator. Staple furs, or those used chiefly in the manufacture of hats, are
                    those of the have and the rabbit, collected mainly in Russia, Germany, France,
                    and England, dressed, carroted, and cut from the skin in western Germiny,
                    France, Belgium, and England, and thence distributed to the manufacturing
                    centres of the world; and here it may be added that the clippings and cuttings
                    of fancy furs from the workshops of furriers are all saved, and find their way
                    to the machinery which utilizes the waste and transforms them into hatters’
                    furs. But of all these fur marts that of London is the chief, for thither tend
                    by the laws of trade, not only much of the produce of Asia and Europe, but also
                    the fine peltries of Chili and Peru, the nutria from Buenos Ayres, the fur seal
                    of Cape Horn and South Shetland, the hair seal from Newfoundland, as well as the
                    inferior peltries of Africa. To prepare fur skins in a way to endure this long
                    transportation is a simple and easy matter. When stripped from the animal the
                    flesh and fat are carefully removed, and the pelts hung in a cool place to dry
                    and harden; nothing is added to protect them. Care is taken that they do not
                    heat after packing, and that they are occasionally beaten to destroy worms. A
                    marked exception is the case of the fur seal, which is best preserved by liberal
                    salting and packing in hogsheads. All other raw furs are marketed in bales.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kinds and Quantities—</hi> Few kinds of animals furnish a pelt
                    of suitable weight and pliability, and all of them differ widely in elegance of
                    texture, delicacy of shade, and fineness of overhair, and it is these
                    differences which determine their place in the catalogue of merchandise. These
                    few animals are not very prolific, and many of them attain their greatest beauty
                    in wild and uncultivated regions. To this remark there are some notable
                    exceptions. Being thus few in kind, and limited in quantity, one might fear the
                    extinction of the several choice varieties through the persistent energy of the
                    trapper. But here the fickleness of fashion steps in, and does for the fur trade
                    what the law of supply and demand does for the more staple articles of commerce.
                    Fashion, fastidious and fickle, neglects the use of certain kinds for a season;
                    the market price of the pelt no longer repays the outfit of the trapper; the
                    hunt is intermitted, and in two or three years the animal regains its numbers
                    and strength. The annual collection of furs is thus a matter of ceaseless
                    change; but the following may be relied on as an estimate correct enough for all
                    practical purposes :—∙</p>

                    to 2⅛ inches long; the pelt is very soft, tough, and durable. The best are from

                    the State of Maine, and the Labrador coast. It is most abundant in the middle

                    inches; overhair coarse and light brown; fur fine, thick, and silky; in general
                    favour with furriers, and available for a great variety of purposes. Best are
                    from New England and New York; very prolific in cultivated regions. The price is
                    very fluctuating, and as the annual collection varies from three to five
                    millions of skins, it is difficult to forecast the market value. Price for
                    prime, from 6d. to 3s. A variety of black coloured musk-rat from Delaware and
                    Maryland fetches double these prices.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nutria.—</hi> From the La Plata, South America; in size and
                    value between the beaver and the musk-rat; overhair coarse and rigid; fur short
                    and fine; pelts too often unsound, and hence the value of the fur is chiefly for
                    hats. Price of dry skins from Is. to 2s. per pound.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Opossum.—</hi> Chiefly from the United States, but some also
                    from Australia. Overhair long, coarse and whitish grey; fur woolly. Best from

                    fine, and extending but little beyond the fur, which itself is very thick,
                    close, fine, and silky; colour dark brown, occasionally with silver points
                    regularly interspersed; pelt pliable and firm. The poorest skins are not more
                    valuable than those of the beaver; but the fine choice specimens command from
                    £20 to £100. They are in high repute with the Russians and Chinese.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rabbit.—</hi> Size, 10 by 16 inches; fur thick and fine; pelt
                    weak; colour all shades from black to white. Best are found in England, but the
                    purest come from Poland. The best coloured skins are used by furriers, but much
                    the larger portion is cut for hatters’ fur. The animal is largely bred in
                    warrens, and its flesh used as food; the pelts thus become of secondary
                    importance, and, being abundant, supply a cheap fur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Raccoon.—</hi> One of the peculiar and valuable pelts of the

                    resembling that of the beaver; colour from silver blue to grey brown and coffee
                    brown. Best are from Michigan and Ohio. Average value of prime, 4s. Some
                    specimens vie with the fisher in its peculiar shade, and some even with the
                    silver fox, and such rare skins bring from £1 to £4.</p>

                    caught in winter are in prime condition. The choicest skins are taken on the

                    hardwood sawdust at about blood heat, drawing the pelt over a sharp knife to
                    remove every particle of flesh, and finally trampling them again in clean
                    sawdust. The pelt thus becomes soft and pliable like the fine kid used for
                    gloves. They are then ready for the furrier, who assorts the skins as to colour
                    and overhair, and cuts them in various ways to bring them to the pattern of the
                    article required. Having been sewed together with a close, fine overseam, the
                    article is damped, and stretched upon a smooth pine board after a pattern
                    marked, then nailed along its edges and left to dry. After removal from the
                    board the article is trimmed, and softened by rubbing, and is then ready for the
                    liner. The skill of the furrier lies in the taste exhibited in the arrangement
                    of the furs, and in the economy of use of material.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dyeing.—</hi> Furs are dyed in a variety of ways to make them
                    uniform in colour, and adapt them to the fashion and taste of the time.
                    Ordinarily this is a cheap and ready process, and only becomes an art when
                    employed upon fine skins, from which the overhair has been first removed by
                    plucking, leaving the fur alone to receive the dye-stuff. Among these are the
                    skins of the musk rat, beaver, otter, and especially the fur seal; the last has
                    received very careful attention, as its entire value depends upon the perfection
                    and success of the process. Unprime fur seals part with their overhair very
                    reluctantly, while the seasoned skins are very readily unhaired, leaving the fur
                    in all its smoothness; thus the best grades are likely to be very good, while
                    the rest rank only from ordinary to very common. Λ subsequent process is the
                    removal of all grease from the fur, which is effected by repeated washings in
                    softened water; if this is imperfectly done, the colour will be uneven and not
                    permanent. The final work is to prepare a dye of suitable strength, and apply it
                    in a suitable way, to infuse the colouring matters into the fur, without
                    suffering too much of it to reach the pelt, whereby its durability might be
                    ruined. London claims to have accomplished this for the sealskin in a manner
                    that distances all competition; and it certainly enjoys a wide popularity, as
                    well as the substantial fruits of the sale of its production of coloured seals.
                    ButAmerica also has its successful dyers of seals, one of the most important of
                    the results they have achieved being the giving to the fur seal a fine deep
                    brown colour, without injuring or burning the fur, while leaving the pelt soft,
                    light, and durable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prices of Fancy Furs.—</hi> The market value of dressed and
                    manufactured furs is at the mercy of fickle fashion and the weather. The
                    production of any one variety is very limited, and consequently those that are
                    in fashion during a cold winter command full and even extravagant prices, while
                    others, of equal intrinsic merit, have a merely nominal value. The consumer is
                    not more responsible for this than are the furrier and the fur merchant. It
                    was’the remark of an old and successful fur dealer that “furs when wanted are
                    diamonds, when not wanted are charcoal.” This fact renders the trade an
                    extremely hazardous one, and tends to make the venture in it a matter of
                    speculation rather than of provident enterprise; and while the consumer
                    occasionally may have to pay a very extravagant price for some few varieties of
                    furs for a short period, it happens far more frequently that the fur dealer is a
                    severe sufferer by reason of sanguine anticipations of advance in values, which
                    in nine cases out of ten are doomed to disappointment. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.
