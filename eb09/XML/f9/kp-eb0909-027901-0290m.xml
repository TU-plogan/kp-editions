                    occurring in north temperate regions, and having the following characters
                    :—Rootstock creeping, horizontal, thick, with dichotomous joints, or tuberous;
                    leaves usually ensiform and equitant; flowers large and showy; the perianth (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany, voL</hi> iv. p. 144, fig. 268) superior, with the
                    three outer segments large, spreading, or revolute, and frequently bearded at
                    the base, and the three inner smaller, sub-erect, and converging; stamens three,
                    inserted at base of outer segments of perianth, and concealed by the stigmas;
                    anthers extrorse; stigmas three, petaloid, and arching over the stamens; capsule
                    three-celled, dehiscing loculicidally; and seeds numerous, with a fleshy
                    albumen. Many kinds of flag are cultivated in England, but only two species are
                    indigenous. One of these, <hi rend="italic">Iris Pseudacorus,</hi> the Yellow
                    Flag or Iris, is common in Britain on river banks, and in marshes and ditches.
                    It is called the “Water-flag” or “bastard Floure de-luce” by Gerard, who remarks
                    that “although it be a water plant of nature, yet being planted in gardens it
                    prospereth well.” Its flowers appear in June and July, and are of a
                    golden-yellow colour. The leaves are from two to four feet long, and half an
                    inch to an inch broad. Towards the latter part of the year they are eaten by
                    cattle. The seeds are numerous and pale-brown; they have been recommended when
                    roasted as a substitute for coffee, of which, however, they have not the
                    properties. The astringent rhizome has diuretic, purgative, and emetic
                    properties, and may, it is said, be used for dyeing black, and in the place of
                    galls for ink-making. The other British species, <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">foetidissima,</hi> the Fetid Iris, Gladdon, or Roast-beef Plant,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Xyris</hi> or StinkingGladdon of Gerard, is a native of
                    England south of Durham, and also of Ireland, southern Europe, and north Africa.
                    Its flowers are usually of a dull, leaden-blue colour; the capsules, which
                    remain attached to the plant throughout the winter, are 2 to 3 inches long; and
                    the seeds scarlet When bruised this species emits a peculiar and disagreeable
                    odour; Among other flags common in Europe are <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Germanica,</hi> probably the Illyrian iris of the ancients, the

                    rend="italic">I. pallida,</hi> a native of Istria, with pale-blue flowers; and

                    underground stems of these three species constitute the “orrisroot” or <hi
                    rend="italic">rhizoma</hi><hi rend="italic">Iridis</hi> of pharmacy, formerly
                    known as « ireos” or “orice,” which is exported in considerable quantity from
                    southern Europe, more especially from the neighbourhood of Leghorn and Trieste.
                    To prepare orrisroot the rhizome is in August dug up and freed of its rootlets
                    and brown outer bark; it is then dried, and packed in casks for sale. Orris-root
                    occurs in commerce in whitish, knobby, sometimes branched pieces, of about the
                    thickness of the thumb, and having on one side numerous pits where the rootlets
                    were attached. It has a bitterish and acrid taste, and is purgative and emetic
                    in properties. By drying it acquires the odour of violets. It is exported to
                    India, where it is called <hi rend="italic">bekhbunufsha</hi> (violet-root). By
                    the ancients it was valued both for its odour and its healing virtues; and in
                    England it was in past times in repute as a medicine for various complaints.
                    Gerard states that “the root of the common Flower deduce, cleane washed, and
                    stamped with a few drops of Rose water, and laid plaister-wise upon the face of
                    man or woman, doth in two dayes at the most take away the blacknesse or
                    blewnesse of any stroke or bruse he further advocates the use of the same remedy
                    in dropsy and infirmities of the chest. It is now employed in the preparation of
                    violet-powder, and of scented hair and tooth-powders and oils, as a perfume for
                    the breath, for making issue-peas, and occasionally as an errhine. At the risk
                    of causing irritation of the mouth and disturbance of the bowels, it is
                    sometimes given to teething infants to bite. In America the rhizome of <hi
                    rend="italic">I. versicolor,</hi> the Blue Flag, as also that of <hi
                    rend="italic">I. Fiorentina,</hi> is employed as a purgative and alterative in
                    strumous complaints. Orris-root contains, besides gum, ligneous matter, and
                    elliptical granules of starch, an acid resin, <hi rend="italic">iridin</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">irisin,</hi> precipitable from the tincture by water, and said
                    in small doses to act as a stimulant of the glandular system; also one-twelfth
                    per cent, of a semisolid substance, the <hi rend="italic">butter</hi> or <hi

                    According to some writers the blossom of the iris is represented in the
                    well-known heraldic device, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fleur-de-lis</hi><hi

                <p>The Sweet Flag, or Sweet Sedge, probably the <hi rend="italic">aκopov</hi> of
                    Dioscorides, is the species <hi rend="italic">A corns Calamus,</hi> L., a plant
                    of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Acoraceae</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orontiaceae.</hi> It has a wide distribution, growing in wet situations in the
                    Himalayas, North America, Siberia, and various parts of Europe, including
                    England, and has been naturalized in Scotland and Ireland. The leaves are
                    sweet-scented, and are ensiform, equitant, 3 to 6 feet long, and two-thirds to
                    1⅛ inches broad; and the spadix is lateral, with bisexual flowers. The rhizome
                    <hi rend="italic">(rhizoma calami</hi><hi rend="italic">aromatici),</hi> which
                    has a more powerful odour than the herbage, is creeping, horizontal, and woody;
                    it has been employed as an aromatic stimulant, antispasmodic, and tonic. Sir J.
                    E. Smith <hi rend="italic">Eng. Flora,</hi> ü. 158, 2d ed., 1828) mentions it as
                    a popular remedy in Norfolk for ague. In India it is used as an insectifuge, and
                    is administered in infantile diarrhaea. It is an ingredient in <hi rend="italic"

                    The rhizome of <hi rend="italic">Acorus Calamus</hi> is sometimes adulterated
                    with that of <hi rend="italic">Iris Pseudacorus,</hi> which, however, is
                    distinguishable by its lack of odour, astringent taste, and dark colour.</p>
