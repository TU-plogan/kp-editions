                        rend="smallcaps">Robert,</hi> two learned Scotch printers and publishers,
                    whose enterprise and devotion to the interests of the higher education deserve
                    to be gratefully remembered. Robert, the eIder of the two, was born in 1707, and
                    his brother in 1712. Their father was a maltman in Glasgow, and they
                    consequently had very ordinary opportunities for intellectual culture in their
                    early years. Robert was apprenticed to a barber; but his ability attracted the
                    attention of Dr Francis Hutchison, who strongly recommended him to establish a
                    printing press. After spending 1738 and 1739 in England and France in company
                    with his brother Andrew, who had been intended for the church and had received a
                    better education, he started business about 1740-1, and in 1743 was appointed
                    printer to the university. In this same year he brought out Demetrius Phalereus,
                    the first Greek book ever printed in Glasgow; and this was soon followed by the
                    famous 12mo edition of Horace which was long but erroneously believed to be
                    immaculate: though the successive sheets were suspended in the university and a
                    reward offered for the discovery of any inaccuracy, six errors at least,
                    according to Dibdin, escaped detection. Soon afterwards the brothers entered
                    into partnership, and they continued for about 30 years to issue carefully
                    corrected and elegantly printed editions of classical works in Latin, Greek,
                    English, French, and Italian. Upwards of 500 separate publications proceeded
                    from their press—among the more noticeable being the small editions of Cicero,
                    Tacitus, Cornelius Nepos, Virgil, Tibullus and Propertius, Lucretius, and
                    Juvenal; a beautiful edition of the Greek Testament, in small 4to; Homer, 4
                    vols, fol., 1756-1758; Herodotus, Greek and Latin, 9 yols. 12mo, 1761; Xenophon,
                    Greek and Latin, 12 vols, in 12mo, 1762-1767; Gray’s Poems; Pope’s Works;
                    Milton’s Poems. The brothers spared no pains, and Robert went to France to
                    procure manuscripts of the classics, and to engage a skilled engraver and a
                    copper-plate printer. Unfortunately it became their ambition to establish an
                    institution for the encouragement of the fine arts; and though one of their
                    chief patrons, the earl of Northumberland, warned them to “print for posterity
                    and prosper,” they spent their money in collecting pictures, pieces of
                    sculpture, and models, in paying for the education and travelling of youthful
                    artists, and in copying the masterpieces of foreign art. Their countrymen were
                    not ripe for such an attempt, and the “Academy” not only proved a failure but
                    involved the projectors in ruin. Andrew died in 1775, and his brother went to
                    London, hoping to realize a large sum by the sale of his pictures. They were
                    sold for much less than he anticipated, and he returned broken-hearted to
                    Scotland, where he died at Edinburgh in June 1776. The debts of the firm
                    amounted to £6500. Robert was the author of a <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of
