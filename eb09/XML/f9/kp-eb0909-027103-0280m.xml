                    mother’s, of the first marquis of Londonderry. He entered the navy from the
                    Royal Naval College, then a school for cadets, on the 19th October 1819, andon
                    the 7thSeptember 1824 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. After serving in
                    the “Thetis” frigate in the Mediterranean and on the coast of South America,
                    under the command of Sir John Phillimore and Captain <pb break="no"

                    “Ganges,” as flag-lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Otway, the
                    commauder-in-chicf on the South American station; and on the melancholy death of
                    Commander Stokes of the “Beagle,” 13th November 1828, was promoted to the vacant
                    command. The “Beagle,” a small brig of about 210 tons, was then, and had been
                    for the two previous years, employed on the survey of the coasts of Patagonia
                    and Tierra del Fuego, under the orders of Commander King in the “Adventure,”
                    and, together with the “Adventure,” returned to England in the autumn of 1830.
                    Fitzroy had brought home with him four Fuegians, one of whom died of small-pox a
                    few weeks after arriving in England; to the others he endeavoured, with but
                    slight success, to impart a rudimentary knowledge of religion and of some useful
                    handicrafts; and, as he had pledged himself to restore them to their native
                    country, he was making preparations in the summer of the following year to carry
                    them back in a merchant ship bound to Valparaiso, when he received his
                    reappointment to the “Beagle,” to continue the survey of the same wild coasts.
                    The “Beagle” sailed from Plymouth on the 27th December 1831, carrying as a
                    supernumerary Mr Charles Darwin, to whose experience, then gained, the study of
                    natural history has been so deeply indebted. After an absence of nearly five
                    years, end having, in addition to the survey of the Straits of Magellan and a
                    great part of the coast of South America, run a chronometric line round the
                    world, thus fixing the longitude of many secondary meridians with sufficient
                    exactness for all the purposes of ordinary navigation, the “Beagle” anchored at
                    Falmouth on the 2d October 1836. In 1834 Fitzroy had been advanced to the rank
                    of captain, and was now fur the next few years principally employed in reducing
                    and discussing his numerous observations In 1837 he was awarded the gold medal
                    of the Royal Geographical Society; and in 1839 he published, in two thick 8vo
                    volumes, the narrative of the voyage of the “Adventure” and “Beagle,” 1826-30,
                    and of the “Beagle,” 1831-36, with a third volume by Mr Darwin—a book familiarly
                    known as a record of scientific travel. Of Fitzroy’s work as a surveyor it is
                    superfluous to speak. Though carried on under circumstances of great difficulty,
                    with scanty means, and with an outfit that was semi-officially denounced as
                    “shabby,” the results have long been before the world stamped with the approval
                    of the nautical profession, and more especially of Sir Francis Beaufort, the
                    Hydrographer to the Admiralty, who, in a report to the House of Commons, 10th
                    Feburary 1848, wrote that “from the equator to Cape Horn, and from thence round

                    achieved by the splendid survey of Captain Robert Fitzroy.”</p>
                <p>In 1841 Fitzroy unsuccessfully contested the borough of Ipswich, and in the
                    following year was returned to parliament ns member for Durham. About the same
                    time he accepted the post of conservator of the Mersey, and in his double
                    capacity obtained leave to bring in a bill for improving the condition and
                    efficiency of officers in the mercantile marine. This was not proceeded with at
                    the time, but gave rise to the “voluntary certificate” instituted by the Board
                    of Trade in 1845, and furnished some important clauses to the Mercantile Marine
                    Act of 1850.</p>
                <p>Early in 1843 Fitzroy was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of New
                    Zealand, then recently established as a colony. He arrived in his government in
                    December, whilst the excitement about the Wairau massacre was still fresh, and
                    the questions relating to the purchase of land from the natives were in a very
                    unsatisfactory state. The early settlers were greedy and unscrupulous; Fitzroy,
                    on the other hand, had made no secret of his partiality for the aborigines.
                    Between such discordant elements agreement was impossible: the settlers insulted
                    the governor; the governor did not conciliate the settlers, who denounced his
                    policy as adverse to their interests, as unjust and illegal; colonial feeling
                    against him ran very high; petition after petition for his recall was sent home,
                    and the Government was compelled to yield to the pressure brought to bear on it.
                    Fitzroy was relieved by Sir George Grey in November 1845.</p>
                <p>In September 1848 he was appointed acting superintendent of the dockyard at
                    Woolwich, and in the following March to the command of the “Arrogant,” one of
                    the early screw frigates which had been fitted out under his supervision, and
                    with which it was desired to carry out a series of experiments and trials. When
                    these were finished he applied to be superseded, on account at once of his
                    health and of his private affairs. In February 1850 he was accordingly placed on
                    half-pay; nor did he ever serve again, although advanced in due course by
                    seniority to the ranks of rear and vice-admiral on the retired list (1857,
                    1863). In 1851 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1854 after
                    serving for a few months as private secretary to his uncle, Lord Hardinge, the
                    commander-in-chief of the army, he was appointed to the meteorological
                    department of the Board of Trade, with, in the first instance, the peculiar
                    title of “Meteorological Statist.”</p>
                <p>From the date of his joining the “Beagle” in 1828 be had paid very great
                    attention to the different phenomena foreboding or accompanying change of
                    weather, and his narratives of the voyages of the “Adventure” and “Beagle” are
                    full of interesting and valuable details concerning these. Accordingly, when in
                    1854 Lord Wrottesley, the president of the Royal Society, was asked by the Board
                    of Trade to recommend a chief for its newly forming meteorological department,
                    he, almost without hesitation, nominated Fitzroy, whose name and career became
                    from that time identified with the progress of practical meteorology. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Weather Book,</hi> published in 1863, embodies in broad outline
                    his views, far in advance of those then generally held; and though, in the rapid
                    march of modern science, this book must be considered as now in some measure
                    obsolete, it is still worthy of careful attention and exact study, not only from
                    the professed meteorologist, but from any one who wishes to have an intelligent
                    appreciation of that question of everyday interest, the weather. His storm
                    warnings, in their origin, indeed, liable to a charge of empiricism, were
                    gradually developed on a more scientific basis, and gave a high percentage of
                    correct results. They were continued for eighteen months after his death by the
                    assistants he had trained, and though stopped when the department was
                    transferred to the management of a committee of the Royal Society, they were
                    resumed α few months afterwards. But though it is perhaps by these storm
                    warnings that Fitzroy’s name has been most generally known, seafaring men owe
                    him a deeper debt of gratitude, not only for his labours in reducing to a more
                    practical form the somewhat complicated wind charts of Captain Maury, but also
                    for his great exertions in connexion with the life-boat association. Into this
                    work, in its many ramifications, he threw himself with the energy of an
                    excitable temperament, already, it may be feared, strained by his long and
                    anxious service in the Straits of Magellan. His last years were fully and to an
                    excessive degree occupied by it; his health, both bodily and mental, threatened
                    to give way; but he refused to take the rest that was prescribed. In a fit of
                    mental aberration he put an end to his existence on the 30th April 1865.</p>
