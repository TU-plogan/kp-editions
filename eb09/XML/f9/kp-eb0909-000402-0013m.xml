                    a distinguished palaeontologist and botanist, descended from an old Scotch
                    family, was born at Forres, 29th February 1808. In 1826 he graduated as M.A. at
                    Aberdeen, where he began to manifest a decided taste for the study of natural
                    history and botany. He afterwards studied medicine in the university of
                    Edinburgh, taking the degree of M.D. in 1829. Proceeding to India in 1830 as
                    assistant-surgeon on the Bengal establishment of the East India Company, he made
                    on his arrival an examination of the fossil bones from Ava in the possession of
                    the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and a description of the collection which he
                    published immediately gave him a recognized position among the scientists of
                    India. In 1831 he was appointed to the army station at Meerut, in the
                    north-western provinces, and in 1832 he succeeded his friend Dr Royle as
                    superintendent of the botanic garden of Saharunpoor. He was thus placed in a
                    district particularly rich in palaeontological remains, the existence of which
                    were, however, then unknown; and he immediately set to work to investigate both
                    its natural history and geology. In 1834 he published a description of the
                    geological character of the neighbouring Sewalik hills, in the Tertiary strata
                    of which he discovered bones of crocodiles, tortoises, and other fossil remains;
                    and subsequently, along with other conjoint labourers, he brought to light a
                    sub-tropical fossil fauna of unexampled extent and richness. For these valuable
                    discoveries he and Captain Cautley received in 1837 the Wollaston medal in
                    duplicate from the Geological Society of London. In 1834 Falconer was appointed
                    to inquire into the fitness of India for the growth of the tea-plant, and it was
                    on his recommendation that it was introduced into that country. He also made
                    large natural history collections, not only of the productions of the country
                    round Saharunpoor, but also of the valley of Kashmir and the countries to the
                    north of it, exploring at the same time the glacier on the southern flank of the
                    Muztagh range, and the great glaciers of Arindoh and of the Braldoh valley. He
                    was compelled by illness to leave India in 1842, and during his stay in England,
                    besides reading various papers on his discoveries before several learned
                    societies, he occupied himself with the classification and arrangement of the
                    Indian fossils presented to the British Museum and East India House, chiefly by
                    himself and Captain Cautley. In 1848 he was appointed superintendent of the
                    Calcutta botanical garden, and professor of botany in the medical college; and
                    on entering on his duties he was at once employed by the Indian Government and
                    the Agricultural and Horticultural Society as their adviser on all matters
                    connected with the vegetable products of India. Being compelled by the state of
                    his health to leave India in 1855, he spent the remainder of his life chiefly in
                    examining fossil species in England and the Continent corresponding to those
                    which he had discovered in India. In the course of his researches he became
                    interested in the question of the antiquity of the human race, and actually
                    commenced a work on “Primeval Man,” which, however, he was not spared to finish.
                    He died 31st January 1865. He was a member of many learned societies, both
                    British and foreign. Shortly after his death a committee was formed for the
                    promotion of a “Falconer Memorial.” This took the shape of a marble bust, which
                    was placed in the rooms of the Royal Society of London, and of a Falconer
                    scholarship of the annual value of £100, open for competition to graduates in
                    science or medicine of the university of Edinburgh.</p>
