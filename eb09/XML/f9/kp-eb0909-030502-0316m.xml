                    1616; the same patron presented him in 1621 with the rectory of Hilgay in
                    Norfolk; in the same year he married. He named his eldest son Edmund, in honour,
                    no doubt, of Edmund Spenser, for whom he preserved an intense admiration. In
                    1627 he published his long poem, in Latin and English, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Locustae, or the Apollyonists,</hi> a furious invective against the Jesuits.
                    Next year appeared a fine but sensuous poem, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britain's Ida,</hi> which was attributed on the title-page to Spenser; but many
                    critics, and particularly Dr A. B. Grosart, consider it to be the work of
                    Phineas Fletcher. The drama of <hi rend="italic">Sicelides</hi> was printed in
                    1631. In 1632 he brought out a theological treatise in prose, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Joy in Tribulation,</hi> and in 1633 his <hi rend="italic">magnum
                    opus,</hi> the famous poem of <hi rend="italic">The Purple Island.</hi> His <hi
                    rend="italic">Piscatory Eclogues</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous
                    Poems</hi> appeared on the same occasion. It is believed that in 1650 he was
                    ejected from his living, but nothing is known of the date or circumstances of
                    his death. In the preface to his posthumous prose work, <hi rend="italic">A
                    Father's Testament,</hi> published in 1670, he is spoken of as having been some
                    years dead. The <hi rend="italic">Purple</hi><hi rend="italic">Island, or the
                    Isle of Man,</hi> is a poem in twelve cantos, describing in cumbrous allegory
                    the whole physiological and intellectual construction of the human body. The
                    veins are spoken of as rivers, the bones as mountains, and the ingenuity as well
                    as scientific knowledge displayed is very considerable. The manner of Spenser is
                    preserved throughout, though not so closely as to destroy the distinct flavour
                    of original genius. The allegory itself is found very tedious and prosaic at the
                    present day; but some of the reflective passages, and the rich, jewelled
                    descriptions of Arcadian scenery possess living charm. Five cantos are occupied
                    with the phenomena of the body, and seven with those of the mind. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Piscatory Eclogues</hi> have nothing to do with fishing; they are
                    simply pastorals in the usual style, the characters being supposed to be
                    fisherboys reposing by the river Cam. The poetry of Phineas Fletcher never
                    approaches the occasional sublimity of that of his brother Giles; it carries the
                    Marini manner to a still more tasteless excess; but it is generally fluent,
                    luxurious, and lacking neither colour nor music.</p>
                <p>A very complete edition of the poetical works of Phineas Fletcher, in 4 vols.,
                    was privately printed by Dr Grosart in 1868. It is the only careful reprint that
                    lias been issued.</p>
