                    (1749-1806), born on the 24th of January 1749, at 9 Conduit Street, in the city
                    of Westminster, was the third son of Henry Fox, first Lord Holland. His mother
                    was the eldest daughter of the second duke of Richmond. As his
                    great-great-grandmother was duchess of Portsmouth, he had in his veins the blood
                    of Charles II. of England and Henry IV. of France. His paternal grandfather, Sir
                    Stephen Fox, was born shortly after Charles I. ascended the throne, and died
                    shortly after the accession of George I. The public services of this member of
                    the Fox family have received less notice than they deserve. He was a yeoman’s
                    son who, having been taught to read, write, and cipher, was considered capable
                    of rising in the world. When a youth he first obtained a situation in the
                    household of the earl of Northumberland; then he entered the service of Lord
                    Percy, the earl’s brother, and he was present with the royalist army at the
                    battle of Worcester as Lord Percy’s deputy at the ordnance board. Accompanying
                    Charles II. in his flight to the Continent, he served him in a menial capacity
                    during his exile, till he was promoted to be keeper of the privy purse. He was
                    employed as intermediary between the king and General Monk. Honours and
                    emolument were his reward after the Restoration; he was knighted, and appointed
                    to the lucrative offices of clerk of the green cloth and paymaster of the
                    forces. He entered the House of Commons, first as member for Salisbury, and
                    secondly for Westminster. He succeeded the earl of Rochester as a commissioner
                    of the treasury, filling that office for 23 years and during three reigns. At
                    the mature age of seventy-seven he married for the second time; four children
                    were the issue of this marriage. He died in 1716 at the age of eighty-nine, and
                    left a large fortune. It is his distinction to have founded Chelsea hospital,
                    and to have contributed £13,000 in aid of this laudable public work. Though his
                    place as a statesman is in the second or even the third rank, yet he was a
                    useful man in his generation, and a public servant who creditably discharged all
                    the duties with which he was entrusted. Unlike other statesmen of his day, he
                    grew rich in the service of the nation without being suspected of corruption,
                    and without forfeiting the esteem of his contemporaries. Sir Stephen Fox’s
                    second son by his second marriage was named Henry. Inheriting a large share of
                    the riches which his father had accumulated, he squandered it soon after
                    attaining his majority. Henry Fox went to the Continent to escape from his
                    creditors. There he made the acquaintance of a countrywoman of fortune, who
                    became his patroness and was so lavish with her purse that, after several years’
                    absence, he was in a position to return home and to enter parliament as member
                    for Hindon. He became the favourite pupil and devoted supporter of Sir Robert
                    Walpole, achieving unequalled and unenviable proficiency in the worst political
                    arts of his master and model. As a speaker he was fluent and self-possessed,
                    imperturbable under attack, audacious in exposition or retort, and able to hold
                    his own against Pitt himself. Thus he made himself a power in the House of
                    Commons, and an indispensable member of several administrations. He heaped up
                    riches when acting as paymaster of the forces during the war which Pitt
                    conducted with extraordinary vigour, and in which the nation was intoxicated
                    with glory. He served under the earl of Bute in order that he might exercise his
                    skill in cajolery and corruption to induce the House of Commons to approve of
                    the treaty of Paris; as a recompense, he was raised to the House of Lords with
                    the title of Baron Holland. He strove, but in vain, to obtain promotion to the
                    dignity of an earl, a dignity upon which he had set his heart, and he died a
                    sorely disappointed man, with a reputation for cunning and unscrupulousness
                    which cannot easily be matched, and with <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0526-0495"/> an unpopularity which justifies the conclusion
                    that he was the most thoroughly hated statesman of his day. Henry Fox’s
                    affection for his son Charles James verged on idolatry. The boy was both
                    precocious and engaging. Whatever he chose to learn, he acquired with ease, and
                    he displayed more than a boy’s good sense in correcting his faults. Once he
                    overheard his mother, with whom he was no favourite, remark to his father,
                    “Charles is dreadfully passionate; what shall we do with him <hi rend="italic"
                    >ì”</hi> and the reply, “Oh, never mind; he is a very sensible little fellow,
                    and he will learn to cure himself.” Thereupon he resolved to repress his angry
                    passions, and he succeeded in rendering himself a pattern for gentle bearing and
                    command of temper. He went to Eton when he was nine, having spent the preceding
                    year, at his own request, in the school kept at Wandsworth by Pampelonne, a
                    French refugee. The boy’s health was delicate, and this caused his father much
                    anxiety. He was not diligent in learning, nor was his tendency towards indolence
                    at school counteracted by the discipline to which he was subjected. The Rev. Dr
                    Francis, his tutor, sent to his father accounts more flattering than just of his
                    son’s progress and attention, and better fitted to gratify parental fondness
                    than set forth the truth. He often went home in order to accompany his parents
                    to some notable spectacle, chief among them being the coronation of George III.,
                    where he met with a slight accident, which, being reported in the newspapers,
                    caused his father to write, “The article [in the newspapers] of Charles’s mishap
                    has brought several messages. The boy is a great deal better beloved than his
                    father is.” When fourteen he left school for four months, which he spent with
                    his parents at Spa and Paris. His father taught him to game at Spa, giving him
                    several gold pieces wherewith to try his luck, as the saying is, every evening.
                    Hence he early became addicted to the vice which was for some years his
                    besetting sin, and for which he could urge no other excuse, when taunted with it
                    later by Lord Hillsborough in the House of Commons, than that it was a vice
                    “countenanced by the fashion of the times, a vice to which some of the greatest
                    characters had given way in the early part of their lives, and a vice which
                    carried with it its own punishment, and entailed a curse upon those wΙιo were
                    addicted to it.” He returned to Eton thinking himself a thorough young man of
                    the world; but his dandified airs only excited the ridicule of his comrades, and
                    Dr Barnard, the head master, by flogging him for misconduct, made him feel
                    keenly that he was still a mere schoolboy. More instructive and advantageous
                    than trips to the Continent and visits to Continental gaming houses were the
                    visits which he made to the Houses of Parliament, in company with his father, to
                    hear important debates. He was in the gallery of the House of Commons when Lord
                    North moved “that the paper entitled the <hi rend="italic">North Briton</hi> is
                    a false, scandalous, and seditious libel.” His father impressed upon him that
                    John Wilkes was a bad man, and that the earl of Bute was a sagacious minister;
                    these opinions were embodied by him in some French verses, which injudicious
                    admirers have reproduced to show his want of mastery over the French language,
                    and the absurdity of his boyish political sentiments. Leaving Eton in 1764, Fox
                    went to Oxford, where he entered Hertford College. In a letter to his friend Mr
                    Macartney, he professed a great liking for Oxford and fondness for mathematics,
                    adding, in another letter, that he believed mathematics were useful, and was
                    sure they were entertaining, this being enough, in his opinion, to recommend
                    them. The same letter contained his judgment on a newly published poem, which is
                    far less paradoxical and more creditable to his discernment than the foregoing
                    statement concerning mathematics. The poem was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traveller,</hi> which the youthful critic pronounced, with perfect truth, “to
                    have a good deal of merit.” A trip to Paris and a stay there of two months
                    interrupted Fox’s university career. Dr Newcome, the head of his college,
                    readily sanctioned this holiday, making the complimentary remark that such
                    application as his required “some intermission, and you are the only person with
                    whom I have ever had connexion to whom I could say this. . . . You need not
                    interrupt your amusements by severe studies; for it is wholly unnecessary to
                    make a step onward without you, and therefore we shall stop until we have the
                    pleasure of your company.” This visit to the capital of France was no more
                    serviceable to him, in a moral sense, than his previous one. His father
                    encouraged him to indulge himself without stint in pleasures to which young men
                    are only too prone, and, what is still more blameworthy, jested at the scruples
                    of a son who had no strong liking for vicious courses. On his return to Oxford
                    he worked hard at his studies, spending the greater part of a vacation in
                    systematic reading along with his friend Dickson, who was afterwards bishop of
                    Down. Their leisure was devoted to perusing the works of the early English
                    dramatists, all of which they read. Taking his degree in 1766, he left Oxford
                    and spent the succeeding two years in Continental travel, traversing France and
                    Italy, either in company with his parents, or else with his friends Lord
                    Carlisle, Lord Fitzwilliam, and Mr Uvedale Price. Along with Dlr Price he
                    visited Voltaire at Ferney, where he was heartily welcomed by the great
                    Frenchman for his fathers sake, and was advised to read Voltaire’s published
                    works in order that he might emancipate himself from religious prejudices and
                    increase his stock of ideas. He became a proficient in speaking the French
                    tongue, and he practised himself in writing it by penning poetical epistles in
                    French to his friend Fitzpatrick. He also mastered Italian, which he admired
                    beyond measure, saying that there was “more good poetry in Italian than in all
                    other languages that I understand put together.” He was then passionately fond
                    of amateur acting and of wearing fine clothes. In after days his friends could
                    scarcely credit the assurance of the friends of his youth when the latter stated
                    that Fox, who had become a sloven in dress, was once a “macaroni,” having made a
                    journey from Paris to Lyons in order to buy waistcoats, and was in the habit of
                    walking about with a little French hat on his head and red-heeled shoes on his
                    feet. As difficult was it for some among them to realize that Fox, the leader of
                    the Whigs, and even further advanced in Liberal opinions than the majority of
                    his party, had been such a Tory at the outset of his parliamentary career as to
                    write to George Selwyn in the following terms: “I am reading Clarendon, but
                    scarcely get on faster than you did with your Charles V. I think the style bad,
                    and that he has a great deal of the old woman in his way of thinking, but hate
                    the opposite party so much that it gives one a kind of partiality for him.”
                    Hating the opposite party so thoroughly, it is not surprising that he should
                    have been inimical to the first administration of the marquis of Rockingham, an
                    administration that repealed the Stamp Act which George Grenville hod designed
                    to raise a revenue in the American Colonies, an administration which was far too
                    liberal in tendency and independent in character to suit the narrow and personal
                    view’s of George III., and that he should have written to Sir George Macartney,
                    “every body laughs at its members, holds them cheap, but, according to the
                    fashionable phrase, doing justice to their good <hi rend="italic"
                    >intentions^</hi> In 1768 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> when still under age, Fox
                    was returned for Midhurst, then a pocket borough. His father having made the
                    arrangements necessary for his election had thereby provided a supporter of the
                    ministry of the day which the earl of Chatham had formed, and in which the duke
                    of Grafton was first lord of the treasury. Fox’s maiden speech in the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n527/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0527-0496"/> House of Commons was delivered in defence of the
                    ministry and in opposition to seating John Wilkes as member for Middlesex. He at
                    once made his mark as a parliamentary speaker, recalling to some members the
                    best traits of Charles Townshend and the elder Pitt. His father, delighted at
                    the success achieved by his favourite son, communicated his satisfaction to his
                    acquaintances, and wrote to one of them that he had been told Charles had spoken
                    extremely well :—“It was all off-hand, all argumentative, in reply to Mr Burke
                    and Mr Wedderburn, and excessively well indeed. I hear it spoken of by everybody
                    as a most extraordinary thing, and I am, you see, not a little pleased with it.”
                    Fox had his reward by being appointed a lord of the admiralty immediately after
                    attaining his majority, and when Lord North had succeeded the duke of Grafton as
                    prime minister. Two years afterwards he resigned, on account of a
                    misunderstanding with his chief and a determination to oppose the Royal Marriage
                    Bill, which the ministry introduced out of deference to George III., and about
                    which the king wrote to Lord North :—“I do expect every nerve to be strained to
                    carry the Bill through both Houses with a becoming firmness, for it is not a
                    question that immediately relates to administration, but personally to myself;
                    therefore I have a right to expect a hearty support from every one in my
                    service, and shall remember defaulters.” Fox not only opposed this bill, which
                    was framed to discourage members of the royal family from marrying, and to throw
                    artificial obstacles in their way should they desire to make love matches, but
                    he also introduced a bill to amend Lord Hardwicke’s Act, “For the better
                    preventing of Clandestine Marriages,” which his father had virulently opposed.
                    This conduct, which gave great offence to George III., was the origin of that
                    implacable enmity to his great subject which ever after prevailed in the royal
                    breast, to the detriment alike of the throne and the country. In introducing his
                    bill Fox is said by Horace Walpole to have spoken “with ease, grace, and
                    clearness”; he effectively answered Edmund Burke and Lord North who opposed it,
                    ridiculing the arguments of the former and confuting those of the latter, “with
                    a shrewdness that, from its multiplicity of reasons, as much exceeded his father
                    in embracing all the arguments of his antagonists as he did in his manner and
                    delivery.” This was doubly agreeable to his father, who had formed a clandestine
                    marriage, and who thought such an Act as Lord Hardwicke’s a slur upon himself.
                    The attempt of his son failed, though he had the triumph of beating the ministry
                    by a majority of one on a motion for leave to introduce the bill. After being a
                    year out of office, he became reconciled to Lord North, and re-entered the
                    administration as a junior lord of the treasury. But he soon reasserted his
                    independence, differing from Lord North on a question of procedure, and causing
                    the defeat of the ministry in the House of Commons by pressing an unwelcome
                    motion to a division. The king was incensed at what he styled Charles Fox’s
                    presumption, adding, in a letter to the premier, “Indeed, that young man has so
                    thoroughly cast off every principle of common honour and honesty that he must
                    become as contemptible as he is odious; and I hope you will let him know you are
                    not insensible of his conduct towards you.” Lord North, acting in conformity
                    with the king’s suggestion, wrote as follows to Fox :—“Sir, his Majesty has
                    thought proper to order a new commission of the treasury to be made out, in
                    which I do not see your name.” Thus ended the first stage of Fox’s political
                    career. A year later he avowed in the House of Commons that “the greatest folly
                    of his life was in having supported Lord North.” He was chargeable with follies
                    of another kind. Among the young men of the day he was conspicuous for staking
                    money at play and making bets on horse races. Sometimes he won bets made at
                    Newmarket, but he almost invariably lost larger sums in a gaming club at
                    Almack’s, where the stakes were £50, and where as much as £10,000 was on the
                    table at a time. Lord Holland advanced £40,000 to pay his debts, but this did
                    not suffice, and he became the dupe of a Mrs Grieve, who, on the pretext of
                    introducing him to a Miss Phipps, a West Indian heiress, obtained money from
                    him. His reputation stood so low in public estimation that, according to Horace
                    Walpole, it was commonly supposed he had been dismissed by Lord North for
                    robbing the treasury. In 1774 Fox began that opposition to the ill-advised and
                    ill-fated measures of Lord North which gave him a place among the greatest of
                    orators and the most prescient of statesmen. He lost both his parents in that
                    year, and his brother Stephen, second Lord Holland, soon followed them to the
                    grave, leaving behind him the boy whom Fox treated with almost paternal fondness
                    and care, whose memory as third Lord Holland is held in kindly remembrance, and
                    who, with characteristic modesty, considered it his chief glory to have been the
                    nephew of Fox and friend of Grey. Soon after Fox entered the ranks of the
                    Opposition he became its acknowledged chief. This rapid advancement was largely
                    due to the lessons in practical politics taught him by Edmund Burke, whose
                    acquaintance he had made in early life. The story of his career from 1774, when
                    he left Lord North's administration, to 1782, when Lord North resigned and when
                    he became secretary of state in the second Rockingham administration, is
                    associated with the unsparing and brilliant opposition of the Whig party to the
                    war which ended with the ratification of the independence of the Thirteen United
                    Colonies of America. An important episode during that period was his election as
                    member for the city of Westminster. On the 2d of February 1780, a meeting in
                    favour of parliamentary reform was held, in Westminster Hall, at which such
                    leading members of the Whig party were present as the duke of Portland, Earl
                    Temple, John Wilkes, General Burgoyne, Aiderman Sawbridge, Edmund Burke, and
                    over which* Fox presided. He delivered a stirring speech in favour of a redress
                    of grievances, and in particular of a reform in the representation of the
                    people. After it had been resolved that a petition to that effect should be
                    presented to parliament, it was proposed and carried by acclamation that Fox,
                    “the Man of the People,” should become a candidate to represent Westminster in
                    the House of Commons, and before the year closed he was a member for the
                    constituency which he represented till the end of his life. A little more than a
                    century had then elapsed since Sir Stephen Fox, his grandfather, had been first
                    returned for the city of Westminster. George III. encouraged the opposition to
                    the election of the “Man of the People,” of whom he wrote that “Fox never had
                    any principle, and can therefore act as his interest may guide him.” Eight
                    thousand pounds were contributed out of the civil list to promote the success of
                    Lord Lincoln, the favourite of the court, yet neither corrupt expenditure nor
                    royal disapproval sufficed to hinder the triumph of Fox. As secretary of state
                    in the ministry of the Marquis of Rockingham, and leader of the House of
                    Commons, Fox displayed great business aptitude and capacity for conciliation. A
                    short time before he became minister, Horace Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann
                    :—“Mr Fox is the first figure in all the places I have mentioned,—the hero in
                    parliament, at the gaming-table, at Newmarket.” After he became minister, the
                    same writer informed his correspondent— “Mr Fox already shines as greatly in
                    place as he did in opposition, though infinitely more difficult a task. He is
                    now as indefatigable as he was idle. He has perfect temper, and not only good
                    humour but good nature, and, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0528-0497"/> which is the first quality of a prime minister in
                    a free country, has more common sense than any man, with amazing parts that are
                    neither ostentatious nor affected” His experience of high office was very short
                    Lord Rockingham became premier on the 27th of March 1782; he died on the first
                    of the following July, aud Fox resigned immediately afterwards. He had finally
                    resolved to do so before the death of his chief, having been outvoted in the
                    cabinet on the question of unconditionally acknowledging the independence of the
                    United Colonies. His brother secretary of state, the earl of Shelburne, and
                    other colleagues thought that the concession of independence should be made one
                    of the conditions of peace. Fox regarded Shelburne with undisguised aversion.
                    When the administration was formed, he fancied that Shelburne was disposed to
                    imitate Lord North and to pay undue deference to George III., and he told him
                    that it appeared “the administration was to consist of two parts, one belonging
                    to the king, the other to the public.” Four weeks after being in office Fox
                    wrote to his friend Fitzpatrick :—“Shelburne shows himself more and more every
                    day, is ridiculously jealous of my encroaching on his department, and wishes
                    very much to encroach upon mine.” Shelburne, in turn, suspected Fox of designs
                    to monopolize power, and to have his own way in all things. This unfortunate
                    antagonism between two men of remarkable ability caused a split in the Whig
                    party, and enabled the king to succeed in his policy of entrusting power only to
                    ministers who were subservient to his will. Succeeding Lord Rockingham as
                    premier, Shelburne held office til) the 24th February 1783. The coalition
                    ministry, in which the duke of Portland was premier, and Lord North and Fox were
                    secretaries of state, took the place of that over which Shelburne', ∣had
                    presided. It was with extreme and undisguised reluctance that the king permitted
                    this administration to be formed. When he found it hopeless to struggle against
                    the inevitable result, he communicated his real feelings on the subject to those
                    politicians who prided themselves upon being his friends. In conversation with
                    Mr Wyndham Grenville, he poured out his indignation “upon Fox, whom he loaded
                    with every expression of abhorrence; upon the duke of Portland, against whom he
                    was little less violent; upon Lord North, to whose conduct he imputed all the
                    disasters of the country; upon American independence, which seemed to have been
                    a most bitter pill indeed.” His early detestation of Fox had now been
                    intensified, owing to the unnatural behaviour of his eldest son, which he
                    erroneously attributed to the teaching of the great Whig statesman. The king
                    even consulted Lord Chancellor Thurlow and Lord Ashburton as to “what redress he
                    could have against a man who alienated from him the affections of his son,” and
                    it is said that Thurlow told him “he would have no peace till his son and Fox
                    were secured in the Tower.” One of the first acts of the coalition was to
                    arrange about the establishment and income of the Prince of Wales. The king was
                    shocked at the proposition which the ministry laid before him, considering the
                    sum which had been agreed upon as a fitting one for the prince to receive
                    utterly extravagant; and he alleged that his advisers were ready to sacrifice
                    the public interests to gratify au “ill-advised young man.” In consequence of
                    the king’s disapproval of the scheme, his eldest son had to content himself with
                    an allowance which was wholly inadequate; hence he had to make repeated
                    applications to parliament to pay his debts. While the coalition ministry held
                    office the definitive treaties of peace were signed between Great Britain and
                    France, Spain, and the United States of America, and thus the war which a
                    ministry after George III.’s own heart had provoked and carried on with amazing
                    incompetence ceased to impoverish and humiliate the nation. But the chief act of
                    the administration and the cause of its downfall was the introduction of a bill
                    for the just and efficient government of British India. Though Burke had the
                    principal share in planning the measure, yet Fox, having made himself thoroughly
                    master of the questions at issue, expounded the scheme iu the House of Commons
                    with great lucidity and impressiveness. The opposition to it was vehement and
                    disingenuous; the measure was falsely described as having been solely designed
                    in order to confiscate the property of the East India Company and establish the
                    supremacy of the Whig party. William Pitt, who was then unsparing and unfair in
                    his criticism, afterwards did practical justice to the wisdom of Fox and his
                    colleagues by bringing a measure into parliament resembling that of the
                    coalition ministry in many essential particulars. Fox’s prediction was thus
                    verified, for the day arrived when his statesmanlike and much maligned bill was
                    “regarded in its true light as a strong, but as a necessary and a just measure.”
                    But the king had determined that the bill which Fox had safely piloted through
                    the House of Commons should never pass into law; several persons calling
                    themselves his friends aided him in accomplishing his object, and the ministry,
                    after being defeated by a small majority in the House of Lords, was summarily
                    and contemptuously dismissed. Twenty-two years elapsed before Fox returned to
                    office.</p>
                <p>During three months after his dismissal, Fox endeavoured to counteract the power
                    of the sovereign to dissolve parliament; but he was baffled by the boldness and
                    patience of William Pitt, the young prime minister. Then followed a more trying
                    discomfiture when the country pronounced in favour of his rival at the general
                    election of 1784. Even the Nonconformists, who had no warmer advocate than Fox,
                    and whose only hope for the redress of intolerable grievances consisted in the
                    Whig party being in office, turned against their true friends, rallying to the
                    shout of “Pitt aud the constitution,” instead of aiding by voice and vote the
                    cause of “Fox and free government.” They deserted him at a critical juncture.
                    Nevertheless he continued to plead for them with his whole heart and soul, and
                    merely remarked, “on recollection of what had been their conduct upon that
                    occasion [the coalition], the House would at least do him the justice to say
                    that, in supporting them that day, he was not influenced by any very obvious
                    motives of private partiality or attachment. Yet he was determined to let them
                    know that, though they could upon some occasions lose sight of their principles
                    of liberty, he would not upon any occasion lose sight of his principles of
                    toleration." It was not enough for the king and the young and haughty premier
                    that the Whig party should be defeated in the country; they were resolved to
                    exclude Fox from parliament, and in any case to prevent his re-election for
                    Westminster. Admiral Lord Hood, Sir Cecil Wray, and Fox were the candidates for
                    the two seats. The court and the ministry were bent upon the first two being
                    chosen. What the king styled “gold pills” were lavished on the occasion.
                    Moreover, 280 of the Guards were sent to vote as householders, a thing which
                    Horace Walpole said his father “in the most quiet season would not have dared to
                    do.” The character of the struggle recalled an envenomed contest 89 years
                    previously, when the Jacobites strove with all their might to hinder the
                    re-election of Sir Stephen Fox, a declared supporter of the Revolution
                    settlement. In 1784, as in 1695, the party of freedom and constitutional
                    government carried the day in Westminster, and Fox was returned by a majority of
                    236. But the partisans of divine right in 1695 never dreamed of retrieving their
                    defeat in the manner which found favour in the eyes of George III. and his
                    advisers in 1784. A scrutiny was demanded, in order that Fox might not take his
                    seat. Happily, this pettifogging manoeuvre was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n529/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0529-0498"/> thwarted by the action of attached friends, who
                    procured his election for the Kirkwall burghs. The validity of this election was
                    challenged, but without result, and Fox was able to make that impassioned and
                    masterly protest in the House of Commons against the shameful treatment to which
                    he had been subjected, which is known as his speech on the Westminster scrutiny,
                    and which ranks among the best speeches ever delivered in parliament. The
                    scrutiny went on for a year, till even Pitt’s docile majority resented the
                    further continuance of the unconstitutional farce, and voted that it should end.
                    In consequence of this Fox took his seat as member for Westminster, brought an
                    action against the high bailiff, who had conducted himself in the affair as a
                    tool of the ministry, and recovered £2000 damages, which he distributed among
                    the Westminster charities. The remainder of Fox’s parliamentary career is more
                    remarkable for eloquent speeches than for stirring personal incident. His
                    criticism of Pitt’s measures was always shrewd and vigorous, though not
                    invariably just. He blundered most seriously in denouncing the commercial treaty
                    with France, a scheme of far-seeing policy and admirable patriotism. When this
                    subject was debated he gave utterance to a phrase which, like the utterances of
                    many other notable men, has been repeated to his discredit by persons who,
                    purposely or inadvertently, dissociate it from the context, and withhold the
                    qualifying clauses. Having said that “France was the natural political enemy of
                    Great Britain,” he was reproached for calling the French the natural enemies of
                    the English. What he meant to convey was, not that enmity necessarily existed
                    between the English and the French, but that the policy of France, as directed
                    by the house of Bourbon, was irreconcilably opposed to the interests of
                    England,—a proposition which was really incontrovertible. His liking for the
                    French people was extreme, and this was openly displayed so soon as they had
                    emancipated themselves from a rule which they detested, and which rendered them
                    the disturbers of the world. Then he avowed his conviction that the new form of
                    government in France “would render her a better neighbour, and less disposed to
                    hostility, than when she was subject to the cabal and intrigues of ambitious and
                    interested state men.” Again, it is forgotten or concealed by those persons who
                    have censured Fox on account of his objection to this treaty, “that he earnestly
                    recommended, instead of the present treaty, a more intimate connexion with the
                    United States of America, such an intercourse for Britain that could be devised,
                    and was entirely consistent with her true political interests, and such an
                    intercourse he had the best reasons for believing America was both willing and
                    eager to enter into upon fair and equitable terms.” Indeed, Washington was
                    anxious to conclude a commercial treaty with Great Britain, but Pitt
                    discountenanced the notion. It was wise in Fox to urge this as most desirable,
                    yet he would have shown still greater wisdom in aiding to the utmost the project
                    for increasing commercial intercourse with France also. On other questions he
                    displayed genuine liberality of sentiment and the highest statesmanship. He
                    declared emphatically against the slave trade at a time when Pitt took credit
                    for delivering no opinion in favour or in disapproval of the traffic in negroes.
                    He repeatedly moved for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, and he
                    advocated a thorough-going scheme of parliamentary reform. He was one of the
                    managers when Warren Hastings was impeached by the Commons of England of high
                    crimes and misdemeanours; he had mastered the subject, spoke on it in a more
                    businesslike, though less rhetorical and sensational style than Burke and
                    Sheridan, while his judgment was accepted as conclusive when his brother
                    managers differed in opinion. His health being impaired, he went to the
                    Continent in 1788 for relaxation and change, revisiting Switzerland and Italy.
                    He spent a short time with Gibbon at Lausanne. The luminous historian has
                    chronicled the pleasure which he reaped from this visit of the illustrious
                    statesman; how they conversed without ceasing from morning to night, adding, “we
                    had little politics; though Fox gave me in a few words such a character of Pitt
                    as one great man should give of another his rival; much of books, from my own,
                    on which he flattered me very pleasantly, to Homer and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arabian Nights·,</hi> much about the country, my garden (which he understands
                    far better than I do); and upon the whole I think he envies me, and would do so
                    were he a minister.” At Bologna, in November 1788, he received an urgent summons
                    to return home, owing to the meeting of parliament on the 20th of that month
                    having been rendered necessary on account of the king’s sudden and serious
                    illness. While journeying to England he heard a report that George III. was
                    dead, being the truth that the monarch had been suddenly bereft of his reason.
                    Travelling with all the speed possible in those days, Pox arrived in London on
                    the ninth day after leaving Bologna. He had gone abroad for his health; the
                    journey back nearly killed him. Wraxall says that Fox’s appearance when he
                    entered the House of Commons on the 4th of December, “excited a great and
                    general sensation. I never saw him, either previously or subsequently, exhibit
                    so broken and shattered an aspect. His body seemed to be emaciated, his
                    countenance sallow and sickly, his eyes swollen; while his stockings hung upon
                    his legs, and he rather dragged himself along, than walked up the floor to take
                    his seat.” Both Pitt and he made mistakes during the debates on the regency,
                    both thinking less of what was best to be done in the circumstances than about
                    the most suitable course to pursue for the purpose of securing the supremacy of
                    their respective parties. Pitt dreaded the loss of office should the Prince of
                    Wales become regent, with full power to conduct the government; Fox was
                    confident that, if the prince exercised the royal prerogatives, a Whig
                    administration would be constituted. The unexpected recovery of the king put an
                    end alike to hopes of promotion and fears of dismissal; but the record of
                    blunders which cannot be excused, and of aspirations which were wanting in
                    patriotism, remained to sully the fame of Tory and Whig leaders. The divergence
                    of opinion between the Whig and Tory parties, and among the members of the Whig
                    party, grew wider and more deplorable when the French Revolution agitated Europe
                    and terrified many Englishmen. An outcry was raised against French principles,
                    and against those persons who held that the surest way to avert danger to
                    England was to remove all reasonable grounds for popular dissatisfaction. The
                    mob of Birmingham, frenzied with panic and overflowing in loyalty, pillaged the
                    houses of Dr Priestley and other Nonconformists, in order to testify attachment
                    to “church and king,” a cry which Dr Parr characterized as the toast of
                    Jacobites and the yell of incendiaries, meaning, “a church without the gospel,
                    and a king above the laws.” Handbills circulated in the neighbourhood where Fox
                    dwelt contained the threat, “Destruction to Fox and his Jacobite crew.” He
                    expressed in the House of Commons his foreboding that his own dwelling might be
                    dealt with in the same way as Dr Priestley’s, yet he persevered in upholding
                    freedom of speech and of the press when the ministry carried the Traitorous
                    Correspondence Act, the Seditious Practices Act, and the suspension of the
                    Habeas Corpus Act. He too suffered for his attachment to liberal principles. For
                    proposing as a toast at the Whig club, “the sovereignty of the people of Great
                    Britain,” his name was expunged by the king from the list of privy councillors,
                    at <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n530/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0530-0499"/> the special suggestion of Pitt. The duke of
                    Norfolk had previously been subjected to the like indignity for having proposed
                    on Fox’s birthday the toast :—“Our sovereign’s health; the majesty of the
                    people.” Finding it hopeless to struggle against the ministerial majority, which
                    had been swelled by defections from the ranks of his own party and friends, he
                    discontinued attending parliament in 1797, and spent his time at St Anne’s Hill
                    in literary study and in writing a history of England from the reign of James
                    II. The debts which had long embarrassed him were discharged by private friends
                    in 1793, who settled an annuity of £3000 upon him. From that date he never
                    touched a card. In 1795 he married Mrs Armitstead, a lady with whom he had lived
                    for some time. During this period he watched over the training of his nephew,
                    the third Lord Holland, and prepared him for playing a useful part on the
                    political stage. Immediately after the peace of Amiens he visited Paris, chiefly
                    in order to examine the archives in the French foreign office for historical
                    purposes. He visited Lafayette, and was cordially welcomed by the republican
                    patriot, planting, in remembrance of his visit, the ivy which now mantles the
                    turrets of the gateway at Lagrange. In common with other distinguished visitors
                    to Paris, he was presented to Bonaparte. The war recommencing soon after his
                    return home, he resumed his advocacy of peace; indeed, as the poet has truly
                    said of this stage in his career, “peace, when he spoke, was ever on his
                    tongue.” Another feature of it was a complete understanding with the marquis of
                    Lansdowne, formerly earl of Shelburne, on questions of foreign policy, the two
                    acting in concert when any such matter was under debate in either House of
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>Pitt died in January 1806. The ministry of “All the Talents” was then formed,
                    with Lord Grenville as first lord of the Treasury and Fox as secretary of state,
                    despite the aversion and resistance of George III. Though loving peace as much
                    as ever, he was yet ready to resist the inordinate pretensions of Bonaparte, and
                    he declared war against Prussia when that power, acting as the vassal of the
                    French conqueror and at his suggestion, annexed Hanover. Fox’s last appearance
                    in the House of Commons was on the 10th of June 1806. Feeble in health, he
                    appeared there at the risk of his life; but he could not forbear making a
                    special effort in order to move resolutions preparatory to introducing a bill
                    for the suppression of the slave trade. The resolutions were carried by large
                    majorities in both Houses. The bill giving effect to them became law the
                    following year. In this, his farewell speech, he said, “So fully am I impressed
                    with the vast importance and necessity of attaining what will be the object of
                    my motion this night, that if, during the almost forty years that I have had the
                    honour of a seat in parliament, I had been so fortunate as to accomplish that,
                    and that only, I should think I had done enough, and could retire from public
                    life with comfort, and the conscious satisfaction that I had done my duty.” On
                    the 13th of the following September, he died, at the age of fifty-eight, of a
                    schirrous affection of the liver. The room in which he drew his last breath is
                    in the duke of Devonshire’s villa at Chiswick, and is the one wherein, at a
                    later day, Canning died also. By Fox’s death the country lost a statesman who,
                    despite his failings, is one of the finest and most fascinating figures in
                    modern history,—a man who, in the phrase which Burke uttered six years after the
                    friendship between them had ended, was “a man made to be loved,” and of whom
                    even George IIT., his single open and bitter enemy, said to Lord Sidmouth,
                    “little did I think that I should ever live to regret Mr Fox’s death,” and to
                    his daughter Princess Mary, “I never thought I should have regretted the death
                    of Mr Fox as much as I do.” Lamented by an unappreciative sovereign and by all
                    discerning men, the mortal remains of the incomparable Whig statesman were
                    carried in public funeral to Westminster Abbey, and laid alongside those of bis
                    brilliant and triumphant rival William Pitt.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to determine the exact place which Fox would have held among
                    English statesmen, if he had been allowed a suitable opportunity for the
                    exercise and display of his talents. His name is associated with one great
                    measure of practical legislation, the Act for amending the law of libel. Peace
                    with the United States, the better government of India, the abolition of the
                    slave trade, were some grand results of his untiring efforts and commanding
                    advocacy. Scarcely any of the measures of reform carried into effect after his
                    death had not been sanctioned and supported by him. Yet he performed but a small
                    part of what he desired to accomplish. His fate had a close similarity to that
                    of the earl of Shelburne, for whom, till a late period in his career, he felt a
                    repugnance which was none the less unfortunate because it was reciprocated. Lord
                    Shelburne, in common with Fox, was far in advance of his age. He neither dreaded
                    the people nor overestimated their capacity. But he never had the chance of
                    giving full effect to his convictions, and his best traits remained in obscurity
                    till a descendant, with ample knowledge and admirable taste, has made them clear
                    to the public of our day. Like Shelburne, the Whig commoner has been the victim
                    of popular misunderstanding. His addiction to pleasure was considered by many
                    contemporaries to be a fatal blot on his character. They argued in his case as
                    Junius did in that of the duke of Grafton, who was denounced as an incompetent
                    statesman because he appeared in public with Nancy Parsons, and was supposed to
                    prefer the attractions of Newmarket to the sober business of cabinet councils.
                    That the duke of Grafton was a man of exceptional capacity is now indisputable.
                    Notwithstanding his liking for gaming and horse-racing, Fox was a thorough man
                    of business, and a statesman for whom no work was too severe and no problem too
                    difficult. The obstacles which Fox could not overcome, and which proved equal
                    stumbling-blocks in Shelburne’s path, were the dislike and distrust of George
                    III. Yet, intensely as the king detested what he considered the Jesuitism of
                    Shelburne, his feeling of antipathy to Fox was still more extreme and
                    indefensible. This was due to aversion to his father, to the independence
                    displayed by Fox when a member of Lord North’s administration, and to the
                    supposition that the undutiful behaviour of his worthless eldest son was the
                    result of Fox’s direct influence and prompting. Charles Butler notes in his
                    interesting miscellanies—“Cardinal de Retz said to a person who taunted him with
                    the superiority of Cardinal Mazarin, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Give me the
                    king but for one day, and you’ll see who has the real superiority.’ Mr Fox never
                    had the king with him, even for one hour.” When he was secretary of state in the
                    coalition ministry, the king in his demeanour to him was “civil, but no more.”
                    The reason of this is obvious to all those persons who have studied George
                    III.’s character. Not deficient in shrewdness, and abounding in the cunning
                    which is the characteristic of men conscious and ashamed of their weakness of
                    intellect, that monarch liked to have advisers who were not too strongly in
                    contrast to himself, or else who would veil their capacity in their intercourse
                    with him. A mere simpleton was as distasteful to him as a towering genius. Pitt,
                    who liked to surround himself with dummies, had chosen Lord Hawkesbury to
                    conduct foreign affairs. His incompetency being too conspicuous, the king told
                    George Rose with gusto that, though the foreign ministers differed on many
                    points, they were unanimous in their contempt and dislike for Lord Hawkesbury,
                    and that “his lordship always ap <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n531/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0531-0500"/> proached him with a vacant grin, and had hardly
                    ever any thing business-like to say to him.” In the presence of men of strong
                    individuality and of great intellect, such as Chatham, Shelburne, and Fox, the
                    king felt ill at ease, being conscious that his nominal servants were his real
                    superiors. William Pitt pleased him, because Pitt, though a man of supreme
                    talent and haughty to his equals and inferiors, was supple in the presence of
                    his sovereign, and ready to defer to the sovereign’s desires, to flatter his
                    prejudices. Instead of impressing him with the opinion of the public on a given
                    question, he professed anxiety to learn what his own view was in order to give
                    effect to it. Once only did Pitt insist upon having his own way; failing, he
                    resigned. But he returned to power on the clear understanding that he would not
                    press the measure of justice to the Roman Catholics which he previously held to
                    be necessary, and to which the king was sternly opposed. If George III. had
                    deemed it possible that Fox would have been as submissive and considerate as
                    Pitt, he would never have told George Rose that “he had taken a positive
                    determination not to admit Mr Fox into his councils, even at the hazard of a
                    civil war,” nor would he have written to Addington that “Mr Fox is excluded by
                    the express command of the king to Mr Pitt.” The wonder is that, despite the
                    hindrances which were thrown in Fox’s path, and the slight occasion which he had
                    of proving in office how well fitted he was to discharge the most onerous tasks,
                    he should yet have proved that no statesman of his age was better qualified for
                    conducting the government of England. What Gibbon said of him during the war
                    with the American colonies is applicable to his entire political career; he
                    exhibited in the conduct of a party capacity for governing an empire.</p>
                <p>It is unquestionable that, as a parliamentary orator, Fox has no superiors. Yet,
                    notwithstanding many volumes contain his speeches, there is an insuperable
                    difficulty in setting forth the secret of his oratorical greatness. One speech
                    only is there printed as it was delivered, the single speech which he wrote out
                    beforehand, being a eulogium on the deceased duke of Bedford. Another, that on
                    the Westminster scrutiny, is said to have been reported with the accuracy which
                    is now the rule. The records of Warren Hastings’s trial comprise verbatim
                    reports of the speeches which he delivered before the House of Lords. But no
                    such evidence suffices to explain the extraordinary effects which his spoken
                    words produced; hence, it is necessary to rely upon the testimony of
                    contemporaries, and to accept their decision as conclusive. Pitt styled him a
                    magician who laid a spell upon his hearers so long as words issued from his
                    lips. A noble lord, thinking to curry favour with the premier, abused one of
                    Fox’s speeches, and received the generous reply from Pitt: “Don’t disparage it;
                    nobody could have made it but himself.” Rogers has recorded that never did he
                    “hear anything equal to Fox’s <hi rend="italic">speeches in reply;</hi> they
                    were wonderful. Burke did not do himself justice as a speaker; his manner was
                    hurried, and he always seemed to be in a passion. Pitt’s voice sounded as if he
                    had worsted in his mouth.” Charles Butler said that Fox had a captivating
                    earnestness of tone and manner; “the moment of his grandeur was when, after he
                    had stated the argument of his adversary, with much greater strength than his
                    adversary had done, and with much greater than his hearers thought possible, he
                    seized it with the strength of a giant, and tore and trampled it to
                    destruction.” Sir James Mackintosh records that Fox “certainly possessed, above
                    all moderns, that unison of reason, simplicity, and vehemence which formed the
                    prince of orators.” Burke pronounced him “the most brilliant and accomplished
                    debater that the world ever saw.” A man may be accomplished in statecraft and
                    unrivalled in oratory, and yet may want the charm which renders him as worthy of
                    love as of admiration. Few rnen whose statesmanship is indisputable, and whose
                    pre-eminence as orators is acknowledged, have surpassed Fox in the graces which
                    soften life and attract affection. His friends regarded him with idolatry. At
                    the time of the French Revolution, when his party had become a fragment, Lord
                    Thurlow said, “there are but forty of them, but there is not one of them who is
                    not ready to be hanged for Fox.” Lord Sidmouth, an uncompromising Tory, could
                    not resist the fascination of his nature, and wrote, after knowing him
                    personally, “I never knew a man of more apparent sincerity, more free from
                    rancour, or even severity, and hardly any one so entirely devoid of
                    affectation.” Gibbon, another political opponent, admired in him “the powers of
                    a superior man, as they are blended in his attractive character, with the
                    softness and simplicity of a child. Perhaps no human being was over more
                    perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood.” It is
                    unnecessary to supplement these testimonies with the eulogies of enthusiastic
                    friends. Nor can there be any excess of partiality for him in the decision that
                    Charles James Fox stands conspicuous among the English statemen whose virtues
                    ought to be kept in loving and perpetual remembrance, (w. F. R.)</p>
