                <p><label type="entry">FAMILY</label>. Family is a word of which the etymology but
                    partially illustrates the meaning. The Roman <hi rend="italic">familia,</hi>
                    derived from the Oscan <hi rend="italic">famel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(servus),</hi> originally signified the servile property, the thralls, of a
                    master. Next, the term denoted other domestic property, in things as well as in
                    persons. Thus, in the fifth of the laws of the Twelve Tables the rules are laid
                    down :—si. <hi rend="smallcaps">intestato, moritur.</hi> çur. SUUS. HERES. NEC.
                    SIT. ADGNATUS. PROXIMUS. FAMILIAM. HABETO, and SI. AGNATUS. NEC. ESCIT.
                    GENTILIS. FAMILIAM. <hi rend="smallcaps">nancitor;</hi> that is, if a man die
                    intestate, leaving no natural heir, who had been under his <hi rend="italic"
                    >potestas,</hi> the nearest agnate, or relative tracing his connexion with the
                    deceased exclusively through males, is to inherit the <hi rend="italic"
                    >familia,</hi> or family fortune of every sort. Failing an agnate, a member of
                    the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> of the dead man is to inherit. In a third sense,
                    the Roman word <hi rend="italic">familia</hi> was applied to all the persons who
                    could prove themselves to be descended from the same ancestor, and thus the word
                    almost corresponded to our own use of it in the widest meaning, as when we say
                    that a person is “of a good family” (Ulpian, <hi rend="italic">Dig.,</hi> 50,
                    16, 195, <hi rend="italic">fcf).</hi> Leaving for a while the Roman terms, to
                    which it will be necessary to return, we may provisionally define “family,” in
                    the modem sense, as the small community formed by the union of one man with one
                    woman, and by the increase of children born to them. These in modem times, and
                    in most European countries, constitute the household, and it has been almost
                    universally supposed that little natural associations of this sort are the
                    germ-cell of early society. The history with which, from childhood, we are best
                    acquainted shows us the growth of the Jewish nation from the one household of
                    Abraham. It is true that his patriarchal family differed from the modern family
                    in one respect. It was polygamous, but, as female chastity was one of the
                    conditions of the patriarchal family, and as descent through males was therefore
                    recognized as certain, the plurality of wives makes no real difference to the
                    argument. In the same way the earliest formal records of Indian, Greek, and
                    Roman society show us the family firmly established, and generally regarded as
                    the most primitive of human associations. Thus, Aristotle derives <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0027-0018"/> the first household (οικία <hi rend="italic"
                    >πρώτη)</hi> from the combination of man’s possession of property—in the slave
                    or in domesticated animals—with man’s relation to woman, and ^he quotes Hesiod:
                    <hi rend="italic">oiικov p·ev</hi><hi rend="italic">πρώτιστα γυναίκα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τe</hi><hi rend="italic">βουν</hi> τ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >αροτηρα</hi><hi rend="italic">(Politics,</hi> 1, 2, 5). The village, again,
                    with him is a colony or offshoot of the household, and monarchical government in
                    states is derived from the monarchy of the eldest male member of the family.
                    Now, though certain ancient terms, introduced by Aristotle in the chapters to
                    which we refer, might have led him to imagine, as we shall see, a very different
                    origin of society, his theory is, on the face of it, natural and plausible, and
                    it has been almost universally accepted. The beginning of society, it has been
                    said a thousand times, is the family, a natural association of kindred by blood,
                    composed of father, mother, and their descendants. In this family, the father is
                    absolute master of his wife, his children, and the goods of the little
                    community; at his death, his eldest son succeeds him; and in course of time this
                    association of kindred, by natural increase and by adoption, develops into the
                    clan, <hi rend="italic">yens,</hi> or γ⅛os. As generations multiply, the more
                    distant relations split off into other clans, and these clans, which have not
                    lost the sense of primitive kinship, unite once more into tribes. The tribes
                    again, as civilization advances, acknowledge themselves to be subjects of a
                    king, in whose veins the blood of the original family runs purest. This, or
                    something like this, is the common theory of the growth of society.</p>
                <p>On the other side, the following facts are to be noticed :— (1) In many barbarous
                    communities the family, in our sense of the word, does not exist. (2) The
                    traditions of civilized races report a similar state of things in their early
                    experience. (3) The domestic institutions of savages, and traces of the same
                    manners among cultivated races, point to an age when the family was not
                    constituted in the modern way. (4) The larger tribal associations of savages
                    were clearly not developed out of the monogamous or patriarchal family. (5) The
                    larger tribal associations of Greece, Rome, and India bear marks of having been
                    evolved out of the tribal associations of savages. If these points can be
                    proved, the family is not the earliest, but one of the latest conquests of
                    civilization. We shall consider these points in order.</p>
                <p>1. At whatever epoch civilized travellers have visited peoples of less
                    cultivation, they have noted, with unconcealed surprise, not the family, but
                    promiscuity and polyandry. They have found men and women living together in what
                    seemed unregulated community, or they have found that the woman had several
                    husbands, and often that these husbands were brothers. They have alleged that
                    the woman, not the man, was really head of the household, that kinship was
                    traced through the female line, on account of the certainty of that sort of
                    genealogy, and consequently that a man’s children belonged, not to his own
                    family, but to that of the wife, in whose affections he had only a limited or
                    transitory share. It may be presumed, with some confidence, that these customs,
                    observed in lands and ages widely apart, cannot have grown out of the monogamous
                    or patriarchal family as we know it. The limitless area in which such practices
                    have been usual may be gathered from a few examples. Thus Herodotus says of the
                    Agathyrsi, a Scythian people (iv. 104): “They have their women in common, that
                    they may all be brothers of each other.” The Nasamones (iv. 172) have similar
                    customs; of the Massagetae (i. 216) it is said that each marries a wife, <hi
                    rend="italic">τaυτr</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">σι</hi> δe <hi
                    rend="italic">ίπίκοινα χρόωνται.</hi> Aristotle alludes to similar promiscuity
                    among the Libyans <hi rend="italic">(Pol.,</hi> ii. 3, 9); they have their women
                    in common, and distribute the children by their likeness to the men. Diodorus
                    Siculus reports the same manners among the Troglodytes and the Ichthyophagi on
                    the coast of the Red Sea. The Auseis by the Libyan lake Tritonis, though they
                    seem to have set store on the chastity of unmarried women, are said by Herodotus
                    to have lived like cattle, with no permanent cohabitation (iv. 180). These are
                    examples of reported promiscuity in ancient times. Though the observers may have
                    overlooked, and probably did overlook, some regulations, yet it is plain that in
                    the societies spoken of the monogamous or patriarchal family cannot have
                    existed, and so cannot have been the germ of such wider tribal associations as
                    were then established. Turning to modern savages, we find the custom of lending
                    wives, as an act of friendliness and hospitality, very common. This may be no
                    more than mere profligacy, in a society where male kin is recognized; but the
                    marriage custom of Thibet, which assigns to a woman several brothers as joint
                    husbands, cannot be thus explained. This amazing practice is the rule of life
                    “among thirty millions of respectable people” (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Abode
                    of Snow).</hi> As to the area over which some form of polyandry extends, the
                    reader may consult Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Lennan ’ s <hi
                    rend="italic">Primitive Marriage</hi> (Edinburgh, 1865, p. 178, 183), where it
                    is traced “to points half round the globe.” Caesar describes something like it
                    among the inhabitants of Britain <hi rend="italic">(De Bello</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gallico,</hi> lib. V. c. 14): “Ten or twelve men have wives in
                    common, and chiefly brothers share with brothers, and father with children.”
                    According to a fragment of Polybius, the same fraternal arrangement was not
                    unknown among the Spartans.</p>
                <p>Among the Nairs of Malabar, a woman has several husbands, but these are not
                    brothers <hi rend="italic">(Asiatic Researches,</hi> vol. V. p. 13; Hamilton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Account of East Indies,</hi> vol. i. p. 308; Buchanan’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey,</hi> vol. ii. p. 411). Among the Nairs the woman lives
                    with her mother or brothers, or in other cases has a house of her own, where she
                    receives her husbands. “No Nair knows his father, and every man looks upon his
                    sister’s children as his heirs” (Buchanan, ii. 412). Some other examples of very
                    loose relations between the sexes will be found in Mr Herbert Spencer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Princi]Jes of Sociology,</hi> vol. i. chap. 5, 6. But, to be
                    brief, we strike on instances as soon as we look below the surface of
                    civilization. Thus, in the Marquesas Islands, Mr Melville <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Narrative of a Four Months' Residence,</hi> 1846, p. 212) describes polyandry,
                    and asks, with some naïveté, “Where else could such a practice exist even for a
                    single day?” He would have found the practice among the Tsonnotouan Iroquois.
                    “La polygamie qui n’est pas permise aux hommes, l’est pourtant aux femmes”
                    (Lafitau, <hi rend="italic">Moeurs des Sauvages Américains,</hi> vol. i. p. 555,
                    1726). If we are to maintain, as it was usual to declare, that “it is difficult
                    to say of what races of men it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> allowable to lay
                    down that the society in which they are united was originally organized on the
                    patriarchal model,” we must believe that some strange necessity, or some
                    monstrous profligacy destroyed the patriarchal model among the people whose
                    manners we have been studying.</p>
                <p>2. If we can trust the traditions of Indo-European and other polite peoples, they
                    too once lived in a stage which can hardly be discerned from promiscuity, and
                    they too allotted many husbands to one wife. Beginning with Greece, we find the
                    legend in Suidas (p. 3102), that the women of Attica abandoned themselves to
                    unchecked vice, and that the male parentage of children could not be
                    ascertained. According to the story of Varro (Augustine, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Civ. Dei,</hi> 1. xviii. c. 9), it was Cecrops, the serpent-king, who first
                    instituted marriage, just as the Australian natives credit the lizard with the
                    discovery. The Hindoos give it to Svetaketu, before whose date “women were
                    unconfined, and roamed at their pleasure This ancient custom is even now the
                    rule for creatures born as brutes and it is still practised among the northern
                    Kurus” (Muir, <hi rend="italic">Sanskrit Texts,</hi> part ii. p. 336). The
                    Egyptians attributed the origin of marriage to the rule of Menes; the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n28/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0028-0019"/> Chinese, to Fohi. As to polyandry, among Aryans
                    of India, a famous passage in the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> tells how
                    the five brothers Pandava “married the fair Draaupadi with eyes of lotus blue.”
                    The whole legend of these princes is so marked with the stamp of polyandrous
                    institutions that the very terminology of polyandry, the system of nomenclature
                    called “classificatory,” is retained. Grand-uncles, in this episode of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> as among the Red Indians, are called
                    grandfathers, and uncles fathers.</p>
                <p>If, then, the Aryan race was not originally organized like the polyandrous
                    Thibetans, the legends which declare these facts are at least singular examples
                    of “undesigned coincidence.” Before coming to that conclusion, it is now
                    necessary to examine certain symbolic customs, certain laws of inheritance and
                    of prohibited degrees, and so to determine whether the looser relations of
                    savages may not have been the material out of which the modern family was
                    gradually fashioned. This can scarcely be called a new, though it has never been
                    a popular opinion. Mr Millar, professor of law in the university of Glasgow,
                    expressed it distinctly in his <hi rend="italic">Origin of the Distinction
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Panks,</hi> p. 47 (4th edition, Edinburgh, 1806).</p>
                <p>3. If the practices which make kindred through males difficult or impossible to
                    recognize were ever universally prevalent, they will have left vestiges of their
                    existence in the custom of tracing descent through females. Again, where that
                    custom is met with, though marriage has become fixed, and where women are
                    mistresses of the household and headβ of the family, it is not easy to give any
                    other explanation of these facts than this, that they are survivals from a time
                    when the union of the sexes was vague and temporary. Where, then, do we meet
                    with examples of kindred traced through the female line <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi>
                    Kindred through women is recognized in Australia (with exceptions among certain
                    tribes), in the Marianne Islands, in Fiji, Touga, and some other isles of the
                    Pacific, and in the Carolina Islands. Among the Kars of the Golden Chersonese,
                    the tribes are divided iuto Sgans, who recognize male descent, and Pwos, who
                    reckon by the mother’s side. The natives of the province of Keang-se “are
                    celebrated among the natives of the other Chinese provinces for the mode or form
                    used by them in address, which is Laon peaon,” paraphrastically translated

                    century. The legislation of the Revolution changed all this, but a popular song
                    still testifies to the annoyance of <hi rend="italic">les héritières.</hi> This
                    ancient custom thus fulfils the proverb, “Tout finit par des chansons” (Giraud
                    Teulon, <hi rend="italic">La Mère chez certains peuples de U Antiquité,</hi>
                    Paris, 1867, p. 42). Among ancient peoples there are very many more or less
                    distinct vestiges of female kinship. Herodotus, it is true, says of the Lycians
                    (i. 173), “This custom they have to themselves, and herein agree with no other
                    men, in that they name themselves by the mother’s side and not by the father’s.
                    And if one ask another who he is, he will recount his maternal descent, and
                    reckon up his mother’s maternal ancestors.” Now, so far from this mode of
                    deducing descent being peculiar to the Lycians, it was in vogue among the
                    Locrians (Polybius, 12, v., and <hi rend="italic">Excerpta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist. Grcec. Frag.,</hi> Rome, 1827, p. 384). In the bilingual Etruscan
                    inscriptions, according to Μ. Giraud Teulon <hi rend="italic">{Origine de la
                    Famille,</hi> p. 21), to whom we owe many of these citations, “the Etruscan text
                    contains only the name of the mother of the dead, while the Latin text gives
                    that of the father.” Certain Egyptian mortuary inscriptions give the name of the
                    mother, while the accompanying Greek text gives that of the father. A stele
                    found in the ruins of the temple at Napata by Mariette Bey <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Revue Archéologique,</hi> May 1873) shows us a monarch justifying his claim to
                    the throne by enumerating the women of his maternal ancestry. Future historians
                    will no doubt explain the apparent coexistence of two systems of kindred in
                    Egypt. Meanwhile it is noteworthy that Herodotue (ii. 35) declares that
                    daughters were compelled by law to maintain their parents, λvhile sons were free
                    to do as they pleased. This report has been curiously confirmed by the legal
                    documents of certain private Egyptian families, lately deciphered by M.
                    Revillout. We see the woman mistress of the household, and owner of the
                    property.</p>
                <p>Many other ancient examples are published by the Baron d’Eckstein <hi
                    rend="italic">{Peνue</hi><hi rend="italic">Archéologique,</hi> 1858), but M.
                    d’Eckstein’s speculations about race need not be accepted. Millar <hi
                    rend="italic">{op. cih,</hi> p. 48) quotes some survivals of the custom of
                    tracing pedigree and deriving condition through women: “If any one be born of a
                    Campanian father, and a mother Puteolan, he is a Campanian citizen, unless, <hi
                    rend="italic">by some particular custom</hi><hi rend="italic">{privilegio
                    aliquo),</hi> his <hi rend="italic">maternal</hi> descent is to be reckoned.”
                    Among places where this local custom ruled, Delphi is mentioned. The great
                    collections of the facts known about the ancient position of women as heads of
                    the family is Bachofen’s <hi rend="italic">Das Mutterrecht,</hi> in which
                    somewhat crude speculations about religion are -introduced. The most classical
                    example of a tradition of gynaecocracy is that often-quoted tale ofjVarro’s
                    preserved by St Augustine <hi rend="italic">{De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Civitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi> lib. xviii. c. 9). In the time of
                    Cecrops, the serpent-king, a dispute arose between Pallas and Poseidon, which
                    was settled by the votes of the Athenians. In these days women possessed the
                    franchise, and a woman’s vote turned the scale in favour of Pallas. To appease
                    Poseidon, the Athenian men resolved that women should no more be admitted to the
                    assemblies, nor should children take their names from the mother’s family. In
                    this tradition survives a memory of the Red Indian and Australian practice,
                    which makes the child belong to the mother’s clan, and also a memory of the
                    political rights, so to speak, which women enjoyed among the ancient Britons,
                    among the Iroquois of Lafitau’s time, and which take the shape of a considerable
                    share in the despotism of African races. It may be said that if women bave ever
                    enjoyed these privileges it is odd that among the least cultivated peoples, such
                    as the Australians, they are treated as slaves. The reply is—if the Australians
                    were a people of barbaric wealth, like many African nations, and if the
                    certainty of succession to the “royal stool” and the royal treasures were a
                    matter of the utmost moment to the state, it is not improbable that the ancient
                    custom of female kinship would have given, among them too, dignity, importance,
                    and power to women. Thus we know from several sources that</p>

                    family is entirely lost in the offspring, but, should the daughters deceive
                    their husbands, it is still preserved.” In leaving this part of the subject we
                    may ask, from what considerations, except those indicated by Bowditch, could the
                    rule of inheritance by the mother’s side have been derived?</p>
                <p>4. It has been shown that the actual practices of many barbarous races make the
                    existence of the patriarchal, and still more of the monogamous family
                    impossible, and that the traditions of the races called Aryan, with many
                    fragments of their customs, testify to a similar state of things in the past
                    experiences of nations now organized on the basis of the family. We must now
                    ask—(1) Of what nature are the wider tribal associations of savages? (2) How did
                    they come into existence? (3) Are there any vestiges of similar and similarly
                    formed associations among peoples which now possess strict marriage and kinship
                    through males? We find that the Australian black fellows and the red men of
                    North America are grouped in <hi rend="italic">local tribes,</hi> which
                    generally are named from the lands they occupy. Thus, the Onondaga are people of
                    the hills, the Mohawks people of the flint, the Senecas people of the great
                    hills, the Oneidas people of the granite, and so forth (Morgan, <hi
                    rend="italic">League of the Iroquois,</hi> 1851). In Australia the tribes take
                    the names of districts, as Ballarat, Wandyalloch, and Moreton Bay. Within these
                    local tribes there are smaller associations, variously called “clans,”
                    “families,” “septs,” “tribes,” by travellers. They are, as a rule, governed on
                    this principle in Australia :—“All the children take after the clan of their
                    mother, and no man can marry a woman of the same clan, although the parties be
                    born of parents in no way related, according to our ideas” (G. S. Lang, <hi
                    rend="italic">Aboriginals of Australia,</hi> Melbourne, 18G5, p. 10; Gray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Journals, &amp;c.,</hi> ii. 227). These smaller associations which
                    may not intermarry are named after some animal, vegetable, or other natural
                    object. A member of the Kangaroo associations may not slay or eat the kangaroo,
                    which he holds in honour, and a Paddymelon must abstain from paddymelon, The
                    obvious result of this scheme of prohibited marriage is to make every local
                    tribe contain much the same assortment of smaller communities. Looking at North
                    America, we find the local tribe of Senecas to be composed of sets of persons
                    called by the name of Wolf, Bear, Turtle, Beaver, Deer, Snipe, Heron, Hawk, and
                    many of the same names prevail among Cayugas, Oneidas, Mohawks, and the rest.
                    Just as in Australia, no man may marry a woman of the same name, though she may
                    have been born hundreds of miles away, and may be no sort of relation in our
                    sense of the word. As in Australia, the animal or plant from which each
                    association takes its name is sacred; in America it is called the totem. The
                    oldest Iroquois totems seem, from many legendary and political proofs, to have
                    been Wolf, Bear, and Turtle (Morgan, <hi rend="italic">Ancient Society,</hi>
                    1877, p. 70; see also M <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Lennan, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fortnightly Review,</hi> 1869-1870). Turning to Africa (Bowditch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mission to Ashantee,</hi> p. 181), we read of similar
                    institutions. Livingstone reports similar facts among the Bechwanas, Falkner
                    among the Patagonians, Brooke among the Sea Dyaks, and Garcilasso de la Vega
                    among the lower races of Peru.</p>
                <p>The essential features of these associations and groups of kindred are, for our
                    present purpose—(1) Their indubitable growth out of <hi rend="italic"
                    >female</hi> kinship, and the rule which prohibits marriage between persons who
                    are of the same name, and own descent from the same plant, animal, or thing; (2)
                    their existence as stocks of different blood in the same local tribe; and (3)
                    their acknowledgment of kinship with, and of the duty to support in war, or to
                    revenge, other members of the same name. (On this point, see Morgan, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Society,</hi> p. 78. Compare also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancient Society,</hi> p. 175, as to the Louchoux or Kutchin of the Tukon River:
                    “A man does not marry into his own class; .... the children belong to the grade
                    of the mother; .... members of the same grade in the different tribes do not war
                    with each other.”) For convenience of nomenclature, we shall call all such
                    associations <hi rend="italic">totem-kin.</hi> The word totem points to the
                    peculiarity of supposed descent from some natural object which gives the name,
                    and “kin” is more convenient than “group” or “clan,” because the same totem and
                    the same name cover many scattered groups.</p>
                <p>5. The question now rises, Do we meet similar associations among civilised
                    peoples who now possess the family? First we find Mr Hart of Canton saying <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ancient Society,</hi> pp. 364, 365): “In some parts of the
                    country large villages are to be met with, in each of which there exists but one
                    family name; thus in one district will be found, say, three villages, each
                    containing two or three thousand people, the one of the Horse, the second of the
                    Sheep, and the third of the Ox family name Just as among the</p>
                <p>North American Indians husband and wife are always of different families,—that
                    is, of different surnames. Custom and law alike prohibit marriage on the part of
                    people having the same family surname. The children are of the father’s
                    family,—that is, they take his surname.” (Compare <hi rend="italic">Narrative of
                    Two Mahometan Travellers,</hi> Pinkerton, vol. vii.) The Arabian travellers had
                    the same law at home, prohibiting marriage between people of the same family
                    name.</p>
                <p>Looking at India we find in the <hi rend="italic">Institutes of Menu</hi> (iii 5)
                    that a man of the twice-born classes may not marry “a woman descended from his
                    paternal or maternal anccstors within the sixth degree, nor [in words believed
                    to be a comment on the original] one who is known by her family name to be of
                    the same primitive stock with his father.” No one, that is to say, may marry
                    within the <hi rend="italic">ghotra,</hi> just as no Red Indian may marry within
                    the limits fixed by the totem. If the ghotra was counted, or if the Chinese
                    family name ran, on the female side, Chinese and Brahmans would be exactly in
                    the position of Australian blacks, as far as prohibited degrees are concerned.
                    Mr Cunningham <hi rend="italic">{Digest of Hindu Law,</hi> Madras, 1877) says
                    that the old rule about the ghotra is falling into disuse, and that local custom
                    in many places permits it to be disobeyed. Now, just as observers in India note
                    this change of practice, so observers among the Red Indians and Australians note
                    another change of practice. Kindred among these peoples is very gradually
                    beginning to be reckoned by the male line; children are being counted among some
                    tribes in the clan of the father (Morgan, p. 86).</p>
                <p>Leaving India, and turning to Greece and Rome, we find the local tribe and,
                    subordinate to the tribe, two forms of associations called the γ⅛os and gens,
                    which are prominent in early history and gradually die out. Thus, though in the
                    Twelve Tables, as we have seen, the members of the gens succeed to the property
                    of an intestate, yet in the 2d century Gaius declares <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Inst.,</hi> iii. 17) that all Gentile law had fallen into desuetude. The gens,
                    then, was, as its very name implies, a form of kindred, but old and hastening to
                    decay. The members of a gens, according to Cicero, had a common name, were born
                    of free parents, and were those who <hi rend="italic">caρite non sunt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">deminuti.</hi> Festus adds that members of a gens are <hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">eodem genere orti.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n30/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0030-0021"/>
                <p>It must be noticed that, though the members of a gens were of no recognizable kin
                    to each other in one sense, yet they showed a certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >solidarité</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> putting on mourning when one of the kin
                    was in disgrace (Livy, vi. 20), sharing common religious rights peculiar to
                    themselves, and at one time having a right to inherit property. All these things
                    poiut to consciousness of distant blood-relationship. Still one feature of the
                    ghotra seems absent. It is hardly proved that there was a time when Romans might
                    not marry within the gens. Indications of the past existence of the rule are
                    found in the fact that Roman genealogies do not, as it is said, show U3 examples
                    of marriages between persons of the same gens. More to the point is Plutarch’s
                    statement (Γkpi <hi rend="italic">αιτίων</hi> ’Ρωμαϊκών), “In times past it was
                    unlawful for Romans to marry women of their own kin (&lt;rυγγm‰s)ι · · · · <hi
                    rend="superscript"> na</hi> y, they did not wed ladies in any degree connected
                    with them by blood, just as now they do not take sisters or aunts, and it was
                    long before they ventured to take cousins to wife.” It seems then that, just as
                    in the case of the contemporary ghotra of the Hindus, an ancient and wide
                    prohibition to marry in the gens was thrown off by the Romans. Here it must be
                    noted that the ghotra of the Hindu law of inheritance is not identical with the
                    ghotra in which marriage is prohibited by custom. It is rather a body composed
                    of all the cognates within certain large limitations.</p>
                <p>Iu the example of the Greek γεvoς we again find the common name a patronymic,
                    generally thought to be derived from a hero. We find that all who bore the name
                    shared certain religious rights, and before Solon’s date were co-heirs to
                    property, and took up the blood feud if one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >yivο&lt;s</hi> were slain. Yet the <hi rend="italic">ycwητaι</hi> are often
                    defined as <hi rend="italic">not</hi> akin in blood, so entirely did the old
                    sense of relationship dwindle, in Greece as in Rome. The lexicographers supposed
                    that the <hi rend="italic">yivη</hi> were constituted by legislative enactment,
                    <hi rend="italic">νόμ,ω</hi> τlvι eχovτeς <hi rend="italic">κοινωνίαν.</hi> (See

                    also Grote’s <hi rend="italic">History of Greece,</hi> iii. 53.) Now, hard as it
                    is to ascertain the exact nature of the <hi rend="italic">yevο&lt;i,</hi> and of
                    its relation to the tribe, it seems, on the whole, more analogous to the
                    totem-kin than to the caste or joint family of the modern Hindus. (See Sir Henry
                    Maine, “South Slavonians and Rajpoots,” <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth
                    Century,</hi> December, 1877.) A common name, co-heirship, the duty of avenging
                    a member, all point to the idea of kinship. As to exogamy, a Greek could
                    certainly marry in his own <hi rend="italic">yivος,</hi> for the common name
                    went by the· father’s side, and a Greek might marry his father’s though not his
                    mother’s daughter. It has been argued that the prohibition to marry a uterine
                    sister, though kinship in historic Greece went by the male line, indicates a
                    past when the maternal tie was more strict,—when, in fact, a man who married his
                    uterine sister married <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >yevο&lt;s,</hi> and a man who took his half-sister by the father’s side married
                    outside the <hi rend="italic">yivο&lt;s.</hi> Here it may be observed that
                    Aristotle (PoZ., 1, 2, 5, 6) gives as very ancient synonyms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ycwηται</hi> the terms ομογάλακτες (nourished on the same milk), όμοσύτυοι
                    (eating from the same vessel), <hi rend="italic">όμοκάπνοι</hi> (warmed by the
                    same fire). These terms speak of a time when motherhood or fosterage, when
                    community of shelter, not blood kinship, were the bonds that kept members of the
                    same kin together. The words may be compared with Gaelic <hi rend="italic"
                    >teadhloch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">coediche,</hi> “Gaelic names for family,
                    signifying, the first, having a common residence, the second those who eat
                    together” (M*Lennan, <hi rend="italic">Prim. Mar.,</hi> p. 154).</p>
                <p>It has been usual, almost universal, to explain the Greek γεvoς and Roman gens by
                    simply saying, like Mr Freeman <hi rend="italic">(Comparative Politics,</hi>
                    Macmillan, 1873, p. Ill), “The family grew into the clan, the clan grew into the
                    tribe.” Mr Freeman says we can trace this process best “among men of our own
                    blood.” But when we examine the early associations of the English (Kemble’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Saxons in England,</hi> vol. i. p. 458), we find, just as in
                    America, just as in Australia, groups of kindred of the same name,—take Billing,
                    by way of example,—scattered from north to south through all the local tribes.
                    We have seen how this happens in America and Australia, we have seen that there
                    the family, in Mr Freeman’s sense, does not grow into the clan. Did it do so in
                    Attica and Italy, and, if so, how did a tribe, which was <hi rend="italic">ex
                    hypothesi</hi> but a swollen clan, contain so many stocks which claimed distinct
                    origin and distinct mythical ancestors <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> How did these
                    stocks come to be scattered through local tribes, not grouped in one I The
                    growth of savage tribes is not a development of the family; tribes singularly
                    like those of savages are found in early civilizations. Had the two kinds of
                    kindred different origins'?</p>
                <p>There remains a point to notice. The thoroughly savage totem-kindreds revere the
                    animal, plant, or other object from which they take their name and claim
                    descent, and they use it as a badge. For Greek and Roman survivals of this usage
                    see Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Theseus;</hi> M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Lennan, “The worship of plants and animals,” in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fortnightly Review,</hi> 1869, 1870; and the <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of
                    Heraldry,</hi> by W. S. Ellis, 1869. If the ordinary theory, that the tribe and
                    clan are overgrown families, be rejected, the converse theory may be stated thus
                    :—The totem-kindreds of savages grow up through exogamy and female kin. The
                    change to male kinship (a change which is demonstrably taking place in America
                    and Australia) produced something like the Chinese circle of relationship. The
                    substitution of the name of a fictitious ancestor for that of the sacred plant,
                    animal, or natural object produced a circle of affinity like the Hindu ghotra of
                    customary religion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We
                    have examples in Zulu-land of the declining belief in animal ancestry
                    (Callaway’s <hi rend="italic">Religion of the Arnuzulu),</hi> and in Greek
                    history we have frequent instances of the fictitious adoption of eponymous
                    heroic ancestors.</p></note> The decay of the prohibition to marry within the
                    kin united by the family name, like the growing laxity of rule in the ghotra,
                    produced something like the Greek γεvoς and the Roman gens. Nothing remained but
                    joint religious rites, a common place of burial, a common name, a vague feeling
                    of connexion, traditions of the prohibition to marry within the gens, the duty
                    of taking up the blood-feud, and vestiges of the jointheirship. In process of
                    time the intenser affections of the family caused the old gentile ties to
                    disappear, and gentile law became an empty memory.</p>
                <p>It has been shown that arrangements ruder than the modern family exist among
                    contemporary savages, and have existed among ancient peoples. It has been shown
                    that these rude institutions produce large associations of men, tribes and
                    totem-kindred, among savages, and that, by a series of changes, every one of
                    which is exemplified in experience, the Greek and Roman gentes, the units of
                    early political society, may have been developed out of barbarous groups. There
                    are next certain customs to be examined, which tend, as far as they go, to show
                    that civilized society passed through savage stages. The chief of these customs
                    are the ceremony of capture and bridal etiquette. As to the ceremony of capture
                    it is superfluous to say much, as the subject has been handled, with complete
                    originality and copious illustrations, in M‘Lennan’s <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                    Marriage.</hi> The classic example of the ceremony of capture is thus stated by
                    C. O. Müller, <hi rend="italic">(History and Antiquities of the Home Race,</hi>
                    English translation, Oxford, 1830, vol. ii. p. 298): “Two things were requisite
                    as an introduction and preparation to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"

                    of the father; secondly, <hi rend="italic">ike seizure of the bride.</hi> The
                    latter was clearly an ancient national custom.” Muller then describes the
                    clandestine intercourse, which lasted for some time, before the man “brought his
                    bride, and frequently her mother, into his house.” The intercourse of bride and
                    groom among the Iroquois of Lafitau’s time was likewise clandestine. For the
                    practice in Crete Muller quotes Strabo, x. 482, D. A similar custom prevailed in
                    Rome (Apuleius, <hi rend="italic">De As. Aur.</hi> iv.; Festus, <hi
                    rend="italic">s. v.</hi> “Rapi”), and was supposed to be derived from the time
                    of the rape of the Sabines. Mr M‘Lennan finds the practice necessary to the
                    constitution of the relations of husband and wife among the Calmucks, the
                    Tunguzians, the Khonds, the Fuegians, the Welsh, the Arabs, the Irish, and
                    various other races. He explains its existence by the institutions of exogamy
                    <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> the rule prohibiting marriage between people of
                    the same blood), and by the prevalence of hostility between the tribes of ride
                    times. Suppose the rule to exist that a man may not marry a woman of his own
                    community, and suppose that, by an exhaustive division, all other communities
                    without exception are hostile, he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> steal a wife if he
                    is to marry at all. The fiction of capture, as men grow more polite, will endure
                    as part of the marriage ceremony when the need of the reality is passed. It is
                    to be noticed that the theft of the woman is, in the fictitious capture,
                    generally the work of more than one man, as it well might be, if the early
                    marriages were polyandrous. If it be granted that the prohibition to marry
                    within the community is as early as it is widely prevalent, this explanation of
                    the form of capture will seem sufficient. The origin of the early prohibition
                    will be discussed later. Thus, on the evidence of a sportive feature in the
                    marriage ceremony of civilized peoples, a vestige is revealed of customs
                    connected with a very early form of the family.</p>
                <p>A strange piece of barbarous etiquette may hint that the kindred of the bride and
                    groom were once hostile groups. The daughter-in-law, among many races, is
                    forbidden to speak to her father-in-law; the mother-in-law must hide when she
                    sees her son-in-law. The wives treat their husbands with what may be a survival
                    of hostility, and never name them by their names. Examples are collected in Sir
                    John Lubbock’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Civilization,</hi> pp. 11, 12. The
                    practices are found among races on the border of the Polar Sea, in the Rocky
                    Mountains, in Southern Africa, among the Caribs, Mongols, and Calmucks, in
                    China, in Siberia, and in Australia. To these instances adduced by Sir John
                    Lubbock we may add Bulgaria (Dozon, <hi rend="italic">Chants Populaires Bulgar
                    es}.</hi></p>
                <p>Herodotus says (i. 146) that the wives of the early Ionians would not call their
                    husbands by their names nor sit at meat with them, and instructed their
                    daughters to practise the same reserve. The reason assigned is that the women
                    were originally Carians, whose parents the Ionians had slain. It may be allowed
                    that this world-wide practice, too, testifies to a time when men married out of
                    their own group, and all groups were hostile each to the other. Perhaps the
                    English local custom, which forbids the parents of bride and bridegroom to be
                    present at the marriage ceremony, holds the same antiquity.</p>
                <p>We have now to note the widespread existence of a system of nomenclature, which
                    can hardly have arisen in times when the monogamous family was the unit of
                    society. Mr Lewis Morgan of New York was. the discoverer of a custom very
                    important in its bearing on the history of society. In about two-thirds of the
                    globe persons in addressing a kinsman do not discriminate between grades of
                    relationship. All these grades are merged in large categories. Thus, in what Mr
                    Morgan calls the “Malayan system,” “all consanguinei, near or far, fall within
                    one of these relationships—grand-parent, parent, brother, sister, child, and
                    grandchild.” No other blood-relationships are recognized <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ancient Society,</hi> p. 385). This at once reminds us of the Platonic
                    Republic. “We devised means that no one should ever be able to know his own
                    child, but that all should imagine themselves to be of one family, and should
                    regard as brothers and sisters those who were within a certain limit of age; and
                    those who were of an elder generation they were to regard as parents and
                    grand-parents, and those who were of a younger generation as children and
                    grandchildren <hi rend="italic">{Timet us,</hi> 18, Jowett’s translation, first
                    edition, vol. ii., 1871). This system prevails in the Polynesian groups, and in
                    New Zealand. Next comes what Mr Morgan chooses to call the Turanian system. “It
                    was universal among the North American aborigines,” whom Mr Morgan styles
                    Ganowanians. “Traces of it have been found in parts of Africa” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ancient Society,</hi> p. 386), and “it still prevails in South India among the
                    Hindus, who speak the Dravidian language,” and also in North India, among other
                    Hindus. The system, as Mr Morgan says, “is simply stupendous.” It is not exactly
                    the same among all his miscellaneous “Turanians,” but, on the whole, assumes the
                    following shapes. Suppose the speaker to be a male, he will style his nephew and
                    niece in the male line, his brother’s children, “son” and “daughter,” and his
                    grand-nephews and grand-nieces in the male line, “grandson” and “granddaughter.”
                    Here the Turanian and the Malayan systems agree. But change the sex; let the
                    male speaker address his nephews and nieces in the female line,—the children of
                    his sister,—he salutes them as “nephew” and “niece,” and they hail him as
                    “uncle.” Now, in the Malay system, nephews and nieces on both sides, brother’s
                    children or sisters, are alike named “children” of the uncle. If the speaker be
                    a female, using the Turanian style, these terms are reversed. Her sister’s sons
                    and daughters are saluted by her as “son” and daughter,” her brother’s children
                    she calls “nephew” and “niece.” Yet the children of the persons thus styled
                    “nephew” and “niece” are not recognized in conversation as “grand-nephew” and
                    “grandniece,” but as “grandson” and “grand-daughter.” It is impossible here to
                    do more than indicate these features of the classificatory nomenclature, from
                    which the others may be inferred. The reader is referred for particulars to Mr
                    Morgan’s great work, <hi rend="italic">Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of
                    the Human Race</hi> (Washington, 1871).</p>
                <p>The existence of the classificatory system is not an entirely novel discovery.
                    Nicolaus Damascenus, one of the inquirers into early society, who lived in the
                    first century of our era, noticed this mode of address among the Galactophagi.
                    Lafitau found it among the Iroquois. To Mr Morgan’s perception of the importance
                    of the facts, and to his energetic collection of reports, we owe our knowledge
                    of the wide prevalence of the system. From an examination of the degrees of
                    kindred which seem to be indicated by the “Malayan” and “Turanian” modes of
                    address, Mr Morgan has worked out a theory of the evolution of the modern
                    family. A brief comparison of this with other modern theories will close our
                    account of the family. The main points of the theory are shortly stated in <hi
                    rend="italic">Systems of Consanguinity,</hi> &amp;c., pp. 487, 493, and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Society,</hi> p. 384. From the latter work we quote the
                    following description of the five different and successive forms of the
                    family:—</p>

                    other; also, on the intermarriage of several brothers, own and collateral, with
                    each others’ wives in a group,— these wives not being necessarily of kin to each
                    other, although <pb break="no"

                    upon marriage between single pairs, but without an exclusive cohabitation. The

                <p>“IV. <hi rend="italic">The Patriarchal Family.</hi> 11 was founded upon the
                    marriage of one man with several wives, followed in general by the seclusion of
                    the wives.</p>
                <p>“V. <hi rend="italic">The Monogamian Family.</hi> It was founded upon marriage
                    between single pairs with an exclusive cohabitation.</p>
                <p>“Three of these forms, namely, the first, second, and fifth, were radical,
                    because they were suflicently general and influential to create three distinct
                    systems of consanguinity, all of which still exist in living forms. Conversely,
                    these systems are sufficient of themselves to prove the antecedent existence of
                    the forms of the family and of marriage with which they severally stand
                    connected.”</p>
                <p>Mr Morgan makes the systems of nomenclature proofs of the existence of the
                    Consanguine and Punaluan families. Unhappily, there is no other proof, and the
                    same systems have been explained on a very different principle (M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Lennan, <hi rend="italic">Studies in Ancient
                    History,</hi> p. 372-407). Looking at facts, we find the Consanguine family
                    nowhere, and cannot easily imagine how early groups abstained from infringing on
                    each other, and created a systematic marriage of brothers and sisters. St
                    Augustine, however <hi rend="italic">(De Civ. Dei,</hi> xv. 16), and Archinus in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Thessalica</hi><hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> xi. 7,
                    scholia B, Q) agree more or less with Mr Morgan. Next, how did the consanguine
                    family change into the Punaluan? Mr Morgan says <hi rend="italic">(Ancient
                    Society,</hi> pp. 424, 428) brothers ceased to marry their sisters, because “the
                    evils of it could not for over escape human observation.” Thus the Punaluan
                    family was hit upon, and “created a distinct system of consanguinity” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ancient Society,</hi> p. 384), the Turanian. Again, “marriages in
                    Punaluan groups explain the relationships in the system.” But (p. 386) Mr Morgan
                    provides himself with another explanation, “the Turanian system owes its origin
                    to marriage in the group <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to the gentile
                    organization.” He calls exogamy “the gentile organization,” though, in point of
                    fact, the only gentes we know, the Roman gentes, show scarcely a trace of
                    exogamy. Again, “the change of relationships which resulted from substituting
                    Punaluan in the place of Consanguine marriage turns the Malayan into the
                    Turanian system” (p. 442, see too p. 387). In the same page (442) Mr Morgan
                    attributes the change to the “gentile organization,” and, still in the same
                    page, uses <hi rend="italic">both</hi> factors in his working out of the
                    problem. Now, if the Punaluan marriage is a sufficient explanation, we do not
                    need the “gentile organization.” Both, in Mr Morgan’s opinion, were efforts of
                    conscious moral reform. In <hi rend="italic">Systems of Consanguinity</hi> (p.
                    490) the gentile organization (there called tribal), that is, exogamy, is said
                    to have been “designed to work out a reformation in the intermarriage of
                    brothers and sisters.” But the Punaluan marriage had done that, otherwise it
                    would not have produced (as Mr Morgan says it did) the change from the Malayan
                    to the Turanian system, the difference in the two systems, as exemplified in
                    Seneca and Tamil, being “in the relationships which depended on the
                    intermarriage or non-intermarriage of brothers and sisters” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ancient Society,</hi> p. 442). Vet the Punaluan family, though itself a reform
                    in morals and in “breeding,” “did not furnish adequate motives to reform the
                    Malay system,” which, as we have seen, it did reform (p. 388). The Punaluan
                    family, it is suspected, “frequently involved own brothers and sisters” (p.
                    427); had it not been so, there would have been no need of a fresh moral
                    reformation,—“the gentile organization.” Yet even in the Punaluan family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ancient Society,</hi> p. 488) “brothers ceased to marry their own
                    sisters.” What, then, did the “gentile organization” do for men <hi
                    rend="italic">Ί</hi> As they had already ceased to marry their own sisters, and
                    as, under the gentile organization, they were still able to marry their
                    half-sisters, the reformatory “ingenuity” of the inventors of the organizations
                    was at once superfluous and useless. It is impossible to understand the Punaluan
                    system. Its existence is inferred from a system of nomenclature which it does
                    (and does not) produce; it admits (and excludes) own brothers and sisters. Mr
                    Morgan has intended, apparently, to represent the Punaluan marriage as a long
                    transition to the definite custom of exogamy, but it will be seen that his
                    language is not very clear nor his positions assured. He does not adduce
                    sufficient proof that the Punaluan family ever existed as an institution, even
                    in Hawaii. There is, if possible, a greater absence of historical testimony to
                    the existence of the Consanguine family. It is difficult to believe that exogamy
                    was a conscious moral and social reformation, because, <hi rend="italic">ex
                    hypothesi,</hi> the savages had no moral data, nothing to cause disgust at
                    relations which seem revolting to us. It is as improbable that they discovered
                    the supposed physical evils of breeding in and in. That discovery could only
                    have been made after a long experience, and in the Consanguine family that
                    experience was impossible. Thus, setting moral reform aside as inconceivable, we
                    cannot understand how the Consanguine families ever broke up. Mr Morgan’s
                    ingenious speculations as to a transitional step towards the gens (as he calls
                    what we style the totem-kindred), supposed to be found in the “classes * and
                    marriage laws of the Kamilaroi, are vitiated by the weakness and contradictory
                    nature of the evidence (see Pritchard, vol. ii. p. 492: Lang’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Queensland,</hi> Appendix; <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of American Academy of
                    Arts,</hi> &lt;fcc., vol. viii. 412; <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> October 29,
                    1874). Further, though Mr Morgan calls the Australian “gentile organization”
                    “incipient,” he admits <hi rend="italic">(Ancient Society,</hi> p. 374) that the
                    Narrinyeri have totem groups, in which “the children are of the clan of the
                    father.” Far from being “incipient,” the gens of the Narrinyeri is on the
                    footing of the ghotra of Hindu custom. Lastly, though Mr Morgan frequently
                    declares that the Polynesians have not the gens (for he thinks them not
                    sufficiently advanced), Mr Gill has shown that unmistakable traces of the totem
                    survive in Polynesian mythology.</p>
                <p>There is the less necessity to believe, with Mr Morgan, in the Punaluan and
                    Consanguine families, because the evidence on which he relies, the evidence of
                    the classificatory system, has been explained on a different theory by Mr M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Lennan <hi rend="italic">(Studies in Ancient History,
                    loc. cit.),</hi> whose mode of conceiving the evolution of the family is,
                    briefly stated, this. Primitive man was, as geology reveals him, gregarious. We
                    have no sort of evidence as to his truly primitive manners, for all existing
                    savages have had many ages of experience and, as it were, of education. It can
                    hardly be supposed, however, that the earliest men had instinct against marriage
                    with near kin. Their earliest associations would be based on the sentiment of
                    kindred, not yet brought into explicit consciousness, and on community of
                    residence. They would be named by the name of their group. The blood relation of
                    the mother to the child would be the first they perceived. As time went on they
                    could reason out other relationships through women, but male kinship would
                    remain, though not unknown as a fact, unrecognized in custom, because, if
                    harmony was to exist within the group, it could only be secured “through
                    indifference and promiscuity,” which made certainty of male parentage
                    impossible. Now let it be supposed, as a vast body of evidence leads us to
                    suppose, that female children were slaughtered as <hi rend="italic">bouches
                    inutiles.</hi> The result would be a scarcity of women within the group. To
                    secure wives men would be obliged to steal them from other groups, which were,
                    <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi,</hi> hostile. This is almost the state of things
                    known to Montaigne (Cotton’s translation, chap, xvii.), “where the servile
                    condition of women is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n33/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0033-0024"/> looked upon with such contempt that they kill all
                    the native females and buy wives from their neighbours.” Now, in each group, by
                    the system of capture, are members of alieu groups, namely, the women and their
                    children, who, as we have seen, are recognized as connexions of the mothers, not
                    the fathers. Let these practices be formed into customary law, refuse a man
                    permission to marry a woman of his own stock-name (marked by the totem), and you
                    have exogamy, or what Mr Morgan calls “the gentile organization.” Within the
                    groups are several families of the earliest type, the female and her offspring.
                    Next, conceive of the sets of mother’s sons, as feeling a stronger bond of union
                    between themselves and the other members of the group, and as living with their
                    mother. They cannot marry their sisters (who are of the same name and totem as
                    themselves), but they regard their sisters’ children as their heirs. To their
                    own putative children, they can only make presents <hi rend="italic">inter
                    vivos,</hi> and the sisters are wedded each to a set of men in the manner of the
                    Nairs. But, as property was amassed, the brothers would prefer to keep their
                    property in the hands of their putative children, and “there would be a
                    disposition in favour of a system of marriage which would allow of the property
                    passing to the brother’s own children” <hi rend="italic">{Prim. Afar.,</hi>
                    242). This form of marriage would be the one prevailing in Thibet. The elder
                    brother, the first to marry, would have some of the attributes of the
                    paterfamilias. Thus the idea of fatherhood attained something like maturity.
                    Chiefs, moreover, would secure one or more wives to themselves, and their
                    example imitated would produce monandry. The old state of things would leave its
                    trace in the levirate, the duty of “raising up seed to a brother.” Even before
                    these changes, the custom of marrying out of the group would have introduced so
                    many strangers of various names and totems, that the members of a local tribe
                    could intermarry with one another and yet not violate the law of exogamy. Such a
                    local tribe, flushed with success in war, might refuse to marry beyond its
                    limits, and become, so to say, a caste divided into ghotras. Let this caste
                    feign itself to be descended from a common ancestor (a process of which Sir John
                    Lubbock gives many examples), and you have a caste believed to be of common
                    blood, yet refusing to marry outside the blood,—that is, an endogamous tribe.
                    Within this tribe (as it were by a reaction from the old kinship through
                    females) grows kinship through males only, the agnatic system of Rome. The wife
                    and children are the husband’s property; agnates only can be a man’s heirs and,
                    failing these, gentiles, <hi rend="italic">—i.e.,</hi> members of the kin still
                    denoted by the common name.</p>
                <p>Many criticisms have been made, especially by Sir John Lubbock and Mr Herbert
                    Spencer <hi rend="italic">{Origin, of Civilization,</hi> third edition; <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Sociology,</hi> vol. i.), on the scheme here too
                    briefly sketched. Sir John Lubbock holds that exogimy springs from marriage by
                    capture (by which alone a member of a group could get a wife to himself), rather
                    than marriage by capture from exogamy. Mr Spencer advocates the action of
                    various “conspiring causes,” “the stealing of a wife might become the required
                    proof of fitness to have one” <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> pp. 652, 653).
                    The origin of exogamy lies so far behind us in the past that it may remain for
                    ever obscure. It is probable that every variety of union of the sexes has
                    existed, while it seems possible that a few have been passed through, as
                    necessary stages, by all advancing races. In this notice we have said little of
                    the custom by which a man is a member of several clubs of men, each with
                    one^wife in common.</p>
                <p>No hard and fast theory is likely to be accepted as more than provisional in the
                    present state of knowledge, when science has only for a few years been busily
                    occupied in this investigation. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. l.)</hi></p>
