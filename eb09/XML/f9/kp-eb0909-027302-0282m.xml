                    <hi rend="smallcaps">St Veit-am-Flaum),</hi> a royal free town and port of
                    Hungary situated at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Quarnero, on the
                    Recina (Fiumara), 46 miles by road S.E. of Trieste, 45° 19' 19'' N. lat., 14°
                    26' 43" E. long. It consists of an old and a new town, the former standing on a
                    hill, the latter extending along the shore. The population in 1869 amounted to
                    14,039 for the town, and 4770 for the territory of Fiume; of these the greatest
                    number were Roman Catholics. Among the many important buildings are the old
                    chapter or cathedral church of the Assumption of the Virgin, and the church of
                    St Veit, built in imitation of Sta. Maria della Salute at Venice, the theatre,
                    capable of holding 1600 persons, the palace of Gorup, the barracks, and the
                    elegant marine academy founded in 1856. In the old town is an ancient Roman
                    triumphal arch, said to have been erected in honour of the emperor Claudius IL
                    Fiume possesses several educational establishments, among which are a
                    realgymnasium, two municipal high schools, and a Croatian gymnasium. The consuls
                    of several states reside in the town, which is the seat of a high court of
                    justice for commerce and marine, and of a chamber of industry and commerce.
                    Among the benevolent institutions are asylums for lunatics and decayed citizens,
                    and an industrial home for boys. Notwithstanding the revival of trade at
                    Trieste, commercial enterprise and industry have considerably increased at
                    Fiume, and the town has now two railways, opened in 1873—one a branch of the
                    southern railway from Vienna to Trieste, the other of the Hungarian state
                    railway from Carlstadt. Fiume is the immediate outlet by sea for the produce of
                    Hungary, with which country it is connected by the Louisen-strasse opened in
                    1809. It has two harbours—Porto Canale Fiumara, suitable only for coasting
                    vessels and small craft, and Porto Nuovo, affording good accommodation for large
                    ships. The latter port, commenced in 1847, is now (1878) being much enlarged and
                    extended to meet the increasing requirements of trade, and when completed will
                    occupy an area of 57∣ acres, and afford quay accommodation for 100 large
                    vessels. The chief exports are wheat, wine, tobacco, timber, rags, salt,
                    rape-seed, hemp, and paper, of which last the annual exports amount to upwards
                    of 30,000 cwt. Foremost among the industrial establishments are Whitehead’s
                    torpedo factory, Messrs Smith &amp; Meynie’s paper-mill, the royal tobacco
                    factory (furnishing yearly more than 200 million cigars and cigarettes and
                    employing above 3000 hands), a chemical factory where 1600 tons of sulphate of
                    soda are annually made, and a large steam flour-mill. Besides these may be
                    mentioned several shipbuilding yards, tanneries, and rope manufactories. The
                    soil of the surrounding country is stony, but the climate is warm, and wine is
                    extensively produced. The Gulf of Quarnero yields a plentiful supply of fish,
                    and the tunny trade with Trieste and Venice is of considerable importance.</p>
                <p>Fiume is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Libumian town <hi
                    rend="italic">Tersatica;</hi> later it received the name of Vitopolis, and
                    eventually that of Fanum Sancti Viti ad Flumen, from which its present name is
                    derived. It was destroyed by Charlemagne in 799, from which time it probably
                    long remained under the dominion of the Franks. It was held in feudal tenure
                    from the patriarch of Aquileia by the bishop of Pola, and afterwards, in 1139,
                    by the counts of Duino, who retained it till the end of the fourteenth century.
                    It next passed into the hands of the counts of Wallsee, by whom it was
                    surrendered in 1471 to the emperor Frederick 1II., who incorporated it with the
                    dominions of the house of Austria. From this date till 1776 Fiume was ruled by
                    imperial governors. In 1723 it was declared a free port by Charles VI., in 1776
                    united to Croatia by the empress Maria Theresa, and in 1779 declared a <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus separatum</hi> of the Hungarian crown. In 1809 Fiume was
                    occupied by the French; but it was retaken by the English in 1813, and restored
                    to Austria in the following year. It was ceded to Hungary in 1822, but after the
                    revolution of 1848-49 was annexed to the crown lands of Croatia, under the
                    government of which it remained for the next twenty years. Since August 1870 the
                    town and territory of Fiume have been under the direct control of the Hungarian
                    central Government.</p>
