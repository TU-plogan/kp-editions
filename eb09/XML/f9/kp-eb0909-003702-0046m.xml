                    (1546-1592), priuce of Parma, the famous governor of the Low Countries, was born
                    most probably about 1546. He was the son of Ottavio Farnese, prince of Parma,
                    and the celebrated Margaret of Austria, natural daughter of Charles V. His
                    boyhood he spent at Alcala and Madrid, having as companions his ill-fated cousin
                    Don Carlos and his uncle Don John of Austria, who were both about the same age
                    as himself. His chief delight was in martial exercises, and his passionate
                    ambition was for warlike glory. At eleven years of age he earnestly begged leave
                    to join the expedition which fought at St Quentin, and wept bitterly when his
                    request was refused. He had, indeed, a love for fighting for its own sake.
                    During the wearisome inactivity of his residence at Brussels with his mother,
                    whose abilities and masculine force of character had led to her appointment as
                    governor of the Low Countries, it was his nightly amusement to saunter in
                    disguise through the streets and challenge any cavalier of martial appearance
                    whom he met. As a young man he was extremely unpopular among the Netherlanders;
                    men said that he was nothing but a coxcomb and a bravo. He treated even the
                    nobility with the most insoleut arrogance. When he honoured them with an
                    invitation to dinner, he sat for the most part silent at the head of the table,
                    and placed his guests below the salt. During hi3 stay at Brussels, on the 18th
                    November 1565, his marriage with that wonderful paragon of propriety, Donna
                    Maria of Portugal, was celebrated with great splendour and at prodigious
                    expense.</p>
                <p>At length, after years of impatient waiting, his passionate longing for military
                    glory could no longer be repressed, and in 1571 he gained his first laurels by
                    brilliant personal bravery in the battle of Lepanto. It was seven years before
                    he had an opportunity of proving his splendid ability as a general. In the end
                    of 1577 he was placed in command of the reinforcements sent to Don John, and it
                    was mainly his prompt decision at a critical moment which secured the victory of
                    Gemblours (1578). His abilities were now recognized by his master Philip II.,
                    and on the death of Don John, he was appointed governor of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>This position, beset on every hand with difficulties apparently insuperable, was
                    exactly that which afforded the best opportunity for the display of his
                    remarkable talents and character. He gave his whole heart to his work, never
                    questioning the justice of the cause. Birth and education had endowed him with
                    the soul of a prince, with its virtues and its faults; and it probably never
                    occurred •to him to doubt that the world was created as a field for the ambition
                    of priuces, or to imagine that the plain Netherland burghers, who certainly did
                    not display a very satisfactory capacity for ruling themselves in the crisis of
                    national danger, were, with all their failings, really fighting for a noble
                    cause. To him they were self-willed Tebels and heretics. In military ability
                    Alexander Farnese was not surpassed, if equalled, by any of his contemporaries.
                    He possessed in a very high degree the power of command; his ill-fed, ill-clad,
                    unpaid soldiers rendered him the most perfect obedience. A consummate master of
                    strategy, fertile in resource, prompt and vigorous in action, partly by the
                    power of his genius and partly by the contagion of his dauntless courage, he
                    performed the greatest achievements with the slenderest means. His coolness in
                    danger amounted to rashness. Once, while dining within range of the enemy, a
                    shot scattered the brains of one of his companions on the table, but he ordered
                    a new cloth to be laid, and would not give the enemy the satisfaction of
                    interfering with his arrangements. His skill in diplomacy was second only to his
                    generalship, but it was a diplomacy without scruple, and his dissimulation was
                    remarkable even in that age. Yet though jealousy preferred numerous charges
                    against him, there is no reason to doubt his fidelity to his ungrateful
                    master.</p>
                <p>He found the Netherlands distracted by petty jealousies and party quarrels, and
                    to take advantage of these all his skill in diplomacy and in the art of delicate
                    bribery was exerted to the utmost. In the magistracies of many of the towns he
                    created a party favourable to the king, and the Walloon provinces were induced
                    to return to their allegiance. But he was unable to prevent the Union of
                    Utrecht, which was formed in 1579 by the genius of William the Silent. For five
                    years he waged equal war with that great prince, his chief exploits being the
                    taking of Maestricht and Oudenarde. In 1584 William was assassinated. The
                    opportunity was not lost by Farnese. He offered most favourable terms (except as
                    regarded the matter of religion), and gained over Ghent and several other
                    important towns. But the great town of Antwerp remained faithful to the union,
                    and against it all his energies were now directed. The history of this siege may
                    be taken as best displaying all the many and varied qualities of a great general
                    which Alexander Farnese possessed. Antwerp enjoyed a natural means of defence,
                    of which William of Orange had resolved to take advantage, and which would have
                    enabled it to bid defiance even to the genius of Farnese. It was possible by
                    breaking down the dykes to flood the country to the very city gates. Sainte
                    Aldegonde, tho governor, persuaded the magistracy to adopt this plan; but the
                    butchers and others, whose private interests were threatened, offered a violent
                    resistance, and the magistrates yielded in fear of riots. Another chance was
                    afforded Antwerp, and the magistrate^ were again to blame, with far less excuse.
                    Even after the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> siege commenced, numerous ships
                    continued to bring grain into the city, which might easily have been stored with
                    supplies for a very long period; but the magistrates fixed a minimum price, and
                    decreed that no corn should be sold to merchants for storing in granaries, thus
                    completely stopping the invaluable traffic. They did not for a moment believe
                    that Farnese would be able to overcome the many difficulties of the task, and
                    build a bridge across the Scheldt. But his engineering skill soon showed itself
                    equal to the achievement; and it was now in his power to starve the town. Yet a
                    third chance was allowed to Antwerp. The ingenious fireships of Gianibelli were
                    launched against the bridge; a breach was effected; a thousand Spanish soldiers
                    were destroyed; Farnese himself was wounded and lay scuseless for some time; his
                    army was overwhelmed with panic. The ships of the Netherlands might have brought
                    their cargoes of corn into the town, and a fatal blow might have been struck
                    against the Spaniards. But, through gross incompetence, the Netherlanders only
                    learned their success too late. The moment he recovered consciousness, Farnese
                    had set about repairing the bridge, inspiring his panic-stricken followers with
                    his own undaunted resolution and energy, and careful precautions were taken
                    against the recurrence of such a disaster. The only hope of Antwerp was to break
                    down the dykes, and, taking advantage of Farnese’s absence, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0047-0038"/> Sainte Aldegonde collected for the work a strong
                    and resolute force. A fierce hand-to-hand fight ensued on the slippery dykes,
                    and the work was going slowly forward, while the Spaniards were beginning to
                    give way, when Farnese himself appeared on the scene, and by his own exploits,
                    and the inspiration of his presence, entirely changed the fortunes of the day.
                    The Netherlanders fought resolutely for their homes and liberties, but at last
                    were forced to retreat, leaving the breach unmade. Antwerp was soon obliged by
                    famine to capitulate; Farnese, who was ignorant of the extremity of their
                    distress, allowing a complete and universal amnesty, and only requiring that all
                    Protestants should leave the city within two years. There was one noteworthy
                    condition, cunningly worded and worthy of Italian diplomacy: it was provided
                    that during the two years allowed the Protestants should not offer “any offence”
                    to the ancient religion. The Catholic magistrates whom Farnese had appointed,
                    and the Spanish garrison which held the citadel he had rebuilt, were, of course,
                    the sole judges of what constituted such an offence.</p>
                <p>The year 1586 he employed in taking steps to obtain the command of the Meuse and
                    Rhine. Grave, Gelders, and Deventer he gained by bribery and intrigue, and
                    Neuss, by assault. In this year negotiations were opened with Elizabeth, who had
                    sent an army under Leicester into the Low Countries. These negotiations are the
                    most striking illustration of Parma’s principles of diplomacy. So perfect was
                    his apparent frankness that even Elizabeth and Burleigh, who were well
                    accustomed to double-dealing, appear to have been completely deceived. From the
                    first Farnese had been told by his master that the negotiations were to lead to
                    nothing; and at the very moment when he had just received orders to invade
                    England, he was assuring the queen that “really and truly” nothing was intended
                    against her majesty or her kingdom.</p>
                <p>As time went on, Parma’s position grew more and more difficult. His soldiers died
                    in hundreds from cold, hunger, and disease; money was 'doled out to him with the
                    most niggardly hand; and it required all his influence to keep down mutiny. He
                    was constantly harassed by Philip’s commands to attempt the impossible. He had
                    prepared a fleet of transport boats, and the king issued repeated orders that he
                    should with these invade England, though every port was blockaded by the ships
                    of Holland and Zealand. Once, goaded to rashness, he made a mad attempt to break
                    through the line, but the odds were too great, and he was repulsed with heavy
                    loss. Even after the failure of the Armada, Philip still thought that Farnese
                    with his unarmed boats should do that which the huge warships had failed to
                    accomplish.</p>
                <p>In 1590 the condition of the Spanish troops had become intolerable. Farnese could
                    no longer support them from his private resources; his very jewels were pledged,
                    and the supplies from the king did not increase in regularity or amount. A
                    mutiny broke out, but was speedily suppressed. Under these difficulties, Farnese
                    was commanded to leave the work of years, and raise the siege of Paris, which
                    was surrounded by Henry of Navarre. He left the Netherlands on the 3d August
                    1590 with 15,000 troops. At Meaux he swore publicly in the cathedral that he had
                    come, not to conquer France, but only to assist the Catholic cause. By the most
                    splendid strategy he outwitted Henry, and relieved Paris; but his troops being
                    insufficiently supplied, he was compelled immediately to return to the Low
                    Countries, losing on the march many stragglers and wounded, who were killed by
                    the peasantry, and leaving all the positions he had taken to be recaptured by
                    Henry.</p>
                <p>Again, in 1591, in the very midst of a desperate contest with the genius of
                    Prince Maurice, sorely against his will, Farnese was obliged to give up the
                    engrossing struggle and march to relieve Rouen. Henry at once cautiously raised
                    the siege. In a subsequent engagement Farnese was wounded by a musket-ball in
                    the arm. Yet he defied pain and fever, refused to take the necessary rest, and
                    was carried in his couch to the field. At length Henry seemed to have shut in
                    the Spanish army safely in the land of Caux, but Farnese found means to escape
                    across the Seine. He spent a few days in Paris, and then visited Spa to drink
                    the waters.</p>
                <p>All his splendid services had not gained for him the confidence of Philip. His
                    enemies persuaded the king that he was only striving to conquer the Netherlands
                    that he might obtain the sovereignty for himself. Philip’s first characteristic
                    step was to dispatch a letter expressing complete confidence and tender
                    affection; Farnese was then politely requested to return home to aid his majesty
                    with his advice. But at the same time the marquis of Cerralbo was sent to the
                    Netherlands to share his work with the Mansfelds, and with orders to send him
                    home by force, if he refused to obey the king’s deceitful command. But all
                    trouble was spared the grateful monarch. In the autumn of 1592 Alexander Farnese
                    prepared to invade France for the third time. His robust constitution ruined by
                    the prodigious labours he had performed, gouty, dropsical, fevered with his
                    wounds, he was lifted into his saddle every day till the very morning of his
                    death. On the 3d December 1592, in the town of Arras, he fainted while
                    undressing for bed, and in a few hours was dead. He was only forty-six years of
                    age. By his own command he was laid out in the garb of a Capuchin friar. His
                    services were rewarded by a pompous funeral at Brussels, at which his Italian
                    and Spanish veterans fought together for the first place among the mourners, and
                    his statue was placed in the Capitol at Rome. He was buried in the church of his
                    own capital of Parma.</p>
