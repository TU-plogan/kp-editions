                    ambition with man; nor will this occasion surprise when we remember the
                    marvellous freedom enjoyed by volant as compared with non-volant animals. The
                    traditions of Daedalus and Icarus illustrate the attempts in the past; and at
                    the present day societies exist in Britain, France, Austria, and other
                    countries, for the purpose of solving, if possible, the knotty problem. These
                    societies embrace men of the highest scientific attainments, and as they evince
                    great activity, and publish their proceedings at regular intervals, it is not
                    too much to expect that the problem of artificial flight will be actually
                    solved, or at least much simplified. For the first time in the history of the
                    world, the subject of aerial navigation has been taken up in earnest by
                    practical men with the necessary degree of preliminary knowledge and training.
                    Investigators no longer dream about flight: they experiment upon and work
                    towards it. It is, they maintain, a physical problem to be solved by mechanical
                    skill and ingenuity. But while writing thus hopefully, it is necessary to state
                    that as yet no one has succeeded in constructing a fully equipped flying
                    machine. The number of successful flying models, however, is so considerable as
                    to inspire the cultivators of aeronautical science with a very confident hope of
                    success.</p>
                <p>The object of the present article is threefold—(1) to demonstrate the laws of
                    natural flight; (2) to expound the principles on which a flying machine should
                    be constructed; and (3) to chronicle some of the more important attempts at
                    aerostation in modern times.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary to enter upon a history of artificial flight. This has
                    already been done in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Aeronautics,</hi> to which
                    the reader is referred. The fact is that aerostation in its modern form dates
                    back only a very few years. It will suffice, then, if the modern discoveries are
                    recorded in the order of time as we proceed.</p>
                <p>The subject of aerostation is admitted on all hands to be one of extreme
                    difficulty. To tread upon the air (and this is what is really meant) is, at
                    first sight, in the highest degree utopian; and yet there are thousands of
                    living creatures which actually accomplish this feat. These creatures, however
                    varied in form and structure, all fly according to one and the same principle;
                    and this is a significant fact, as it tends to show that the air must be
                    attacked in a particular way to ensure flight. The flying machine of the future,
                    there can be no doubt, will be constructed on the type of flying animals,—the
                    insect, bird, and bat. It behoves us then at the outset to scrutinize very
                    carefully the general configuration of flying animals, and in particular the
                    size, shape, and movements of their flying organs.</p>
                <p>Flying animals, it may be premised, differ entirely from sailing ships and from
                    balloons, with which they are not unfrequently though erroneously compared; and
                    a flying machine constructed upon proper principlescan have nothing in common
                    with either of those creations. The ship floats upon water and the balloon upon
                    air; but the ship differs from the balloon, and the ship and the balloon differ
                    from the flying creature and flying machine. The water and air, moreover, have
                    characteristics of their own. The analogies which connect the water with the
                    air, the ship with the balloon, and the ship and the balloon with the flying
                    creature and flying machine are false analogies. A sailing ship is supported by
                    the water and requires merely to be propelled; a flying creature and a flying
                    machine constructed on the living type require to be both supported and
                    propelled. This arises from the fact that water is much denser than air, and
                    because water supports on its surface substances which fall through air.</p>
                <p>While water and air are both to be regarded as fluid media, they are to be
                    distinguished from each other in the following particulars. Water is
                    comparatively very heavy, inelastic, and incompressible; air, on the other hand,
                    is comparatively very light, elastic, and compressible. If water be struck with
                    violence, the recoil obtained is great when compared with the recoil obtained
                    from air similarly treated. In water we get a maximum recoil with a minimum of
                    displacement; in air, on the contrary, we obtain a minimum recoil with a maximum
                    of displacement.</p>
                <p>Water and air when unconfined yield readdy to pressure. They thus form <hi
                    rend="italic">movable f ulcra</hi> to bodies acting upon them. In order to meet
                    these peculiarities the travelling organs of aquatic and flying animals (whether
                    they be feet, fins, flippers, or wings) are made not of rigid but of elastic
                    materials. The travelling organs, moreover, increase in size in proportion to
                    the tenuity of the fluid to be acted upon. The difference in size of the
                    travelling organs of animals becomes very marked when the land animals are
                    contrasted with the aquatic, and the aquatic with the aerial, as in figs. 1, 2,
                    and 3.</p>
                <p>The peculiarities of water and air as supporting media are well illustrated by a
                    reference to swimming, diving, and flying birds. A bird when swimming extends
                    its feet simultaneously or alternately in a backward direction, and so obtains a
                    forward recoil. The water supports the bird, and the feet simply propel. In this
                    case the bird is lighter than the water, and the long axis of the body is
                    horizontal (α of fig. 4). When the bird dives, or flies under <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0320-0309"/> water, the long axis of the body is inclined
                    obliquely downwards and forwards, and the bird forces itself into and beneath
                    the water by the action of its feet, or wings, or both. In diving or subaquatic
                    flight the feet strike upwards and backwards, the wings downwards and <hi
                    rend="italic">backwards</hi><hi rend="italic">{b</hi> of fig. 4). In aerial
                    flying everything is reversed. The long axis of the bird is inclined obliquely
                    upwards and forwards, and thewings strike, not downwards and backwards, but
                    downwards and <hi rend="italic">forwards</hi> (c of fig. 4). These changes in
                    the direction of the long axis of the bird in swimming, diving, and flying, and
                    in the direction of the stroke of the wings in subaquatic and aerial flight, are
                    due to the fact that the bird is heavier than the air and lighter than the
                    water.</p>
                <p>The physical properties of water and air explain in a great measure how the
                    sailing ship differs from the balloon, and how the latter differs from the
                    flying creature and flying machine constructed on the natural type. The sailing
                    ship is, as it were, immersed in two oceans,—viz., an ocean of water and an
                    ocean of air—the former being greatly heavier and denser than the latter. The
                    ocean of water buoys or floats the ship, and the ocean of air, or part of it in
                    motion, swells the sails which propel the ship. The moving air which strikes the
                    sails directly strikes the hull of the vessel indirectly and forces it through
                    the water, which, as explained, is a comparatively dense fluid. When the ship is
                    in motion it can be steered either by the sails alone, or by the rudder alone,
                    or by both combined. A balloon differs from a sailing ship in being immersed in
                    only one ocean, viz., the ocean of air. It resembles the ship in floating upon
                    the air, as the ship floats upon the water; in other words, the balloon is
                    lighter than the air, as the ship is lighter than the water. But here all
                    analogy ceases. The ship, in virtue of its being immersed in two fluids having
                    different densities, can be steered and made to tack about in a horizontal plane
                    in any given direction. This in the case of the balloon, immersed in one fluid,
                    is impossible. The balloon in a calm can only rise and fall in a vertical line.
                    Its horizontal movements, which ought to be the more important, are accidental
                    movements due to air currents, and cannot be controlled; the balloon, in short,
                    cannot be guided. One might as well attempt to steer a boat carried along by
                    currents of water in the absence of oars, sails, and wind, as to steer a balloon
                    carried along by currents of air. The balloon has no hold upon the air, and this
                    consequently cannot be employed as a <hi rend="italic">fulcrum</hi> for
                    regulating its course. The balloon, because of its vast size and from its being
                    lighter than the air, is completely at the mercy of the wind. It forms an
                    integral part, so to speak, of the wind for the time being, and the direction of
                    the wind in every instance determines the horizontal motion of the balloon. The
                    force required to propel a balloon against even a moderate breeze would result
                    in its destruction. The balloon cannot be transferred with any degree of
                    certainty from one point of the earth’s surface to another, and hence the chief
                    danger in its employment. It may, quite as likely as not, carry its occupants
                    out to sea. The balloon is a mere lifting machine. It has no analogue in nature,
                    and, as its history sufficiently shows, is incapable of improvement.</p>
                <p>The balloon, as is well known, was introduced by the Montgolfier brothers in
                    1782. It was first inflated by heated air obtained by burning trusses of straw
                    under it, then by hydrogen gas, and lastly by coal gas. It is in no sense to be
                    regarded a flying machine. It resembles the flying creature only in this that it
                    is immersed in the ocean of air in which it sustains itself. The mode of
                    suspension is wholly different. The balloon floats because it is lighter than
                    the air; the flying creature floats because it extracts from the air, by the
                    vigorous downward action of its wings, a certain amount of upward recoil. The
                    balloon is passive; the flying creature is active. The balloon is controlled by
                    the wind; the flying creature controls the wind. The balloon in the absence of
                    wind can only rise and fall in a vertical line; the flying creature can fly in a
                    horizontal plane in any given direction. The balloon is inefficient because of
                    its levity; the flying creature is efficient because of its weight.</p>
                <p>Weight, however paradoxical it may appear, is necessary to flight. Everything
                    which flies is vastly heavier than the air. The inertia of the mass of the
                    flying creature enables it to control and direct its movements in the air. Many
                    are of opinion that flight is a mere matter of levity and power. This is quite a
                    mistake. No machine, however light and powerful, will ever fly whose travelling
                    surfaces are not properly fashioned and properly applied to the air.</p>
                <p>It was supposed at one time that the air sacs of birds contributed in some
                    mysterious way to flight, but this is now known to be erroneous. The bats and
                    some of the best-flying birds have no air sacs. Similar remarks are to be made
                    of the heated air imprisoned within the bones of certain birds.<note

                    swimming bladder in some fishes, and the existence of membranous expansions or
                    pseudo-wings in certain animals, such as the flying fish, flying dragon, and
                    flying squirrel. As, however, the animals referred to do <pb break="no"

                    and there sustain themselves for brief intervals, they afford no real support to
                    the theory. The so-called floating animals are well depicted at figs. 5, 6, and
                    7.</p>
                <p>It has been asserted, and with some degree of plausibility, that a fish lighter
                    than the water might swim, and that a bird lighter than the air might fly; it
                    ought, however, to be borne in mind that, in point of fact, a fish lighter than
                    the water could not hold its own if the water were in the least perturbed, and
                    that a bird lighter than the air would be swept into space by even a moderate
                    breeze without hope of return. Weight and power are always associated in living
                    animals, and the fact that living animals are made heavier than the medium they
                    are to navigate may be regarded as a conclusive argument in favour of weight
                    being necessary alike to the swimming of the fish and the flying of the bird. It
                    may be stated once for all that flying creatures are for the most part as heavy,
                    bulk for bulk, as other animals, and that flight in every instance is the
                    product, not of superior levity, but of <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">power</hi> directed upon properly constructed flying organs.</p>
                <p>This fact is important as bearing on the construction of flying machines. It
                    shows that a flying machine need not necessarily be a light, airy structure
                    exposing an immoderate amount of surface. On the contrary, it favours the belief
                    that it should be a compact and moderately heavy and powerful structure, which
                    trusts for elevation and propulsion entirely to its flying appliances—whether
                    actively moving wings, or screws, or aero-planes wedged forward by screws. It
                    should attack and subdue the air, and never give the air an opportunity of
                    attacking or subduing it. It should smite the air intelligently and as a master,
                    and its vigorous well-directed thrusts should in every instance elicit an upward
                    and forward recoil. The flying machine of the future, there is reason to
                    believe, will be a veritable example of “<hi rend="italic">multum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in parvof</hi> It w ill launch itself in the ocean of air, and
                    will extract from that air, by means of its travelling surfaces—however
                    fashioned and however applied—the recoil or resistance necessary to elevate and
                    carry it forward. Extensive inert surfaces indeed are contra-indicated in a
                    flying machine, as they approximate it to the balloon, which, as has been shown,
                    cannot maintain its position in the air if there are air currents. A flying
                    machine which could not face air currents would necessarily be a failure. To
                    obviate this difficulty we are forced to fall back upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >tveight,</hi> or rather the structures and appliances which weight represents.
                    These appliances as indicated should not be unnecessarily expanded, but when
                    expanded they should, wherever practicable, be converted into actively moving
                    flying surfaces, in preference to fixed or inert dead surfaces.</p>
                <p>The question of surface is a very important one in aerostation: it naturally
                    resolves itself into one of active and passive surface. As there are active and
                    passive surfaces in the flying animal, so there are, or should be, active and
                    passive surfaces in the flying machine. Art should follow nature in this matter.
                    The active surfaces in flying creatures are always greatly in excess of the
                    passive ones, from the fact that the former virtually increase in proportion to
                    the spaces through which they are made to travel. Nature not only distinguishes
                    between active and passive surfaces in flying animals, but she strikes a just
                    balance between them, and utilizes both. She regulates the surfaces to the
                    strength and weight of the flying creature and the air currents to which the
                    surfaces are to be exposed and upon which they are to operate. In her
                    calculations she never forgets that her flying subjects are to control and not
                    to be controlled by the air. As a rule she reduces the passive surfaces of the
                    body to a minimum; she likewise reduces as far as possible the actively moving
                    or flying surfaces. While, however, diminishing the surfaces of the flying
                    animal as a whole, she increases as occasion demands the active or wing surfaces
                    by wing movements, and the passive or dead surfaces by the forward motion of the
                    body in progressive flight. She knows that if the wings are driven with
                    sufficient rapidity they practically convert the spaces through which they move
                    into solid bases of support; she also knows that the body in rapid flight
                    derives support from all the air over which it passes. The manner in which the
                    wing surfaces are increased by the wing movements will be readily understood
                    from the accompanying illustrations of the blow fly with its wings at rest and

                    insect and the wings are, as compared with those of fig. 9, trifling. The wind w
                    ould have much less purchase on fig. 8 than on fig. 9, provided the surfaces
                    exposed by the latter were passive or dead surfaces. But they are not dead
                    surfaces: they represent the spaces occupied by the rapidly vibrating wings,
                    which are actively moving flying organs. As, moreover, the wings travel at a
                    much higher speed than any wind that blows, they are superior to and control the
                    wind; they enable the <pb break="no"

                    exposed to a current of air, fig. 9 would be more blown about than fig. 8.</p>
                <p>It is true that in beetles and certain other insects there are the elytra or wing
                    cases—thin, light, horny structures— which in the act of flight are extended
                    horizontally and act as sustainers or gliders. The elytra, however, are
                    comparatively long narrow structures which occupy a position in front of the
                    wings, of which they may be regarded as forming the anterior parts. The elytra
                    are to the delicate wings of some insects what the thick anterior margins are to
                    stronger wings. The elytra, moreover, are not wholly passive structures. They
                    can be moved, and the angles made by their under surfaces with the horizon
                    adjusted. Finally, they are not essential to flight, as flight in the great
                    majority of instances is performed without them. The elytra serve as protectors
                    to the wings when the wings are folded upon the back of the insect, and as they
                    are extended horizontally when the insect is flying they contribute to flight
                    indirectly, in virtue of their being carried forward by the body in motion.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the wings of the insect traverse the air, so as practically
                    to increase the basis of support, raises the whole subject of natural flight. It
                    is necessary, therefore, at this stage to direct the attention of the reader
                    somewhat fully to the subject of flight, as witnessed in the insect, bat, and
                    bird,—a knowledge of natural flight preceding, and being in some senses
                    indispensable to, a knowledge of artificial flight.</p>
                <p>The bodies of flying creatures are, as a rule, very strong, comparatively light,
                    and of an elongated form,—the bodies of birds being specially adapted for
                    cleaving the air. Flying creatures, however, are less remarkable for their
                    strength, shape, and comparative levity than for the size and extraordinarily
                    rapid and complicated movements of their wings. To Professor J. Bell Pettigrew
                    is due the merit of having first satisfactorily analysed those movements, and of
                    having reproduced them by the aid of artificial wings. This physiologist in

                    bird, are screws structurally, and that they act as screws when they are made to
                    vibrate, from the fact that they twist in opposite directions during the down
                    and up strokes. He also explained that all wings act upon a common principle,
                    and that they present oblique, kite-like surfaces to the air, through which they
                    pass much in the same way that an oar passes through water in sculling. He
                    further pointed out that the wings of flying creatures (contrary to received
                    opinions, and as has been already indicated) strike downwards and forwards
                    during the down strokes, and upwards and forwards during the up strokes. Lastly,
                    aud most important of all, he demonstrated that the wings of flying creatures,

                    type="authorial"><p>The sphygmograph, as its name indicates, is a recording
                    instrument. It consists of a smoked cylinder revolving by means of clock work at
                    a known speed, and a style or pen which inscribes its surface by scratching or
                    brushing away the lamp black. The movements to be registered are transferred to
                    the style or pen by one or more levers, and the pen in turn transfers them to
                    the cylinder, where they appear as legible tracings. In registering the
                    movements of the wings,. the tips and margins of the pinions were, by an
                    ingenious modification, employed as the styles or pens. By this arrangement the
                    different parts of the wings were made actually to record their own movements.
                    As will be seen from this account, the figure-of-8 or wave theory of stationary
                    and progressive flight has been made the subject of a rigorous <hi rend="italic"
                    >experimentum crucis.</hi></p></note> The movements in question are now regarded
                    as fundamental, from the fact that they are alike essential to natural and
                    artificial flight.</p>
                <p>The following is Professor Pettigrew’s description of wings and wing movements
                    published in 1867 :—</p>
                <p>“The wings of insects and birds are, as a rule, more or less triangular in shape,
                    the base of the triangle being directed towards the body, its sides anteriorly
                    and posteriorly. They are also conical on section from within outwards and from
                    before backwards, this shape converting the pinions into delicately-graduated
                    instruments balanced with the utmost nicety to satisfy the requirements of the
                    muscular system on the one hand and the resistance and resiliency of the air on
                    the other. While all wings are graduated as explained, innumerable varieties
                    occur as to their general contour, some being falcated or scythe-like, others
                    oblong, others rounded or circular, some lanceolate, and some linear. The wings
                    of insects may consist either of one or two pairs,—the anterior or upper pair,
                    when two are present, being in some instances greatly modified and presenting a
                    corneous condition. They are then known as elytra, from the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">eλυτpoi',</hi> a sheath. Both pairs are composed of a duplicature
                    of the integument, or investing membrane, and are strengthened in various
                    directions by a system of hollow, homy tubes, known to entomologists as the
                    neurae or nervures. These nervures taper towards the extremity of the wing, and
                    are strongest towards its root and anterior margin, where they supply the place
                    of the arm hi bats and birds. The neurae are arranged at the axis of the wing
                    after the manner of a fan or spiral stair,—the anterior one occupying a higher
                    position than that farther back, and so of the others. As this arrangement
                    extends also to the margins, <hi rend="italic">the wings are more or</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">less twisted</hi><hi rend="italic">upon themselves,</hi> and
                    present a certain degree of convexity on their superior or upper surface, and a
                    corresponding concavity on their inferior or under surface,—their free edges
                    supplying those fine curves which act with such efficacy upon the air in
                    obtaining the maximum of resistance and the minimum of displacement. As
                    illustrative examples of the form of wings alluded to, those of the beetle, bee,
                    and fly may be cited,—the pinions in those insects acting as <hi rend="italic"
                    >helices,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">twisted</hi><hi rend="italic">levers,</hi>
                    and elevating weights much greater than the area of the wings would seem to
                    warrant” (figs..10 and 11).</p>
                <p>“To confer on the wings the multiplicity of movements which they require, they
                    are supplied with double hinge or compound joints, which enable them to move not
                    only in an upward, downward, forward, and backward direction, but also at
                    various intermediate degrees of obliquity. An insect with wings thus hinged may,
                    as far as steadiness of body is concerned, be not inaptly compared<pb break="no"

                    universality of motion in one direction ensures comparative fixedness in
                    another.” “All wings obtain their leverage by presenting oblique surfaces to the
                    air, the degree of obliquity gradually increasing in a direction from behind,
                    forwards and downwards, during extension when the sudden or effective stroke is
                    being given, and gradually decreasing in an opposite direction during flexion,
                    or when the wing is being more slowly recovered preparatory to making a second
                    stroke. The effective stroke in insects, and this holds true also of birds, is
                    therefore delivered <hi rend="italic">doumwards and forwards,</hi> and not, as
                    the majority of writers believe, vertically, or even slightly backwards. The
                    wing in the insect is more flattened than in the bird; and advantage is taken on
                    some occasions of this circumstance, particularly in heavy-bodied, small-winged,
                    quick-flying insects, <hi rend="italic">to</hi><hi rend="italic">reverso</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">the pinion moreor less completely during the down and up
                    strokes.”</hi> “This is effected in the following manner. The posterior margin
                    of the wing is made to rotate, during the down stroke, in a direction from above
                    downwards and from behind forwards,—the anterior margin travelling in an
                    opposite direction and reciprocating. The wing may thus be said to attack the
                    air by a <hi rend="italic">screwing movement</hi> from above. During the up or
                    return stroke, on the other hand, the posterior margin rotates in a direction
                    from below upwards and from before backwards, so that by a similar but <hi
                    rend="italic">reverse screwing motion</hi> the pinion attacks the air from
                    beneath.” ...... <hi rend="italic">“A jigure-of-S,</hi> compressed laterally and
                    placed obliquely with its long axis running from left to right of the spectator,
                    represents the movements in question. <hi rend="italic">The down and up
                    strokes,</hi> as will be seen from this account, <hi rend="italic">cross each
                    other,</hi> the wing smiting the air during its descent from above, as in the
                    bird and bat, and during its ascent from below as in the flying fish and boy’s
                    kite” (fig- 12).</p>
                <p>“The figure-of-8 action of the wing explains how an insect or bird may fix itself
                    in the air, the backward and forward reciprocating action of the pinion
                    affording support, but no propulsion. In these instances the backward and
                    forward strokes are made to counterbalance each other. Although the figure-of-8
                    represents with considerable fidelity the twisting of the wing upon its axis
                    during extension and flexion, when the insect is playing its wings before an
                    object, or still better when it is artificially fixed, it is otherwise when the
                    down stroke is added and the insect is fairly on the wing and progressing
                    rapidly. In this case the wing, in virtue of its being carried forward by the
                    body in motion, describes an undulating or spiral course, as shown in fig
                    13.”</p>
                <p>. . . “The down and up strokes are compound movements— the termination of the
                    down stroke embracing the beginning of the up stroke, and the termination of the
                    up stroke including the beginning of the down stroke. This is necessary in order
                    that the down and up strokes may glide into each other in such a manner as to
                    prevent jerking and unnecessary retardation.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This continuity of the down into the up
                    stroke and the converse is greatly facilitated by the elastic ligaments at the
                    root or in the substance of the wing. These assist in elevating, and, when
                    necessary, in flexing and elevating it. They counteract in some measure what may
                    be regarded as the dead weight of the wing, and are especially useful In giving
                    it continuous play.</p></note></p>
                <p>“The wing of the bird, like that of the insect, is concavo-convex, and <hi
                    rend="italic">more or less twisted upon itself</hi> when extended, so that the
                    anterior or thick margin of the pinion presents a different degree of curvature
                    to that of the posterior or thin margin. This twisting is in a great measure
                    owing to the manner in which the bones of the wing are twisted upon themselves,
                    and the spiral nature of their articular surfaces,—the long axes of the joints
                    always intersecting each other at right angles, and the bones of the elbow and
                    wrist making a quarter of a turn or so during extension and the same amount
                    during flexion. As a result of this disposition of the articular surfaces, the
                    wing may be shot out or extended, and retracted or flexed in nearly the same
                    plane, the bones composing the wing rotating on their axes during either
                    movement (fig. 14). The secondary action, or the revolving of the component
                    bones on their own axes, is of the greatest importance in the movements of the
                    wing, as it communicates to the hand and forearm, and consequently to the
                    primary and secondary feathers which they bear, the precise angles necessary for
                    flight. It in fact ensures that the wing, and the curtain or fringe of the wing
                    which the primary and secondary feathers form, shall be screwed into and down
                    upon the wind in extension, and unscrewed or withdrawn from the wind during
                    flexion. The wing of the bird may therefore be compared to a huge gimlet or
                    auger, the axis of the gimlet representing the bones of the wing, the flanges or
                    spiral thread of the gimlet the primary and secondary feathers” (figs.</p>
                <p>15 and 16) “From this description it will be evident that by the mere rotation of
                    the bones of the forearm and hand the maximum and minimum of resistance is
                    secured much in the same way that this object is attained by the alternate
                    dipping and feathering of an oar.” “The wing, both when at rest and when in
                    motion, may not inaptly be compared to the blade of an ordinary screw propeller
                    as employed in navigation. Thus the general outline of the wing corresponds
                    closely with the outline of the propeller (figs. 11, 16, and 18), and the track
                    described by the wing in space <hi rend="italic">is twisted</hi><hi

                    twisted configuration or screw-like form cannot be over-estimated. That this
                    shape is intimately associated with flight is apparent from the fact that the
                    rowing leathers of the wing of the bird are every one of them distinctly spiral
                    in their nature; in fact, one entire rowing feather is
                    equivalent—morphologically and physiologically—to one entire insect wing. In the
                    wing of the martin, where the bones of the pinion are short, and in some
                    respects rudimentary, the primary and secondary feathers are greatly developed,
                    and banked up in such a manner that the wing as a whole presents the same curves

                    bones, muscles, and feathers have attained a maximum development. The
                    conformation of the wing is such that it presents a waved appearance in every
                    direction,—the waves running longitudinally, transversely, and obliquely. The
                    greater portion of the wing may consequently be removed without essentially
                    altering either its form or its functions. This is proved by making sections in
                    various directions, and by finding that in some instances as much as two-thirds
                    of the wing may be lopped off without materially impairing the power of flight”

                    to a solid for the time being, in the same way that the spokes of a wheel in
                    violent motion, as is well understood, more or less completely occupy the space

                <p>.... “The wing of the bat bears considerable resemblance to that of the insect,
                    inasmuch as it consists of a delicate, semi-transparent, continuous membrane,
                    supported in divers directions, particularly towards its anterior margin, by a
                    system of stays or stretchers which confer upon it the degree of rigidity
                    requisite for flight. It is, as a rule, deeply concave on its under or ventral
                    surface, and in this respect resembles the wing of the heavy-bodied birds. The
                    movement of the bat’s wing in extension is a <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> one,
                    the spiral running alternately from below upwards and forwards and from above
                    downwards and backwards. The action of the wing of the bat, and the movements of
                    its component bones, are essentially the same as in the bird” (figs. 17 and

                <p>As will be seen from these figures, the wing during its vibration sweeps through
                    a comparatively very large space. This space, as already explained, is
                    practically a solid basis of support for the wing and for the flying animal. The
                    wing attacks the air in such a manner as virtually to have no slip,—this for two
                    reasons. The wing reverses instantly and acts as a kite during nearly the entire
                    down and up strokes. The angles, moreover, made by the wing with the horizon
                    during the down and up strokes are at no two intervals the same, but (and this
                    is a remarkable circumstance) they are always adapted to the speed at which the
                    wing is travelling for the time being. The increase and decrease in the angles
                    made by the wing as it hastens to and fro are due partly to the resistance
                    offered by the air, and partly to the mechanism and mode of application of the
                    wing to the air. The wing, during its vibrations, rotates upon two separate
                    centres, the tip rotating round the root of the wing as an axis (short axis of
                    wing), the posterior margin rotating around the anterior margin (long axis of
                    wing). The wing is really eccentric in its nature, a remark whiclι applies also
                    to the rowing feathers of the bird’s wing. The compound rotation goes on
                    throughout the entire down and up strokes, and is intimately associated with the
                    power which the wing enjoys of alternately seizing and evading the air.</p>
                <p>The compound rotation of the wing is greatly facilitated by the wing being
                    elastic and flexible. It is this which causes the wing to twist and untwist
                    diagonally on its long axis when it is made to vibrate. The twisting referred to
                    is partly a vital and partly a mechanical act;—that is, it is occasioned in part
                    by the action of the muscles and in part by the greater resistance experienced
                    from the air by the tip and posterior margin of the wing as compared with the
                    root and anterior margin,—the resistance experienced by the tip and posterior
                    margin causing them to reverse always subsequently to the root and anterior
                    margin, which has the effect of throwing the anterior and posterior margins of
                    the wing into figure-of-8 curves, as shown at figs. 9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20, and
                    21.</p>
                <p>The compound rotation of the wing, as seen in the bird, is represented in fig.
                    24.</p>
                <p>Not the least curious feature of the wing movements is the remarkable power which
                    the wing possesses of making and utilizing its own currents. Thus, when the wing
                    descends it draws after it a strong current, which, being met by the wing during
                    its ascent, greatly increases the efficacy of the up stroke. Similarly and
                    conversely when the wing ascends, it creates an upward current, which, being met
                    by the wing when it descends, powerfully contributes to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0325-0314"/> efficiency of the down stroke. This statement can
                    be readily verified by experiment both with natural and artificial wings.
                    Neither the up nor the down strokes are complete in themselves.</p>
                <p>The wing to act efficiently must be driven at a certain speed, and in such a
                    manner that the down and up strokes shall glide into each other. It is only in
                    this way that the air can be made to pulsate, and that the rhythm of the wing
                    and the air waves can be made to correspond. The air must be seized and let go
                    in a certain order and at a certain speed to extract a maximum recoil. The
                    rapidity of the wing movements is regulated by the size of the wing, small wings
                    being driven ata very much higher speed than larger ones. The different parts of
                    the wing, moreover, are made to travel at different degrees of velocity—the tip
                    and posterior margin of the wing always rushing through a much greater space, in
                    a given time, than the root and anterior margin.</p>
                <p>The rapidity of travel of the insect wing is in some cases enormous. The wasp,
                    for instance, is said to ply its wings at the rate of 110, and the common house
                    fly at the rate of 330 beats per second. Quick as are the vibrations of natural
                    wings, the speed of certain parts of the wing is amazingly increased. Wings as a
                    rule are long and narrow. As a consequence, a comparatively slow and very
                    limited movement at the root confers great range and immense speed at the tip,
                    the speed of each portion of the wing increasing as the root of the wing is
                    receded from. This is explained on a principle well understood in mechanics,
                    viz., that when a wing or rod hinged at one end is made to move in a circle, the
                    tip or free end of the wing or rod describes a much wider circle in a given time
                    than a portion of the wing or rod nearer the hinge (fig. 25).</p>
                <p>One naturally inquires why the high speed of wings, and why the progressive
                    increase of speed at their tips and posterior margins î The answer is not far to
                    seek. If the wingg were not driven at a high speed, and if they were not
                    eccentrics made to revolve upon two separate axes, they would of necessity be
                    large cumbrous structures; but large heavy wings would be difficult to work, and
                    what is worse, they would (if too large), instead of controlling the air, be
                    controlled by it, and so cease to be flying organs.</p>
                <p>There is, however, another reason why wings should be made to vibrate at high
                    speeds. The air, as explained, is a very light, thin, elastic medium, which
                    yields on the slightest pressure, and unless the wings attacked it with great
                    violence the necessary recoil or resistance could not be obtained. The
                    atmosphere, because of its great tenuity, mobility, and comparative
                    imponderability, presents little resistance to bodies passing through it at low
                    velocities. If, however, the speed be greatly accelerated, the action of even an
                    ordinary cane is sufficient to elicit a recoil. This comes of the action and
                    reaction of matter, the resistance experienced varying according to the density
                    of the atmosphere and the shape, extent, and velocity of the body acting upon
                    it. While, therefore, scarcely any impediment is offered to the progress of an
                    animal in motion in the air, it is often exceedingly difficult to compress the
                    air with sufficient rapidity and energy to convert it into a suitable fulcrum
                    for securing the onward impetus. This arises from the fact that bodies moving in
                    air experience a <hi rend="italic">minimum, of resistance</hi> and occasion a
                    <hi rend="italic">maximum of displacement.</hi> Another and very obvious
                    difficulty is traceable to the great disparity in the weight of air as compared
                    with any known solid, and the consequent want of buoying or sustaining power
                    which that disparity involves. If we compare air with water we find it is nearly
                    1000 times lighter. To meet these peculiarities the insect, bat, and bird are
                    furnished with extensive flying surfaces in the shape of wings, which they apply
                    with singular velocity and power to the air, as levers of the third order. In
                    this form of lever, as the reader is aware, the power is applied between the
                    fulcrum and the weight to be raised. The power is represented by the wing, the
                    fulcrum by the air, and the weight by the body of the flying animal. Although
                    the third order of lever is particularly inefficient when the fulcrum is rigid
                    and immobile, it possesses singular advantages when these conditions are
                    reversed, that is, when the fulcrum, as happens with the air, is <hi
                    rend="italic">elastic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yielding.</hi> In this instance
                    a very slight movement at the root of the pinion, or that end of the lever
                    directed towards the body, is followed by an immense sweep of the extremity of
                    the wing, where its elevating and propelling power is greatest,— this
                    arrangement ensuring that the large quantity of air necessary for propulsion and
                    support shall be compressed under the most favourable conditions.</p>
                <p>In this process the weight of the body performs an important part, by acting upon
                    the inclined planes formed by the wings in the plane of progression, The power
                    and the weight may thus be said to reciprocate, the two sitting as it were side
                    by side and blending their peculiar influences to produce a common result, as
                    indicated at fig. 26.</p>

                <p>When the wings descend they elevate the body, the wings being active and the body
                    passive; when the body descends it contributes to the elevation of the
                    wings,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The other forces
                    which assist in elevating the wings are—(a) the elevator muscles of the wings,
                    (δ) the elastic properties of the wings, and (c) the reaction of the compressed
                    air on the under surfaces of the wings.</p></note> the body being active and-the
                    wings passive. It is in this way that weight forms a factor in flight, the wings
                    and the weight of the body reciprocating and mutually assisting and relieving
                    each other. This is an argument for employing four wings in artificial
                    flight,—the wings being so arranged that the two which are up shall always by
                    their fall mechanically elevate the two which are down. Such an arrangement is
                    calculated greatly to conserve the driving power, and, as a consequence, to
                    reduce the weight.</p>
                <p>That the weight of the body plays an important part in the production of flight
                    may be proved by a very simple experiment. If two quill feathers are fixed in an
                    ordinary cork, and so arranged that they expand and arch above it, it is found
                    that if the apparatus be dropped from a vertical height of three yards it does
                    not fall vertically downwards, but downwards and <hi rend="italic">forwards</hi>
                    in a curve, the forward travel amounting in some instances to a yard and a half.
                    Here the cork, in falling, acts upon the feathers (which are to all intents and
                    purposes wings), and these in turn act upon the air, in such a manner as to
                    produce a horizontal transference. The apparatus which formed the subject of the
                    present experiment is represented at fig. 27.</p>
                <p>In order to utilize the air as a means of transit, the body in motion, whether it
                    moves in virtue of the life it possesses, or because of a force superadded, must
                    be heavier than air. It must tread and rise upon the air as a swimmer upon the
                    water, or as a kite upon the wind. This is necessary for the simple reason that
                    the body must be active, the air passive. The flying body must act against
                    gravitation, and elevate and carry itself forward at the expense of the air and
                    of the force which resides in it, whatever that may be. If it were otherwise—if
                    it were rescued from the law of gravitation on the one hand, and bereft of
                    independent movement on the other, it would float about uncontrolled and
                    uncontrollable like an ordinary balloon.</p>
                <p>In flight one of two things is necessary. Either the wings must attack the air
                    with great violence, or the air in rapid motion must attack the wings: either
                    suffices. If a bird attempts to fly in a calm, the wings must be made to smite
                    the air after the manner of a boy’s kite with great vigour and at a high speed.
                    In this case the wings fly the bird. If, however, the bird is fairly launched in
                    space and a stiff breeze is blowing, all that is required in many instances is
                    to extend the wings at a slight upward angle to the horizon so that the under
                    parts of the wings present kite-like surfaces. Under these circumstances the
                    rapidly moving air flies the bird. The flight of the albatross supplies the
                    necessary illustration. If by any chance this magnificent bird alights upon the
                    sea he must flap and beat the water and air with his wings with tremendous
                    energy until he gets fairly launched. This done he extends his enormous
                    pinions<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The wings of the

                    along, seldom deigning to flap his wings, the breeze doing the work for him. A
                    familiar illustration of the same principle may be witnessed any day when
                    children are engaged in their favourite pastime of kite-flying. If two boys
                    attempt to fly a kite in a calm, the one must hold up the kite and let go when
                    the other runs. In this case the under surface of the kite is made to strike the
                    still air. If, however, a stiff autumn breeze be blowing, it suffices if the boy
                    who formerly ran when the kite was let go stands still. In this case the air in
                    rapid motion strikes the under surface of the kite and forces it up. The string
                    and the hand are to the kite what the weight of the flying creature is to the
                    inclined planes formed by its wings.</p>
                <p>The area of the insect, bird, and bat, when the wings are fully expanded, is
                    greater than that of any other class of animals, their weight being
                    proportionally less. As already stated, however, it ought never to be forgotten
                    that even the lightest insect, bird, or bat is vastly heavier than the air, and
                    that no fixed relation exists between the weight of body and expanse of wing in
                    any of the orders. We have thus light-bodied and large-winged insects and birds,
                    as the butterfly and heron; and others with heavy bodies and small wings, as the
                    beetle and partridge. Similar remarks are to be made of bats. Those apparent
                    inconsistencies in the dimensions of the body and wings are readily explained by
                    the greater muscular development of the heavy-bodied, small-winged insects,
                    birds, and bats, and the increased power and rapidity with which the wings in
                    them are made to oscillate. This is of the utmost importance in the science of
                    aerostation, as showing that flight may be attained by a heavy powerful animal
                    with comparatively small wings, as well as by a lighter one with greatly
                    enlarged wings. While, therefore, there is apparently no correspondence between
                    the area of the wing and the animal to be raised, there is, unless in the case
                    of sailing insects, birds, and bats, an unvarying relation as to the weight and
                    number of oscillations; so that the problem of flight would seem to resolve
                    itself into one of weight, power, velocity, and small surfaces, <hi
                    rend="italic">versus</hi> buoyancy, debility, diminished speed, and extensive
                    surfaces,— weight in either case being a <hi rend="italic">sine qua
                    non.</hi></p>
                <p>That no fixed relation exists between the area of the wings and the size and
                    weight of the body is evident on comparing the dimensions of the wings and
                    bodies of the several orders of insects, bats, and birds. If such comparison be
                    made, it will be found that the pinions in some instances diminish while the
                    bodies increase, and the converse. No practical good can therefore accrue to
                    aerostation from elaborate measurements of the wings and body of any flying
                    thing; neither can any rule be laid down as to the extent of surface required
                    for sustaining a given weight in the air. The statements here advanced are borne
                    out by the fact that the wings of insects, bats, and birds may be materially
                    reduced without impairing their powers of flight. In such cases the speed with
                    which the wings are driven is increased in the direct ratio of the mutilation.
                    The inference to be deduced from the foregoing is plainly this, that even in
                    large-bodied, small-winged insects and birds the wing-surface is greatly in
                    excess, the surplus wing area supplying that degree of elevating and sustaining
                    power which is necessary to prevent undue exertion on the part of the volant
                    animal. In this we have a partial explanation of the buoyancy of insects, and
                    the great lifting power possessed by bats and birds,—the bats carrying their
                    young without inconvenience, the birds <pb break="no"

                <p>While, as explained, no definite relation exists between the weight of a flying
                    animal and the size of its flying surfaces, there being, as stated, heavy-bodied
                    and smallwinged insects, bats, and birds, and the converse, and while, as has
                    been shown, flight is possible within a wide range, the wings being, as a rule,
                    in excess of what are required for the purposes of flight,—still it appears from
                    the researches of Μ. de Lucy that there is a general law, to the effect that the
                    larger the volant animal the smaller by comparison are its flying surfaces. The
                    existence of such a law is very encouraging so far as artificial flight is
                    concerned, for it shows that the flying surfaces of a large, heavy, powerful
                    flying machine will be comparatively small, and consequently comparatively
                    compact and strong. This is a point of very considerable importance, as the
                    object desiderated in a flying machine is elevating capacity.</p>

                <p>“It is easy, by the aid of this table, to follow the order, always decreasing, of
                    the surfaces, in proportion as the winged animal increases in size and weight.
                    Thus, in comparing the insects with one another, we find that the gnat, which
                    weighs 460 times less than the stag-beetle, has 14 times more of surface. The
                    lady-bird weighs 150 times less than the stag-beetle, and possesses 5 times more
                    of surface, &amp;c. It is the same with the birds. The sparrow weighs about 10
                    times less than the pigeon, and has twice as much surface. The pigeon weighs
                    about 8 times less than the stork, and has twice as much surface. The sparrow
                    weighs 339 times less than the Australian crane, and possesses 7 times more
                    surface, &amp;c. If now we compare the insects and the birds, the gradation will
                    become even much more striking. The gnat, for example, weighs 97,000 times less
                    than the pigeon, and )ιas 40 times more surface; it weighs three millions of
                    times less than the crane of Australia, and possesses 140 times more of surface
                    than this latter, the weight of which is about 9 kilogrammes 500 grammes (25 lb
                    5 oz. 9 dwt. troy, 20 lb 15 oz. 2∣ dr. avoirdupois).</p>
                <p>The Australian crane, the heaviest bird weighed, is that which has the smallest
                    amount of surface, for, referred to the kilogramme, it does not give us a
                    surface of more than 899 square centimetres (13£&gt; square inches), that is to
                    say, about an eleventh part of a square metre. But every one knows that these
                    grallatorial animals are excellent birds of flight. Of all travelling birds they
                    undertake th© longest and most remote journeys. They are, in addition, the eagle
                    excepted, the birds which elevate themselves the highest, and the flight of
                    which is the longest maintained.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Insects, in reference to the subject of Aerial Locomotion,</hi> by Μ. de Lucy,
                    Paris.</p></note></p>
                <p>The way in which the natural wing rises and falls on the air, and reciprocates
                    with the body of the flying creature, has a very obvious bearing upon artificial
                    flight. In natural flight the body of the flying creature falls slightly forward
                    in a curve when the wing ascends, and is slightly elevated in a curve when the
                    wing descends. The wing and body are consequently always playing at cross
                    purposes, the wing rising when the body is falling and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The alternate rise and fall of the body and wing of the bird are
                    well seen when contemplating the flight of the gull from the stem of a
                    steamboat, as the bird is following in the wake of the vessel. The complementary
                    movements referred to are indicated at fig. 29, where the continuous waved line
                    represents the trajectory made by the wing, and the dotted waved line that made
                    by the body. As will be seen from this figure, <hi rend="italic">the wing
                    advances both when it rises and when it falls.</hi> It is a condition of natural
                    wings, and of artificial wings constructed on the principle of living wings,
                    that when forcibly elevated or depressed, even in a strictly vertical direction,
                    they inevitably dart forward. If, for instance, the wing is suddenly depressed
                    in a vertical direction, as at <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> of fig. 29, it at once
                    darts downwards and forwards (see continuous line of figure) to c, thus
                    converting the vertical down stroke into a <hi rend="italic">down, oblique,
                    forward stroke.</hi> If, again, the wing be suddenly elevated in a strictly
                    vertical direction, as at <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi> the wing as certainly
                    darts upwards and forwards in a curve to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> thus
                    converting the vertical up strokes into an <hi rend="italic">upward, oblique,
                    forward stroke.</hi> The same thing happens when the wing is depressed from <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> to <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and elevated from <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> to <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> the wſlng describing a <hi
                    rend="italic">waved track</hi> as at <hi rend="italic">e g, g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i.</hi></p>
                <p>There are good reasons why the wings should always be in advance of the body. A
                    bird when flying is a body in motion; but a body in motion tends to fall not
                    vertically downwards, but <hi rend="italic">downwards and forwards.</hi> The
                    wings consequently must be in advance of the body of the bird if they are to
                    prevent the bird from falling <hi rend="italic">downwards and forwards.</hi> If
                    the wings were to strike backwards in aerial flight, the bird would turn a
                    forward somersault.</p>
                <p>That the wings invariably strike downwards and forwards in aerial flight is
                    proved alike by observation and experiment. If any one watches a bird rising
                    from the ground or the water, he cannot fail to perceive that the head and body
                    are slightly tilted upwards, and that the wdngs are made to descend with great
                    vigour in a downward and forward direction. The dead natural wing and a properly
                    constructed artificial wing act in precisely the same way. If the wing of a
                    gannet, just shot, be removed and made <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0328-0317"/> to flap in what the operator believes to be a
                    strictly vertical downward direction, the tip of the wing, in spite of him, will
                    dart forwards between two and three feet—the amount of forward movement being
                    regulated by the rapidity of the down stroke. This is a very striking
                    experiment. The same thing happens with a properly constructed artificial wing.
                    The down stroke with the artificial as with the natural wing is invariably
                    converted into an oblique, downward, and forward stroke. No one ever saw a bird
                    in the air flapping its wings towards its tail. The old idea was that the wings
                    <hi rend="italic">pushed</hi> the body of the bird in an upward and forward
                    direction; in reality the wings do not push but <hi rend="italic">pull,</hi> and
                    in order to pull they must always be in advance of the body to be flown. If the
                    wings did not themselves fly <hi rend="italic">forward,</hi> they could not
                    possibly cause the body of the bird to fly forward. It is the wings which fly
                    the bird, and not the converse.</p>
                <p>It only remains to be stated that the wing acts as a true kite, during both down
                    and up strokes, its under concave or biting surface, in virtue of the forward
                    travel communicated to it by the body of the flying creature, being closely
                    applied to the air, during both its ascent and its descent. This explains how
                    the wing furnishes a persistent buoyancy alike when it rises and when it falls
                    (fig. 30).</p>
                <p>The natural kite formed by the wing differs from the artificial kite only in
                    this, that the former is capable of being moved in all its parts, and is more or
                    less flexible and elastic, whereas the latter is comparatively rigid. The
                    flexibility and elasticity of the kite formed by the natural wing are rendered
                    necessary by the fact that the wing, as already stated, is practically hinged at
                    its root and along its anterior margin, an arrangement which necessitates its
                    several parts travelling at different degrees of speed, in proportion as they
                    are removed from the axes of rotation. Thus the tip travels at a higher speed
                    than the root, and the posterior margin than the anterior margin. This begets a
                    <hi rend="italic">twisting diagonal movement</hi> of the wing on its long axis,
                    which, but for the elasticity referred to, would break the wing into fragments.
                    The elasticity contributes also to the continuous play of the wing, and insures
                    that no two parts of it shall reverse at exactly the same instant. If the wing
                    was inelastic, every part of it would reverse at precisely the same moment, and
                    its vibration would be characterized by pauses or dead points at the end of the
                    down and up strokes which would be fatal to it as a flying organ. The elastic
                    properties of the wing are absolutely essential, when the mechanism and
                    movements of the pinion are taken into account. A rigid wing can never be an
                    effective flying instrument.</p>
                <p>The kite-like surfaces referred to in natural flight are those upon which the
                    constructors of flying machines very properly ground their hopes of ultimate
                    success. These surfaces may be conferred on artificial wings, aeroplanes, aerial
                    screws, or similar structures; and these structures, if we may judge from what
                    we find in nature, <hi rend="italic">should be of moderate size and
                    elastic.</hi> The power of the flying organs will be increased if they are
                    driven at a comparatively high speed, and particularly if they are made to
                    reverse and reciprocate, as in this case they will practically create the
                    currents upon which they are destined to rise aud advance. The angles made by
                    the kite-like surfaces with the horizon, should vary according to circumstances.
                    They should be small when the speed is high, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> This, as stated, is true of natural wings. It should also be true of
                    artificial wings and their analogues. There is no escaping from natural laws. A
                    knowledge of natural laws alone will enable us to construct (it is to be hoped
                    in the immediate future) the much-desired flying machine.</p>
                <p>Having explained as far as space would permit how water differs from air, how the
                    sailing ship differs from the balloon, and how the balloon differs from the
                    flying creature and flying machine constructed on the living type, and having
                    further explained the peculiarities of wings and wing movements as witnessed in
                    natural flight, we are now in a position to enter upon a consideration of
                    artificial wings and wing movements, and of artificial flight and flying
                    machines.</p>
                <p>We begin with artificial wings. The first properly authenticated account of an
                    artificial wing was given by Borelli in 1670. This author, distinguished alike
                    as a physiologist, mathematician, and mechanician, describes and figures a bird
                    with artificial wings, each of which consists of <hi rend="italic">a rigid rod
                    in front and flexible feathers behind.</hi> The w ings are represented as
                    striking <hi rend="italic">vertically downwards,</hi> as the annexed duplicate
                    of Borelli’s figure shows (fig. 31).</p>
                <p>Borelli was of opinion that flight resulted from the application of an inclined
                    plane, which beats the air, and which has a wedge action. He, in fact,
                    endeavours to prove that a bird wedges itself forward upon the air by the
                    perpendicular vibration of its wings, the wings during their action forming a
                    wedge, the base of which (c <hi rend="italic">b e)</hi> is directed towards the
                    head of the bird, the apex (α∕) being directed towards the tail (J). In the
                    196th proposition of his work (De <hi rend="italic">moüi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Animalium,</hi> Leyden, 1685) he states that—</p>
                <p>“If the expanded wings of a bird suspended in the air shall strike the
                    undisturbed air beneath it with a motion <hi rend="italic">perpendicular to the
                    horizon,</hi> the bird will fly with <hi rend="italic">a transverse motion</hi>
                    in a plane parallel with the horizon.” “If,” he adds, “thewings of the bird be
                    expanded, and the under surfaces of the wings be struck by the air <hi
                    rend="italic">ascending perpendicularly to the horizon</hi> with such a force as
                    shall prevent the bird gliding downwards <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> with a
                    tendency to glide downwards) from falling,it will be urged in a horizontal
                    direction.” The same argument is re-stated in different words as under :— “If
                    the air under the wings be struck by the flexible portions of the wings <hi
                    rend="italic">{flabella,</hi> literally fly flaps or small fans) with a motion
                    perpendicular to the horizon, the sails (reZα)and flexible portions of the wings
                    <hi rend="italic">(flabella)</hi> will yield in an upward direction and form a
                    wedge, the point of which is directed towards the tail. Whether, therefore, the
                    air strikes the wings from below, or the wings strike the air from above, the
                    result is the same,—the posterior or flexible margins of the wings <hi
                    rend="italic">yield in an upward direction,</hi> and in so doing urge the bird
                    in <hi rend="italic">a horizontal direction.”</hi></p>
                <p>There are three points in Borelli’s argument to which it is necessary to draw
                    attention :—(1) the direction of the down stroke: it is stated to be <hi
                    rend="italic">vertically downwards;</hi> (2) the construction of the anterior
                    margin of the wing: it is stated to consist of <hi rend="italic">a rigid
                    rod·,</hi> (3) the function delegated to the posterior margin of the wing: it is
                    said <hi rend="italic">to yield in an upward direction</hi> during the down
                    stroke.</p>
                <p>With regard to the first point. It is incorrect to say the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n329/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0329-0318"/> wing strikes <hi rend="italic">vertically
                    downwards,</hi> for, as already explained, the body of a flying bird is a body
                    in motion; but as a body in motion tends to fall downwards and forwards, the
                    wing must strike <hi rend="italic">downwards</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >forwards</hi> in order effectually to prevent its fall. Moreover, in point of
                    fact, all natural wings and all artificial wings constructed on the natural type
                    invariably strike <hi rend="italic">downwards and forwards.</hi></p>
                <p>With regard to the second point, viz., the supposed <hi rend="italic">rigidity
                    of</hi> the anterior margin of the wing, it is only necessary to examine the
                    anterior margins of natural wings to be convinced that they are in every case
                    <hi rend="italic">flexible and elastic.</hi> Similar remarks apply to properly
                    constructed artificial wings. If the anterior margins of natural and artificial
                    wings were rigid, it would be impossible to make them vibrate smoothly and
                    continuously. This is a matter of experiment. If a rigid rod, or a wing with a
                    rigid anterior margin, be made to vibrate, the vibration is characterized by an
                    unequal jerky motion, which contrasts strangely with the smooth, steady, fanning
                    movement peculiar to natural wings.</p>
                <p>As to the third point, viz., <hi rend="italic">the upward bending of the
                    posterior margin of the wing during the down stroke,</hi> it is necessary to
                    remark that the statement is true if it means a slight upward bending, but that
                    it is untrue if it means an extensive upward bending.</p>
                <p>Borelli does not state the amount of upward bending, but one of his followers,
                    Professor E. J. Marey, maintains that during the down stroke the wing yields
                    until its under surface makes <hi rend="italic">a backward angle with the
                    horizon of</hi> 45°. Marey further states that during the up stroke the wing
                    yields to a corresponding extent in an opposite direction— the posterior margin
                    of the wing, according to him, passing through an angle of 90°, plus or minus,
                    according to circumstances, every time the wing rises and falls.</p>
                <p>That the posterior margin of the wing yields to a slight extent during both the
                    down and up strokes will readily be admitted, alike because of the very delicate
                    and highly elastic properties of the posterior margins of wings', and because of
                    the comparatively great force employed in their propulsion; but that they do not
                    yield to the extent stated by Professor Marey is a matter of absolute certainty.
                    This admits of direct proof. If any one watches the horizontal or upward flight
                    of a large bird he will observe that the posterior or flexible margin of the
                    wing never rises during the down stroke to a perceptible extent, so that the
                    under surface of the wing never looks backwards. On the contrary, he will
                    perceive that the under surface of the wing (during the down stroke) invariably
                    looks forwards and forms a true kite with the horizon, the angles made by the
                    kite varying at every part of the down stroke, as shown more particularly at c
                    <hi rend="italic">d efg,</hi><hi rend="italic">ijklmot</hi> fig. 30, p. 317.</p>
                <p>The authors who have adopted Borelli’s plan of artificial wing, and who have
                    endorsed his mechanical views of the wing’s action most fully, are Chabrier,
                    Straus-Durkheim, Girard, and Marey. Borelli’s artificial wing, it will be
                    remembered, consists of a <hi rend="italic">rigid rod</hi> in front and a <hi
                    rend="italic">flexible sail</hi> behind. It is also made to strike <hi
                    rend="italic">vertically</hi><hi rend="italic">doιvnwards.</hi> According to
                    Chabrier, the wing has only one period of activity. He believes that if the wing
                    be suddenly lowered by the depressor muscles, it is elevated solely by the
                    reaction of the air. There is one unanswerable objection to this theory: the
                    bats and birds, and some if not all the insects, have distinct elevator muscles,
                    and can elevate their wings at pleasure when not flying and when consequently
                    the reaction of the air is not elicited. Straus-Durkheim agrees with Borelli
                    both as to the natural and the artificial wing. Durkheim is of opinion that the
                    insect abstracts from the air by means of the <hi rend="italic">indined
                    plane</hi> a component force <hi rend="italic">{composant)</hi> which it employs
                    to <hi rend="italic">support</hi> and <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> itself. In
                    his theology of nature he describes a schematic wing as consisting of a <hi
                    rend="italic">rigid ribbing</hi> in front, and a <hi rend="italic">flexible
                    sail</hi> behind. A membrane so constructed will, according to him, be fit for
                    flight. It will suffice if such a sail elevates and lowers itself successively.
                    It will of its own accord dispose itself as an inclined plane, and <hi
                    rend="italic">receiving obliquely the reaction of the air,</hi> it transfers
                    into <hi rend="italic">tractile force</hi> a part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertical impulsion it has received.</hi> These two parts of the wing, moreover,
                    are equally indispensable to each other.</p>
                <p>Marey repeats Borelli and Durckheim with very trifling modifications, so late as
                    1869.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    the one composed of a <hi rend="italic">rigid rod</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sail—</hi> the rod representing <hi rend="italic">the stiff anterior
                    margin</hi> of the wing; the sail, which is made of paper bordered with card
                    board, <hi rend="italic">the flexible posterior margin.</hi> The other wing
                    consists of a <hi rend="italic">rigid</hi><hi rend="italic">nervure</hi> in
                    front and behind of thin parchment which supports fine rods of steel. He states
                    that, if the wing only elevates and depresses itself, “the <hi rend="italic"
                    >resistance of the air</hi> is sufficient to produce all the other movements. In
                    effect (according to Marey) the wing of an insect has not the power of equal
                    resistance in every part. On the anterior margin the extended nervures make it
                    <hi rend="italic">rigid,</hi> while behind it is fine and jfeα7√e. During the
                    vigorous depression of the wing, the nervure has the power of <hi rend="italic"
                    >remaining rigid,</hi> whereas the flexible portion, <hi rend="italic">being
                    pushed in an upward direction</hi> on account of the resistance it experiences
                    from the air, assumes an oblique position which causes <hi rend="italic">the
                    upper surface of the wing to look forwards.”</hi> The reverse of this, in
                    Marey’s opinion, takes place during the elevation of the wing—the resistance of
                    the air from above causing <hi rend="italic">the upper surface of the wing to
                    look backwards.</hi>. . . “At first,” he says, “the plane of the wing is
                    parallel with the body of the animal. It lowers itself— <hi rend="italic">the
                    front part of the wing strongly resists,</hi> the sail which follows it being

                    minus</hi> according to circumstances The wing continues its move ments of
                    depression inclined to the horizon; but the impulse of the air, which continues
                    its effect, and naturally acts upon the surface which it strikes, has the power
                    of resolving itself into two forces, <hi rend="italic">a vertical</hi> and a <hi

                    observed, reproduces Borelli’s artificial wing, and even his text, at a distance
                    of nearly two centuries.</p>
                <p>The artificial wing recommended by Professor Pettigrew is a more exact imitation
                    of nature than either of the foregoing. It is of a more or less triangular form,
                    thick at the root and anterior margin, and thin at the tip and posterior margin.
                    <hi rend="italic">No part of it is rigid.</hi> It is on the contrary highly
                    elastic and flexible throughout. It is furnished with springs at its root to
                    contribute to its continued play, and is applied to the air by a direct piston
                    action in such a way that it descends in a downward and forward direction during
                    the down stroke, and ascends in an upward and forward direction during the up
                    stroke. It elevates and propels both when it rises and falls. <hi rend="italic"
                    >It, moreover, twists and untwists during its action and describes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">figure-of-⅛</hi><hi rend="italic">and waved tracks in space,
                    precisely as the natural wing does.</hi> The twisting is most marked at the tip
                    and posterior margin, particularly that half of the posterior margin next the
                    tip. The wing when in action may be divided into two portions by a line running
                    diagonally between the tip of the wing anteriorly and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0330-0319"/> root of the wing posteriorly. The tip and
                    posterior parts of the wing are more active than the root and anterior parts,
                    from the fact that the tip and posterior parts (the wing is an eccentric) always
                    travel through greater spaces, in a given time, than the root and anterior
                    parts.</p>
                <p>The wing is so constructed that the posterior margin yields freely in a downward
                    direction during the up stroke, while it yields comparatively little in an
                    upward direction during the down stroke; and this is a distinguishing feature,
                    as the wing is thus made to fold and elude the air more or less completely
                    during the up stroke, whereas it is made to expand and seize the air with
                    avidity during the down stroke. The oblique line referred to as running
                    diagonally across the wing virtually divides the wing into an active and a
                    passive part, the former elevating and propelling, the latter sustaining.</p>
                <p>It is not possible to determine with exactitude the precise function discharged
                    by each part of the wing, but experiment tends to show that the tip of the wing
                    <hi rend="italic">elevates,</hi> the posterior margin <hi rend="italic"
                    >propels,</hi> and the root <hi rend="italic">sustains.</hi></p>
                <p>The wing—and this is important—is driven by a direct piston action with an
                    irregular hammer-like movement, the pinion having communicated to it a smart
                    click at the beginning of every down stroke—the up stroke being more uniform.
                    The following is the arrangement (fig. 32). If the artificial wing here
                    represented (fig. 32) be compared with the natural wing as depicted at fig. 33,
                    it will be seen that there is nothing in the one which is not virtually
                    reproduced in the other. In addition to the foregoing,</p>
                <p>Professor Pettigrew recommends a double elastic wing to be applied to the air
                    like a steam-hammer, by being fixed to the head of the piston. This wing, like
                    the single wing described, twists and untwists as it rises and falls, and
                    possesses all the characteristics of the natural wing (fig.</p>
                <p>He also recommends an <hi rend="italic">elastic aerial screw</hi> consisting of
                    two blades, which taper and become thinner towards the tips and posterior
                    margins. When the screw is made to rotate, the blades, because of their
                    elasticity, assume a great variety of angles, the angles being least where the
                    speed of the blades is greatest and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The pitch
                    of the blades is thus regulated by the speed attained (fig. 35).</p>
                <p>The peculiarity of Professor Pettigrew’s wings and screws consists in their <hi
                    rend="italic">elasticity,</hi> their <hi rend="italic">twisting action,</hi> and
                    their <hi rend="italic">great comparative length and narrowness.</hi> They offer
                    little resistance to the air when they are at rest, and when in motion the speed
                    with which they are driven is such as to ensure that the comparatively large
                    spaces through which they travel shall practically be converted into solid bases
                    of support.</p>
                <p>Since Professor Pettigrew enunciated his views (1867) as to the screw
                    configuration and elastic properties of natural wings, and more especially since

                <p>Μ. Pénaud’s experiments are alike interesting and instructive. He constructed
                    models to fly by three different methods :—(a) by means of screws acting
                    vertically upwards; (δ) by aero-planes propelled horizontally by screws; and (c)
                    by wings which flapped in an upward and downward direction. An account of his
                    hélicoptère or screw model appears in the <hi rend="italic">Aeronaut</hi> for
                    January 1872, but before giving a description of it, it may be well to state
                    very <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n331/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0331-0320"/> briefly what is known regarding the history of
                    the screw as applied to the air.</p>
                <p>The first suggestion on this subject was given by Paucton in 1768. This author,
                    in his treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Théorie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Vis</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Archimède,</hi> describes a
                    machine provided with two screws which he calls a “ptérophores.” In 1796 Sir</p>
                <p>“As it may be an amusement to some of your readers to see a machine rise in the
                    air by mechanical means, I will conclude my present communication by describing
                    an instrument of this kind, which any one can construct at the expense of ten
                    minutes’ labour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> fig. 36, are two corks,
                    into each of which are inserted four wing feathers from any bird, so as to be
                    slightly inclined like the sails of a windmill, but in opposite directions in
                    each set. A round shaft is fixed in the cork <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which
                    ends in a sharp point. At the upper part of the cork <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    fixed a whalebone bow, having a small pivot hole in its centre to receive the
                    point of the shaft. The bow is then to be strung equally on each side to the
                    upper portion of the shaft, and the little machine is completed. Wind up the
                    string by turning the flyers different ways, so that the spring of the bow may
                    unwind them with their anterior edges ascending; then place the cork with the
                    bow attached to it upon a table, and with a finger on the upper cork press
                    strong enough to prevent the string from unwinding, and, taking it away
                    suddenly, the instrument will rise to the ceiling.”</p>
                <p>Cayley’s screws were peculiar, inasmuch as they were superimposed and rotated in
                    opposite directions. He estimated that if the area of the screws was increased
                    to 200 square feet, and moved by a man, they would elevate him. His interesting
                    experiment is described at length, and the apparatus figured, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Nicolson</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal,</hi> 1809, p. 172.</p>
                <p>Other experimenters followed Cayley at moderate intervals :—Deghen in 1816,
                    Ottoris Sarti in 1823, and Dubo-chet in 1834. These inventors all constructed
                    flying models on the vertical screw principle. In 1842 Mr Philips succeeded in
                    elevating a steam model by the aid of revolving fans, which flew across two
                    fields after having attained a great altitude; and in 1859 Mr Bright took out a
                    patent for a machine to be sustained by vertical screws, the model of which is
                    to be seen at the patent museum, Kensington, London. In 1863 the subject of
                    aviation by vertical screws received a fresh impulse from the experiments of MM.
                    Ponton d’Amécourt, De la Landelle, and Nadar, who exhibited models driven by
                    clock-work springs, which ascended with graduated weights a distance of from 10
                    to 12 feet. These models were so fragile that they usually broke in coming in
                    contact with the ground in their descent. Their flight, moreover, was
                    unsatisfactory, from the fact that it only lasted a few seconds.</p>
                <p>Stimulated by the success of his spring models, Μ. Ponton d’Amécourt had a small
                    steam model constructed. This model, which was shown at the exhibition of tho
                    Aeronautical Society of Great Britain at the Crystal Palace in 1868, consisted
                    of two superposed screws propelled by an engine, the steam for which was
                    generated (for lightness) in an aluminium boiler. This steam model proved a
                    failure, inasmuch as it only lifted a third of its own weight.</p>
                <p>Fig. 37 embodies Μ. de la Landelle’s ideas.</p>
                <p>All the models referred to (Cayley’s excepted<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cayley’s screws, as explained, were made of feathers, and
                    consequently elastic. As, however, no allusion is made in his writings to the
                    superior advantages possessed by elastic over rigid screws, it is to be presumed
                    that feathers were employed simply for convenience and lightness. Professor
                    Pettigrew, there is reason to believe, was the first to advocate the employment
                    of elastic screws for aerial purposes.</p></note>) were provided with <hi
                    rend="italic">rigid</hi> screws, which, for many reasons, we are disposed to
                    regard as an error. In 1872 Μ. Pénaud discarded the rigid screws in favour of
                    elastic ones, as Professor Pettigrew had done some years before.</p>
                <p>Μ. Pénaud also substituted india-rubber under torsion for the whalebone and clock
                    springs of the smaller models, and the steam of the larger ones. His hélicoptère
                    or screw model is remarkable for its lightness, simplicity, and power. The
                    accompanying sketch will serve to illustrate its construction (fig. 38). It
                    consists of two superposed elastic screws (α <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> δ), the
                    upper of which <hi rend="italic">(a d)</hi> is fixed in a vertical frame (c),
                    which is pivoted in the central part (sh) of the under screw. From the centre of
                    the under screw an axle provided with a hook (e), which performs the part of a
                    crank, projects in an upward direction. Between the hook or crank (e) and the
                    centre of the upper <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0332-0321"/> screw (α <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> the
                    india-rubber in a state of torsion (sh) extends. By fixing the lower screw and
                    turning the upper one a sufficient number of times the requisite degree of
                    torsion and power are obtained. The apparatus when liberated flies into the air
                    sometimes to a height of 50 feet, and gyrates in beautiful large circles for a
                    period varying from 15 to 30 seconds.</p>
                <p>Μ. Pénaud next directed his attention to the construction of a model, to be
                    propelled by a screw and sustained by an elastic aero-plane extending
                    horizontally. Sir George Cayley, it should be stated, proposed such a machine in
                    1810, and Mr Henson (as will be shown subsequently) constructed and patented a
                    similar machine in 1842.</p>
                <p>Several other inventors succeeded in making models fly by the aid of aero-planes
                    and screws, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Mr Stringfellow in 1817,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Stringfellow constructed a
                    second model, which was exhibited at the exhibition of the Aeronautical Society
                    (Crystal Palace), in 1868. It is described and figured further on.</p></note> Μ.
                    du Temple in 1857, and Μ. Jullien in 1858. Λs <hi rend="italic">rigid</hi>
                    aero-planes and screws were employed in the construction of these models they
                    flew in a hap-hazard sort of a way, it being found exceedingly difficult to
                    confer on them the necessary degree of stability fore and aft and laterally. Μ.
                    Pénaud succeeded in overcoming the difficulty in question by the invention of
                    what he designates his automatic rudder. This consists of a small <hi
                    rend="italic">elastic</hi> aero-plane placed aft or behind the principal
                    aero-plane which is also <hi rend="italic">elastic.</hi> The two elastic
                    aero-planes extend horizontally and make a slight upward angle with the horizon,
                    the angle made by the smaller aero-plane (the rudder) being slightly in excess
                    of that made by the larger. The motive power is india-rubber in the condition of
                    torsion; the propellor, a screw. The reader will understand the arrangement by a
                    reference to the accompanying drawing (fig. 39).</p>
                <p>Models on the aero-plane screw type may be propelled by two screws, one fore and
                    one aft, rotating in opposite directions; and in tlιe event of only one screw
                    being employed it may be placed in front of or behind the aeroplane.</p>
                <p>When the model is wound up and let go it descends about two feet, after which,
                    having acquired initial velocity, it rises and flies in a forward direction at a
                    height of from 8 to 10 feet from the ground for a distance of from 120 to 130
                    feet. It flies this distance in from 10 to 11 seconds, its mean speed being
                    something like 12 feet per second. From experiments made with this model, Μ.
                    Pénaud calculates that one horse power would elevate and support 85 lb.</p>
                <p>Mr Brown has also written (1874) in support of elastic aero-bi-planes. His
                    experiments prove that two elastic aeroplanes united by a central shaft or
                    shafts, and separated by a wide interval, always produce increased stability.
                    The production of flight by the vertical flapping of wings is in some respects
                    the most difficult, but this also has been attempted and achieved. Μ. Pénaud and
                    Μ. de Villeneuve have each constructed winged models. Professor Marey was not so
                    fortunate. He endeavoured to construct an artificial insect on the plan
                    advocated by Borelli, Straus-Durckheim, and Chabrier, but signally failed, his
                    insect never having been able to lift more than a third of its own weight.</p>
                <p>MM. de Villeneuve and Pénaud constructed their winged models on different types,
                    the former selecting the bat, the latter the bird. Μ. Villeneuve made the wings
                    of his artificial bat conical in shape and comparatively rigid. He controlled
                    the movements of the wings, and made them strike downwards and <hi rend="italic"
                    >forwards</hi> in imitation of natural wings, as described by Professor
                    Pettigrew. His model possessed great power of rising. It elevated itself from
                    the ground with ease, and flew in a horizontal direction for a distance of 24
                    feet, and at a velocity of 20 miles an hour. Μ. Pénaud’s model differed from Μ.
                    de Villeneuve’s in being provided with elastic wings, the posterior margins of
                    which in addition to being elastic were free to move round the anterior margins
                    as round axes (see p. 313, fig. 24). India-rubber springs were made to extend
                    between the inner posterior parts of the wings and the frame, corresponding to
                    the backbone of the bird.</p>

                    untwisted and formed reciprocating screws, precisely analogous to those

                    Professor Pettigrew’s artificial wing (page 319, fig. 32), tho identity of
                    principle and application is at once apparent.</p>
                <p>The twisting kite-like action of the wings, to which allusion has so frequently
                    been made, and to which, as has been shown, Professor Pettigrew first strongly
                    directed attention in 1867, justifies our introductory remarks as to the very
                    intimate relation which subsists between natural and artificial flight. As
                    already stated, it is not possible to understand artificial flight in the
                    absence of a knowledge of natural flight.</p>
                <p>In Μ. Pénaud’s artificial bird the equilibrium is secured by the addition of a
                    tail The model cannot raise itself from the ground, but on being liberated from
                    the hand it descends 2 feet or so, when, having acquired initial velocity, it
                    flies horizontally for a distance of 50 or more feet, and rises as it flies from
                    7 to 9 feet. The following are the measurements of the model in question
                    :—length of wing from tip to tip, 32 inches; weight of wing, tail, frame,
                    india-rubber, &amp;c., 73 grammes (about 2¾ ounces).</p>
                <p>We have referred to Mr Henson’s flying machine, which was designed in 1843. As it
                    was the earliest attempt at aerostation on a great scale it deserves a more than
                    passing notice. Mr Henson was one of the first to combine aerial screws with
                    extensive supporting structures occupying a nearly horizontal position. The
                    accompanying illustration explains the combination (fig, 41),</p>
                <p>“The chief feature of the invention was the very great expanse of its sustaining
                    planes, which were larger in proportion to the weight it had to carry than those
                    of many birds. The machine advanced <hi rend="italic">with its front edge a
                    little raised,</hi> the effect of which was to present its under surface to the
                    air over which it passed, the resistance of which, acting upon it like a strong
                    wind on the sails of a windmill, prevented the descent of the machine and its
                    burden. The sustaining of the whole, therefore, depended upon the speed at which
                    it travelled through the air, and <hi rend="italic">the angle at which its under
                    surface impinged on the air in its front</hi> The machine, fully prepared for
                    flight, was started from the top of an inclined plane, in descending which it
                    attained a velocity necessary to sustain it in its further progress. That
                    velocity would be gradually destroyed by the resistance of the air to the
                    forward flight; it was, therefore, the office of the steam-engine and the vanes
                    it actuated simply to repair the loss of velocity; it was made, therefore, only
                    of the power and weight necessary for that small effect.” The editor of Newton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal of Arts and Sciences</hi> speaks of it thus :—“The
                    apparatus consists of a car containing the goods, passengers, engines, fuel,
                    &amp;c., to which a rectangular frame, made of wood or bamboo cane, and covered
                    with canvas or oiled silk, is attached. This frame extends on either side of the
                    car in a similar manner to the outstretched wings of a bird; but with this
                    difference, that <hi rend="italic">the frame is immovable.</hi> Behind the wings
                    are two vertical fan wheels, furnished with oblique vanes, which are intended to
                    propel the apparatus through the air. The rainbow-like circular wheels are the
                    propellers, answering to the wheels of a steam-boat, and acting upon the air
                    after the manner of a windmill. These wheels receive motions from bands and
                    pulleys from a steam or other engine contained in the car. To an axis at tlιe
                    stern-of the car a triangular frame is attached, resembling the tail of a bird,
                    which is also covered with canvas or oiled silk. This may be expanded or
                    contracted at pleasure, and is moved up and down for the purpose of causing the
                    machine to ascend or descend. Beneath the tail is a rudder for directing the
                    course of the machine to the right or to the left; and to facilitate the
                    steering a sail is stretched between two masts which rise from the car. The
                    amount of canvas or oiled silk necessary for buoying up the machine is stated to
                    be equal to one square foot for each half pound of weight.”</p>
                <p>The defect of Mr Henson ’ s machine consists mainly in its rigidity, and in the
                    vast amount of sustaining surface displayed by it, this approximating it in some
                    measure to the balloon.</p>
                <p>Mr Wenham, thinking to improve upon Mr Henson, invented in 1867 what he
                    designated his aero-planes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“On Aerial Locomotion,” <hi rend="italic">Aeronautical Society's Report</hi>
                    for 1867.</p></note> The aero-planes are thin, light, long, narrow structures,
                    arranged above each other in tiers like so many shelves. They are tied together
                    at a slight upward angle, and combine strength and lightness. The idea is to
                    obtain great sustaining area in comparatively small space. It was hoped that
                    when the aero-planes were wedged forward in the air by vertical screws, or by
                    the body to be flown, each aero-plane would rest or float upon a stratum of
                    undisturbed air, and that practically the aero-planes would give the same
                    support as if spread out horizontally. The aero-planes may be said to form a
                    compound kite, and have only been partially successful. They are rigid, and
                    present a large extent of dead surface, so that the same objections made to Mr
                    Henson’s arrangement apply to them. The great sustaining surface they present
                    forms at once their strength and weakness. They sustain and lift, but are very
                    difficult to wedge forward, and if a breeze be blowing they become unmanageable,
                    in the sense that a balloon is unmanageable. The accompanying figures illustrate
                    Mr Wenham’s views (figs. 42 and 43).</p>
                <p>Mr Stringfellow, who was originally associated with Mr Henson, and constructed a
                    successful flying model in 1847, built a second model in 1868, in which Mr
                    Wenham’s aero-planes were combined with aerial screws. This model was on view at
                    the Exhibition of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, held at the Crystal
                    Palace, London, in 1868. It was remarkably compact, elegant, and light, and
                    obtained the £100 prize of the exhibition for its engine, which was the lightest
                    and most powerful ever constructed. The annexed woodcut (fig. 44), taken from a
                    photograph of Mr Stringfellow’s model, gives a very good idea of the
                    arrangement,—α, <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi> representing the superimposed
                    planes, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the tail, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> the vertical screw propellers. The superimposed planes <hi
                    rend="italic">{a, b,</hi> c) in this machine contained a sustaining area of 28
                    square feet, in addition to the tail (&lt;Z). Its engine represented a third of
                    a horse power, and the weight of the whole (engine, boiler, water, fuel,
                    superimposed planes, and propellers) was under 12 δ&gt;. Its sustaining area, if
                    that of the tail <hi rend="italic">(&lt;L)</hi> be included, was something like
                    36 square feet, <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> 3 square feet for every <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0334-0323"/> pound. The model was forced by its propellers
                    along a wire at a great speed, but so far as an observer could determine, failed
                    to lift itself, notwithstanding its extreme lightness and the comparatively very
                    great power employed. Mr Stringfellow stated that his machine occasionally left
                    the wire and was sustained by its aero-planes alone. The horizontal speed
                    attained was certainly very great; but as the machine was exhibited under cover
                    in the Crystal Palace buildings, and ran along a wire, it is doubtful how it
                    would have deported itself in the open air. Everything about it was <hi
                    rend="italic">rigid,</hi> the aero-planes, screws, &amp;c.; and as the dead
                    surfaces displayed were comparatively very large, the chances are that it would
                    not have been able to hold its own against air currents. That the principle of
                    its construction was faulty is proved beyond doubt by the fact that it weighed
                    under 12 lb, while its engine exerted a third of a horse power. No flying
                    creature, as is well-known, weighing 12 lb possesses a tithe of the power
                    indicated. This fact is significant as showing that flight is not a mere
                    question of levity and power. As has been more than once stated in the present
                    article, the mystery of flight can only be cleared up by an intelligent study of
                    the structure and mode of application of the flying organs of animals. It is to
                    natural flight and the principles which underlie it that the aeronaut must look
                    for a solution of the intensely interesting but vastly complicated problem of
                    aerial navigation.</p>
                <p>The idea embodied by Henson,. Wenham, and Stringfellow is plainly that of a boy’s
                    kite sailing upon the wind. The kite, however, is a more perfect flying
                    apparatus than that furnished by these gentlemen, inasmuch as the inclined plane
                    formed by its body strikes the air at various angles —the angles varying
                    according to the length of string, strength of breeze, 'length and weight of
                    tail, &amp;c. Henson’s, Wenham’s, and Stringfellow’s methods, although carefully
                    tried, have hitherto failed. The objections are numerous. In the first place,
                    the supporting planes (aeroplanes or other forms) are not flexible and elastic
                    as wings are, but <hi rend="italic">rigid;</hi> 2d, they strike the air <hi
                    rend="italic">at a given angle,</hi> where, again, fhere is a departure from
                    nature; 3d, a machine so constructed must be precipitated from a height or
                    driven along the surface of the land or water at a high speed to supply it with
                    initial velocity; 4th, it is unfitted for flying with the wind unless its speed
                    greatly exceeds that of the wind; 5th, it is unfitted for flying across the wind
                    because of the large surfaces exposed; 6th, the sustaining surfaces are passive
                    or dead surfaces, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they have no power of moving or
                    accommodating themselves to altered circumstances. Natural wings, as explained,
                    present small flying surfaces, and these can be applied to the air at any degree
                    of obliquity—the great speed at which wings are propelled converting the spaces
                    through which they pass into what are practically solid bases of support, as
                    indicated at pp. 310, 313 (figs. 9, 20, 21, 22, and 23).</p>
                <p>This arrangement enables natural wings to seize and utilize the air, and renders
                    them superior to adventitious currents. Natural wings work up the air in which
                    they move; but unless the volant animal desires it, they are scarcely, if at
                    all, influenced by winds or currents which are not of their own forming. In this
                    respect they differ entirely from the balloon and all forms of fixed aero
                    planes. In nature small wings driven at a high speed produce the same result as
                    large wings driven at a low speed. In flight a certain space must be covered,
                    either by large wings spread out as solids, or by small wings made to vibrate
                    rapidly. A like result is obtained if air currents travelling at a high speed
                    strike the under surfaces of the wings of the volant animal. In the former cases
                    the wings are active, the air passive; in the latter case the air is active and
                    the wings passive.</p>
                <p>It would be easy to multiply almost indefinitely our list of aerial models and
                    flying machines.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    most recent experiments in aerial transit are described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the New Zealand</hi><hi rend="italic">Institute,</hi> vol x.,
                    1878.</p></note> As however the present article has already attained
                    sufficiently large dimensions it will suffice if we refer in conclusion to the
                    aerial steamer of Mr Moy, designed in 1874, and still in process of
                    construction. Its leading features will readily be understood by a reference to
                    the annexed drawing (fig. 45).</p>
                <p>Mr Moy’s invention consists of a light, powerful, skeleton frame resting on three
                    wheels; a very effective light engine constructed on a new principle, which
                    dispenses with the old-fashioned, cumbrous boiler; two long, narrow, horizontal
                    aero-planes; and two comparatively very large aerial screws. The idea is to get
                    up the initial velocity by a preliminary run on the ground. This accomplished it
                    is hoped that the weight of the machine will gradually be thrown upon the aero
                    planes in the same way that the weight of certain birds—the eagle, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.—</hi> is thrown upon the wings after a few hops and leaps.
                    Once in the air the aero-planes will become effective in proportion to the speed
                    attained. Mr Moy’s machine resembles in its general features that of Mr
                    Stringfellow. It repeats its defects as far as rigid surfaces are concerned, but
                    it has the advantage in presenting a relatively less amount of surface. The
                    diminished surface of Mr Moy’s machine is, moreover, more broken up, and what is
                    important, a relatively greater proportion of the surface (so diminished and
                    broken up) is made active or moving surface. These are hopeful features.</p>
                <p>The unremitting efforts of Mr Moy and other British engineers to construct flying
                    machines deserve well of science. They are significant as showing that the great
                    subject of aerial navigation is at length receiving a fair share of the thought
                    and energy of a country which has already produced the locomotive engine, and
                    which, there is good reason to believe, is destined also to produce the flying
                    machine. (J. B. P.) <pb break="no"
