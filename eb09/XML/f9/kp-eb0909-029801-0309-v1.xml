                    was the greatest sculptor, or, if that title may be disputed on account of
                    certain technical shortcomings in his work, at any rate the greatest designer of
                    sculpture, that England has produced; and as a representative of the Greek
                    spirit in modern art his name stands among the foremost, not of England merely,
                    but of the world.</p>
                <p>He was born on the 6th of July 1755. His name, John, was hereditary in the
                    family, having been borne by his father after a forefather who, according to the
                    family tradition, had fought on the side of parliament at Naseby, and afterwards
                    settled as a carrier or farmer, or both, in Buckinghamshire. John Flaxman the
                    elder carried on with repute the trade of a moulder and seller of plaster casts
                    in New Street, Covent Garden, London. Our sculptor was the second son of his
                    parents, and was born while they were temporarily living at York. Within six
                    months of his birth they returned to London, and in his father’s back shop he
                    spent an ailing childhood, in the course of wſhich his life was once at least
                    despaired of. His figure was high-shouldered and weakly, with the head very
                    large for the body. His father by and by removed to a more commodious house in
                    the Strand, and, his first wife dying, married a second, who proved a thrifty
                    housekeeper and gentle stepmother. Of regular schooling the boy must have had
                    Some, since he is reputed as having remembered in after life the tyranny of some
                    pedagogue of his youth; but his principal education he picked up for himself at
                    home. He early took delight in drawing and modelling from his father’s
                    stock-in-trade, and early endeavoured to understand those counterfeits of
                    classic art by the light of translations from classic literature. Customers of
                    his father took a fancy to the child, and helped him with books, advice, and
                    presently with commissions. The two special encouragera of his youth were the
                    painter Romney, and a cultivated clergyman, Mr Mathew, in whose house in
                    Rathbone Place the young Flaxman used to meet the lettered society of those
                    days, and, among associates of his own age, the artists Blake and Stothard.
                    Before this he had begun to work with success in clay as well as in pencil. At
                    eleven years old, and again at thirteen, he won prizes from the Society of Arts.
                    At twelve he became a public exhibitor in the gallery of the Free Society of
                    Artists, and at fifteen in that of the Royal Academy, then in the second year of
                    its existence. In the same year, 1770, he entered as an Academy student, and won
                    the silver medal. But all these successes were followed by a discomfiture. In
                    the competition for the gold medal of the Academy, Flaxman, who had made quite
                    sure of victory, was defeated, the prize being adjudged by the president, Sir
                    Joshua Reynolds, to another competitor named Engleheart. But this reverse proved
                    no discouragement, and the young Flaxman continued to ply his art diligently,
                    both as a student in the schools and as an exhibitor in the galleries of the
                    Academy, occasionally also attempting diversions into the sister art of
                    painting. Before long he received a commission, from a friend of the Mathew
                    family, for a statue of Alexander. But by heroic and ideal <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n310/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0310-0299"/> work of this class—and it was work of this
                    class that he at first almost exclusively exhibited—he could of course make no
                    regular livelihood. The means of such a livelihood, however, presented
                    themselves in his twentieth year, when he first received employment from Josiah
                    Wedgwood and his partner Bentley, as a modeller of classic and domestic friezes,
                    plaques, ornamental vessels, and medallion portraits, in those varieties of
                    “jasper” and “basalt” ware which earned in their day so prodigious a reputation
                    for the manufacturers who had conceived and perfected the invention, and of
                    which the examples, dispersed and disregarded during the first fifty years of
                    this century, have now again returned into favour among the curious, and are
                    disputed in sale-rooms at prices greater than they fetched in the first fever of
                    the fashion. For twelve years, from his twentieth to his thirty-second
                    (1775-1787), Flaxman subsisted chiefly by his work for the firm of Wedgwood. It
                    may be urged, of the extreme refinements of figure outline and modelling which
                    these manufacturers aimed at in their ware, that they were not the qualities
                    best suited to such a material; or it may be regretted that the gifts of one of
                    the greatest figure designers who ever lived should have been employed upon such
                    a minor and half-mechanical art of household decoration; but the beauty of the
                    product it would be idle to deny, or the value of the training which the
                    sculptor by this practice acquired in the delicacies, the very utmost delicacies
                    and severities, of modelling in low relief and on a minute scale. By 1780
                    Flaxman had begun to earn something in another, and, so to speak, a more
                    legitimate branch of his -profession. This was in the sculpture of monuments for
                    the dead. Three of the earliest of such monuments by his hand are those of
                    Chatterton in the church of St Mary Redcliffe at Bristol, of Mrs Morley in
                    Gloucester Cathedral, and of a widow comforted by an angel, in the cathedral at
                    Chichester. During the rest of Flaxman’s career memorial bas-reliefs of the same
                    class occupied a principal part of his industry; they are to be found scattered
                    in many churches throughout the length and breadth of England, and in them all
                    the finest qualities of his art are represented. The best are quite
                    unsurpassable for pathos, for simplicity, for an instinct of composition as
                    just, pure, and lovely as that of the Greeks themselves, and for the alliance
                    with those harmonious lines and groupings of the ancients of that spirit of
                    domestic tenderness and innocence which is the secret, and the holiest secret,
                    of the modern soul.</p>
                <p>In 1782, being twenty-seven years old, Flaxman was married to Anne Denman, and
                    had in her the best of helpmates until almost his life’s end. She was a woman of
                    attainments in letters and to some extent in art, and the devoted companion of
                    her husband’s fortunes and of his travels. They set up house at first in Wardour
                    Street, 'and lived an industrious life, spending their summer holidays ouce and
                    again in the house of the hospitable poet Hayley, at Eartham in Sussex. After
                    five years, in 1787, they found themselves with means enough to travel, and set
                    out for Rome. Records more numerous and more consecutive of Flaxman’s residence
                    in Italy exist in the shape of drawings and studies than in the shape of
                    correspondence. He soon ceased modelling himself for Wedgwood, but continued to
                    direct the work of other modellers employed for the manufacture at Rome. He had
                    intended to return after a stay of a little more than two years, but was
                    detained by a commission for a marble group of a Fury of Athamas, a commission
                    attended in the sequel with circumstances of infinite trouble and annoyance,
                    from the notorious Comte-Eveque, Frederick Hervey, earl of Bristol and bishop of
                    Derry. He did not, as things fell out, return until the summer of 1794, after an
                    absence of seven years,—having in the meantime executed another ideal commission
                    (a</p>
                <p>Cephalus and Aurora) for Mr Hope, and having sent home models for several funeral
                    monuments, including that of the poet Collins in Chichester Cathedral. But what
                    gained for Flaxman in this interval an immense and European fame was not his
                    work in sculpture proper, but those outline designs to the poets, in which he
                    showed not only to what purpose he had made his own the principles of ancient
                    design in vase-paintings and bas-reliefs, but also by what a natural affinity,
                    better than all mere learning, he was bound to the ancients and belonged to
                    them. The designs for the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Odyssey</hi> were commissioned by Mrs Hare Naylor; those for Dante by Mr
                    Hope; those for Aeschylus by Lady Spencer. During their homeward journey the
                    Flaxmans travelled through central and northern Italy. On their return they took
                    a house, which they never afterwards left, in Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square.
                    Immediately afterwards we find a sculptor exhibiting the model of a large
                    monument in the round, that of Lord Mansfield, now in Westminster Abbey, and at
                    the same time publishing a spirited protest against the scheme already
                    entertained by the Directory, and carried out five years later by Napoleon, of
                    equipping at Paris a vast central museum of art with the spoils of conquered
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The record of Flaxman’s life is henceforth an uneventful record of private
                    affection and contentment, of happy and tenacious industry; with reward not
                    brilliant, but sufficient; with repute not loud, but loudest in the mouths of
                    those whose praise was best worth having—Canova, Schlegel, Fuseli; of quiet,
                    beloved, modestly enthusiastic, and simply honourable life. He took for pupil a
                    son of Hayley’s, who presently afterwards sickened and died. In 1797 he was made
                    an associate of the Royal Academy. Every year he exhibited work of one class or
                    another: occasionally a public monument in the round, like those of Paoli or
                    Captain Montague for Westminister Abbey, and of Nelson or Howe for St Paul’s;
                    more constantly, memorials for churches, with symbolic Acts of Mercy or
                    illustrations of Scripture texts, both commonly in low relief; and these pious
                    labours he would vary from time to time with a classical piece like those of his
                    earliest predilection. Soon after his election as associate, he published a
                    scheme, half grandiose half childish, for a monument to be erected on Greenwich
                    Hill, in the shape of a Britannia 200 feet high, in honour of the naval
                    victories of his country. In 1800 he was elected full Academician. During the
                    peace of Amiens he went to Paris to see the despoiled treasures now actually
                    collected there, but bore himself according to the spirit of protest that was in
                    him. The next event which makes any mark in his life is his appointment to a
                    chair specially created for him by the Royal Academy—the chair of Sculpture:
                    this took place in 1810. We have ample evidence of his thoroughness and
                    judiciousness as a teacher in the Academy schools, and his professorial lectures
                    have been often reprinted. With many excellent observations, and with one
                    singular merit,—that of doing justice, as in those days justice was hardly ever
                    done, to the sculpture of the mediaeval schools,—these lectures lack point and
                    felicity of expression, just as they are reported to have lacked fire in
                    delivery, and are somewhat heavy reading. The most important works that occupied
                    Flaxman in the years next following this appointment were the monument to Mrs
                    Baring in Micheldever church, the richest of all his monuments in relief; that
                    to Lord Cornwallis, destined for India; and that to Sir John Moore, for Corunna;
                    with a pastoral Apollo for Lord Egremont. At this time the antiquarian world was
                    much occupied with the vexed question of the merits of the Elgin marbles, and
                    Flaxman was one of those whose evidence before the parliamentary commission had
                    most weight in favour of the purchase <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n311/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0311-0300"/> which was ultimately effected in 1816. In
                    1817 we find him returning to his old practice of classical outline
                    illustrations, and producing the happiest of all his series in that kind, the
                    designs to Hesiod, engraved by the friendly hand of Blake. Immediately
                    afterwards he is much engaged designing for the goldsmiths—a testimonial cup in
                    honour of John Kemble, and, following that, the great labour of the famous
                    Shield of Achilles. Almost at the same time he undertakes a frieze of Peace,
                    Liberty, and Plenty, for the duke of Bedford’s sculpture gallery at Woburn, and
                    an heroic group of Michael overthrowing Satan, for Lord Egremont’s house at
                    Petworth.</p>
                <p>In 1820 died Mrs Flaxman, after a first warning from paralysis six years earlier.
                    Her younger sister, Maria Denman, and the sculptor’s own sister, Maria Flaxman,
                    remained in his house, and his industry was scarcely at all relaxed. In 1822 he
                    delivered at the Academy a lecture in memory of his old friend and generous
                    fellow-craftsman, Canova, then lately dead; in 1823 he received from <hi
                        rend="italic">A.</hi> W. Von Schlegel a visit of which that writer has left
                    us the record. From an illness occurring soon after this he recovered
                    sufficiently to resume both work and exhibition, but on the 26th of December
                    1826, he caught cold in church, and died three days later, in his seventy-second
                    year. Among a few intimate associates, he left a memory singularly dear; having
                    been in companionship, although susceptible and obstinate when his religious
                    creed—a devout Christianity with Swedenborgian admixtures—was crossed or
                    slighted, yet in other things genial and sweet tempered beyond all men, full of
                    modesty, full of playfulness and of a homely dignity withal, the truest friend,
                    the kindest master, the purest and most blameless spirit.</p>
                <p>Posterity will doubt whether it was the fault of Flaxman or of his age, which in
                    England offered neither training nor much encouragement to a sculptor, that he
                    is weakest when he is most ambitious, and then most inspired when he makes the
                    least effort; but so it is. Not merely does he fail wheu he seeks to illustrate
                    the intensity of Dante, or to rival the tumultuousness of Michelangelo—to be
                    intense or tumultuous he was never made; but he fails, it may almost be said, in
                    proportion as his work is elaborate and far carried, and succeeds in proportion
                    as it is partial and suggestive. Of his completed ideal sculptures, the St
                    Michael at Petworth is by far the best, and is indeed admirably composed from
                    all points of view; but it lacks fire and force, and it lacks the finer touches
                    of the chisel; a little bas-relief like the diploma piece of the Apollo and
                    Marpessa in the Royal Academy compares with it favourably. Again, of Flaxman’s
                    complicated monuments in the round —-we speak of the three in Westminster Abbey
                    and the four in St Paul’s—there is scarcely one which has not something heavy
                    and infelicitous in the arrangement, and something empty and unsatisfactory in
                    the surface execution. But when we come to his simple monuments in relief, in
                    these we find usually an almost complete felicity. The truth is, that he did not
                    thoroughly understand composition on the great scale and in the round; but he
                    thoroughly understood relief, and found scope in it for all his unrivalled gifts
                    of rhythmical design, and tender, grave, and penetrating feeling. Of pity and
                    love he is a perfect master, and shows, as no one had ever shown before, how
                    poignantly those passions can be expressed in the simplest conceivable
                    combinations of human shapes and gestures. But if we would see even these the
                    happiest of his conceptions at their best, wo must study them, not in the
                    finished monument, but rather in the casts from his studio sketches, of which so
                    precious a collection is preserved in the Flaxman gallery at University College.
                    And the same is true of his happiest efforts in the classical and poetical vein,
                    like the well-known relief of Pandora conveyed to Earth by Mercury, Nay, going
                    further back still among the rudiments and first conceptions of his art, we can
                    realize the most essential charm of his genius in the study, not of his modelled
                    work at all, but of his outlined and tinted sketches on paper. Of these, too,
                    there is at University College a choice collection, and many others are
                    dispersed in public and private cabinets. Every one knows the excellence of the
                    engraved designs to Homer, Dante, Aeschylus, and Hesiod, in all cases save when
                    the designer aims at that which he cannot hit, the terrible or the grotesque. To
                    know Flaxman at his best, it is necessary to bo acquainted not only with the
                    original studies for such designs as these, but still more with those almost
                    innumerable studies from real life which he was continually producing with pen,
                    tint, or pencil. These are the most delightful and suggestive <hi rend="italic"
                        >sculptors notes,</hi> so to speak, in existence; in them it was his habit
                    to set down, with a perfect feeling and directness, the leading or expressive
                    lines, and generally no more, of every group that struck his fancy. There are
                    groups of Italy and London, groups of the parlour and the nursery, of the
                    street, the garden, and the gutter; and of each group the artist knows how to
                    seize at once the structural and the spiritual secret, expressing perfectly the
                    value and suggestiveness, for his art of sculpture, of the contacts, intervals,
                    interlacements, and balancings of the various figures in any given group, and
                    not less perfectly the charm of the affections which link the figures together
                    and harmonize their gestures.</p>
                <p>The materials for the life of Flaxman are scattered in various biographical and
                    other publications; the principal are the following:—An anonymous sketch in the
