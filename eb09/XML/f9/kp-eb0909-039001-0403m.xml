                    (1809-1868), successively professor of natural philosophy in the university of
                    Edinburgh and principal of the United College in the university of St Andrews,
                    was the fourth son of Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, the lineal representative
                    of the Forbeses of Monymusk and Pitsligo. His mother was Wilhelmina
                    Belches-Stuart, sole child and heiress of Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn. Their
                    family consisted of two daughters and four sons, of whom James David, born at
                    his father’s town house, 86 George Street, Edinburgh, on the 20th April, 1809,
                    was the youngest. Two years after his birth, the death of Lady Forbes took
                    place., Sir William retired with his family from Edinburgh to Colinton, his
                    country residence, and thus it happened that, up to the age of sixteen, when he
                    entered college, James Forbes was entirely a home-bred boy, and his only teacher
                    the schoolmaster of the village. At an early age, however, he developed
                    remarkable powers of self-education. Passionately fond of natural science, he
                    stored his mind with all available knowledge of physics, constructed for himself
                    astronomical instruments, and actually commenced a connected series of
                    meteorological observations, which he kept up for many years. But these pursuits
                    were carried on without the knowledge of his family; for Sir William had
                    destined him for the bar, and Forbes loved his father too well to betray tastes
                    and inclinations which might seem to point towards a different career. In
                    November 1825 he entered the university of Edinburgh, and joined the classes of
                    Latin and chemistry. He still continued his self-imposed studies, and at length
                    forwarded anonymously to Sir David (then Dr) Brewster, who was at the time
                    conducting the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Pldlosophical Journal,</hi> a paper
                    on “The Apparent Number of the Stars.” It was at once inserted, and further
                    communications were requested from the anonymous “A.” The request was complied
                    with, and during an extended tour through France, Germany, and Italy, in company
                    with a large family party, Forbes contributed a number of papers on “The
                    Physical Geography of the Bay of Naples,” “The Horary Oscillations of the
                    Barometer at Rome,” and other subjects, all of which were inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal.</hi> On his return to Scotland after a year’s absence, he
                    made himself known to Brewster as his unknown correspondent. Brewster,
                    astonished at his extensive reading and remarkable powers of observation,
                    encouraged him in his scientific pursuits, and proposed him as a fellow of the"
                    Royal Society of Edinburgh, to which, at the age of 19, he was elected. In the
                    meantime he had re-entered college, where his subsequent career was a
                    distinguished one. In the class of moral philosophy, taught by the celebrated
                    Professor Wilson, he gained the highest honours, and in Sir John Leslie’s
                    natural philosophy class he twice carried off the gold medal. An event now
                    occurred which changed the whole tenor of his life. His father died on the 24th
                    of October 1828, and it became necessary that Forbes should seriously consider
                    his future course of life. The choice lay between the bar and a scientific
                    career, and after much consultation with his friends he chose the latter. He
                    passed his law trials indeed, and put on his advocate’s gowu, but never wore it,
                    for a competence given him by his father had rendered him independent. About
                    this time Sir David Brewster was engaged in laying the foundations of the
                    British Association. Forbes joined cordially in the work, and contributed much
                    towards placing the Association on the basis it now occupies. Throughout the
                    rest of his life he attended, with rare exceptions, all its meetings, often
                    breaking off a foreign tour, and hastening back to do so. The presidency of the
                    meeting held at Dundee in 1867 was offered to him, but ill health compelled him
                    to decline it</p>
                <p>Immediately after his election as fellow of the Royal Society of London, in June
                    1832, Forbes started on an extensive scientific tour, but was suddenly recalled
                    from Geneva by news of the death of Sir John Leslie, professor of natural
                    philosophy at the university of Edinburgh. Forbes had left word that should this
                    chair at any time become vacant, he desired to be put in nomination, and on his
                    return found that this had actually been done. He also found himself, to his
                    surprise and dismay, the rival of his old friend Sir David Brewster. But Forbes
                    was already committed, and had received testimonials from Whewell, Airy,
                    Peacock, Vernon Harcourt, Chalmers, and others, bearing high testimony to his
                    attainments, and the immense results they promised. After a more than usually
                    excited contest, into which politics to some extent entered, Forbes was elected,
                    at the age of twenty-four, to a professorial chair of the highest distinction.
                    The inaugural lecture with which he opened the session of 1833-34 was listened
                    to with unusual interest. As a professor, he more than realized the high
                    expectations which had been formed of his special capacity for the work. During
                    the twentyseven years of his professorship his lectures left no branch of
                    natural philosophy untouched, and owing to his thorough acquaintance with the
                    literature of the subject, each of them was a mass of condensed
                    information,—not, however, confined to old knowledge taken from books, but
                    enriched from time to time by the results of original research, enlivened by
                    many a happy illustration drawn from his travels and adventures, and rendered
                    more effective by his clear ringing voice and graceful delivery. He soon
                    gathered round him an enthusiastic body of hard-working students, and although
                    the high standard he aimed at made him a somewhat strict disciplinarian, their
                    personal interest in his researches and their pride in his success increased as
                    years went on. Forbes took an interest in his students no less personal, and
                    more than one acquaintance formed in the class-room ripened into a tender and
                    affectionate friendship. But his energies were not confined to the work of his
                    professorship; they soon made themselves felt throughout all the machinery of
                    the university. The system of examination for degrees—already for some time in
                    operation at Oxford—was then much wanted at Edinburgh, where, owing to the
                    absence of any sufficient test of proficiency, graduation was little valued and
                    seldom sought for. Forbes became an energetic reformer in this direction, and to
                    him is mainly owing the complete system of examination for degrees which, under
                    his guidance as dean of the faculty of arts, greatly tended to raise the
                    standard of Scottish education. Again, in 1841, there was much discussion in the
                    senatus as to the disposal of a large sum of money bequeathed by General Reid
                    for the foundation of a chair of music and for other purposes.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0404-0391"/>
                <p>Forbes strongly opposed the idea of a musical professorship, urging that the
                    money would be more usefully employed in providing retiring allowances for
                    superannuated professors. But controversy ran high, litigation ensued, and after
                    years of contention a part of the Reid bequest was assigned by the law courts to
                    the chair of music. Next year another large sum, the Straton fund, had to be
                    dealt with, and here again Forbes was instrumental in inducing the senate to
                    devote what was left of the Reid bequest, combined with the Straton fund, to the
                    foundation of fellowships to be held by distinguished students after graduation.
                    In these and other controversies the uncompromising energy with which he strove
                    to carry out his views of what was right could not fail to bring him into
                    collision with men whose opinions were as decided, and their wills as strong as
                    his own. When two such unbending natures as Sir William Hamilton and James
                    Forbes came into contact—as they did more than once—the shock was a rough one;
                    but although they differed widely in opinions, each has left a permanent mark
                    for good on the university.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to enter here into the subjects or method of Forbes’s
                    class lectures; nor is it necessary to give more than a brief notice of the
                    important researches which shared with his class work the winter mouths. They
                    were the subject of voluminous private correspondence with such men as Whewell,
                    Brewster, Peacock, Airy, Faraday, Arago, Melloni, Cauchy, and many others, and
                    their results were embodied in a long list of communications to various
                    scientific societies, ranging over a great variety of subjects.</p>
                <p>For a paper on “The Transparency of the Atmosphere and the Laws of Extinction of
                    the Sun’s Rays passing through it,” the Royal Society of London awarded him
                    their Royal Medal. Another, on “The Selective Absorption of the Sun’s Light in
                    passing through Steam,” was one of the first steps in the direction of spectrum
                    analysis. In 1832 he described the experiments by which he succeeded in
                    producing a spark by means of a natural magnet. He was the author of valuable
                    memoirs on the thermal springs of the Pyrenees, the extinct volcanoes of the
                    Vivarais (Ardêche), and the geology of the Cuchullin and Eildon hills. Soon
                    after his elevation to the chair Forbes resumed his researches in heat, begun
                    some years before. He commenced experiments with Melloni’s thermo-multiplier,
                    measured the refractive index of rock salt with heat from various sources,
                    luminous and non-luminous, and pursued a course of investigations which led him
                    to his most brilliant discovery, the polarization of non-luminous heat, by
                    transmission through tourmaline and thin mica plates, and by reflection from the
                    latter. By employing mica for depolarization he succeeded in showing the double
                    refraction of non-luminous heat, a fact of which this experiment remains the
                    only proof. He also produced circularly polarized heat by two internal
                    reflections, using Fresnel’s rhombs made of rock salt. By these researches the
                    identity of thermal and luminous radiations was finally established. In 1846 he
                    made careful arrangements for the measurement of underground temperatures, and
                    by sinking his thermometers in three different sets of surface materials, he
                    obtained an absolute determination of the thermal conductivity of traptufa,
                    sandstone, and pure loose sand. His experiments on the conductivity of metals
                    occupied the closing years of his life. By a thoroughly original method he
                    obtained quantitative measurements of the absolute thermal conductivity of iron
                    at various temperatures, and showed that this is diminished (contrary to the
                    assumption of Fourier) by increase of temperature, thus following the known laws
                    of electrical conductivity.</p>
                <p>Forbes generally devoted a part of each vacation to excursions with his family in
                    various parts of Scotland, and to geological tours among his native mountains,
                    in the course of which, at times in company with some scientific friend, more
                    often alone, he traversed on foot the greater part of the Highlands. In 1856 he
                    acquired a beautiful cottage near Pitlochrie in Perthshire, where the succeeding
                    summers were chiefly spent. From 1835 to 1851 Forbes usually passed some months
                    on the Continent, travelling, as he expressed it, not as an amusement, but as a
                    serious occupation, with De Saussure before him as a model And it may be almost
                    doubted whether science did not profit as much by his summer travels as by his
                    winter work.</p>
                <p>His first tour was devoted to the geology of the Pyrenees and of the Vivarais—the
                    latter of which be afterwards revisited. In 1837, after a short sojourn at Bonn,
                    for the purpose of study, he travelled throughout Germany and Austria, making
                    frequent experiments on terrestrial magnetism and other subjects. In 1839, among
                    the crags and glaciers of Monte Viso, of the Pelvoux range, and of the Alps of
                    Cogne, he learned to be an active and intrepid mountaineer; and during the
                    intervals of his glacier investigations he did good service in opening up Alpine
                    districts before scarcely known to Englishmen, by a series of excursions
                    extending over the whole of the Pennine chain.</p>
                <p>But of all his journeys and discoveries, those made by him among the mountains of
                    Savoy are most popularly known; and their results have associated his name for
                    ever with the glaciers of the Alps. In 1840, while presiding over the physical
                    section of the British Association at Glasgow, he met Μ. Agassiz of
                    Neuchâtel—who, after spending several years in the study of glacial phenomena,
                    had just published his2‰awA⅛ <hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les
                    Glaciers,—</hi> and agreed to visit Switzerland with him the following year.
                    Accordingly, at the close of the session of 1840-41, Forbes joined Agassiz and
                    his party at the well-known “Hôtel des Neu-châtelois,” a small hut on the
                    moraine of the Lauter Aar Gletscher. After a fortnight spent in exploration and
                    observation, in the course of which Forbes called attention for the first time
                    to the veined structure of glacier ice, they ended the campaign by the passage
                    of the Ober Aar Joch, and the ascent of the Jungfrau. This was Forbes’s
                    apprenticeship in glacier observation,—a field of inquiry then jointly occupied
                    by two rival theories, the gravitation or sliding theory of De Saussure, and the
                    dilatation theory of Charpentier. After a close analysis of these Forbes not
                    only showed conclusive physical reasons for rejecting both, but pointed out the
                    impossibility of forming a sound theory of glaciers until the internal structure
                    of these anomalous bodies had been investigated, and the character and velocity
                    of their motions ascertained.</p>
                <p>These important data Forbes resolved to obtain for himself, and the summer of
                    1841 found him at Chamounix, engaged in a close examination of the Μ er de
                    Glace. He attacked the problem for the first time as a question of pure physics,
                    executed accurate measurements with instruments of precision, -and at once
                    established the fact that the motion of a glacier averages roughly a foot in 24
                    hours, and that such motion is continuous. As his observations went on, he
                    successively discovered that the centre of the glacier moves faster than the
                    sides, and the surface than the ice vertically below it, that its velocity
                    increases directly with the steepness of its bed, and that the motion of a
                    portion of the glacier when embayed behind a rock is greatly diminished, and the
                    whole mass distorted, without any solution of continuity taking place. Convinced
                    by these discoveries that the resemblance between a glacier and a river, already
                    noticed by Captain Hall, Msgr. Rendu, and others, was more than a mere analogy,
                    he deduced from the above mentioned data the following <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0405-0392"/> theory of glacier motion :— <hi rend="italic">A
                    glacier is an imperfect fluid or a viscous body, which is urged down slopes of a
                    certain inclination by the mutual pressure of its parts.</hi> In reply to the
                    strongly urged objection that ice is by its nature a brittle solid, and not
                    sensibly possessed of any viscous quality, he asserted that ice is only hard and
                    crystalline at a temperature of 30° F. or lower, and that at 32° it is a plastic
                    solid possessing a slight but perfectly sensible genuine molecular plasticity.
                    When the urgency of the forces to which it is subjected causes this limit to be
                    overpowered, a general bruise takes place, producing innumerable internal
                    fissures, with finite displacements in certain planes, and subsequent
                    restoration of continuity by “time and cohesion”; hence the blue bands of the
                    conchoidal veined structure. When the urgency is still greater the mass acts
                    like a solid, and crevasses open. In the case of glacier ice an additional
                    element of plasticity exists, for glacier ice is scarcely ever coherent. It is
                    usually a congeries of irregular polyhedrons tightly wedged together, possessing
                    a rude flexibility, and always traversed by an infinity of capillary fissures.
                    Hence a glacier is really a compound of ice and water, more or less plastic
                    according to its wetness and infiltration,—a fact proved by its more rapid
                    motion in summer when saturated with water, and its relative retardation in
                    winter when the surface water remains frozen. Forbes’s “viscous theory” was
                    sharply criticized, but it is now universally accepted, subject to some
                    modifications which do not affect the groundwork of the structure, and rather
                    elucidate than disprove his conclusions. But besides scientific criticism, he
                    was compelled to defend himself—which he did with complete success—against
                    insinuations, not only of plagiarism, but of an endeavour to suppress the rights
                    of others to priority of discovery.</p>
                <p>During the winter which followed this eventful summer, Forbes was busily engaged
                    in writing his <hi rend="italic">Travels through the Alps of Savoy,</hi> a
                    charming contribution to Alpine literature, in which graphic descriptions of
                    scenery and mountaineering are happily blended with accounts of his scientific
                    researches. Its last lines were written almost on the eve of his marriage with
                    Alicia, eldest daughter of the late George Wauchope, Esq. They started on their
                    marriage tour to Switzerland, but had only got so far as Bonn, when Forbes was
                    attacked by a dangerous illness, and it was not until August that they reached
                    the Alps. He was then so far restored as to be able to resume his observations
                    on the glaciers of Chamounix and Grindelwald, but as the winter approached he
                    was pronounced unequal to the work of the following session at Edinburgh. His
                    request for permission to appoint a substitute was readily granted, and he set
                    out with Mrs Forbes for Italy. Naples and Rome were their headquarters until the
                    end of May, and the summer months were passed at the Italian lakes and in
                    Switzerland. Forbes returned to Edinburgh in the autumn of 1844, and carried on
                    his work during the winter months, but his health had suffered a rude shock,
                    from the effects of which he never entirely recovered, The succeeding summer was
                    spent with his family in the Highlands of Scotland; but the vacation of 1846
                    found him again on the Mer de Glace, engaged in observations on the ablation of
                    the surface of the glaciers, and the difference of movement between the surface
                    and the underlying ice. His next and last visit to the Alps in 1850 was entirely
                    occupied in putting the finishing touches to his survey of the Mer de Glace,
                    which was for some years after its publication the only correct Alpine map in
                    existence. At the close of the session of 1850-51 he started for Norway with the
                    double purpose of observing a total eclipse of the sun visible at Bergen, and of
                    comparing the phenomena of the arctic glaciers with those of the Alps. These
                    objects were not attained without great fatigue and exposure; Forbes returned
                    from Norway with health much impaired, and had scarcely recommenced his work
                    when he was attacked by haemorrhage, the precursor of a long and dangerous
                    illness. All through December he lay between life and death, but in January he
                    was able to be removed to Clifton, which he made his headquarters for two years.
                    During this enforced leisure he was constantly engaged in writing a very able
                    “Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science,” for the
                    pages of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</hi> and in preparing
                    for the press a work on <hi rend="italic">Norway and its Glaciers,</hi> similar
                    in character to his <hi rend="italic">Glaciers of the Alps,</hi> and scarcely
                    yielding to it in picturesqueness of narrative or careful observation. In the
                    summer of 1853 he was called from Clifton to Oxford to receive the honorary
                    degree of D.C.L. During the three sessions of Forbes’s absence, his class work
                    had been conducted by Professor Kelland, but the session of 1854-1855 found him
                    again at his post, and he worked with but little interruption from illness until
                    1859, assisted latterly by Dr Balfour Stewart. In that year the current of his
                    life was turned into another channel. Owing to the translation of Sir David
                    Brewster to the principalship of the Edinburgh university, the principalship of
                    the United College of St Andrews became vacant; Forbes offered himself as a
                    candidate, and was successful. His commission bears date December 2, 1859, but
                    he did not resign his professorship until the following April. The degree c∙f
                    LL.D, was then conferred on him by the university which his own labours had so
                    greatly benefited and adorned.</p>
                <p>His new post, although it relieved him of the fatigue of constant lecturing, was
                    no sinecure. The Scottish University Commission were then in full session, and
                    in their investigations of the affairs, financial and other, of his own college,
                    and of the university, the responsibility of supplying information and
                    suggesting reforms fel <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> largely on him. A zealous
                    reformer he always was, and he had not left behind him at Edinburgh that
                    dauntless spirit of “Thorough” which saw only one straight road to a right
                    principle, and pursued it, not without collisions, and often painful ones. The
                    duties of his office were performed with scrupulous industry. His own college is
                    indebted to him for a laborious examination and classification of its ancient
                    charters. He found the collegiate church of St Salvator in a condition of
                    tasteless neglect; he left it partially restored and greatly beautified. He
                    occasionally lectured on glaciers, climate, heat, and others of his favourite
                    subjects, and even strained his failing powers to complete his researches on the
                    thermal conductivity of iron. For the latter, shortly before his death, the
                    Keith medal was awarded to him.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1867 Forbes’s health gradually declined, and towards the end of
                    September he set out with his wife and three daughters to Cannes, and afterwards
                    went on to Hyères. His health now continued to improve until the middle of
                    January, when he was again attacked by haemorrhage brought on by fatigue. He
                    never sat up again, and while in that painful state the presidency of the Royal
                    Society of Edinburgh was offered to him and declined. It was evident that a
                    summer at Hyères was impossible, so he was conveyed, together with one of his
                    daughters who was almost in the same sad condition as himself, to Clifton, where
                    he lingered for eight months, awaiting his end with patient calmness, sustained
                    by the deep and fervent religious faith which had characterized his boyhood, and
                    which a life of active scientific research had strengthened rather than
                    impaired. He died on the 31st of December 1868.</p>
                <p>Forbes received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from Oxford, and that of LL.D. from
                    the university of Edinburgh. The Royal Society of London awarded him their
                    Rumford medal for his discovery of the polarization of heat, and their Royal
                    medal for a paper on the influence<pb break="no"

                    Society of Edinburgh the keith medal λvas thrice presented to him, and he filled
                    the post of secretary to that body from 1840 till the failure of his health
                    obliged him to resign it. In 1845 a pension of £200 a year was granted to him
                    for his services rendered to science. He was fellow of the Royal Societies of
                    London and Edinburgh, and of the Geological Society, corresponding member of the
                    Imperial Institute of France, and associate or honorary member of the Bavarian
                    Academy of Sciences, of the Academy of Palermo, of the Dutch Society of Sciences
                    (Haarlem), of the Helvetic Society, of the Pontifical Society, of the Pontifical
                    Academy of “Nuovi Lincei” at Rome, and of the Natural History Societies of
                    Heidelberg, Geneva, and Vaud, and honorary member of the Royal Medical Society
                    of Edinburgh, of the Cambridge, Yorkshire, St Andrews, and Isle of Wight
                    Philosophical Societies, and of the Plymouth and Bristol Institutions.</p>
