                <p><label type="entry">FAMINES</label>. War, pestilence, and famine are regarded by
                    many as the natural enemies of the human race; but in truth these are all more
                    or less associated with the circumstances of civilization. In the highest state
                    of civilized society there ought to be no war; there need be no pestilence; and
                    famine alone would stand as being beyond the range of human prevention—subject
                    to some conditions to be afterwards spoken of. The advancement in the social
                    scale to a state of dependence upon cereal crops, while the facilities of
                    intercommunication between different countries, or even parts of the same
                    country, remained imperfect, led almost necessarily to the periodical recurrence
                    of scarcity. Cereal crops are especially dependent upon conditions of climate
                    for their regular production; and here at least are circumstances beyond human
                    control.</p>
                <p>In a matter of such practical importance as the failure of the regular supply of
                    the food of the people, it is not desirable to rely upon merely theoretical
                    surmises; nor is it necessary to do so. A table has recently been prepared<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Statistical Journal,</hi> vol. xli., paper by Mr Cornelius Walford, F.I.A.,
                    F.S.S., &amp;c., “On the Famines of the World, past and present.”</p></note> of
                    over 350 famines which have occurred in the history of the world, beginning with
                    those spoken of in the Scriptures as having been in Palestine and in the
                    neighbouring nations in the time of Abraham (Gen. xii. 10), and again in the
                    time of Isaac (Gen, xxvi. 1); passing on to the seven years’ famine in Egypt
                    down through those which afflicted ancient Rome; enumerating in their order
                    those which have visited the three divisions of the United Kingdom (by far the
                    most numerous in the table—the records being more available), as also those
                    devastating Europe in the Middle Ages; reviewing in special detail the 34
                    famines -which have visited India, including, as the first recorded of this
                    group, that of 1769-70 (above 20 have been on a large scale); and concluding
                    with that terrible calamity which is now ravaging the populations in North
                    China. It is not pretended that this table is entirely exhaustive. It is knowm
                    that many famines have occurred in the Chinese empire of which no details have
                    been found available; and it is supposed that many have desolated Persia and
                    other portions of Asia of which exact particulars are not available. But as this
                    is believed to be the only existing table of the kind, and as great pains have
                    been taken to make it complete, it may for our present purpose be regarded at
                    least as representative. We proceed then to an analysis of it, in view of
                    ascertaining what have been the causes of famines,—a point of the first
                    importance when we come to a consideration of the problem which will naturally
                    force itself into prominence—can anything be done to avert these national
                    calamities?</p>
                <p>The analysis discloses the following causes, or we may perhaps more accurately
                    say attributed causes—for in this matter we have to follow the authority of the
                    original chronicle, or of such records as have reached us :—1, rain; 2, frost;
                    3, drought; 4, other meteorological phenomena; 5, insects and vermin; 6, w ar;
                    7, defective agriculture; 8, defective transport; 9, legislative interference;
                    10, currency restrictions; 11, speculation; 12, misapplication of grain. These
                    causes are named, as far as may be, in the order of their importance. It is
                    immediately noticeable that they form themselves into the two distinct groups of
                    natural and artificial causes.</p>
                <p>We proceed to consider the first group— <hi rend="italic">natural causes of
                    famines.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Rain.—</hi> By excess of rain floods are produced, the soil
                    becomes saturated, and decomposition of the seed is occasioned. In hilly
                    countries the seed is not unfrequently washed entirely out of the ground, and so
                    is destroyed. This cause of famine applies in a marked manner to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0034-0025"/> tropical countries, where the rains are so much
                    of the nature of torrents that the evil presents itself in a magnified degree.
                    Improved cultivation of the land, embracing good drainage, is providing the most
                    effective remedy. Other forms of damage to grain crops result from rain, as
                    where it occurs in undue quantities during the harvest season, and the crops are
                    destroyed before they can bo safely stored. This has constantly happened in the
                    northern portions of our own kingdom, and in parts of continental Europe.
                    Inundations from the sea, from rivers, from inland lakes, fall within this
                    category, and great mischief has resulted from these in many parts of the world.
                    White, in his <hi rend="italic">Natural History of Selbome,</hi> gives
                    scientific reasons why much-flooded lands remain infertile—the beneficial action
                    of the earth-worms is thereby retarded.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Frost.—</hi> In temperate regions frost is a deadly enemy to
                    vegetation in several forms. In the case of grain cultivation it may, by setting
                    in early, prevent the efficient manipulation of the soil and the sowing of the
                    autumn seed. Or by being protracted beyond the early months of the year, it will
                    prevent spring sowing, and even seriously injure the young crops. Combined with
                    rain it will frequently destroy the vitality of the seed while yet in the
                    ground. In the northern part of our island it not unfrequently destroys the
                    grain before it is fully harvested. Efficient drainage of the soil is almost as
                    effective against the ravages of frost as against the damage from rain. Many
                    famines in Great Britain have been shown to be directly the result of frost. In
                    France, and other wine and olive producing countries, the damage occasioned by
                    frost is immense. Such damage, as well as that occasioned by floods, is there a
                    recognized branch of insurance business.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Drought.—</hi> In all climate3 of a tropical character
                    drought plays an important part in retarding the development of vegetation. When
                    combined with moisture, solar heat affords the most certain means of securing
                    luxuriance; without the moisture there is absolute sterility. The early Bible
                    records refer to the rising of the waters of the Nile as the event upon which
                    the fertility of Egypt depends. About 1060 the overflowing of this great river
                    failed for seven successive years, occasioning one of the greatest famines of
                    history. Two provinces were wholly depopulated; and in another half the
                    inhabitants perished. Even in temperate climates long-continued drought is very
                    disastrous.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Other Meteorological Phenomena.—</hi> Under this general
                    designation has to be included several causes more or less directly or remotely
                    contributing to famines, (a) <hi rend="italic">Comets.</hi> —The appearance of
                    these has often coincided with periods of drought; they are also frequently
                    associated with excessive heat. But heat, except in so far as it may superinduce
                    drought, is not detrimental to the grain crops; while, in relation to fruit
                    crops, and more especially that of the vine, not only is the quality of the
                    produce greatly enhanced, but frequently its quantity also. The sale of some of
                    the comet-claret of 1811 recently at &lt;£12, 10s. per bottle in Paris is some
                    evidence of the quality. (ό) <hi rend="italic">Earthqιιakes.—</hi> These would
                    seem to have but little influence in producing famine, except in the immediate
                    locality of their devastations. Where, however, they have produced irruptions of
                    the sea or inland waters, which has not unfrequently been the case, the damage
                    has been extensive, (c) <hi rend="italic">Hurricanes and Storms.—</hi> These
                    frequently produce widespread injury in the localities they visit. They also
                    lead to irruptions of the sea, and to the overflow of rivers; but as a rule
                    these occur at periods of the year when the grain and other crops are not
                    sufficiently advanced to sustain serious damage by shaking or otherwise, or have
                    been harvested. <hi rend="italic">(√) Hail-storms.—</hi> These are usually local
                    in their effects—rarely extending beyond 60 miles in their greatest length and
                    some 6 miles in width, and are generally confined to much smaller limits. They
                    are most destructive to grain and fruit produce of all kind when they occur in
                    severe form, and in the summer and autumn months—when they are most prevalent.
                    The damage these occasion lias long been the subject of insurance alike in
                    England and other parts of Europe. In France hail-storms are of great frequency,
                    and also of great severity.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Insects, Vermin, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> Insect plagues appear to
                    have afflicted mankind from a very early period. Thus flies and locusts were
                    among the plagues of Egypt, and concerning the latter we read (Ex. x. 14, 15):
                    “Very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they,
                    neither after them shall be such. For they covered the face of the whole earth,
                    so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all
                    the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; and there remained not any green
                    in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.” The
                    present writer travelled in 1874 through districts in the Western States of
                    America devastated very much in the manner thus described. The famine now raging
                    in North China began in one district at least by a visitation of locusts. In
                    India such visitations have occurred several times. England has been visited on
                    various occasions by plagues of insects, especially in 476 and again in 872. As
                    to vermin, such as rats, mice, &amp;c., destroying the crops, there are but few
                    instances on record. In 1581 there was a plague of mice in Essex, and in 1812-13
                    a plague of rats in the Madras presidency, which in part occasioned the famine
                    of that year.</p>
                <p>We now turn to the <hi rend="italic">artificial causes</hi> of famines, some of
                    which hardly admit of being dealt with in the same detail.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">JΓar.—</hi> Warfare has a tendency to create famine in one
                    or other of several forms. It too frequently retards cultivation, either by its
                    direct operation, or indirectly by calling the agricultural classes to arms. By
                    its agency, too, the cr0p3 of whole districts are either designedly destroyed or
                    ruinously devastated. Famines in particular towns or localities are often
                    occasioned by the establishment of blockades, or through supplies being
                    otherwise intercepted or cut off. A large quantity of grain, too, is probably
                    damaged every year by being kept in military stores in various parts of Europe;
                    in the event of famine, however, these stores may become of immense value.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Defective Agriculture.—</hi> This may result from one of
                    several causes, as ignorance, indifference, or unsuitability of climate or
                    location. "Where the produce of the soil but barely meets the current
                    requirements of the inhabitants, it is clear that either the failure of one
                    season’s crops, or the sudden influx of any great number of strangers, may
                    produce at least temporary famine. See Macaulay’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >England,</hi> vol. i. chap. 3, or Wade’s <hi rend="italic">British History
                    chronologically arranged,</hi> under date 1549 to 1553, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Defective Transport.</hi> —This may arise from such causes
                    as bad roads or want of roads, absence of canals or want of shipping, or from
                    wilful obstruction. In our own country we had the advantage of the great Roman
                    roads from a very early period; but still for cross country purposes the roads
                    remained very bad, or, indeed, did not exist, until comparatively recent times.
                    In 1285 an Act was passed for widening the highways from one market town to
                    another; “but this was intended rather to prevent robbery than to facilitate
                    travelling” (Wade). In consequence of the bad state of the roads it has
                    frequently happened that there was a famine prevailing in one part of the
                    kingdom, with a superabundance of food in another. The introduction of canal3,
                    and subsequently of railroads, removed all possible difficulty in the United
                    Kingdom. In India at the present moment the chief difficulty in connexion with
                    the famines is the want of the means of transport <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0035-0026"/> 9. <hi rend="italic">Legislative
                    Interference.—</hi> It does not appear altogether certain whether legislative
                    interference with respect to the import or export of grain originated in
                    relation to the prevention of famines, or in the desire to advance agriculture
                    or to keep down prices within the limits at one time prescribed by law. Probably
                    all these causes contributed to the building up of the system of the Corn Laws,
                    which were only repealed, at the indignant demand of the nation, as recently as
                    1846. It is clear that all legislative interference must be designed to
                    interfere with the natural course of supply and demand; and to that extent it is
                    dangerous. There is no doubt that the Corn Laws were often called into play to
                    prevent exportation of grain; while they only admitted of its importation when
                    prices reached or exceeded certain predetermined limits. It was the Irish famine
                    of 1845-6 which at least hastened their final repeal.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edward I. “caused the wooll and leather to be
                    stayed in England, and there followed great dearth of corne and
                    wine.”—Penkethman.</p></note></p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Currency Restrictions.—</hi> Under this head is mainly
                    included the consideration of debasing the coin, and so lessening its purchasing
                    power. But for very direct testimony on more than one occasion we should hardly
                    have included this among the causes of famine. Thus Penkethman (who may be
                    regarded as a high authority) says, under date 1124, “By means of changing the
                    coine all things became very deere, whereof an extreame famine did arise, and
                    afflict the multitude of the people unto death.” Other instances, as in 1248,
                    1390, and 1586, are more particularly set out in the table of famines already
                    referred to.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Speculation.—</hi> Under this head has chiefly to be
                    considered that class of dealings known as “forestalling,” “ingrossing,” and
                    trafficking by “regratours.” Offences of this character were prohibited by
                    statute in 1552 (5 and 6 Edward VI. c. 14), and it is seen that much importance
                    was attached to them. Then there was the Act of 1555 (2 and 3 Philip and Mary,
                    c. 15), “An Act that purveyors shall not take victuals within 5 miles of
                    Cambridge and Oxford,” on account of the poor estate of the multitude of
                    scholars “having very bare and small sustentation.” A further inquiry into the
                    legislative measures taken in this direction would show how little removed from
                    famine conditions were the people of England even at a comparatively recent
                    period.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Misapplication of Grain.—</hi> Under this head is mainly to
                    be noted the excessive use of grain in brewing and distilling, and by burning,
                    whether wilfully or by misadventure. The law3 regarding the burning of grain
                    ricks were long and properly very severe, the punishment being capital until
                    within a comparativly recent date. Under date 1315 we find it recorded that the
                    Londoners, “considering that wheat was much consumed by the converting thereof
                    into mault, ordained that from thence it was to be made of other grains.” This
                    order was afterwards extended by the king (Edward II.) through the whole
                    kingdom. In later times distilling from grain has been prohibited.</p>
                <p>It is clear from what has thus been said that the specific causes of famines
                    which are denominated artificial have nearly all passed away, so far as Britain
                    is concerned; but some of them still assert their force, especially in the East.
                    As to India, the constantly recurring famines in the various provinces have
                    caused great commiseration in England, and much anxiety and cost to the
                    Government,—that of 1874 costing £6,500,000, that of 1877 nearly £10,000,000,
                    —and have naturally drawn attention to the fact that the Indian empire, as a
                    whole, produces year by year sufficient food for its aggregate population. The
                    food supply fails at certain points; and there are no adequate means of
                    transportation between the suffering provinces and others which have abundance.
                    Hence millions starve; and hence, in the meantime, has arisen a fierce
                    controversy between those who are in favour of canals, and water carriage
                    generally, and the military authorities, who regard railways as of the first
                    necessity—funds not being immediately forthcoming for both purposes.</p>
                <p>There are other facts regarding the famines of India which require to be known,
                    as they are contrary to the general belief. Thus Mr F. C. Danvers says, in his
                    able <hi rend="italic">lieport on the Famines of India</hi> (1878):—</p>
                <p>“Famines in India have arisen from several different causes, but the most general
                    cause has not been the failure of the usual rains. Distress has also, however,
                    been caused by hostile invasion, by swarms of rats and locusts, by storms and
                    floods, and not unfrequently by the immigration of the starving people from
                    distant parts into districts otherwise well provided with food supplies, and
                    occasionally by excessive exports of grain into famine-stricken districts, or by
                    combinations of two or more of the above-mentioned circumstances.”</p>
                <p>Another point may be mentioned, which bears, not only upon the famines of India,
                    but upon those of other countries where they are occasioned by deficiency of
                    rain, or by too much rain, viz., the effect produced on the average rainfall by
                    denuding a country of its growing timber. There can be no doubt that the
                    rainfall in England has been much lessened by the continuous destruction of our
                    forests and even of our hedgerows. In India the cutting down of timber for the
                    purpose of supplying fuel to the locomotive engines on the railways has already
                    produced noticeable effects. The authorities are happily alive to the fact, and
                    remedial measures are already being taken. But other results are produced by the
                    same cause. The testimony of the French forest department in the Hautes and
                    Basses Alpes is strong, and reaches the practical question of floods and the
                    damage they occasion. “So great indeed were the devastations from which these
                    alpine districts suffered through the denudation of the mountain sides, and the
                    consequent formation of torrents, that intervention of the most prompt
                    description became necessary to prevent the destruction, not only of the grazing
                    grounds themselves, but of the rich valleys below them.” The replanting of these
                    mountains had been going on for some time. “Already the beneficial effect of
                    what has been done is felt in the diminution of the violence of the torrents
                    During the present summer (1875), when so much mischief has been done in the
                    south of France by inundations, the Durance, which rises in the mountains east
                    of Avignon, and which, on former occasions, has been the worst and most
                    dangerous of all the rivers in the south of France, on account of the
                    inundations it has caused, has scarcely been heard of; and it is around the head
                    waters of this river that the chief plantation works have, during the last ten
                    years, been carried on.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Simla</hi> (India), October 1875.</p></note></p>
                <p>In connexion with famines the “sun-spot” theory of rainfall has of late engaged
                    much attention. The basis of this theory is that all the phenomena connected
                    with the sun ebb and flow once in eleven years, and that from the relation of
                    the earth to the sun these maximum and minimum periods regulate terrestrial
                    phenomena. The sun’s energy “gives us our meteorology by falling at different
                    times upon different points of the aerial and aqueous envelopes of our planet,
                    thereby producing ocean and air currents; while, by acting upon the various
                    forms of water which exist in those envelopes, it is the fruitful parent of
                    rain, and cloud, and mist. Nor does it stop here. It affects in a more
                    mysterious way the electricity in the atmosphere, and the magnetism of the globe
                    itself.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Sun-Spots and
                    Famines,” by J. Norman Lockyer and W. W. Hunter, in <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth
                    Century,</hi> Nov. 1877, p. 583.</p></note> So far, however, as the tables <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0036-0027"/> illustrating the theory admit of comparison with
                    the list of famines already referred to—and the tables extend to the rainfall
                    (as indicated by floods), to frosts, to drought, and to other meteorological
                    phenomena—there is no present evidence that such a theory can be upheld, even
                    when applied to the famines of India only; and apparently still less when
                    extended to those of the whole world. As to Mr Jeula’s tables of shipwrecks,
                    which appear to follow the eleven years’ theory, and to which the doctrine of
                    recurrent storms, induced by the meteorological influences already named, has
                    been applied—the explanation may be traced to other influences, such as
                    mercantile depression, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>In remains to be added that to the direct influence of famiues we owe our Poor
                    Laws—that national system of insurance against starvation. “In the 29th yeare of
                    Queen Elizabeth, about January [1586], Her Majesty observing the general Dearthe
                    of Corne, and other victual, groune partly through the unseasonablenesse of the
                    year then passed, and partly through the uncharitable greediness of the
                    Corne-Masters, but especially through the unlawful and over much transporting of
                    graine in forreine parts; by the advice of Her most Hon. Privy Council,
                    published a Proclamation, and a Booke of Orders to be taken by justices for
                    reliefe of the Poore; notwithstanding all which the excessive prices of grain
                    still encreased: so that wheate was sold at London for 8s. the Bushel, and in
                    some other parts of the Realme above that price.”—Penkethman. To the famiue in
                    India in 1781-3 was due the institution of the <hi rend="italic">Moneyar
                    Choultry,</hi> or the Indian equivalent to the British Poor Law; while in
                    connexion with the Indian famine of 1790-2 was introduced the system of
                    Government relief works, so extensively adopted at the time of the Irish famine
                    of 1846-7 and the Lancashire cotton famine of 1861-5. The first recorded
                    importation of grain into Great Britain took place during the great famine of
                    1258, when “fifty of shiploads of wheat, barley, and bread were procured from
                    Germany ”—hence the first incident which, at a later date, gave rise to our Corn
                    Laws; and in many other ways famines have left their mark upon our history and
                    our institutions. (c. w.)</p>
