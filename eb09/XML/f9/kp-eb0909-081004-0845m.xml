                    the Roman conventus juridici, otherwise known as jurisdictiones, or fora, which
                    in Pliny’s time were already numerous in the Iberian peninsula. In each of these
                    provincial fora the Roman magistrate, as is well known, was accustomed to pay
                    all possible deference to the previously established common law of the district;
                    and it was the privilege of every free subject to demand that he should be
                    judged in accordance with the customs and usages of his proper forum. This was
                    especially true in the case of the inhabitants of those towns which were in
                    possession of the jus italicum. It is not, indeed, demonstrable, but there are
                    many presumptions, besides some fragments of direct evidence, which make it more
                    than probable, that the old administrative arrangements both of the provinces
                    and of the towns, but especially of the latter, remained practically undisturbed
                    at the period of the Gothic occupation of Spain.<note anchored="true"

                    avowedly designed in some points to supersede the Roman law, appear to have
                    contemplated any marked interference with the former fora, which were still to a
                    large extent left to be regulated in the administration of justice by unwritten,
                    immemorial, local custom. Little is known of the condition of the subject

                    the old municipal fora, if much impaired, were not even then in all cases wholly
                    destroyed. At all events when the word forum<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    century in the sense of a liberty or privilege, it is generally implied that the
                    thing so named is nothing new. The earliest extant written fuero is probably
                    that which was granted to the province and town of Leon by Alphonso V. in 1020.
                    It emanated from the king in a general council of the kingdom of Leon and
                    Castile, and consisted of two separate parts; in the first 19 chapters were

                    mark a new legislative departure, unless in so far as it marks the beginning of
                    the era of written charters for towns. The “fuero general” does not profess to
                    supersede the consuetudines antiquorum jurium or Chindaswint’s codification of
                    these in the Lex Visigothorum; the “fuero municipal” is really for the most part
                    but a resuscitation of usages formerly established, a recognition and definition
                    of liberties and privileges that had long before been conceded or taken for
                    granted. The right of the burgesses to self-government and self-taxation is
                    acknowledged and confirmed, they, on the other hand, being held bound to a
                    constitutional obedience and subjection to the sovereign, particularly to the
                    payment of definite imperial taxes, and the rendering of a certain amount of
                    military service (as the ancient municipia had been). Almost contemporaneous
                    with this fuero of Leon was that granted to Najera (Naxera) by Sancho el Mayor
                    of Navarre <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1035), and confirmed, in 1076, by

                    occasionally to be met with. In the fuero of Cardeña, for example, granted by
                    Ferdinand I. in 1039, reference is made to a previous forum Burgense (Burgos),
                    which, however, has not been preserved, if, indeed, it ever had been reduced to
                    writing at all. The phraseology of that of Sepulveda (1076) in like manner
                    points back to an indefinitely remote antiquity.<note anchored="true"

                    these, which was distinguished by the unusual largeness of its concessions, and
                    by the careful minuteness of its details, rapidly extended to many places in the
                    neighbourhood, while the latter charter was given also to Miranda by Alphonso
                    VI., and was further extended in 1181 by Sancho el Sabio of Navarre to Vitoria,
                    thus constituting one of the earliest written fora of the “Provincias

                    of such documents increased very rapidly; that of Toledo especially, granted to
                    the Mozarabic population in 1101, but greatly enlarged and extended by Alphonso
                    VII. (1118) and succeeding sovereigns, was used as a basis for many other
                    Castilian fueros. Latterly the word fuero came to be used in Castile in a wider
                    sense than before, as meaning a general code of laws; thus about the time of
                    Saint Ferdinand the old Lex Visigothorum, then translated for the first time
                    into the vernacular, was called the Fuero Juzgo, a name which was soon
                    retranslated into the barbarous Latin of the period as Forum Judicum;<note

                    >Fuero</hi><hi rend="italic">Viejo de Castilla,</hi> dates from a still later
                    period. As the power of the Spanish crown was gradually concentrated and
                    consolidated, royal pragmaticas began to take the place of constitutional laws;
                    tho local fueros of the various districts slowly yielded before the superior
                    force of imperialism; and only those of Navarre and the Basque provinces have
                    had sufficient vitality to enable them to survive to comparatively modern times.
                    While actually owning the lordship of the Castilian crown since about the middle
                    of the 14th century, these provinces, until quite recently, rigidly insisted
                    upon compliance with their consuetudinary law, and especially with that which
                    provided that the señor, before assuming the government, should personally
                    appear before the assembly and swear to maintain the ancient constitutions. Each
                    of the provinces mentioned had distinct sets of fueros, codified at different
                    periods, and varying considerably as to details; the main features, however,
                    were the same in all. In the province of Biscay, the most democratic of the
                    group, the management of public affairs was vested in the junta or assembly of
                    popular representatives, chosen by household suffrage. Its functions included
                    the collection of taxes, the protection and defence of the territory, and the
                    nomination of all the officers of government except the corregidor. The
                    inhabitants of the province were exempt from all imposts except the self-imposed
                    ones of their own locality, and from all duties on imported merchandise. They
                    claimed the privileges of Spanish nobility on merely proving their descent from
                    pure Biscayan blood. They were not obliged to appear before any tribunal beyond
                    the bounds of their own lordship, or to tolerate any royal intendant or
                    comptroller within the province, or to allow any royal monopoly as in the rest
                    of Spain, or have any royal establishment except the post-office, or admit royal
                    troops within the territory, or furnish recruits for the royal army. They were
                    privileged to defend their territory with their own means and their own blood,
                    and, moreover, to visit with summary punishment every attempt to interfere with
                    these their constitutional rights. These rights, after having been recognized by
                    successive Spanish sovereigns from Ferdinand the Catholic to Ferdinand VII.,
                    were, at the death of the latter in 1833, set aside by the Government of
                    Castaños. The result was a civil war, which terminated in 'a renewed
                    acknowledgment of the fueros by Isabel II. (1839). The provisional Government of
                    1868 also promised to respect them, and similar pledges were given by the
                    Governments which succeeded. In consequence, however, of the Carlist rising of
                    1873-76, the Basque fueros were finally extinguished in 1876. The his tory of
