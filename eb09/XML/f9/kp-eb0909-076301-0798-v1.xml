                    town of Saxony, is situated on the Münzbach, not far from its confluence with
                    the Mulde, and 19 miles S.W. of Dresden. It is well built, and is still
                    surrounded by its old walls. It is the seat of the general administration of the
                    mines throughout the kingdom, and its celebrated academy of mines, founded in
                    1765, is frequented by students from all parts of Europe. Connected with the
                    academy are extensive collections of minerals and models, a library of 18,000
                    volumes, and in a separate building laboratories for chemistry, metallurgy, and
                    assaying. Among its distinguished scholars it reckons Werner (who was also a
                    professor there), Humboldt, Mohs, and Jameson. Freiberg has extensive
                    manufactures of gold and silver lace, woollen cloths, linen and cotton goods,
                    iron, copper, and brass wares, shot, gunpowder, and white-lead. It has also
                    several large breweries. In the vicinity are numerous mines of silver, lead,
                    copper, and cobalt, affording employment to about 6000 miners. The old castle of
                    Freudenstein or Freistein, situated in one of its suburbs, is now used as a corn
                    magazine. In the grounds of the castle a monument was erected to Werner in 1851,
                    and one to those who fell in the Franco-German war was erected in 1874. The
                    cathedral, an elegant Gothic edifice, founded in the 12th century and rebuilt in
                    the 15th century, after its almost complete destruction by fire, has a richly
                    adorned portal in the Byzantine style, called the Golden Gate. It contains
                    numerous monuments, among which is one in memory of Prince Maurice of Saxony,
                    who fell in the battle of Sievershausen in 1553. In the lady chapel adjoining
                    are the remains of Henry the Pious and his successors down to John George IV.,
                    who died in 1694. Among the other public buildings are the oldtown hall, dating
                    from the 15th century, the gymnasium, the real school, the female burgher
                    school, the new law courts, the cavalry barracks, the antiquarian museum, and
                    the natural history museum. Freiberg owes its rise to the discovery of its
                    silver mines in the 12th century. The castle of Freudenstein was erected for its
                    defence about 1175, and the town was surrounded by walls in 1187. It was a long
                    time one of the summer residences of the Saxon princes. The population in 1875
                    was 23,559.</p>
