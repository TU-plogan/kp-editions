                    electrician, and philosopher, was born at Newington, Surrey, 22d September 1791,
                    and died at Hampton Court, 25th August 1867. His parents had migrated from
                    Yorkshire to London, where his father worked as a blacksmith. Faraday himself
                    became apprenticed to Mr Riebau, a bookbinder. The letters written to his friend
                    Benjamin Abbott at this time give a lucid account of his aims in life, and of
                    his methods of self-culture, when his mind was beginning to turn to the
                    experimental study of nature. In 1812 Mr Dance, a customer of his master, took
                    him to hear four lectures by Sir Humphry Davy. Faraday took notes of these
                    lectures, and afterwards wrote them out in a fuller form. Under the
                    encouragement of Mr Dance, he wrote to Sir H. Davy, enclosing these notes. “The
                    reply was immediate, kind, and favourable.” He continued to work as a journeyman
                    bookbinder till 1st March 1813, when, at the recommendation of Sir H. Davy, he
                    was appointed assistant in the laboratory of the Royal Institution of Great
                    Britain. He was appointed director of the laboratory 7th February 1825; and in
                    1833 he was appointed Fullerian professor of chemistry in the Institution for
                    life, without the obligation to deliver lectures. He thus remained in the
                    Institution for 54 years. He accompanied Sir H. Davy in a tour through France,
                    Italy, Switzerland, Tyrol, Geneva, &lt;fcc., from October 13, 1813, to April 23,
                    1815.</p>
                <p>Faraday’s earliest chemical work was in the paths opened by Davy, to whom he
                    acted as assistant He made a special study of chlorine, and discovered two new
                    chlorides of carbon. He also made the first rough experiments on the diffusion
                    of gases, a phenomenon first pointed out by Dalton, the physical importance of
                    which has been more fully brought to light by Graham and Loschmidt. He succeeded
                    in liquefying several gases; he investigated the alloys of steel, and produced
                    several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of
                    these heavy glasses afterwards became historically important as the substance in
                    which Faraday detected the rotation of the plane of polarization of light when
                    the glass was placed in the magnetic field, and also as the substance which was
                    first repelled by the poles of the magnet. He also endeavoured with some success
                    to make the general methods of chemistry, as distinguished from its results, the
                    subject of special study and of popular exposition. See his work on <hi
                    rend="italic">Chemicdl Manipulation.</hi></p>
                <p>But Faraday’s chemical work, however important in itself, was soon completely
                    overshadowed by his electrical discoveries. The first experiment which he has
                    recorded was the construction of a voltaic pile with seven halfpence, seven
                    disks of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. With
                    this pile he decomposed sulphate of magnesia (first letter to Abbott, July 12,
                    1812). Henceforward, whatever other subjects might from time to time claim his
                    attention, it was from among electrical phenomena that he selected those
                    problems to which he applied the full force of his mind, and which he kept
                    persistently in view, even when year after year his attempts to solve them had
                    been baffled.</p>
                <p>His first notable discovery was the production of the continuous rotation of
                    magnets and of wires conducting the electric current round each other. _ The
                    consequences deducible from the great discovery of Örsted (21st July 1820) were
                    still in 1821 apprehended in a somewhat confused manner even by the foremost men
                    of science. Dr Wollaston indeed had formed the expectation that he could make
                    the conducting wire rotate on its own axis, and in April 1821 he came with Sir
                    H. Davy to the laboratory of the Royal Institution to make an experiment.
                    Faraday was not there at the time, but coming in afterwards he heard the
                    conversation on the expected rotation of the wire.</p>
                <p>In July, August, and September of that year Faraday, at the request of Mr
                    Phillips, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Philosophy,</hi> wrote
                    for that journal an historical sketch of electromagnetism, and he repeated
                    almost all the experiments ho described. This led him in the beginning of
                    September to discover the method of producing the continuous rotation of the
                    wire round the magnet, and of the magnet round the wire. He did not succeed in
                    making the wire or the magnet revolve on its own axis. This first success of
                    Faraday in electromagnetic research became the occasion of the most painful,
                    though unfounded, imputations a&lt;minst his honour. Into these we shall not
                    enter, referring<pb break="no"

                    Faraday,</hi> by Dr Bence Jones.</p>
                <p>We may remark, however, that although the fact of the tangential force between an
                    . electric current and a magnetic pole was clearly stated by Orsted, and clearly
                    apprehended by Ampdre, Wollaston, and others, the realization of the continuous
                    rotation of the wire and the magnet round each other was a scientific puzzle
                    requiring no mean ingenuity for its original solution. For on the one hand the
                    electric current always forms a closed circuit, and on the other the two poles
                    of the magnet have equal but opposite properties, and are inseparably connected,
                    so that whatever tendency there is for one pole to circulate round the current
                    in one direction is opposed by the equal tendency of the other pole to go round
                    the other way, and thus the one pole can neither drag the other round and round
                    the wire nor yet leave it behind. The thing cannot be done unless we adopt in
                    some form Faraday’s ingenious solution, by causing the current, in some part of
                    its course, to divide into two channels, one on each side of the magnet, in such
                    a way that during the revolution of the magnet the current is transferred from
                    the channel in front of the magnet to the channel behind it, so that the middle
                    of the magnet can pass across the current without stopping it, just as Cyrus
                    caused his army to pass dryshod over the Gyndes by diverting the river into a
                    channel cut for it in his rear.</p>
                <p>We must now go on to the crowning discovery of the induction of electric
                    currents.</p>
                <p>In December 1824 he had attempted to obtain an electric current by means of a
                    magnet, and on three occasions he had made elaborate but unsuccessful attempts
                    to produce a current in one wire by means of a current in another wire or by a
                    magnet. He still persevered, and on the 29th August 1831 he obtained the first
                    evidence that an electric current can induce another in a different circuit. On
                    September 23 he writes to his friend R. Phillips—“I am busy just now again on
                    electromagnetism, and think I have got hold of a good thing, but can’t say. It
                    may be a weed instead of a fish that, after all my labour, I may at last pull
                    up.” This was his first successful experiment. In nine more days of
                    experimenting he had arrived at the results described in his first series of
                    “Experimental Researches” read to the Royal Society, November 24, 1841,</p>
                <p>By the intense application of his mind he had brought the new idea, in less than
                    three months from its first development, to a state of perfect maturity. The
                    magnitude and originality of Faraday’s achievement may be estimated by tracing
                    the subsequent history of his discovery. A3 might be expected, it was at once
                    made the subject of investigation by the whole scientific world, but some of the
                    most experienced physicists were unable to avoid mistakes in stating, in what
                    they conceived to be more scientific language than Faraday’s, the phenomena
                    before them. Up to the present time the mathematicians who have rejected
                    Faraday’s method of stating his law as unworthy of the precision of their
                    science have never succeeded in devising any essentially different formula which
                    shall fully express the phenomena without introducing hypotheses about the
                    mutual action of things which have no physical existence, such as elements of
                    currents which flow out of nothing, then along a wire, and finally sink into
                    nothing again.</p>
                <p>After nearly half a century of labour of this kind, we may say that, though the
                    practical applications of Faraday’s discovery have increased and are increasing
                    in number and value every year, no exception to the statement of these laws as
                    given by Faraday has been discovered, no new law has been added to them, and
                    Faraday’s original statement remains to this day the only one which asserts no
                    more than can be verified by experiment, and the only one by which the theory of
                    the phenomena can be expressed in a manner which is exactly and numerically
                    accurate, and at the same time within the range of elementary methods of
                    exposition.</p>
                <p>During his first period of discovery, besides the induction of electric currents,
                    Faraday established the identity of the electrification produced in different
                    ways; the law of the definite electrolytic action of the current; and the fact,
                    upon which he laid great stress, that every unit of positive electrification is
                    related in a definite manner to a unit of negative electrification, so that it
                    is impossible to produce what Faraday called “an absolute charge of electricity”
                    of one kind not related to an equal charge of the opposite kind.</p>
                <p>He also discovered the difference of the capacities of different substances for
                    taking part in electric induction, a fact which has only in recent years been
                    admitted by continental electricians. It appears, however, from hitherto
                    unpublished papers that Henry Cavendish had before 1773 not only discovered that
                    glass, wax, rosin, and shellac have higher specific inductive capacities than
                    air, but had actually determined the numerical ratios of these capacities. This,
                    of course, was unknown both to Faraday and to all other electricians of his
                    time.</p>
                <p>The first period of Faraday’s electrical discoveries lasted ten years. In 1841 he
                    found that he required rest, and it was not till 1845 that he entered on his
                    second great period of research, in which he discovered the effect of magnetism
                    on polarized light, and the phenomena of diamagnetism.</p>
                <p>Faraday had for a long time kept in view the possibility of using a ray of
                    polarized light as a means of investigating the condition of transparent bodies
                    when acted on by electric and magnetic forces. Dr Bence Jones <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Life of Faraday,</hi> vol. i. p. 362) gives the following note from his
                    laboratory book, 10th September 1822 :—</p>
                <p>“Polarized a ray of lamp-light by reflexion, and endeavoured to ascertain whether
                    any depolarizing action (was) exerted on it by water placed between the poles of
                    a voltaic battery in a glass cistern; one Wollaston’s trough used; the fluids
                    decomposed were pure water, weak solution of sulphate of soda, and strong
                    sulphuric acid; none of them had any effect on the polarized light, either when
                    out of or in the voltaic circuit, so that no particular arrangement of particles
                    could be ascertained in this way.”</p>
                <p>Eleven years afterwards we find another entry in his notebook on 2d May 1833 <hi
                    rend="italic">{Life,</hi> by Dr Bence Jones, vol. ii. p. 29). He then tried, not
                    only the effect of a steady current, but the effect on making and breaking
                    contact.</p>
                <p>“I do not think, therefore, that decomposing solutions or substances will be
                    found to have (as a consequence of decomposition or arrangement for the time)
                    any effect on the polarized ray. Should now try non-decomposing bodies, as solid
                    nitre, nitrate of silver, borax, glass, &amp;c., whilst solid, to see if any
                    internal state induced, which by decomposition is destroyed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> whether, when they cannot decompose, any state of electrical tension
                    is present. My borate of glass good, and common electricity better than
                    voltaic.”</p>
                <p>On May 6 he makes further experiments, and concludes—“Heuce I see no reason to
                    expect that any kind of structure or tension can be rendered evident, either in
                    decomposing or non-decomposing bodies, in insulating or conducting states.”</p>
                <p>Experiments similar to the last-mentioned have recently been made by Dr Kerr of
                    Glasgow, who considers that he has obtained distinct evidence of action on a ray
                    of polarized light when the electric force is perpendicular to the ray and
                    inclined 45° to the plane of polarization. Many physicists, however, have found
                    themselves unable to obtain Dr Kerr’s result.</p>
                <p>At last, in 1845, Faraday attacked the old problem, but this time with complete
                    success. Before we describe this result we may mention that in 1862 he made the
                    relation between magnetism and light the subject of his very last experimental
                    work. He endeavoured, but in vain, to detect any change in the lines of the
                    spectrum of a flame when the flame was acted on by a powerful magnet.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0040-0031"/>
                <p>This long series of researches is an instance of his persistence. His energy is
                    shown in the way in which he followed up his discovery in the single instance in
                    which he was successful. The first evidence which he obtained of the rotation of
                    the plane of polarization of light under the action of magnetism was on the 13th
                    September 1845, the transparent substance being his own heavy glass.</p>
                <p>He began to work on August 30,1845, on polarized light passing through
                    electrolytes. After three days he worked with common electricity, trying glass,
                    heavy optical glass, quartz, Iceland spar, all without effect, as on former
                    trials. On September 13 he worked with lines of magnetic force. Air, flint,
                    glass, rock-crystal, calcareous spar, were examined but without effect.</p>
                <p>“Heavy glass was experimented with. It gave no effects when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >same magnetic poles or</hi> the <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi> poles were on
                    opposite sides (as respects the course of the polarized ray), nor when the same
                    poles were on the same side either with the constant or intermitting current.
                    But when contrary magnetic poles were on the same side there was an effect
                    produced on the polarized ray, and thus magnetic force and light were proved to
                    have relations to each other. This fact will most likely prove exceedingly
                    fertile, and of great value in the investigation of the conditions of natural
                    force.”</p>
                <p>He immediately goes on to examine other substances, but with “no effect,” and he
                    ends by saying, “Have got enough for to-day.” On September 18 he “does an
                    excellent day’s work.” During September he had four days of work, and in October
                    six, and on 6th November he sent in to the Royal Society the nineteenth series
                    of his “Experimental Researches,” in which the whole conditions of the phenomena
                    are fully specified. The negative rotation in ferromagnetic media is the only
                    fact of importance which remained to be discovered afterwards (by Verdet in
                    1856).</p>
                <p>But his work for the year was not yet over. On November 3 a new horseshoe magnet
                    came home, and Faraday immediately began to experiment on the action in the
                    polarized ray through gases, but with no effect. The following day he repeated
                    an experiment which had given no result on October 6. A bar of heavy glass was
                    suspended by silk between the poles of the new magnet. “When it was arranged,
                    and had come to rest, I found I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> affect it by the
                    magnetic forces and give it position.” By the 6kh December he had sent in to the
                    Royal Society the twentieth, and on 24th December the twenty-first, series of
                    his “Researches,” in which the properties of diamagnetic bodies are fully
                    described. Thus these two great discoveries were elaborated, like his earlier
                    one, in about three months.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarized light, though it
                    did not lead to such important practical applications as some of Faraday’s
                    earlier discoveries, has been of the highest value to science, as furnishing
                    complete dynamical evidence that wherever magnetic force exists there 13 matter,
                    small portions of which are rotating about axes parallel to the direction of
                    that force.</p>
                <p>We have given a few examples of the concentration of his efforts in seeking to
                    identify the apparently different forces of nature, of his far-sightedness in
                    selecting subjects for investigation, of his persistence in the pursuit of what
                    he set before him, of his energy in working out the results of his discoveries,
                    and of the accuracy and completeness with which he made his final statement of
                    the laws of the phenomenon.</p>
                <p>These characteristics of his scientific spirit lie on the sur face of his work,
                    and are manifest to all who read his writings. But there was another side of his
                    character, to the cultivation of which he paid at least as much attention, and
                    which was reserved for his friends, his family, and his church. His letters and
                    his conversation were always full of whatever could awaken a healthy interest,
                    and free from anything that might rouse ill-feeling. When, on rare occasions, he
                    was forced out of the region of science into that of controversy, he stated the
                    facts, and let them make their own way. He was entirely free from pride and
                    undue self-assertion. During the growth of his powers he always thankfully
                    accepted a correction, and made use of every expedient, however humble, which
                    would make his work more effective in every detail. When at length he found his
                    memory failing and his mental powers declining, he gave up, without ostentation
                    or complaint, whatever parts of his work he could no longer carry on according
                    to his own standard of efficiency. When he was no longer able to apply his mind
                    to science, he remained content and happy in the exercise of those kindly
                    feelings and warm affections which he had cultivated no less carefully than his
                    scientific powers.</p>
                <p>The parents of Faraday belonged to the very small and isolated Christian sect
                    which is commonly called after Robert Sandeman. Faraday himself attended the
                    meetings from childhood; at the age of thirty he made public profession of his
                    faith, and during two different periods he discharged the office of elder. His
                    opinion with respect to the relation between his science and his religion is
                    expressed in a lecture on mental education delivered in 1854, and printed at the
                    end of his <hi rend="italic">Researches in Chemistry and Physics.</hi></p>
                <p>“Before entering upon the subject, I must make one distinction which, however it
                    may appear to others, is to me of the utmost importance. High as man is placed
                    above the creatures around him, there is a higher and far more exalted position
                    within his view; and the ways are infinite in which he occupies his thoughts
                    about the fears, or hopes, or expectations of a future life. I believe that the
                    truth of that future cannot be brought to his knowledge by any exertion of his
                    mental powers, however exalted they may be; that it is made known to him by
                    other teaching than his own, and is received through simple belief of the
                    testimony given. Let no one suppose for an instant that the self-education I am
                    about to commend, in respect of the things of this life, extends to any
                    considerations of the hope set before us, as if man by reasoning could find out
                    God. It would be improper here to enter upon this subject farther than to claim
                    an absolute distinction between religious and ordinary belief. I shall be
                    reproached with the weakness of refusing to apply those mental operations which
                    I think good in respect of high thiugs to the very highest. I am content to bear
                    the reproach. Yet even in earthly matters I believe that ‘ the invisible things
                    of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
                    things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead’; and 1 have never seen
                    anything incompatible between those things of man which can be known by the
                    spirit of man which is within him and those higher things concerning his future,
                    which he cannot know by that spirit.”</p>
                <p>Faraday gives the following note as to this lecture :—</p>
                <p>“These observations were delivered as a lecture before His Royal Highness the
                    Prince Consort and the members of the Royal Institution on the 6th of May 1854.
                    They are so immediately connected in their nature and origin with my own
                    experimental life, considered either as cause or consequence, that I have
                    thought the close of this volume not an unfit place for their reproduction.”</p>
                <p>As Dr Bence Jones concludes—</p>
                <p>“His standard of duty was supernatural. It was not founded on any intuitive ideas
                    of right and wrong, nor was it fashioned upon any outward experiences of time
                    and place, but it was formed entirely on what he held to be the revelation of
                    the will of God in the written word, and throughout all his life his faith led
                    him to act up to the very letter of it.”</p>
