                <p><label type="entry">FONTANA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Prospero</hi></label>
                    (1512-1597), a painter, was born in Bologna, and became a pupil of Innocenzo da
                    Imola. He afterwards worked for Vasari and Pierino del Vaga. It was probably
                    from Vasari that Fontana acquired a practice of offhand, self-displaying work.
                    He undertook a multitude of commissions, and was so rapid that he painted, it is
                    said, in a few weeks an entire hall in the Vitelli Palace at Città di Castello.
                    Along with daring, he had fertility of combination, and in works of parade he
                    attained a certain measure of success, although his drawing was incorrect, and
                    his mannerism palpable. He belongs to the degenerate period of the Bolognese
                    school, under the influence chiefly of the imitators of Raphael—Sabbatini,
                    Sammachini, and Passerotti being three of his principal colleagues. His soundest
                    successes were in portraiture, in which branch of art he stood so high that
                    towards 1550 Michelangelo introduced him to Pope Julius III. as a
                    portrait-painter; and he was pensioned by this pope, and remained at the
                    pontifical court with the three successors of Julius. Here he lived on a grand
                    scale, and figured as a sort of arbiter and oracle among his professional
                    brethren. Returning to Bologna, he opened a school of art, in which he became
                    the preceptor of Lodovico and Agostino Caracci; but these pupils, standing forth
                    as reformers and innovators, finally extinguished the academy and the vogue of
                    Fontana. His subjects were in the way of sacred and profane history and of
                    fable. He has left a large quantity of work in Bologna, -—the picture of the
                    Adoration of the Magi, in the Church of S. Maria delle Grazie, being considered
                    his masterpiece— not unlike the style of Paul Veronese. His death took place in
                    Rome in 1597.</p>
