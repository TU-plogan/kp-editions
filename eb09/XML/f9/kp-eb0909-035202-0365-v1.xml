                <p><label type="entry">FLYING-FISH</label> are of two different kinds. The one <hi
                        rend="italic">(Dactylopterus)</hi> belongs to the Gurnard family <hi
                        rend="italic">(Triglidae),</hi> and is more properly called Flying Gurnard;
                    the other <hi rend="italic">(Exocaetus)</hi> has been called Flying Herring,
                    though more nearly allied to the Gar-pike than to the Herring. Some other fishes
                    with long pectoral fins (<hi rend="italic">Pterois)</hi> have been stated to be
                    able to fly, but this has been proved to be incorrect. The Flying Gurnards are
                    much less numerous than the <hi rend="italic">Exocaeti</hi> with regard to
                    individuals as well as species, there being only three or four species known of
                    the former, whilst more than fifty have been described of the latter, which,
                    besides, are found in numerous shoals of thousands. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bactylopteri</hi> may be readily distinguished by a large bony head armed
                    with spines, hard keeled scales, two dorsal fins, &lt;fcc. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Exocaeti</hi> have thin, deciduous scales, only one dorsal fin, and the
                    ventrals placed far backwards, below the middle of the body; some have long
                    barbels at the chin. In both kinds the pectoral fins are greatly prolonged and
                    enlarged, modified into an organ of flight, and in many species of <hi
                        rend="italic">Exocaetus</hi> the ventral fins are similarly enlarged, and
                    evidently assist in the aerial evolutions of these fishes. Flying fishes are
                    found in the tropical and subtropical seas only, and it is a singular fact that
                    the geographical distribution of the two kinds is nearly identical. The
                    literature on the subject of flying fishes is very extensive, and great
                    diversity of opinion exists among observers as regards the mode and power of
                    their flight; but the most reliable agree that the fishes do not leave the water
                    for the purpose of catching insects, and that they are unable to move their fins
                    in the manner of a bat or bird, or to change voluntarily the direction of their
                    flight, or to fly beyond a very limited distance. The most recent inquiries are
                    those of K. Möbius <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Bewegungen der
                        Fliegenden Fische durch die Luft,</hi> Leip. 1878, 8vo), the chief results
                    of which may be summed up thus. Flying fish are more frequently observed in
                    rough weather and in a disturbed sea than during calms; they dart out of the
                    water when pursued by their enemies or frightened by an approaching vessel, but
                    frequently also without any apparent cause, as is also observed in many other
                    fishes; and they rise without regard to the direction of the wind or waves. The
                    fins are kept quietly distended, without any motion, except an occasional
                    vibration caused by the air whenever the surface of the wing is parallel with
                    the current of the wind. Their flight is rapid, but gradually decreasing in
                    velocity, greatly exceeding that of a ship going 10 miles an hour and a distance
                    of 500 feet. Generally it is longer when the fishes fly against, than with or at
                    an angle to, the wind. Any vertical or horizontal deviation from a straight line
                    is not caused at the will of the fish, but by currents of the air; thus they
                    retain a horizontally straight course when flying with or against the wind, but
                    are carried towards the right or left whenever the direction of the wind is at
                    an angle with that of their flight. However, it sometimes happens that the fish
                    during its flight immerses its caudal fin in the water, and by a stroke of its
                    tail turns towards the right or left. In a calm the line of their flight is
                    always also vertically straight or rather parabolic, like the course of a
                    projectile, but it may become undulated in a rough sea, when they are flying
                    against the course of the waves; they then frequently overtop each wave, being
                    carried over it by the pressure of the disturbed air. Flying fish often fall on
                    board of vessels, but this never happens during a calm or from the lee side, but
                    during a breeze only and from the weather side. In day time they avoid a ship,
                    flying away from it, but during the night, when they arc unable to see, they
                    frequently fly against the weatherboard, where they are caught by the current of
                    the air, and carried upwards to a height of 20 feet above the surface of the
                    water, whilst under ordinary circumstances they keep close to it. All these
                    observations point clearly to the fact that any deflexion from a straight course
                    is due to external circumstances, and not to voluntary action on the part of the
                    fish.</p>
