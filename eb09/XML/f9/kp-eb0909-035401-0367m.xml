                    French family which flourished from the 11th to the 16th century. The title was
                    first assumed by Roger, nephew of Peter Roger count of Carcassonne, on his
                    inheriting the town of Foix with the adjoining lands from his uncle. He died in
                    1064, and was succeeded by his brother Peter, who died in 1070 and was succeeded
                    by his eldest son Roger II. This count was excommunicated by Pope Pascal II. for
                    taking possession of ecclesiastical property, but in 1095 he took part in the
                    crusade, and afterwards by rich donations made his peace with the church. He
                    died in 1125, and was succeeded by Roger III., who on his death in 1141 was
                    succeeded by his eldest son Roger Bernard I. Roger Bernard was succeeded in 1188
                    by his only son Raymond Roger, who in 1190 accompanied Philip Augustus to the
                    Holy Land, and distinguished himself at the capture of Acre. He was afterwards
                    engaged in the wars of the Albigenses, and on his being accused of heresy, Simon
                    de Montfort was put in possession of his estates. He, however, made his peace
                    with the church some time before his death, which took place in 1223 from
                    exposure and fatigue at the siege of Mirepoix. This count was a patron of the
                    Provençal poets, and reckoned himself one of their number. He was succeeded by
                    his son Roger Bernard II., surnamed the Great, who distinguished himself in the
                    wars against the Albigenses, joined in an alliance against Louis VIII. of
                    France, lost his lands but succeeded in regaining them, was twice excommunicated
                    but obtained absolution, and died in 1241 in the abbey of Bolbone, where he was
                    for a short time a monk. Roger IV., his son and successor, did homage for his
                    lands to the king of France and the count of Carcassonne. He died in 1265. His
                    son and successor, Roger Bernard III., was more famous as a poet than a warrior.
                    He was taken prisoner by Philip the Bold and again by Peter III. of Aragon; and
                    before his death in 1302 began the quarrel of the house of Foix with that of
                    Armagnac. His son and successor, Gaston I., continued the war, was
                    excommunicated in 1308 by Clement V. and imprisoned in the Châtelet, Paris, but,
                    regaining his freedom shortly afterwards, joined Louis X. in 1315 in the
                    expedition against Holland, and died on the way home. To him succeeded his
                    eldest son Gaston IL, who became reconciled with the house of Armagnac, joined
                    the Navarrese in their wars against the Castilians, over whom he won a great
                    victory at Tudela in 1335, took part in the war of the French against the
                    English in 1337, and in 1343 assisted Alphonso XL of Castile against the Moors.
                    He died at Seville in September of the same year. His son Gaston III.
                    (1331-1391), surnamed on account of his beauty Phaebus, was the most famous of
                    the old Foix family. He took part in the wars against the English in 1345, and
                    was on that account appointed by the king of France governor of Languedoc and
                    Gascony. In 1346 he married Agnes of Navarre, but on account of a dispute with
                    her brother Charles the Bad, he divorced her in 1373. On suspicion of being
                    concerned in a conspiracy in conjunction with his brother-in-law he in 1356
                    suffered a short imprisonment in the Châtelet. After obtaining· his release he
                    took part in the wars against the heretics of Prussia, and on his return in 1358
                    he assisted in releasing the royal princesses from the hands of the Jacquerie at
                    Meaux. In the same year he recommenced the quarrels with the house of Armagnac,
                    and took the count of Armagnac prisoner at the battle of Launac in 1372. In 1380
                    he was again appointed governor of Languedoc by Charles V., but that king dying
                    the same year the regency replaced the count of Foix by the duke of Berry.
                    Gaston defeated and slew the duke, but was afterwards induced to resign his
                    claims. In 1390 Gaston entertained Charles VI. in his castle of Mazères, and
                    agreed for a sum of money to make him heir of his dominions. He died suddenly of
                    apoplexy the same year when returning from the chase. Shortly after his death
                    Charles VI. ceded the estate of Foix to Matthew, great-great-grandson of Roger
                    I., who died without issue in 1398. On his death his sister’s husband
                    Archambault de Grailly took possession of the estates, and in 1401 assumed the
                    title. Dying in 1412 he was succeeded by his son Jean de Grailly, who became
                    governor-general of Languedoc, Auvergne, and Guienne, and, dying in 1436, was
                    succeeded by his son Gaston IV., who took part in the wars of Charles VII.
                    against the English, and was raised to the peerage of France. Gaston’s
                    father-in-law, Jean II. of Navarre, declared him in 1455 his successor; and
                    Louis XI. conferred on him the seignory of Carcassonne and the countships of
                    Roussillon and Cerdagne. In 1471 he joined in a league against Louis, which,
                    however, was rendered abortive by the death of the king’s brother. On the death
                    of Gaston in 1472, the house of Foix became mergedin that of Navarre.</p>
