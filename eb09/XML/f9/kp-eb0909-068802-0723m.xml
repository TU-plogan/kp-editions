                    a goldsmith named Francia, and from him probably he got the nickname whereby he
                    is generally known; he, moreover, studied design under Marco Zoppo. The youth
                    was thus originally a goldsmith, and also an engraver of dies and niellos, and
                    in these arts he became extremely eminent. He was particularly famed for his
                    dies for medals; he rose to be mint-master at Bologna, and retained that office
                    till the end of his life. A famous medal of Pope Julius II. as liberator of
                    Bologna is ascribed to his hand, but not with certainty. At a mature age—having
                    first, it appears, become acquainted with Mantegna—he turned his attention to
                    painting. His earliest known picture is dated 1494 (not 1490, as ordinarily
                    stated). It shows so much mastery that one is compelled to believe that
                    Raibolini must .before then have practised painCing for some few years. This
                    work is now in the Bologna gallery,—the Virgin enthroned, with Augustine and
                    five other saints. It is an oil picture, and was originally painted for the
                    church of S. Maria della Misericordia, at the desire of the Bentivoglio family,
                    the rulers of Bologna. The same patrons employed him upon frescos in their own
                    palace; one of Judith and Holophernes is especially noted, its style recalling
                    that of Mantegna. Francia probably studied likewise the works of Perugino; and
                    he became a friend and ardent admirer of Raphael, to whom he addressed an
                    enthusiastic sonnet. Raphael cordially responded to the Bolognese master’s
                    admiration, and said, in a letter dated in 1508, that few painters or none had
                    produced Madonnas more beautiful, more devout, or better portrayed than those of
                    Francia. If we may trust Vasari—but it is difficult to suppose that he was
                    entirely correct—the exceeding value which Francia set on Raphael’s art brought
                    him to his grave. Raphael had consigned to Francia his famous picture of St
                    Cecilia, destined for the church of S. Giovanni in Monte, Bologna; and Francia,
                    on inspecting it, took so much to heart his own inferiority, at the advanced age
                    of about sixty-six, to the youthful Umbrian, that he sickened and shortly
                    expired. Distanced though he may have been by Raphael, Francia is rightly
                    regarded as the greatest painter of the earlier Bolognese school, and hardly to
                    be surpassed as representing the art termed “antico-moderno,” or of the
                    “quattrocento.” It has been well observed that his style is a medium between
                    that of Porugino and that of Giovanni Bellini; he has somewhat more of
                    spontaneous naturalism than the former, and of abstract dignity in feature and
                    form than the latter. The magnificent portrait in the Louvre of a young man in
                    black, of brooding thoughtfulness and saddened profundity of mood, would alone
                    suffice to place Francia among the very great masters, if it could with
                    confidence be attributed to his hand, but in all probability its real author was
                    Franciabigio; it had erewhile passed under the name of Raphael, of Giorgione, or
                    of Sebastian del Piombo. The London National Gallery contains two remarkably
                    fine specimens of Francia, once combined together as principal picture and
                    lunette,—the Virgin and Child and St Anne enthroned, surrounded by saints, and
                    (in the lunette) the Pietà, or lamentation of angels over the dead Saviour. They
                    come from the Buonvisi chapel in the church of S. Frediano, Lucca. Other leading
                    works are—in Munich, the Virgin sinking on her knees in adoration of the Divine
                    Infant, who is lying in a garden within a rose trellis; in the Borghese Gallery,
                    Rome, a Peter Martyr; in Bologna, the frescos in the church of St Cecilia,
                    illustrating the life of the saint, all of them from the design of Raibolini,
                    but not all executed by himself; a public passage now traverses these frescos,
                    and they are in a pitiful state of decay. His landscape backgrounds are of
                    uncommon excellence. Francia had more than 200 scholars. Marcantonio Raimondi
                    the famous engraver is now the most renowned of them; next to him, the painter
                    Lorenzo Costa; also Amico Aspertini, and Francia’s own son Giacomo, and his
                    cousin Julio.</p>
