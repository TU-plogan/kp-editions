                    writer, whose essays were extremely popular during the 17th century. He is
                    believed to have been the son of Thomas Feltham or Felltham of Mutford in
                    Suffolk, and he was probably born about 1609. He was secretary to the earl of
                    Thomond, under whose roof he wrote, when a youth of eighteen, a volume of one
                    hundred <hi rend="italic">Resolves, Divine, Moral, and Political,</hi> short and
                    pithy essays, of which two editions saw the light in 1628. Of this book, which
                    the author constantly augmented, eleven editions were printed before 1700 and
                    several since. To later issues of the <hi rend="italic">Resolves</hi> Feltham
                    appended <hi rend="italic">Lusoria,</hi> a collection of forty poems. Hardly
                    anything is known of his life, except that Randolph addressed a poem of
                    compliment to him, and became his friend, and that Feltham attacked Ben Jonson
                    in an ode shortly before the aged poet’s death, but contributed a flattering
                    elegy to the <hi rend="italic">Jonsomιs</hi><hi rend="italic">Virbius</hi> in
                    1638. Early in life Feltham visited Flanders, and published his observations in
                    1652 under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Brief Character of the Low
                    Countries.</hi> He was a Royalist and a strict high-churchman. It is supposed
                    that he died soon after 1677. Hallam, with excessive severity, has stigmatized
                    Feltham as one of our worst writers. He has not, indeed, the elegance of Bacon,
                    whom he emulated, and he is often obscure and affected after the fashion of his
                    time; but his copious imagery and genuine penetration give his reflections a
                    charm to those who have leisure to peruse them. To the middle classes of the
                    17th century he seemed a heaven-sent philosopher and guide, and was only less
                    popular than Quarles the emblematist.</p>
