                    figure of a twofold and in some respects antithetical type,—on the one hand the
                    deliberate choice of evil, on the other an unsatisfied aspiration towards the
                    highest good. The development of the latter conception-from the former—of
                    Goethe’s Faust from the mediaeval Faustus—is an interesting study in itself, and
                    affords a curious example of the accretions and modifications incidental to
                    popular myths. The Faustus of tradition arose from the fusion of two more
                    primitive conceptions,—that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n64/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0064-0055"/> of a compact with the evil one, of which the
                    Theophilus of ecclesiastical legend supplies the typical example, and that of
                    the subjugation of the infernal powers by intellectual pre-eminence, as in the
                    cases of Virgil, Pope Sylvester, and Michael Scott. Early in the sixteenth
                    century the two currents of tradition united in the person of an adventurer
                    calling himself Faustus the Youuger, from which it may be inferred that the name
                    had already become typical. ' The existence of an elder Faustus cannot, however,
                    be proved; nor can he, as sometimes suggested, be identified with Gutenberg’s
                    coadjutor, the printer Fust. A conjuring book bearing his name <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dr Faust's</hi><hi rend="italic">Dreifacher</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hollenzwanf}</hi> exists in several MSS. dated early in the sixteenth century,
                    and has been published in the magical collections of Scheible and Horst. It
                    nevertheless appears from the style to be at least a century later. The younger
                    Faust’s own existence has been disputed, but apparently on no good grounds. He
                    is mentioned as a contemporary by Trithemius (1507), Mutianus Rufus (1513),
                    Begardi (1539), and Gast (1548). Trithemius denounces him aβ a charlatan, who
                    purposely shunned him for fear of exposure. Rufus and Gast claim to have been
                    actually in his company. The former entertains the same opinion of him as
                    Trithemius; the latter considers that a learned dog and horse which accompanied
                    him were probably devils. The same judicious author vouches for his having been
                    carried away by the demon in or about the year 1525. Thie catastrophe is also
                    mentioned in an inscription on a picture still extant in Auerbach’s cellar at
                    Leipsic, bearing that date, and depicting the feats familiar to Goethe’s
                    readers. Further particulars are given by Wier in his well known work <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">praestigiis daemonum,</hi> and in
                    Manlius’s <hi rend="italic">Locorum communium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >collectanea</hi> (1562), in a passage often erroneously attributed to
                    Melanchthon, whose conversation Manlius is not reporting on this occasion.
                    According to him, Faustus was born at Knittlingen in Würtemberg (the popular
                    legend says Rohda in Saxony, and other places are also mentioned), and educated
                    at the university of Cracow. However unworthy of such a distinction, lie had
                    evidently by this time become a popular hero, around whom the floating
                    accumulations of legend respecting such national wizards as the Bohemian .Zyto,
                    the English Friars Bacon and Rush, and the Polish Twardowski were gradually
                    tending to group themselves. These ultimately took shape in the standard version
                    of Faustus’s life, published at Frankfort by Johannes Spiess in 1587. This
                    remarkable book, the work of an anonymous scholar acquainted with Latin, first
                    mentions Mephistophiles as the name of Faustus’s familiar spirit, introduces new
                    elements suggested by the compiler’s animosity to Rome, and gives especial
                    prominence to the traditions which represent Faustus in connexion with classical
                    mythology. The effect is to exalt his importance as a type by exhibiting him as
                    in some sort a representative of free thought and free learning, thus paving the
                    way for Goethe’s more profound interpretation of his alleged compact with the
                    fiend. The more obvious tragic aspects of the situation were magnificently
                    brought out by Marlowe, whose tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Faustus,</hi> founded
                    on an English translation of the German narrative, is thought to have appeared
                    as early as 1589. Marlowe’s play contains some of the finest dramatic poetry in
                    our language, and he dwells with especial delight on Faustus’s evocation of
                    Helen, which by education and sympathy he was peculiarly qualified to apprehend.
                    It was inevitable, however, that he should be principally studious of dramatic
                    effect; and the perception of the full significance of this episode, as well as
                    of the story generally, was reserved for a more reflective age. A more homely
                    moral was drawn by Faustus’s next biographer, Johann Wiedemann, who (1599)
                    rewrote the narrative from an edifying point of view, interspersing copious
                    historical parallels and theological disquisitions,—which latter, indeed, are
                    not wanting in the earlier version,—and omitting what he deemed unsuitable for
                    pious ears. His pedantic labours, subsequently revised in the same spirit by
                    Pfitzer (1664), unfortunately led to the almost total disappearance of the older
                    narrative, except in the abridged form of a chap book, in which it has survived
                    nearly to our own times, and has even bçen reprinted in America. Another
                    development of the myth was now at hand—the dramatic. It formed the theme of <hi
                    rend="italic">Justi</hi><hi rend="italic">Placidii</hi><hi rend="italic">infelix
                    prudentia,</hi> a play in Latin verse published at Leipsic in 1598. By 1618, as
                    appears from Ayrer’s <hi rend="italic">Opus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theatricum,</hi> a play on the subject was a stock piece on the boards of the
                    German puppet-theatre. Heine thinks that it w as introduced by the English
                    itinerant players who traversed Germany at the time,—a supposition confirmed by
                    Lessing’s previous indication of an English element in the text These marionette
                    pieces long maintained themselves as a popular entertainment. Zedler mentions
                    them as still frequently performed in 1735; Heine saw the story of Faustus thus
                    represented as late as 1826. It was not committed to writing, and was partly
                    extemporized for the occasion. Restorations have nevertheless been given by
                    Scheible (1847), Hamm (1850), and Engel (1872). Such representations undoubtedly
                    served to keep the legend alive until it met with critics and poets able to
                    discern its significance in the persons of Lessing and Goethe. The original
                    draft of the latter’s <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> as pointed out by Heine, is
                    almost entirely based upon the puppet representation. Lessing’s interest in
                    Faust is believed to have been awakened by a performance of the old play at
                    Berlin in 1753. He took up the subject shortly afterwards, and, according to his
                    own statement, at different periods of his life sketched out the ground plan of
                    two versions,—the first on the lines of the original legend, the second without
                    any supernatural element. Both are said, on his own authority, to have been
                    nearly completed in December 1775, but were probably lost in the following year,
                    along with a trunk containing other MSS. An anonymous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faust</hi> appeared in 1775 at Munich, and has recently been republished as
                    Lessing’s, which it certainly is not. The conception of Goethe’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust</hi> was formed as early as 1770, and, according to the
                    contemporary testimony of Merck, the composition had made great progress as
                    early as 1775. The first part, notwithstanding, was not completed until 1807,
                    nor the second until 1831. The analysis of this wonderful work will fall more
                    appropriately under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Goethe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q. υ.).</hi> It need only be remarked here that, while Goethe has
                    finally achieved the transformation of Faustus from a vulgar conjuror into a
                    personification of humanity in one of its most interesting phases, the result,
                    in the first part, is still inadequate to the power of the machinery and the
                    dignity of the situation. As Charles Lamb tersely expressed it, “What has
                    Margaret to do with Faust 1” The much abused and under-rated second part may be
                    regarded as an endeavour to remedy this defect, which might have fully succeeded
                    but for the taste for allegory which had become a mania with Goethe in his later
                    years. The Helena episode is nevertheless a masterpiece, and the fifth act
                    presents the quintessence of Goethe’s wisdom with the authority of a last
                    testament :—</p>

                <p>Among later attempts at a literary treatment of the Faust legend may be mentioned
                    Klinger’s romance, translated into English by Borrow, and chiefly remarkable for
                    the introduction of the Borgia family; Klingemann s unwittingly burlesque
                    tragedy, “the hero of which is not the old Faust driven desperate by the
                    uncertainty of human knowledge, but plain John Faust the printer, driven
                    desperate by an ambitious temper and a total deficiency of <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">;</hi> and Lenau’s poem, partly epic and partly dramatic, not
                    deficient in isolated beauties, but a mere repetition of Goethe in all essential
                    respects. Goethe’s example, as well a3 the generally subjective character of
                    modern poetry, has led to the creation of a number of ideal figures
                    impersonating some particular thought or principle, and betraying more or less
                    affinity to their original. Such are the Manfred of Byron, the Paracelsus of
                    Browning, the Balder of Dobell, the Spiridion of George Sand, the Konrad
                    Wallenrod of Mickiewicz, last and not least remarkable the Brand of the
                    Norwegian poet Ibsen. The affinity between the typical figures of Faustus and
                    Tannhäuser is very powerfully indicated in the last poem of the lyrical
                    collection entitled <hi rend="italic">Der neue Tannhäuser,</hi> by Eduard
                    Grisebach (1871).</p>
