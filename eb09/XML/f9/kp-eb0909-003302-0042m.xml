                    districts; on the W. by the Chandnâ and Madhumati rivers, separating it from
                    Jessor; and on the S. by Bâkarganj. The general aspect of the district is flat,
                    tame, and uninteresting, although in the northern tract the land is
                    comparatively high, with a light sandy soil, covered with water during the rainy
                    season, but dry during the cold and hot weather. From the town of Faridpur the
                    ground slopes, until in the south, on the confines of Bâkarganj, it becomes one
                    immense swamp, never entirely dry. During the height of the inundations the
                    whole district may be said to be under water. The villages are built on
                    artificially raised sites, or the high banks of the deltaic streams. Along many
                    of the larger rivers the line of hamlets is unbroken for miles together, so that
                    it is difficult to say where one ends and another begins. The huts, however,
                    except in markets and bazaars, are seldom close together, but are scattered
                    amidst small garden plots, and groves of mango, date, and betel-nut trees. The
                    plains between the villages are almost invariably more or less depressed towards
                    the centre, where usually a marsh, or lake, or deep lagoon is found. These
                    marshes, however, are gradually filling up by the silt deposited from the
                    rivers; in the north of the district there now only remain two or three large
                    swamps, and in them the process may be seen going on. The climate of Faridpur is
                    damp, like that of the other districts of Eastern Bengal: the average annual
                    rainfall is 85 ’ 42 inches, and the average mean temperature 76 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9° F.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Faridpur are the Ganges, the Ariâl Khân, and the
                    Madhumati. The Ganges, or Padmâ as it is locally called, touches the extreme
                    north-west corner of the district, flows along its northern boundary as far as
                    Goâlandâ, where it receives the waters of the Jamuna or main stream of the
                    Brahmaputra, and whence the united stream turns southwards and forms the eastern
                    boundary of the district. At the confluence of the two great rivers, the current
                    is so strong, and the eddies and whirlpools so numerous, that the most powerful
                    river steamers proceeding up stream during the flood season are often unable to
                    make headway, and have to lie for days at Goâlandâ point until the river
                    subsides. The Padmâ is navigable by the largest cargo boats and river steamers
                    throughout the year, its channel being estimated at an average of 1600 yards.
                    The Ariâl Khân is the principal branch of the Padmâ. It takes off from the right
                    bank of the parent stream a few miles below Faridpur town, and runs a
                    south-easterly and southerly course till it leaves the district and flows into
                    Bâkarganj. The river is navigable by large cargo boats throughout the year, and
                    has an average breadth during the rainy season of 1600 yards. The third great
                    water channel is the Madhumati (a continuation of the Garâi branch of the
                    Padmâ), which forms the western boundary of the district. These rivers, but
                    particularly the Padmâ, are subject to constant alluvial changes on a large
                    scale, and to repeated alterations in their course.</p>
                <p>Rice, the great crop of the district, is divided into four distinct species, each
                    with many minor varieties These are—the <hi rend="italic">aman</hi> or winter
                    rice, which forms the principal harvest, and is the great staple of export; the
                    <hi rend="italic">dus</hi> or autumn rice; and the spring <hi rend="italic"
                    >bοrο</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rdida</hi> rice, both grown in swamps and deep
                    water, and forming the common food of the people. The other cereal crops are
                    wheat, barley, oats, and Indian corn; pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, fibres,
                    sugar cane, date palms, indigo, safflower, betel-leaf, comprise tho remaining
                    important agricultural products. The area of the district, prior to recent
                    changes of boundary, was 1506 square miles, of which 1143 were returned in 1871
                    as under cultivation, 133 as uncultivated but capable of tillage, and 230 as
                    uncultivable. More than one-half of the whole cultivated area is under rice. The
                    only natural calamity to which the district is subject to any serious extent
                    arises from floods, which occasionally cause a general destruction of the crops.
                    The three principal lines of road in Faridpur are the Calcutta and Jessor
                    imperial road, 19 miles in length; Faridpur and Kâlinagar road, 16 miles;
                    Faridpur and Tâlmâ road, 10 miles. The Eastern Bengal Railway ru∏3 for 22 miles
                    from west to east through the north of the district, having its terminus at
                    Goâlandâ, at the junction of the Padmâ and Jamuna rivers.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 showed a population of l,012,5S9, 497,854 males and 514,735
                    females, inhabiting 2307 villages and 157,518 houses. The Mahometans number
                    588,299, or 58 T per cent, of the whole; the Hindus, 420,988, or 41 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent.; Christians, 463; and “others,” 2839. The
                    material condition of the population has considerably improved of late years,
                    owing to the increase of tillage and the general rise in prices of agricultural
                    products. Two towns contain a population exceeding 5000, viz.—(1) Faridpur, the
                    chief town and administrative headquarters of the district: population in 1872,
                    8593; municipal revenue, £319, 3s. 7d.; expenditure, £213, 19s. 2d.; and (2)
                    Sayyidpur: population, 6324; municipal revenue, £91, 4s. 9d.; expenditure, £136,
                    3s. 2d. The other towns or villages of importance as places of trade are—Bhänga,
                    on the Kumar; Gopalganj, on the Madhumati; Boalmari, on the Barâsia; Madhukhali
                    and Betanga, on the Chândnâ; Kanâipur, on the Kumar; and Goalandâ, on the
                    Padmâ.</p>
                <p>The district has rapidly advanced in prosperity under British administration,
                    especially of late years. In 1844-45 the total net revenue amounted to £9616,
                    and the expenditure to £6004; in 1870-71 the net revenue was £58,868, and the
                    expenditure £25,013. The land revenue, which in 1850 amounted to £3803 paid by
                    448 proprietors, had increased in 1870-71 to £27,263, derived from 3126
                    proprietors. The regular police force consisted in 1871 of 341 officers and men,
                    costing £6425. A small municipal force of 20 men is kept up in tho municipal
                    towns of Faridpur and Sayyidpur. ’ Γhe rural police consisted in 1871 of 2026
                    men, and cost £7658, contributed by the landholders and villages. The schools in
                    1872-73 numbered 176, with 6497 pupils.</p>
