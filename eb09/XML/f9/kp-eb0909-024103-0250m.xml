                    district is level, with the exception of a few sand-hills in the south and
                    south-east. The country consists of two distinct tracts, that liable to annual
                    fertilizing inundations from the Sutlej, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bhet,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">rohi</hi> or upland tract The only river
                    is the Sutlej, which runs along the north-western boundary. The census of 1868
                    returned the population at 303,489 males and 245,764 females—total 549,253, of
                    whom 68,406 were Hindus, 245,659 Mahometans, 160,487 Hindus, and 74,701
                    “others.” The area of the district is 2740 square miles, or 1,753,250 acres, of
                    which 1,243,508 are cultivated, 377,722 cultivable, and 132,020 uncultivable and
                    waste. The principal crops are wheat, barley, millet, gram, pulses, oilseeds,
                    cotton, tobacco, &amp;c. The manufactures are of the humblest kind, consisting
                    chiefly of cotton and wool-weaving, and are confined entirely to the supply of
                    local wants.</p>
                <p>The Lahore and Ludhiána road runs for 51 miles through the district, and forms
                    the chief trade route. The chief town and administrative headquarters of the
                    district is Firozpur. The other important towns and seats of commerce are
                    Mahrág, population 5681; Dharmkot, 5379; Moga, 4844; Muktsar, 4694; and Zira,
                    3010. The district revenue in 1872-73 amounted to £61,141, of which £49,713 was
                    derived directly from the land. For the protection of person and property there
                    are 12 revenue and civil and 13 magisterial courts, a regular police force of
                    388 officers and men, a municipal police of 75 men, and a rural constabulary of
                    542 men. For educational purposes 121 schools, attended by 3487 pupils, are
                    maintained or subsidized by the state, at a cost of £1299. Owing principally to
                    the dryness of its climate, Firozpur has the reputation of being an
                    exceptionally healthy district. In September and October, however, after the
                    annual rains, the people suffer a good deal from remittent fever. The average
                    annual rainfall is 20 ’ 9 inches. British rule was first established at Firozpur
                    in 1835, when on the failure of heirs to the Sikh family who possessed it, a
                    small territory 86 miles in extent became an escheat to the British Government,
                    and the present district has been gradually formed around this nucleus. Firozpur
                    was the scene of operations during the first Sikh war. The Sikhs crossed the
                    Sutlej in December 1845, were defeated successively at Mudki, Firozsháh, Aliwál,
                    and Sobráon; after which they withdrew into their own territory, and peace was
                    concluded at Lahore. At the time of the mutiny, Firozpur cantonments contained
                    two regiments of native infantry and a regiment of native cavalry, together with
                    the 61st Foot, and two companies of European artillery. One of the native
                    regiments, the 57th, was disarmed; but the other, the 45th, broke into mutiny,
                    and, after an unsuccessful attempt to seize the magazine, which was held by the
                    Europeans, proceeded to join the rebel forces in Delhi. Throughout the mutiny
                    Firozpur remained in the hands of the English.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Firozpur,</hi> the civil headquarters of the district of the
                    same name, also a military cantonment, is situated on the old bank of the
                    Sutlej, in 30° 57' N. lat. and 74° 10' E. long. The city contains a population
                    of 20,592, according to the census of 1868, of whom 7181 are Hindus, 11,171
                    Mahometans, 1347 Sikhs, and 893 “others.” It has been constituted a municipality
                    of the second class; municipal income in 1872-73, £4033; expenditure, £3962;
                    rate of taxation per head, 3s. lθjd. Firozpur has rapidy advanced in material
                    prosperity of late years, and is now a very important seat of commerce. The main
                    streets of the city are wide and well paved, and the whole is inclosed by a low
                    brick wall. Great improvements have been made in the surroundings of the city.
                    The cantonment lies two miles to the south of the city, and is connected with it
                    by <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0251-0242"/> a good metalled road. The garrison now consists
                    of one regiment of British infantry, one of native infantry, one battery of
                    field and one of garrison artillery. The arsenal to which Firozpur owes its
                    political importance is situated one mile distant from cantonment. It is by far
                    the largest in the province, and well stored with all munitions of war. The
                    population of Firozpur cantonments and military lines amounted in 1868 to
                    15,837.</p>
