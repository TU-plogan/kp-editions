                    Winchester, was his tutor. Immediately after taking his B.A. degree, he
                    transferred his residence (December 1525) to the newly founded college of St
                    Frideswide or Cardinal College (now Christ Church), Oxford, whither, along with
                    other young men of distinguished talent, he had been invited by Wolsey. At

                    to be suspected as a heretic, and led to his imprisonment for some months. On
                    being at the instance of Wolsey released from confinement, towards the close of
                    1526 or early in 1527, ho fled to the Continent, where he appears to have
                    resided chiefly at the newly founded Protestant university of Marburg, and to
                    have been associated with Tyndal in many of the literary labours of the latter.
                    At Marburg he became acquainted with several scholars and Reformers of note, and
                    particularly with the famous Patrick Hamilton. Frith’s first publication in fact
                    was a translation of Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Places,</hi> made shortly
                    after the martyrdom of their author; and soon afterwards the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revelation of Antichrist,</hi> a translation from the German, appeared, along
                    with <hi rend="italic">A Pistle to the Christen Reader,</hi> by “Richard Bright
                    wall” (supposed to be Frith), and <hi rend="italic">An Antithesis wherein are
                    compared togeder Christes</hi><hi rend="italic">Actes</hi><hi rend="italic">and
                    our Holye Father the Popes,</hi> dated “at Malborow in the lande of Hesse,” 12th
                    July 1529. His <hi rend="italic">Disputacyon of Purgatorye,</hi> a treatise in
                    three books, against Rastell, Sir T. More, and Fisher (bishop of Rochester)
                    respectively, was published at the same place in 1531. In 1532, probably in July
                    or August, he ventured back to England, apparently on some business to which he
                    and Tyndal attached importance in connexion with the prior of Reading. Warrants
                    for his arrest were almost immediately issued at the instance of Sir T. More,
                    then lord chancellor. For some weeks Frith successfully evaded pursuit, but
                    ultimately, in December, he fell into the hands of the authorities at Milton
                    Shore in Essex, as he was on the point of making his escape to Flanders. The
                    rigour of his imprisonment in the Tower was somewhat abated when Sir T. Audley
                    succeeded to the chancellorship, and it was understood that both Cromwell and
                    Cranmer were disposed to show great leniency. But the treacherous circulation of
                    a manuscript “lytle treatise” on the sacraments, which Frith had written for the
                    information of a friend, and without any view to publication, served further to
                    excite the hostility of his enemies, and in a lent sermon preached against the
                    “sacramentaries” before the king, special reference was made to some at that
                    time in the Tower, “so bold as to write in defence of that heresy,” and who
                    seemed to be put there “rather for safeguard than for punishment.” On thij
                    instigation, Henry ordered that Frith should be examined; the result of a
                    regular trial which followed was that he was found guilty of having denied, with
                    regard to the doctrines of purgatory and of transubstantiation, that they were
                    necessary articles of faith. On the 23d of June 1533 he was handed over to the
                    secular arm, and at Smithfield on the 4th of July following he was burnt at the
                    stake. During his captivity he had been more than usually busy with his pen, and
                    his writings belonging to this period include, besides several letters of
                    interest, a controversial work on the eucharist in reply to what Sir T. More had
                    written against Frith’s “lytle treatise”; also two tracts entitled respectively
                    <hi rend="italic">A Mirror or Glass to know thyself,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Mirror or Looking-glass wherein you may behold the Sacrament of Baptism.</hi>
                    Apart from his ability, which seems to have been regarded by all his
                    contemporaries as extraordinary, his acquirements, his piety, his early and
                    tragic death, Frith is an interesting and so far important figure in English
                    ecclesiastical history as having been the first to maintain and defend that
                    doctrine regarding the sacrament of Christ s body and blood which ultimately
                    came to be incorporated in the English communion office. Twenty-three years
                    after Frith’s death as a martyr to the doctrine of that office, that “Christ’s
                    natural body and blood are in Heaven, not here,” Cranmer, who had been one of
                    his judges, went to the stake for the same belief. Within t ιree years more, it
                    had become the publicly professed faith of the entire English nation.</p>
