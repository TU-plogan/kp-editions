                    improbable in the Scotic or Milesian kings imitating it so far as to assign
                    constant military duty to certain clans. One of the glosses on the word <hi

                    the <hi rend="italic">Tuath Homnann,</hi> settled in Erris in the west of Mayo.

                    celebrated hero of the older or Heroic period, seems to have been of this race.
                    It is worthy of note that Ulster, whose warriors of the <hi rend="italic">Craebh
                    Ruaid</hi> or Red Branch are the most prominent figures in the Heroic period,
                    had no Fenians. The genealogists of later times, desirous of making every
                    warrior, poet, and saint a Milesian, provided elaborate Milesian pedigrees for
                    the <hi rend="italic">Clanna Baiscne,</hi> to which belonged the chief hero of
                    the Fenian period, <hi rend="italic">Heime,</hi> surnamed <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Irish MSS. contain no account of the organization or distribution of the
                    Fenians, except what can be gathered from incidental references; but Dr Keating,
                    who appears to have had access to many MSS. since lost, and who may be trusted
                    to tell only what he found in them, gives in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Ireland</hi> a curious legendary account to which the reader is referred. It was
                    this account which suggested calling the members of an organization that was
                    formed a few years ago among the Irish in the United States of America for
                    promoting and assisting revolutionary movements in Ireland, and which attained
                    much notoriety, Fenians (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ireland).</hi> The founder of
                    the modern Fenians, John O‘Mahony, was also the author of a translation of
                    Keating’s <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> which he published io New York in the
                    year 1857.</p>

                    rend="italic">Oisin,</hi> and some others of the chief heroes, are doubtless
                    real personages. But even in the oldest manuscripts they are so mixed up with
                    mythological beings that it is impossible to sift fact from fiction. Thus in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Leabhar na h-Uidhri,</hi> the oldest existing MS. written
                    wholly in Irish, sometime before the year 1106, there is a story concerning a
                    certain king <hi rend="italic">MongantiaQ</hi> subject of many legends, who is
                    supposed to have flourished at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh
                    century, which makes him out to be no other than the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Find</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Cumall</hi> himself. The Fenian
                    stories are merely Celtic myths in a new dress, clothing a few misty forms of
                    real life, about whom we know almost nothing. As has been stated in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Celtic Literature,</hi> the personages of the Heroic
                    period, <hi rend="italic">Ccichidaind, Fergus</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">Rog,

                <p>The recitation of Fennian stories in the halls of kings and chieftains, and in
                    popular assemblies by the <hi rend="italic">Fili,</hi> was usual in the 12th
                    century, as we learn from a poem on the triennial <hi rend="italic">Aoηech,</hi>
                    or fair of Carman, now Wexford, in the Book of Leinster, a manuscript of that
                    time. This manuscript also contains poems attributed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Find</hi> himself, and to his son <hi rend="italic">Oisin,</hi> and most of the
                    poems and prose tales coming under the head Fennian, or Fenian, and now or
                    recently current among the Irish-speaking peasantry, are also to be found in
                    MSS. at least 300 years old.</p>
                <p>As might be expected from the common origin of the Irish and Gaelic population of
                    Scotland, and the close intellectual association between them for centuries,
                    owing to the literary language of both being the same, and to the additional
                    circumstance that the Irish poets, harpers, and leeches looked upon Celtic
                    Scotland quite as much within their domain as any part of Ireland, Fennian poems
                    and tales were as well known in the former as in the latter. The written stories
                    when old are in the literary language, that is Irish, and do not differ from
                    those found in similar MSS. in Ireland. The current stories are of course in the
                    Gaelic dialect of Scotland, which has gradually supplanted Irish as the literary
                    language since the literary separation of Ireland and Scotland, caused by the
                    Reformation and the decay of the Irish language in Ireland itself. It was such
                    stories, written in the literary language or Irish, and others still current
                    among the Gaelic-speaking population of the Highlands, that suggested to James
                    Macpherson thesubjects of his poems of Ossian, and supplied him with a
                    considerable part of the materials. In using these materials he mingled the
                    events and the actors of the two perfectly distinct periods of story, that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cuchulaind,</hi> or the Heroic period, and that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Find,</hi> or the Fennian period. Macpherson was not, however, the
                    first who was guilty of this anachronism; in the Book of the Dean of Lismore,
                    transcribed in the first half of the 16th century, there is a sort of mosaic
                    poem made up apparently of fragments of totally different stories belonging to
                    both periods, and having lines <pb break="no"

                    200 years after. The first part appears to be a fragment of a version of the <hi
