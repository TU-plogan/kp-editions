                    digitigrade Carnivora, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Canidae</hi> or dog
                    family, but differing from the true dogs <hi rend="italic">(Canis)</hi> in the
                    greater elongation and sharpness of the muzzle, and in the greater length and
                    bushiness of the tail. They likewise differ in the pupil of the eye being
                    elliptical when contracted, and in the possession of a subcaudal gland, in which
                    a fetid substance is secreted, the emission of which gives to foxes their
                    peculiarly disagreeable odour. There are 24 recent species of foxes known,
                    distributed over all the great continents except South America and Australia. Of
                    these the Fennec foxes are exclusively African, and the bristle-tailed foxes
                    North American. The Common <hi rend="italic">Eoz.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Vulpes</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgaris),</hi> the pet of the hunting field and
                    the pest of the farmyard, occurs throughout Europe, wherever it has not been
                    exterminated by man. It is the Scottish <hi rend="italic">tod</hi> and the
                    French <hi rend="italic">renard.</hi> It measures about two feet in length
                    exclusive of the tail, which is about a foot long Its fur is of a reddish-brown
                    colour above, and more or less white beneath; the back of its ears and the fore
                    part of its limbs are black, and the tip of its bushy tail, or brush as it is
                    called, is white. Its long, sharp muzzle, erect pointed ears, and sharp eye give
                    it an appearance of sagacity and cunning which its real character fully
                    justifies. The fox is undoubtedly the subtlest of British beasts of the field,
                    its intellectual capacity having no doubt been enlarged by the peculiarly hard
                    conditions under which alone it is permitted to exist in this country. It is
                    regularly hunted by the fleet and keen-scented foxhounds, urged on by mounted
                    huntsmen, all of whom are not unfrequently baffled by the speed, cunning, and
                    ingenuity of this wily creature. The fox is a solitary animal, inhabiting a
                    burrow known as its earth, which it either excavates for itself, or, as more
                    usually happens, obtains by previously ejecting the badger or the rabbit from
                    its home. So averse, indeed, is the fox to dig for itself, that when foiled in
                    its attempts to dispossess the badger, it has been known to take up its quarters
                    with the latter, and in Germany it is readily induced to make its home in
                    artificial burrows, constructed of stone and earth for the purpose of
                    facilitating the operation of digging out the cubs. The fox also occurs in
                    woods, and even in the open country without burrows, lying in its “cover’’ by
                    day and stealing forth at night, when alone it can be said to see properly, in
                    search of its prey. Its food consists of rabbits, hares, poultry, and
                    game-birds, although when these are not to be had it is fain to satisfy its
                    hunger with rats, mice, and even insects—“the droppings of these creatures,”
                    says Bell, “being often composed almost entirely of the wing cases of beetles.”
                    The fox also visits the sea-shore, where it feeds on shell-fish and crustaceans;
                    and on the Continent it is said to frequent the vineyards in order to gratify
                    its taste for ripe grapes. Although the flesh of most birds forms its favourite
                    food, it is a curious circumstance, noticed by Dr Weissenborn, that even the
                    severest hunger cannot compel it to eat the flesh of birds of prey, while there
                    is good reason to believe that the fox enjoys, if it does not even prefer,
                    “high” meat. The female produces her young in April—the period of gestation
                    extending from 60 to 65 days. These are usually from 5 to 8 in number, and for
                    them she shows the greatest solicitude) defending them with the utmost courage,
                    and exhibiting a boldness altogether foreign to her character at other times.
                    The cubs, attain their full size in about 18 months, and the duration of life in
                    the species, judging from individuals kept in confinement, probably extends to
                    13 or 14 years. The cubs, like those of most Carnivora, are exceedingly playful,
                    and may often be seen amusing themselves, after the manner of young dogs, in
                    pursuit of their own brushes. Their resemblance to the dog does not, however,
                    extend much further, for, unlike it, they seem incapable of attachment to man.
                    Although taken young and brought up with dogs, their attachment does not go
                    beyond refraining from biting the hand that is accustomed to feed them. They
                    remain timid and suspicious, and are always ready to snap at any one seeking to
                    be familiar. This incapability of domestication, and the fact that the dog and
                    fox have never been known to interbreed, would seem to prove that these animals
                    are by no means so nearly related as was at one time supposed. Ample proof of
                    the very considerable intellectual capacity of the fox is to be found in the
                    stratagems to which it has recourse in securing its prey, but still more in the
                    quickness with which it detects man’s strategic efforts to outwit and capture it
                    “Its instinctive cunning,” says Bell, “leads it soon to suspect the wiles of its
                    enemies, and it will in a very short time ascertain the design of a trap or a
                    gin, though concealed with the utmost care.” Nothing can exceed the caution with
                    which reynard approaches and examines the baited trap, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nonchalance</hi> with which he approaches, enters, and rifles the snare in
                    which some animal has been already caught, and which he evidently knows can do
                    him no injury until reset. There are also several well-authenticated cases of
                    the fox counterfeiting death in order to escape from its enemies. Attempts have
                    been made to put a different interpretation on such instances, but examples of
                    “feigning” have of late years been noticed in so many and such diverse
                    animals,—among insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals,—that there seems no reason
                    to doubt that the wily fox has recourse to a stratagem which, for want of a
                    better term, may be described as counterfeiting death.</p>
                <p>Closely allied to the common fox of Europe is the Red Fox <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Vulpes</hi><hi rend="italic">fuivus)</hi> of eastern North America, regarded
                    by many naturalists as only a variety of the common species— an opinion which
                    receives some confirmation from the fact that hitherto no remains of the red fox
                    have been found in the cave deposits of that continent, although remains of the
                    grey fox are abundant. It may thus possibly be the descendant of individuals of
                    the European species, introduced at a comparatively early period, and owing the
                    differences that now distinguish it to the greatly altered conditions under
                    which for centuries it has existed. It is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n525/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0525-0494"/> altogether larger than the common fox of Europe,
                    and the fur is longer and softer, the colour more brilliant, and the muzzle less
                    extended. According to Sir J. Richardson, it preys largely on the smaller
                    animals of the rat family, and is very fond of fish. “The red fox,” he says,
                    “does not possess the wind of its English congener. It runs for about 100 yards
                    with great swiftness, but its strength is exhausted in the first burst, and it
                    is soon overtaken by a wolf or a mounted horseman.” In Canada and the United
                    States it is largely hunted for its valuable fur, about 60,000 skins of this
                    species being annually imported into the London market. There are several
                    well-known varieties of the red fox, as the cross fox and the black or silver
                    fox. The latter is very scarce, and its fur is more valuable than any other
                    found in North America. La Hontan states that in his time a skin of the silver
                    fox was worth its weight in gold, and an unusually fine skin has been sold in
                    the London market for £50. The fur is sometimes of a uniform black shining
                    colour, except at the tip of the tail, which is white; but more usually it has a
                    hoary appearance from the admixture of white tipped hairs with those entirely
                    black. This fox is exceedingly shy and difficult of approach, owing probably to
                    the persistency with which it is hunted by the fur traders. About 1600 skins of
                    the silver fox are annually imported into Britain. The Arctic Fox <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vulpes</hi><hi rend="italic">lagopus)</hi> is an inhabitant of
                    the boreal regions of Europe, Asia, and America. It is somewhat smaller than the
                    European fox, its ears being less pointed and the muzzle shorter. The soles of
                    its feet are densely furred, resembling those of a hare, hence its specific
                    name, <hi rend="italic">lagopus.</hi> As with many Arctic animals the colour of
                    its fur changes with the season, being in most cases of a pure white colour in
                    winter, with the exception of a few black hairs at the extremity of the tail.
                    Towards the end of April, however, when the Arctic snows begin to disappear, the
                    long white fur gives place to shorter hair of a dark brown or sooty colour.
                    Occasionally a dark-coloured fox may be seen in winter, and a white one in
                    summer, and in Iceland, according to Professor Newton, the winter coat differs
                    very slightly in colour from that of summer, probably owing to the comparatively
                    mild character of the Icelandic winter. The Arctic fox has little of the
                    proverbial cunning of its kind, having been seen to walk unsuspiciously into the
                    trap which had been baited in its presence. It is an exceedingly cleanly animal,
                    and the fetid odour characteristic of the entire genus is almost absent in this
                    species. It differs also from the common fox in being gregarious, living,
                    according to Richardson, in little villages consisting of 20 or 30 burrows
                    placed near each other. The Arctic foxes seek their food, which consists of
                    lemmings, birds, eggs, and carrion, at night, and their first impulse, says
                    Captain Lyon, on securing it is to hide it, even though suffering severely from
                    hunger. It was suggested some years ago by Professor Newton that this species
                    supported itself during winter on a store of provisions laid up during summer,
                    and Captain Feilden was able during the recent polar expedition (1875) to
                    confirm this. When in Grinnell Land he and his companions came upon Arctic
                    foxes, and were greatly surprised on discovering numerous deposits of dead
                    lemmings. “In one nook,” says Captain Feilden, “under a rock we pulled out over
                    50; we disturbed numerous <hi rend="italic">caches</hi> of 20 and 30, and the
                    ground was honeycombed with holes, each of which contained several bodies of
                    these little animals, a small quantity of earth being placed over them” <hi
                    rend="italic">(A Voyage to the Polar Sea,</hi> by Captain Sir G. Nares, 1878).
                    Nearly 10,000 skins of the Arctic fox, chiefly in winter fur, are annually
                    brought into Britain.</p>
                <p>Foxes are found fossil in caverns in many parts of Europe, and extinct species
                    occur in the Tertiary deposits of both hemispheres. (J. <hi rend="smallcaps"
