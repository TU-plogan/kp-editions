                    (1788-1827), an illustrious French physicist, the son of an architect, was born
                    at Broglie, in the department of Eure, in France, May 10,1788. His early
                    progress in learning was slow, and when eight years old he was still, unable to
                    read. At the age of thirteen he entered the Ecole Centrale in Caen, and at
                    sixteen and a half the École Polytechnique, where he acquitted himself with
                    distinction. Thence he went to the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées. He served as an
                    engineer successively in the departments of Vendée, Drome, and Ille-et-Villaine;
                    but his espousal of the cause of the Bourbons in 1814 occasioned, on Napoleon’s
                    reaccession to power, the loss of his appointment. On the second restoration he
                    obtained a post as engineer in Paris, where much of his life from that time was
                    spent. His researches in optics, continued until his death, appear to have been
                    begun about the year 1814, when he prepared a paper on the aberration of light,
                    which, however, was not published. In 1818 he read his celebrated memoir on
                    diffraction, for which in the ensuing year he received the prize of the Academy
                    of Sciences at Paris. He was in 1823 unanimously elected a member of the
                    Academy, and in 1825 he became a member of the Royal Society of London, which in
                    1827, at the time of his last illness, awarded him the Rumford medal. In 1819 he
                    was nominated a commissioner of lighthouses, for which he was the first to
                    construct compound lenses as substitutes for mirrors (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lighthouses).</hi> Fresnel died of consumption at Ville-d’Avray, near Paris,
                    July 14, 1827. The undulatory theory of light enunciated by Hooke, and upheld by
                    Huygens and Euler, but first founded upon experimental demonstration by Thomas
                    Young, was extended to a large class of optical phenomena, and permanently
                    established, by the brilliant discoveries and the mathematical deductions of
                    Fresnel. By the use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an
                    angle of nearly 180°, he avoided the diffraction caused in Grimaldi’s experiment
                    on interference by the employment of apertures for the transmission of the
                    light, and was thus enabled in the most conclusive manner to account for the
                    phenomena of interference in accordance with the undulatory theory. With Arago
                    he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays, and discovered that
                    though when similarly polarized they affect each other as do ordinary rays, yet
                    when rectangularly polarized they have no power of interference. Circularly
                    polarized light Fresnel obtained by means of a rhomb of glass, known as
                    “Fresnel’s rhomb,” having obtuse angles of 126°, and acute angles of 54°. His
                    labours in the cause of optical science received during his lifetime only scant
                    public recognition, and some of his papers were not printed by the Academy of
                    Sciences till many years after his decease. But, as he wrote to Young in 1824,
                    in him “that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory” had
                    been blunted. “All the compliments,” he says, “that I have received from Arago,
                    Laplace, and Biot never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic
                    truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment.” For further details
