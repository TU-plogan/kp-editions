                    and Avenches, it has a very irregular outline towards the Lake of Neuchâtel, and
                    indeed breaks up into <hi rend="italic">enclaves</hi> which are completely
                    surrounded by the territory of Vaud or Waadt. The only other canton with which
                    it is conterminous is Bern, which lies to the north and east. With very slight
                    exceptions in the south the whole canton belongs to the basin not of the Rhone
                    but of the Rhine, being traversed throughout its entire length from south to
                    north by the Sarine or Saane, which rises in the Sanetsch in Bern and ultimately
                    joins the Aar below Giiminen. The surface of the country has considerable
                    variety of relief, but can hardly, in such a region as Switzerland, be described
                    as mountainous. The canton, however, is the very heart of pastoral Switzerland,
                    and the home of tho “ranz des vaches.” The southern portion is occupied with
                    offshoots of the Bernese Alps,presenting such heights as the Moléson, 6578 feet;
                    the Dent de Vüdetze or De Lys, 6609 feet; the Vanil des Arzes, 6513; the Cape au
                    Moine, 6376; the Dent de Broc, 5986; Brenleyre, 7724; Folliéran,7685; and the
                    Vanil Noir, 7825. The last is the highest elevation in the canton, and is
                    situated in the south on the Bernese frontier to the right of the valley of the
                    Sarine. The western and north-western districts belong to the system of the
                    Jorat or Jurten, the most important massif being Mount Gibloux, which attains an
                    altitude of 3945 feet. Besides the Sarine there are two considerable streams
                    which flow partly through Freiburg territory,—the Singine or Sense, which,
                    deriving one of its head streams from Freiburg and the other from Bern, forms
                    throughout the greater part of its course the boundary between the two cantons,
                    and the Broye or Brux, which rises in the south-west near Semsales, and after
                    traversing the outskirts of Freiburg and Vaud enters the Lake of Morat or
                    Murten, and thus finds its way to the Lake of Neuchâtel. There are a few small
                    lakes in the canton, the most noteworthy being that of Seedorf, which -was
                    lowered about 11 feet by draining operations undertaken in 1871-73 for
                    reclaiming the marshy land around it. Mineral waters occur at Lac Noir or
                    Schwarzsee, at Wyler-vor-Bad, at Montbarry near Gruyère, and at Bonn not far
                    from the town of Freiburg. Out of a total area of about 340,705 acres, about
                    9880 may be regarded as unproductive, 57,432 are occupied by forests, upwards of
                    84,100 furnish pasture, 91,876 are meadow land, 104,925 are arable fields, and
                    675 are vineyards. The forests are of great value to the canton, firewood and
                    timber being among its principal exports. Though the cereals are pretty
                    extensively cultivated, the production of grain is far under the consumption.
                    Tobacco is an important article in the commerce of the canton, and the
                    manufacture of <hi rend="italic">Kirschwasser</hi> is widely distributed. The
                    district of Gruyère, extending from the Singine to the Veveyse, is famous for
                    its cheese, of which upwards of 49,000 cwts. is produced annually. With the
                    exception of tanning and straw plaiting there are no industries that give
                    employment to any great number of people; but there are glass works at Semsales,
                    a paper mill at Marly, and kilns for hydraulic lime at Tour de Trème and Chatel,
                    and watches are made at Morat and Montilier. The canton is divided into seven
                    districts or prefectures, and there are 277 communes and 118 Catholic and 8
                    Protestant parishes. The district of the Sarine numbers 25,544 inhabitants, and
                    includes the capital of the canton; the district of the Singine, lying towards
                    the east, numbers 16,375, and has its administrative centre at Tavers or Tafels;
                    the district of the Gruyère, to the south of those already named, has 19,337
                    inhabitants, and includes tho chief town Bulle, with the ancient palace of the
                    bishops of Lausanne, Tour de Trème, Vuadens, with a model cheesedairy, Gruyère,
                    with the old manor of its counts, Marsens, the seat of the cantonal lunatic
                    asylum, the convent of Valsainte, the monastery of Pont-Dieu, and the castle and
                    village of Corbières; the district of the Lake numbers 14,839 inhabitants, and
                    its chief town is Morat, the scene of the famous battle of 1476; the district of
                    the Glane has 13,176 inhabitants, and its chief town is Romont, with an ancient
                    castle and ramparts and towers; the district of the Broye has 13,706
                    inhabitants, and its chief town is Estevayer, a busy little place on the Lake of
                    Neuchâtel, to which it sometimes gives its name; and lastly, in the far south
                    the district of Veveyse numbers 7855, and besides its chief town,
                    Châtel-St-Denis, contains the village of Semsales. The canton is traversed from
                    north-east to south-west by the railway from Bern to Lausanne; another line
                    proceeds from the town of Freiburg westward by the Lake of Neuchâtel, and a
                    third unites Romont and Bulle. Freiburg returns, according to its population,
                    six representatives tó the national council of Switzerland. Its own
                    administration consists of a great council, to which a member is furnished by
                    every 1200 inhabitants, a state council of seven members, and a judicial council
                    of nine. According to the census of 1870, out of a total population of 110,900,
                    94,000 were Catholics and 16,800 Protestants, the latter being most numerous in
                    tho district of the Lake. The Catholics <pb break="no"

                    Lausanne, who has his residence at Freiburg. Though the official language is
                    French, which is generally spoken in the towns, public documents are also
                    published in German, which holds its ground in the district of the Singine, in
                    part of the district of the Lake, and in the commune of Bellegarde in Gruyère.
                    In the rest of Gruyère, as well as in the districts of the Veveyse, the Glane,
                    the Sariue, and the Broye, a patois of the French stock is the prevailing
                    speech.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of Freiburg practically begins with
                    the counts of Zahringen, who, under the emperors, held considerable possessions
                    in this part of Switzerland. In 1179 Berthold IV. founded the town of Freiburg,
                    as his uncle Berthold III. had already been the founder of Freiburg in the
                    Breisgau, and as his son and successor was not long afterwards to be the founder
                    of Bern. He not only bestowed on it all the territory which he held for three
                    leagues round—a district afterwards known as the <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>
                    ‘ old lands,” or the “twenty-four parishes,” but he also, by a charter or <hi
                    rend="italic">Handfeste,</hi> granted a number of privileges similar to those of
                    Cologne, which in that unsettled period soon attracted what was then a
                    considerable population of artisans, peasants, and traders from the neighbouring
                    countries. On the death of Berthold V., the last duke of Záhringen, in 1218, his
                    possessions passed to his sister Anne, wife of Ulrich of Kyburg; aud the Kyburgs
                    were accordingly lords of Freiburg till 1264, when they also became extinct in
                    the male line. Anne of Kyburg, who had married Eberhard of Hapsburg, sold
                    Freiburg to Rudolph of Hapsburg for 3000 marks; and thus the town was subject to
                    the house of Austria for 188 years. During that long period it had to fight many
                    a battle for its existence, more especially against the neighbouring town of
                    Bern and the counts of Savoy. At length abandoned by Austria, it was obliged in
                    1452 to swear fidelity to Louis of Savoy, to whom it had become indebted for
                    vast sums of money. In spite of all the difficulties of its position, it was in
                    this first part of tne 15th century that it maintained a considerable trade with
                    France, Italy, and Venice in its leather and cloth. As many as 18,000 or 20,000
                    pieces of cloth were stamped with the town’s seal in the course of a year. The
                    reign of the Savoy dynasty was of short duration, for when Yolande, widow of
                    Amadeus, entered into alliance with Charles the Bold of Burgundy, Freiburg
                    joined Bern against the Burgundians, and took part in the battles of Morat and
                    Grandson. At length, in the diet of Stanz in 1481—thanks mainly to the advocacy
                    of Brother Claus (Nicholas von der Fliιh)—it was admitted a member of the Swiss
                    Confederation. Considerable additions of territory were effected in the 15th and
                    16th centuries. In 1475 Illens, Planfayon, and the castle of Chenaux were
                    acquired, aud, along with the Bernese, the people of Freiburg wrested Morat from
                    the house of Savoy. In 1478 the lordship of Montagny was purchased for 6700
                    florins, and in 1482 Farvagny and Pont. Bellegarde was added in 1502, Wallenbuch
                    in 1504, Font in 1508, and in the course of 1536 Vuippens, Estevayer, Corserey,
                    Bulle, Vuissens, Châtel St Denis, Bossonnens, Surpierre, Romont, Rue, La
                    Molière, and St Aubin. Corbières was bought for 8000 florins in 1553; and in
                    1555 Bern and Freiburg forced Michel, the last count of Gruyère, to abdicate,
                    and paid 80,500 crowns for his countship. The people of Freiburg had to endure
                    very heavy taxation to raise their proportion of the sum. Meanwhile, in the 16th
                    century, the original democratic government gave place to an exclusive
                    oligarchy, which succeeded in maintaining its supremacy in spite of the
                    pretensions of the papal power and the bishop of Lausanne on the one hand, and
                    the dissatisfaction of the people on the other. The French occupation of 1798
                    brought its government to a close; but in 1814 it was partially restored, 108 of
                    the 144 seats of the great council being assigned to members of the patrician
                    families. On December 2, 1830, the people rose and demanded equality of rights
                    for all the citizens of the canton; and in January 1831 a democratic
                    constitution was drawn up, and a representative government established. In 1846
                    Freiburg joined the Sonderbund, and in the following year it was consequently
                    invaded by the federal forces. In 1848 the.constitution was revised and rendered
                    more liberal in regard to religious matters. Several attempts were made by the
                    Catholic party to recover their supremacy; but their efforts were defeated, and
                    Bishop Marilley and other of their leaders were exiled. In 1857, however, the
                    great council decided for another revision of the constitution in a reactionary
                    sense, and their proposal was adopted by the people. Since then there has been
                    no alteration of the general tendency, and the Catholic clergy are in possession
                    of unbounded influence.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Freiburg,</hi> the chief town of the above canton, with a
                    station on the line between Bern and Geneva, occupies a highly picturesque
                    situation in the valley of the Sarine, part of it lying in the bottom of the
                    ravine and part of it climbing the irregular eminences on the left. It is
                    divided into four districts—the Bourg or central town, the Quartier des Places
                    or the upper town, and the districts of the Ange and the Neuveville, which,
                    together with the Planche, constitute the lower town. The principal
                    ecclesiastical building of Freiburg, the collegiate church of St Nicholas,
                    commenced about 1283 and finished in the second half of the 15th century, is
                    worthy of notice, not only for the noble belfry 245 feet in height, but also for
                    the organ, which was constructed between 1824 and 1834 by Aloys Mooser, a native
                    of the town, and is one of the most famous instruments of its kind. The various
                    buildings belonging to the municipal and cantonal Governments, the conventual
                    establishments of the Cordeliers, the Ursuline nuns, and other fraternities and
                    sisterhoods, the college of St Michel and the lyceum, with the cantonal museum,
                    and the civic hospital and other beneficent institutions are the most important
                    of the public edifices. In front of the town-hall grows a linden tree which is
                    said to have been planted by a soldier from the battle of Morat, 22d June 1476.
                    The ravine of the Sarine is crossed by several bridges, of which the most
                    notable is the suspension bridge constructed by Μ. Challey about 1834, which has
                    a span of 871 feet, and consists mainly of four cables each composed of 1056
                    distinct wires, individually not more than a tenth of an inch in diameter. About
                    3 miles to the north of the town, the river valley is crossed by the great
                    railway viaduct of Grandfey, which dates from 1862, is a girder structure 1095
                    feet in length and 260 feet high, contains about 3100 tons of metal, and cost
                    2,500,000 francs. Immediately above the town a vast dam was thrown across the
                    river-bed by Ritter the engineer in 1871-3; and the fall thus obtained yields a
                    water power of from 2600 to 4000 horse-power. A motive force of 600 horse-power
                    secured by turbines in the stream is conveyed to the plateau of Pérolles by
                    “telodynamic” cables more than 2295 feet in length, for whose passage a tunnel
                    has been constructed in the rock of the ravine. The industrial establishments
                    are still comparatively few and unimportant. Population in 1870, 10,904.</p>
