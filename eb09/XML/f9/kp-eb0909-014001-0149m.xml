                    excuse for crime with the moral common-place that it is unfair to punish a man
                    for violating a law of whose existence he was unaware. Again, some fictions are
                    deliberate falsehoods, adopted as true for the purpose of establishing a remedy
                    not otherwise attainable. Of this sort are the numerous fictions of English law
                    by which the different courts obtained jurisdiction in private business, removed
                    inconvenient restrictions in the law relating to land, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>What to the scientific jurist is a stumbling-block is to the older writers on
                    English law a beautiful device for reconciling the strict letter of the law with
                    common sense and justice. Blackstone, in noticing the well-known fiction by
                    which the Court of Queen’s Bench established its jurisdiction in common pleas
                    (viz., that the defendant was in custody of the marshal of the court), says,
                    “These fictions of law, though at first they may startle the student, he will
                    find upon further consideration to be highly beneficial and useful; especially
                    as this maxim is ever invariably observed, that no fiction shall extend to work
                    an injury; its proper operation being to prevent a mischief or remedy an
                    inconvenience that might result from the general rule of law. So true it is that

                    Austin, on the other hand, while correctly* assigning as the cause of many
                    fictions the desire to combine the necessary reform with some show of respect
                    for the abrogated law, makes the following harsh criticism as to others :—“Why
                    the plain meanings which I have now stated should be obscured by the fictions to
                    which I have just adverted I cannot conjecture. A wish on the part of the
                    authors of the fictions to render the law as <hi rend="italic"
                    >uncognoscible</hi> as may be is probably the cause which Mr Bentham would
                    assign. I judge not, I confess, so uncharitably; I rather impute such fictions
                    to the sheer imbecility (or, if you will, to the active and sportive fancies) of
                    their grave and venerable authors, than to any deliberate design, good or evil.”
                    Bentham, of course, saw in fictions the instrument by which the great object of
                    his abhorrence, <hi rend="italic">jwdiciary law,</hi> was produced. It was the
                    means by which judges usurped the functions of legislators. “A fiction of law,”
                    he says, “may be defined as a wilful falsehood, having for its object the
                    stealing legislative powers by and for hands which could not or durst not openly
                    claim it, and but for the delusion thus produced could not exercise it.” A
                    partnership, he says, was formed between the kings and the judges against the
                    interests of the people. “Monarchs found force, lawyers fraud; thus was the
                    capital found” <hi rend="italic">{Historical Preface to the second edition of
                    the Fragment on Government),</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the same essay Bentham notices the comparative rarity of
                    fictions in Scotch law. As to fiction in particular, compared with the work done
                    by it in English law, the use made of it by the Scotch is next to nothing. No
                    need have they had of any such clumsy instrument. They have two others “of their
                    own making, by which things of the same sort have been done with much less
                    trouble. <hi rend="italic">Nobile</hi><hi rend="italic">officium</hi> gives them
                    the creative power of legislation; this and the word desuetude together the
                    annihilative.” And he notices aptly enough that, while the English lawyers
                    declared that James II. had abdicated the throne (which everybody knew to be
                    false), the Scotch lawyers boldly said he bad forfeitedit.</p></note></p>
                <p>Sir H. Maine <hi rend="italic">{Ancient Law)</hi> supplies the historical element
                    which is always lacking in the explanations of Austin and Bentham. Fictions form
                    one of the agencies by which, in progressive societies, positive law is brought
                    into harmony with public opinion. The others are equity and statutes. Fictions
                    in this sense include, not merely the obvious falsities of the English and Roman
                    systems, but any assumption which conceals a change of law by retaining the old
                    formula after the change has been made. It thus includes both the case law of
                    the English and the <hi rend="italic">Responsa</hi><hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rudentum</hi> of the Romans. “At a particular stage of social
                    progress they are invaluable expedients for overcoming the rigidity of law; and,
                    indeed, without one of them, the fiction of adoption, which permits the family
                    tie to be artificially created, it is difficult to understand how society would
                    ever have escaped from its swaddling clothes, and taken its first steps towards
                    civilization.”</p>
                <p>The bolder remedial fictions of English law have been to a large extent removed
                    by legislation, and one great obstacle to any reconstruction of the legal system
                    has thus been partially removed. Where the real remedy stood in glaring contrast
                    to the nominal rule, it has been openly ratified by statute. In ejectment cases
                    the mysterious sham litigants have disappeared. The bond of entail can be broken
                    without having recourse to the collusive proceedings of fine and recovery.
                    Fictions have been almost entirely banished from the procedure of the courts.
                    The action for damages on account of seduction, which is still nominally an
                    action by the father for loss of his daughter’s services, is perhaps the only
                    fictitious action now remaining· <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi></p>
                <p>Fictions which appear in the form of principles (like that of the unity of
                    husband and wife) are not so easily dealt with by legislation. To expel them
                    formally from the system would require the re-enactment of vast portions of law.
                    A change in legal modes of speech and thought would be more effective. The legal
                    mind instinctively seizes upon concrete aids to abstract reasoning. Many hard
                    and revolting fictions must have begun their career as metaphors. In some cases
                    the history of the change may still almost be traced. The conception that a
                    man-of-war is a floating island, or that an ambassador’s house is beyond the
                    territorial limits of the country in which he resides, was originally a figure
                    of speech designed to set a rule of law in a striking light. It is then gravely
                    accepted as true in fact, and other rules of law are deduced from it. Its
                    beginning is to be compared with such phrases as “an Englishman’s house is his
                    castle,” which have had no legal offshoots, and still remain mere figures of
                    speech.</p>
                <p>Constitutional law is of course honeycombed with fictions. Here there is hardly
                    ever anything like direct legislative change, and yet real change is incessant.
                    The rules defining the sovereign power and fixing the authority of its various
                    members are in most points the same as they were at the last revolution,—in many
                    points they have been the same since the beginning of parliamentary government.
                    But they have long ceased to be true in fact; and it would hardly be too much to
                    say that the entire series of formal <pb break="no"

                    series of fictions. The legal attributes of the king, and even of the House of
                    Lords, are fictions. If we could suppose that the effects of the two Reform Acts
                    had been brought about, not by legislation, but by the decisions of law courts
                    and the practice of House of Commous committees—by such assumptions as that
                    freeholder includes lease-holder, and that ten means twenty—we should have in
                    the legal constitution of the House of Commons the same kind of fictions that we
                    find in the legal statement of the attributes of the crown and the House of
                    Lords. Here, too, fictions have been largely resorted to for the purpose of
                    supporting particular theories,—populärer monarchical,—and such have flourished
                    even more vigorously than purely legal fictions, <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.
