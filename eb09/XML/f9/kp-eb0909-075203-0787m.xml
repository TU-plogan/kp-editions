                <p><label type="entry">FREE TRADE</label>. This expression has been appropriated, in
                    a somewhat technical manner, to denote an unimpeded intercourse between such
                    manufacturing and commercial communities as, having reciprocal interests, are
                    under separate governments, and thereupon have separate financial systems. Thus
                    the term is not applied to the facilities which town and country, labourer and
                    capitalist, have obtained for reciprocal exchange, though these facilities have
                    been acquired only in comparatively recent times. It is not used to describe the
                    commercial intercourse of the three kingdoms, though restraints on the trade
                    between Scotland and Ireland on the one side and England on the other were
                    remitted, long after a political union between the three kingdoms had been
                    effected, very grudgingly and very cautiously. Again, if we speak of free trade
                    in land or free trade in banking, we use the term in a different sense from that
                    in which it has been employed since the time of Adam Smith. But the phrase is
                    technically used to designate such a commercial intercourse between any
                    particular country, its colonies, and foreign countries, as gives the maximum of
                    facilities for reciprocal exchange, and in the least degree attempts to make a
                    fiscal system the means for stimulating and assisting domestic industry by
                    protective enactments.</p>
                <p>Free trade in the sense given to it above is advocated on two principal grounds,
                    the one economical, the other political; and all arguments alleged in favour of
                    it can be brought under one or other of these topics. It is resisted similarly
                    for economical and political reasons,— not, indeed, in contradiction to those
                    which are adduced in its favour, for these are absolutely irrefragable, but on
                    the grounds that the industries of a country ought not to be defined by merely
                    economical reasons, and that there are political interests which will not indeed
                    annul, but must materially modify the universal and undeviating application of
                    the free-trade principle. It will be the object of the present article to give a
                    brief account of the controversy between the advocates of commercial freedom and
                    those of commercial restraint, and to show how events, due to opinions which
                    have long become obsolete, have strengthened the position of those who urge that
                    the restraint of trade is and should be part of the function of Government. It
                    is perhaps necessary, however, to meet an objection at once which might be
                    taken, if it were not anticipated. Every civilized Government rightly and
                    properly undertakes the supervision of contracts,—prohibiting some altogether,
                    regulating others with less or greater strictness, and assuming the right to
                    give an equitable interpretation to all; the application of the principles of
                    equity to contracts being the most important improvement which modern
                    civilization has induced on jurisprudence. Thus the law of civilized nations
                    forbids any contract which would reduce one of the contracting parties to
                    permanent slavery, though it compels the fulfilment of bargains which involve
                    the temporary servitude of one of the parties. Again, it nullifies immoral
                    bargains, though it does not profess to follow the consequences which a bargain
                    that is <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> innocent may
                    have. Again, it subjects some callings to a police, either by exacting, in the
                    case of certain professions, evidence of the individual’s capacity, or by
                    guarding continuously against any abuse which may arise from the exercise of a
                    calling specially open to abuse, as in the case of houses for public
                    entertainment, and the issue of paper money by banks. Furthermore, it subjects
                    even simple contracts to revision,—as, for example, cases in which exorbitant
                    charges are made for loans. In these instances, and in others like them, a
                    Government is only carrying out its primary duty in protecting its people from
                    force or fraud, by controlling the free action of those who may inflict a
                    serious injury on others. To define the extent indeed, to which such
                    interference is necessary or desirable, is one of the hardest questions in what
                    may be called the casuistry of politics. A country may be so overgoverned by a
                    watchful administration as to lose, to a greater or less extent, the spirit of
                    enterprise or initiation, and thereby to be weakened in the legitimate rivalry
                    of nations. But, on the other hand, it may be still more seriously weakened by
                    the destruction of credit or confidence,—a result which is very likely to ensue
                    when fraud is successful and unpunished.</p>
                <p>Similarly a Government may control or prohibit intercourse between nations. If
                    individuals have rights at all, one of the most obvious and important of these
                    rights is that of choosing a market for their labour. But a Govern ment would be
                    admittedly justified in prohibiting the emigration<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0788-0753"/> of such artisans as are employed in the
                    manufacture of munitions of war to a country with which itself was at war. It
                    does more when it does not allow its harbours to be a refuge or a market for
                    belligerents’ ships, and prevents private individuals from supplying munitions
                    of war to combatants. <hi rend="italic">A fortiori,</hi> it would not allow its
                    subjects to sell such goods to its enemies as might enable those enemies to
                    protract their defence. It is a question whether it is not entitled to prohibit,
                    or at least restrain, the exportation of that over which it is able to exercise
                    a monopoly, though it is very seldom, if indeed it is ever the case, that any
                    country is in so advantageous a position. And, lastly, it is allowed that a
                    Government may make the commercial intercourse of its subjects a matter of
                    bargain with the Government of other countries, though such expedients, from an
                    economical point of view, have been subjected to very adverse criticism. Free
                    trade, then, must be innocuous and not hostile to the general public good.</p>
                <p>Between nations, free trade represents the well-known principle of the Division
                    of Employments. The advantages which result from the natural or spontaneous
                    division of employments, and the loss which ensues from a forced division of
                    employments, are the commonplaces of economists. But the fact that exactly the
                    same principle rules the distribution of production over such parts of the world
                    as are occupied by industrial agents is not so frequently insisted on. That
                    there are several commodities which a country cannot produce at all, or can only
                    produce under circumstances so disadvantageous as to involve disproportionate
                    expense or loss, is admitted by every Government, however anxious it may be to
                    develop native industry by protective regulations. No European Government,
                    however imperfectly civilized, would attempt to direct its home industries into
                    the production of tea, coffee, and chocolate, or to domesticate elephants for
                    the sake of their ivory, or to breed ostriches for the sake of their plumes, or
                    to maintain a race of wild hogs in order to obtain a due supply of bristles from
                    native sources. But there are in most countries a number of industries the
                    continuity of which Governments have attempted, and still attempt, to promote,
                    by hindering the free entrance of foreign-made articles of the same kind. It
                    will be found that, historically, this practice has had its origin in what is
                    now understood to be a delusion as to the true functions of the currency.</p>
                <p>The restraint of production and trade was a policy which ancient civilization
                    never adopted. The great statesman of Athens congratulates his audience on the
                    fact that, thanks to the extended commerce of their country, they are as
                    familiar with the use of foreign products as they are with those of domestic
                    industry, and use them even as freely as the country of their origin does. The
                    public opinion of Greece was profoundly shocked when, as a measure of political
                    animosity, Athens excluded a Greek city, Megara, from its market. The oldest
                    public document preserved in the Roman archives was a commercial treaty with
                    Carthage (Polybius, xii. 22), in which Roman merchants are indeed restrained
                    from traffic in certain districts, more, we may be certain, from fear of the
                    Carthaginian occupation of Italy thin for other reasons, for the treaty
                    expressly exempts traffic from tolls, and prescribes that Carthage shall build
                    no factories in Latium. Nor is there any record of restraint put upon the
                    distribution of the precious metals, except in one oration of Cicero, where the
                    orator, defending his client from a charge of extorting money from the Asiatic
                    Jews, comments on the public policy of hindering this people from disturbing the
                    money market by sending great remittances of specie to Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the explanation of the fact that the civilization of antiquity did not
                    interfere with the process of international exchange is to be found in the
                    prevalence of slavery. Setting aside for a moment the historical origin of
                    modern protection, the influence and apparent truth of the mercantile system of
                    which we shall speak immediately, there is a radical difference between ancient
                    and modern civilization,—that in the former slavery was deemed natural, in the
                    latter it has been seen to be mischievous and felt to be detestable. In modern
                    societies, therefore, the free labourer is a factor in the interpretation of
                    economical forces; in ancient ones,he counted for nothing, or next to nothing.
                    To have prohibited free trade in the products of foreign labour at Athens would
                    have been to give advantage to one class of slave-holders in opposition or in
                    contrast to another class of slave-holders, and was not to be thought of. To
                    prohibit free trade between England and France, or England and the United
                    States, is, in appearance at least, to assist the home labour of the country
                    which adopts protection against the rivalry of free labour in another country
                    which might undersell its rivals. Protection in ancient times would have been
                    seen to be naked selfishness; in modern times, it may seem to be a genuine and
                    disinterested patriotism. And it may be observed that, for this and for other
                    reasons, most slave-holding countries have been indifferent to protective
                    regulations, or even unfriendly to them. This fact is sufficiently illustrated
                    by the contrast of opinion in the northern and southern States of the American
                    Union before the war of secession.</p>
                <p>The control of production and trade in modern Europe is historically due to the
                    development of what Adam Smith called the mercantile system, i.e., the effort of
                    Government to secure as far as possible the largest possible amount of specie
                    within the country whose affairs it administered. It is easy to discover the
                    origin of this policy. To a Government which spends, but does not produce, the
                    possession of treasure is of the greatest utility and service. To an individual
                    who produces and trades, still more to one who trades only, treasure is, as a
                    rule, the least valuable instrument of traffic, as it is an article from which,
                    as it is affected by the least possible variation in value, the least amount of
                    profit can be anticipated by those who deal in it as an article of trade. A
                    trader in the Middle Ages would have readily accepted the doctrine that money
                    was wealth as far as regarded every one but himself; as far as he was concerned,
                    he wished to get rid of his money as soon as he could, in exchange for goods, on
                    which he might secure his profits. The doctrine that the machinery of
                    international trade supplied the process by which the precious metals were
                    distributed, and that therefore, if trade were to exist, the attempts of
                    Government to restrain the exportation of money were mischievous or nugatory,
                    was argued as early as the middle of the 14 th century by Sanuto the Venetian,
                    and by Oresme the bishop of Lisieux, in language as precise as any used by
                    Turgot or Adam Smith. The reasonings, however, by which protective theories were
                    upheld, the mean and malignant arguments of restraint, as Adam Smith calls them,
                    were always strengthened in England up to thirty years ago, by suggesting the
                    hideous consequences which would come on the nation from a drain of gold.
                    Protection had its origin in the reputed duty of Government towards the
                    currency. Once established, it created artificial interests whose existence was
                    a loss to the whole community, but whose maintenance seemed to be the
                    satisfaction of a contract entered into between the Government and the industry
                    which the Government had called into being or had stimulated.</p>
                <p>It will be clear that if any particular industry is of such a character as to be
                    very conveniently carried out by the inhabitants of a particular community or
                    district, if the producer fears no rival in the home market, and still more if
                    he dreads no competition in a foreign market, any protection accorded to his
                    industry most be wholly superfluous.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0789-0754"/>
                <p>He might even contemplate an export duty with equanimity, though of course an
                    export duty would be destructive of his foreign market if he had real rivals,
                    and he would generally And that such a duty would not only limit the consumption
                    of his produce, but would call a rivalry into existence. It is equally clear
                    that if a protective duty were imposed on the importation of foreign commodities
                    into a country which has already a marked superiority over other countries in
                    these commodities, the regulation would have no effect in increasiug either the
                    profits of the producer or the cost of the article to the consumer,—that, in
                    short, the enactment would be absolutely nugatory. It will be also plain that,
                    in every country, there are certain commodities which are effectually shielded
                    from foreign rivalry by the cost of carriage, and that such commodities possess
                    the superiority which other products enjoy from the peculiar facilities which a
                    particular country has in manufacturing them. A protective system then is
                    inevitably concerned with such products as are liable to foreign rivalry, and a
                    foreign rivalry can only be defeated at the cost of the consumer. But as the
                    protective regulation can affect prices in that country only which imposes the
                    regulation, it is obvious that the only person who can be made to bear the
                    increased cost which the protective restraint imposes will be the home consumer.
                    If the produce could find a market at home, there would be no need of the
                    assistance; if it cannot subsist at home without a machinery which guarantees
                    the profit of the producer, the domestic consumer is the only person who can be
                    made to contribute the fund from which the profit is made.</p>
                <p>The positions stated above receive a significant but complete illustration from
                    the economical history of England. A century ago the English landowners were
                    free traders, the English merchants protectionists. Adam Smith rested all his
                    hopes of a better system on the former class, but despaired of any co-operation
                    from the latter. Twenty years after the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi>
                    was published, the mercantile and manufacturing classes, with few exceptions,
                    were free traders; the landowners, with few exceptions, were protectionists. The
                    explanation of the change in sentiment is to be found in the change of
                    interests. Up to the middle of the 18th century England exported considerable
                    quantities of agricultural produce,—sometimes naturally, at other times under
                    the wholly indefensible stimulus of a bounty on exportation. Now it needs very
                    little intelligence to discover that the profits of an exporter, or at any rate
                    the extension of his trade, depend largely on the variety of imports which he
                    can obtain in exchange for his goods. A country which puts no hindrance on
                    imports always deals to the greatest advantage, and the advantage decreases with
                    restraint. If a country refused to admit any import but one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> money, it would sell its exports in the worst possible market, and
                    for the least possible value, receiving in return an article which the machinery
                    of its trade takes the most effectual possible means to depreciate. Hence the
                    landowners of the 18th century, like the agriculturists of the western and
                    southern States of America now, were free-traders, because free trade was their
                    best hope of profit. The manufacturers, on the other hand, were profoundly
                    afraid of foreign rivalry, even the rivalry of the British colonies, even the
                    rivalry of Ireland. Perhaps the most grotesque illustration of this fear was the
                    law which directed under strict penalties that the dead should be buried in
                    woollen, in order to encourage the woollen manufactures.</p>
                <p>The change of sentiment was due to the great mechanical industries of the 18th
                    century. The discoveries of Ark wright, of Watt, of Hargreaves, Of Crompton,
                    gave England a practical monopoly of textile fabrics, and subsequently of other
                    products nearly as important. No doubt the Berlin and Milan decrees interfered
                    with the Continental trade of England, though it is well known that Napoleon’s
                    soldiers were clothed, in spite of these decrees, in the produce of
                    north-eastern and west country looms. But in other parts of the world England
                    had no rivals, while her supremacy on sea, after the great victory of Trafalgar,
                    guaranteed her traffic. Hence, when the merchant and manufacturer, especially
                    the latter, discovered that protection had ceased to be an advantage to them,
                    and discovered also, for the reasons given above, that the restraint of imports
                    was a disadvantage to production and exportation, the principles of free trade
                    made rapid progress in the manufacturing districts of England. But on the other
                    hand, the very reverse opinion influenced the minds of the landowners. Owing
                    partly to the succession of late harvests, partly to the rapid growth of
                    population consequent upon manufacturing enterprise, partly to the restriction
                    of Continental supply, the result of war, of the great drain which war made on
                    the agricultural population of Europe, and of hindrances put on the import of
                    food,—rents and farmers’ profits rose with amazing rapidity, and the Corn Law of
                    1815 was enacted in order to secure, if possible, the permanence of such rents
                    and profits. The partisans of free trade and protection weιe only by accident
                    allied to the great historical parties of English public life. The struggle for
                    free trade was really one between town and country, as hereafter efforts in the
                    same direction will get their advocates from the same classes.</p>
                <p>It may be believed that, in England at least, the question of protection to
                    manufactures is finally settled, though there are not wanting persons who
                    advocate reciprocity, co-ordinate taxation on foreign products, retaliatory
                    duties on reputed bounties, and the like. But the traditions of legislation are
                    too firmly fixed, and the benefits of free trade experienced during the past
                    thirty years are so generally admitted, that the advocacy of the exploded theory
                    of protection is looked on as a harmless wſhim wſhich has no chance of
                    popularity. It is not perhaps equally clear that the English people are quite
                    safe against the revival of protection to agriculture under the pretence of
                    sanitary restraint, for that which is the inevitable result of protection to
                    manufacture, the limitation of voluntary consumption, is not so markedly
                    developed from the protection which may be accorded to articles of necessary
                    consumption.</p>
                <p>When trade is restrained in those articles of foreign origin which may be
                    produced, though under less advantageous circumstances, at home, and the product
                    is an article in which the use may, to a limited extent only, be economized, the
                    following results ensue :—Prices rise, and profits rise,—of course, at the
                    expense of the consumer; wages, however, do not rise, for in so far as wages are
                    determined by the competition of employers for services, the tendency is towards
                    a reduction of wages, seeing that the use of the product is not increased but
                    rather stinted. Now, the extra profits which protection accords might be secured
                    to those who are already employed in the particular industry thus favoured only
                    if the producers have a natural monopoly in the produce of their calling, as was
                    practically the case with the English landowners during the existence of the
                    corn laws, or if the law restrains other persons from competing against them, as
                    was the case in England with Eastern produce during the continuance of the East
                    India Company’s chartered trade. If such an advantage be not accorded, capital
                    makes its way to the favoured industry'; or, to be more accurate, an
                    increasing’number of employers compete for the exceptional profit. Such an
                    operation may in some degree raise the rate of wages, though here again, unless
                    the labour be protected by some arrangement, such as apprenticeship, or by the
                    machinery of a strict trade union, the same cause which attracted the energies
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0790-0755"/> employer will rapidly, even more rapidly, supply
                    what may be needed in the way of labour. Generally, indeed, the check to such a
                    decline in wages is supplied by trades unions, which are, as the industrial
                    experience of the United States has proved, the inevitable outcome of a
                    protective system in a country where combinations of labour are not prohibited
                    by law. In England up to 1824 they were prohibited.</p>
                <p>In course of time then, and generally at an early period, the advantage which the
                    protective system accorded to a special industry ceases, by being distributed
                    among a larger number of producers. To this rule there is but one exception,
                    protection accorded to the produce of land. Here, if the commodity produced be
                    one which cannot be dispensed with, and for which no substitute is found, the
                    fact that the supply procurable falls short of the demand may greatly increase
                    the value of the article, and through the farmer’s profits raise rents. But the
                    advantage is soon found to be only partial. In civilized and fully settled
                    countries, agriculture is a complex process, in which success depends upon a
                    just balance being struck between tillage proper and stock-keeping. An excessive
                    price of corn, or rather of wheat, due to the machinery of a protective system,
                    apart from the extraordinary fluctuations in price which it induces on the price
                    of wheat, discourages the use of meat, and even of the inferior kinds of grain;
                    for it is a law in prices that any notable exaltation in the value of one of the
                    items which contribute to a joint product invariably depresses the value of the
                    other items; just as it is an equally invariable law in prices that when there
                    is a notable scarcity of any commodity the greatest rise in price always takes
                    place in that form or quality of the article which was cheapest before. Hence
                    there is always a natural remedy, though it is by no means a compensating one to
                    the consumer, for any artificial exaltation in the value of agricultural
                    produce. The principles referred to may be proved by the analysis of facts.
                    Since the repeal of the English corn laws the price of agricultural land has
                    steadily risen; for though the average price of wheat has fallen, that of other
                    kinds of grain, as is found by the tithe averages, has risen, while meat and
                    dairy produce have much more than doubled in value since the period referred
                    to.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly, however, in relation to manufactures that the operation of
                    protective regulations is significant or important, for most countries have
                    abandoned all or nearly all restraint on the importation of food. The employer
                    gets no advantage from the regulation, nor the labourer, and the consumer
                    suffers a loss. But the removal of protection would, in most cases, however
                    great a benefit to the consumer, inflict considerable Joss on employers and
                    labourers, since they would be subjected to a competition in which it is
                    probable they would be worsted; for it may be concluded that the manufacturer
                    cannot, or believes he cannot, subsist without protection, since he would
                    repudiate it if he saw that it was superfluous. Hence it is exceedingly
                    difficult and invidious to alter a system to which capital and labour have
                    accommodated themselves; and it may be stated generally that all the arguments
                    by which an existing protection is defended, however plausible and convenient
                    they may be, are mere sophistry, though very often unconscious sophistry; while
                    the prospect that the sudden suspension of protection to manufactures would
                    seriously disturb the relations of employers and labourers, and would very
                    probably lead to a great destruction of property, points to a real difficulty,
                    which the advocates of free trade will always find confronting them. In
                    practical politics, in so far as they are connected with economical subjects,
                    the difficulty is enormous, for the defence of imperilled interests is always
                    more watchful and energetic than attack on them, and can always count on a
                    co-operation and concentration wſliich is far less fully developed in those who
                    criticize or challenge the privilege. There is a well-known passage in Mr Mill’s
                    political economy in which this author conceives it expedient that protection
                    should be given to certain industries in new countries, provided that the
                    country had good natural resources for the successful prosecution of such an
                    industry, and the protection accorded be only temporary. But apart from the fact
                    that new countries never possess a superfluity of capital and labour, and
                    therefore are least of all well advised in directing these elements of wealth
                    into channels where they would be less advantageously employed than they would
                    be in others; apart from the considerations that all countries have a natural
                    protection in the cost of carriage, and in the comparative ease with which they
                    can interpret demand; and apart from the fact that good natural advantages for
                    any particular industry are sure to suggest that industry at the very earliest
                    time at which it will be expedient to undertake it,—the circumstances which
                    invariably affect a protected industry render it impossible that Mr Mill’s rule
                    of a temporary protection should be applicable. Who is to determine at what time
                    the protection should be removed I Not the consumer, as represented in the
                    legislature, for he would naturally object to the protection from the beginning,
                    since the regulation inflicted a loss on him, at the very instant that it came
                    into operation. Not the manufacturer, for until the time comes in which he
                    dreads no rivalry, he believes that the regulation is the guarantee of his
                    ordinary profit, and that its removal will expose him to certain loss, The
                    probability that he may come to such a state as to render the protection
                    manifestly superfluous depends on his making some great, sudden, and lasting
                    stride in the efficiency of the industry which he exercises. But protection
                    discourages all kinds of improvement, and indeed it does not appear that the
                    phenomenon of sudden, vast, and permanent progress has ever been witnessed in
                    economical history except during the latter half of the 18th century in England.
                    Not the labourer who is engaged in producing the favoured product, for the wages
                    of labour are adversely affected, in the fall of prices, at an earlier stage
                    than any other object into which gross value is distributed, and are
                    advantageously affected, on the other hand, at a later period than that in which
                    any other interest, other than that of manual labour, is benefited. Loaned or
                    floating capital is most easily extricated from a declining trade, and most
                    easily attracted to a growing trade; fixed capital, and such capital as gives
                    efficiency to fixed capital, is attracted less easily, and by parity of
                    reasoning, is less easily accumulated or appropriated; while the supply of
                    labour is decreased with the greatest loss to the labourer, and increased with
                    the smallest gain.</p>
                <p>It may be concluded then that, wſhile Mr Mill has given a doubtful defence for
                    the adoption of a temporary protection, his limits to the protection so accorded
                    will be found to be practically nugatory, and that in fact the adoption of the
                    system will confer the minimum of good, while the abolition or abandonment of it
                    will inflict the maximum of injury. This result then,—the creation of factitious
                    industries, which cannot be assisted by the operations of Government without
                    loss to the consumer, but which cannot be abandoned by Government without ruin
                    real or apparent to the consumers,—is substantially the apology and defence for
                    the protective systems of Continental Europe. For there is nothing which
                    characterizes modern systems of government more than the tenderness which all
                    parties show towards imperilled interests. There is a growing disposition
                    towards treating them as vested,—that is, as equitably entitled to compensation
                    if their continuity is disturbed or even threatened. Of course there must be a
                    limit to this consideration, for no Government has yet ventured on admitting,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n791/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0791-0756"/> however democratic may be its institutions, the
                    vested interests of manual labour, or allowed that it should be compensated, if
                    events required that a change be made in legislation which might interfere with
                    the continuity of its wages. But if the project which is in favour with certain
                    schools of socialism in France and Germany, that the state should assist labour
                    (and of course it could assist only special kinds of labour) with Government
                    subventions, the doctrine of vested interests would assuredly be applied to such
                    assisted callings. It was, perhaps still is, a contention with some public men
                    in England that poor-law relief is of the nature of a vested interest to labour,
                    or that it is the indefeasible heritage of the poor.</p>
                <p>It has been very fairly shown by Mr Fawcett, in his recently published essay on
                    free trade, that many circumstances assisted towards making the acceptance of
                    this great political change in the United Kingdom,—notwithstanding the vehement
                    passions which were excited against those who carried on the struggle for the
                    repeal of all taxes on food. Mr Fawcett has not by any means exhausted all the
                    facts which aided the advocates of this change, nor has he enumerated all the
                    motives which influenced those who gradually became reconciled to the change,
                    and who even, from being opponents, were converted into partisans of the
                    movement. For the principles of free trade had been accepted by Lord Liverpool
                    in 1820, and had been cautiously tried by Mr Huskisson in certain directions and
                    with marked success. In fact, the first modifications of the tariff were
                    agreeable to the landowners and the farmers, were acceptable to the
                    manufacturers and small traders, and were objected to, as similar reforms were
                    objected to in Walpole’s time, by the great mercantile houses, who were enabled
                    by their capital to retain almost a monopoly of the wholesale trade as against
                    less opulent dealers. But even here a significant law of prices, never indeed
                    formulated, but recognized, effectively enough reconciled the great houses to
                    the remission of taxation on raw materials and on those foreign products against
                    which no home production competed. It is that a remission of taxation, in all
                    consumable articles, and notably in those of extended demand,is followed by
                    arise in the price of the untaxed articles. This law is a constant refutation of
                    the policy which imposes taxes on imports, and operates still more emphatically
                    when taxes on exports are imposed, as they sometimes are by ignorant and needy
                    Governments. Hardly a voice, therefore, was raised against the bold measures
                    which Peel adopted between 1842 and 1846. They could not possibly harm the
                    landowners; they were a positive boon to the manufacturers and the consumers. So
                    much was this the case that for some time, as has been already stated, the
                    remission of a vast number of small taxes on consumption was made the apology
                    for retaining the income tax.</p>
                <p>But the case was very different when the taxes on food produced abroad, and in
                    competition with that produced at home, and on sugar imported from other places
                    than the British colonies, were assailed by the logic of the English
                    free-traders. Here it was seen at once that the most powerful interests were
                    imperilled. For very obvious reasons, the landed interest in England has always
                    wielded far more power, political and financial, than any other. During the
                    Middle Ages it controlled the monarchy, deposed kings, altered the succession,
                    till, up to the beginning of the 17th century, the general appellation which
                    Continental nations gave the English was that of “disloyal.” The landed gentry
                    and free holders fought the wars of the Long Parliament, and subverted the
                    monarchy. The Restoration was a compromise between them and the courtiers, and
                    one of the first results of the Restoration was the enactment of stringent
                    provisions against the importation of foreign food. For centuries the policy,
                    the legislation, the finance of England had been defined by the interests, real
                    or supposed, of the landed gentry, the yeoçianry, and the tenant farmers. They
                    were now threatened with a complete reversal of this traditionary policy, and
                    such a reversal seemed to purpose their ruin. Those who lived through this time
                    will easily recall to mind how violent were the passions which the anti-corn-law
                    movement excited; how Whigs of the Melbourne school denounced the free-trade
                    movement as folly; how such a man as Lord Brougham, who was conceived, ten years
                    or more before, to have carried the reform agitation to the very verge of
                    sedition, now declared, and perhaps with perfect good faith, that the movement
                    in favour of free trade was unconstitutional; how Sir Robert Peel believed that
                    the opponents of protection were the instigators of a plot against his life; and
                    how, long after the victory was won, it was a commonplace to accuse the leaders
                    of the movement with the most sinister designs against property. And yet the tax
                    on food was in the last degree invidious. It was avowedly imposed in the
                    interest of the landowners, and with a view to maintaining rents. It was allowed
                    that free trade in the abstract was just, protection in the abstract
                    indefensible. There were of course reasons alleged in favour of protection,
                    analogous to those which are now current in the United States and elsewhere, as
                    to the wisdom of a nation being self-supporting; as to the disturbance of the
                    exchanges in the presence of bad harvests; as to the incapacity of domestic
                    industry to compete against the low-priced labour of semi-barbarous countries;
                    as to the destruction of national industries, and the extinction of the best and
                    most patriotic of English craftsmen. But these alarms were either heedless or
                    interested rhetoric, never put forward by really competent critics. Nearly
                    thirty years ago, Mr Gladstone informed the writer of this article that he never
                    had but one objection to the repeal of the corn law, during the early period of
                    his connexion with Peel’s Government, and that was the fear that he entertained
                    as to the consequences which would ensue to an interest which seemed, and seemed
                    naturally, to be the very centre of English national life. Statesmen may well be
                    excused from venturing on economical changes of a vast and extended character,
                    even though the propriety of the change may be proved to demonstration; for a
                    period of change, however beneficent it may be in the end, is almost invariably
                    accompanied by temporary and severe loss.</p>
                <p>Already, however, there were far-sighted men who predicted that this loss, if
                    loss did ensue from the change, would be a minimum. They discovered
                    oranticipated this in pursuance of that other fundamental law of prices already
                    hinted at. When the products of any industry are numerous, and all are in
                    demand, such an alteration in the cost of producing one of these products as
                    makes it, from being the most profitable branch of the calling, the least, is
                    followed by an exaltation in the value of the other products. Thus it is
                    constantly the case that the bye-products of a complex industry are found to be
                    the sole source of business profits. Such at least is said to be the fact in the
                    manufacture of gas and soda ash, and it is alleged that even if a substitute be
                    found for gas as a means of lighting, the value of the bye-products in the
                    manufacture is so great, and the use of them so indispensable in the economy of
                    society, that the manufacture would still be necessary and profitable. But there
                    is no illustration of the law which is so exact and invariable as that supplied
                    by agriculture. During the existence of the corn laws, the profits of the farmer
                    and the rents of the landowner were estimated in wheat. It was from the probable
                    decline in the value of wheat that all the sinister predictions as to the future
                    of the landed interest were derived. So entirely did grain, especially wheat,
                    form the measure of agricultural values that ten years before the repeal of the
                    corn laws the commutation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n792/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0792-0757"/> of tithes took no account of any other kind of
                    agricultural produce than the three principal cereals, although in that
                    commutation interests, lay and clerical, of not less, in capital value, than 150
                    millions sterling were involved. Even here, however, the tithe-owner has
                    suffered no loss by the change, for though the price of wheat has fallen, the
                    decline has been more than compensated by the upward movement in the price of
                    barley and oats. Since the repeal of the corn laws, the tithe rent charge has
                    been 2⅜ per cent, above par value. Far greater, however, has been the
                    consequence of the change on the price of other agricultural products,
                    especially meat and dairy produce, the value of which has nearly, if not quite,
                    doubled during the last forty years. Now this result was anticipated in a rough
                    manner by the shrewder heads among landowners and occupiers, and therefore
                    reconciled many whose interests might seem to be imperilled to a change which,
                    while it threatened a superficial and temporary loss, might easily determine in
                    a permanent and increasing profit. And finally, the farmers learnt by
                    demonstration and experience that, whoever might gain by restrictions on the
                    trade in food, they did not; and that in some unexplained manner the machinery
                    of a law which seemed to be intended for their profit either turned out to be a
                    loss, or was wholly inadequate to secure the results intended. And yet, though
                    the people were starved, manufacture was unprofitable, foreign trade was
                    declining, and the revenue had been constantly insufficient for the expenses of
                    government, it needed the catastrophe of the Irish famine in order to give
                    effect to an agitation more prolonged, more costly, and more popular than any
                    which has happened in the history of a civilized nation, to effect a peaceful
                    repeal of laws which did no person whatever any good, which were no advantage
                    whatever to the parties for whose special benefit they were enacted, and which
                    inflicted prodigious losses on the two most important classes in the community,
                    the producer and the consumer.</p>
                <p>The history of the movement which led to the repeal of the English corn laws in
                    1846 has been sketched at some length, in order to show that if, in a case where
                    the impolicy and the injury of the law was proved to demonstration, it was so
                    arduous a task to effect a change, the difficulty is far greater in those
                    countries where it is not possible to array such formidable forces against the
                    continuance of a protective system. It is easy to show that the law of prices
                    above referred to applies with the same cogency to the collective industries of
                    any country whatever as it does to such industries as necessarily supply varied
                    products, and that any artificial attempts to direct the home and foreign trade
                    of a country into special channels is sure to bring about a factitious
                    exaltation of one set of values, and a factitious depreciation of another set of
                    values. Various Governments in Europe, in the New World, and in the British
                    colonies have striven to start special industries. They will succeed in the
                    attempt, however injudicious the attempt may be, if there be a demand for the
                    product which they determine to artificially foster. But from two consequences
                    they cannot escape. The consumer of the produce thus stimulated into an
                    unnatural or premature existence must pay for the policy of the Government in
                    enhanced prices, and the producer of goods must offer more of his goods for sale
                    in order to effect an exchange in that which the Government permits to be
                    imported, but hinders either in kind or quality with a protective tax. But it by
                    no means follows that, when the consequence of this policy is exhibited, when
                    its mischief is demonstrated, when its futility is exposed, nay, even when it is
                    proved that, on pretence of doing a special service to the Government and the
                    people which it is intended to aid, it deliberately gives the maximum of
                    advantage to the foreign exporter, and inflicts the maximum of loss on the
                    domestic consumer, the country which makes the discovery will reverse its
                    policy. For, apart from the considerations which have been dwelt on above, the
                    fact, namely, that the revocation of a protective duty which is efficient in
                    raising prices must be followed by a loss to the producer, the existing practice
                    may always be defended by a number of plausible arguments, held, it should be
                    admitted, with perfect good faith by those who promulgate them, however shallow
                    and erroneous they may seem to others, whose passions and interests ’are not
                    stimulated to defend such a practice. With the same sincerity of conviction the
                    defence may be further supplemented by appeals to an irrelevant patriotism, or
                    by an imputation of sinister motives on the part of assailants, or by a bold
                    assertion that the social condition of other countries differs radically from
                    that of the district in which protection is maintained. And finally, in all
                    political and economical movements, it must be repeated, the forces of defence
                    are far more manageable than those of attack. For, as the defenders are in
                    possession, and the sentiment of civilized societies is always favourable to
                    existing interests, the defence can urge, if not with truth, at least with great
                    effect, that it is dangerous to relinquish what is actual, and under which
                    society has long existed, for that which is hypothetical, problematical,
                    experimental; and it can always threaten its assailants with the indefinite
                    danger of the discontent which may come from a great and far-reaching change.
                    Those who remember the history of the free-trade movement in England are well
                    aware that all these expedients were used against the promoters of the movement,
                    though the position which the defence occupied was singularly untenable. But it
                    is certain that in countries which have adopted protection the defence will be
                    more stubborn, and the struggle more protracted than it was in England more than
                    thirty years ago. And in illustration of this fact, it may be observed that it
                    took all the forces at the disposal of the personal Government of the second
                    French empire, and all the threats of a power which was then at the highest of
                    its reputation for military prowess and domestic control, to impose upon the
                    French manufacturers, even in view of great reciprocal advantages to the most
                    important and natural among the domestic industries of France, the very moderate
                    concessions of the commercial treaty with England. The Government of Napoleon
                    actually went to the length of informing the iron manufacturers of France that
                    they would be held personally responsible for the effects of any discontent that
                    might arise by any act of theirs towards their workmen which might be taken in
                    view of the contemplated changes; and the menace was effectual, because it was
                    not doubted that it would be followed by action, and that this action would be
                    irresistible.</p>
                <p>As the origin of protective enactments was a desire that a nation should profit
                    by the losses of another nation, and as the extension of this feeling is the
                    primary motive of war, so a permanent or persistent division of international
                    interests, with the object of sustaining or promoting municipal or rather
                    particular interests, is a fruitful source of international difficulties. It is,
                    in fact, what Thucydides calls, speaking of the caution with which commercial
                    intercourse was carried on in the days which preceded the great Peloponnesian
                    war, an unproclaimed war. Many forms of patriotism, falsely so called, have
                    inflicted grievous and ineffaceable injuries on mankind. The war for empire be
                    tween the old and new notions of government, which was at the root of the
                    Peloponnesian war, was the ruin of Greek civilization. But each of the
                    combatants appealed to the patriotism of race, and the defence of repugnant
                    institutions. The Thirty Years’ War threw back Europe for two centuries, and
                    left behind it memories, jealousies, policies, the effects of which are even now
                    dominant in the attitude of the great <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n793/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0793-0758"/> European powers, and in the∙forms of European
                    government. Still the Thirty Years’ War was a struggle between anarchy and
                    despotism, interminable disunion and forcible unity, and could appeal to some
                    noble passions in the midst of a mass of ignoble aims, to some generous purposes
                    in the confusion of a host of sordid and mean impulses. But wars for the
                    monopoly of trade and production have done nothing but mischief, have not been
                    varied by any worthy purpose, have been, as Adam Smith described them with
                    honest energy and undeniable truth, mean and malignant. Not much better is the
                    temper which carries on a furtive war against the general industry and the
                    general good of mankind under the spurious name of a patriotic protection. But
                    it must be admitted that no tendency of civilized societies is so inveterate,
                    because none is defended with more ingenious and more unconscious sophistry, and
                    none appears to be more necessary for the maintenance of existing interests.</p>
                <p>Nations accommodate themselves, but with losses which may be easily described,
                    though they cannot perhaps be numerically calculated, to protective restraints
                    on trade. But it is a penalty on having been in the right that any departure
                    from the right into the wrong is more mischievous than it is to remain in the
                    wrong. The people of England are, as far as manufactures and trade are
                    concerned, fairly committed to free trade. The world admits that England has
                    prospered under free trade; indeed, it is difficult to deny the fact, and
                    equally difficult to assert that the prosperity which the country has reached
                    has been achieved in spite of free trade. It might be shown that the very
                    circumstances which, thirty years ago or more, were adduced as conditions under
                    which free trade would be ruinous to England have now been alleged in order to
                    explain why it has been exceptionally beneficial. The growth of population has
                    given a practical refutation to the alarms of Malthus, though it has not
                    rebutted and could not rebut the abstract principles on which that theory was
                    founded. The repeal of the com laws has modified the Ricardian theory of rent,
                    and has reduced it to the explanation of the cause which measures the difference
                    between the rent paid for the same superficial extent in two pieces of ground.
                    The same fact has been a cure for the currency crazes which the old sliding
                    scale used to foster, for the notion that we might be impoverished by a drain of
                    gold, and for the dread that the country would be ruined if the balance value in
                    the imports exceeded that of the exports. A thousand economical fallacies still
                    dominant in the minds of those who are in the darkness of protection have been
                    dissipated in the light of free trade. The English people were, as far as the
                    fundamental principles of social economy were concerned, in the cave of Plato,
                    mistaking shadows for realities, and constrained to get their impression of the
                    shadow from the false mirror of an artificial system. But free trade has put
                    English industry into the daylight, and with the daylight the country has
                    gradually become familiar. More or less violent reconstructions of society, the
                    socialism with which much of civilized Europe is pestered, the paternal theory
                    of government in its most grotesque form under which the American republic
                    attempts to control and distribute the occupation of its free citizens, are to
                    Englishmen as extinct as the animal worship of Egypt, the nature worship of
                    Greece, and the other strange beliefs which have been popular in the infancy of
                    the world and of its knowledge. That English trade and manufactures are open to
                    dangers which may check or diminish their prosperity must be admitted, but those
                    dangers are of a totally different kind from those which menace the progress of
                    such countries as imagine that protection is a safeguard.</p>
                <p>The great advantage which free trade has bestowed on English manufacture consists
                    in the fact that it has enabled the producer to interpret accurately the cost of
                    production, and therefore to discover the prospect which his industry has of a
                    remunerative market. It is superfluous to protect an industry which is strong
                    enough to assert itself in the rivalry of competition. It is similarly
                    superfluous to protect an industry the products of which, by reason of their
                    bulk and cheapness, are shielded from competition by the costs of carrying the
                    same products from foreign parts, or even from remote districts within the same
                    political system. It may be inferred, therefore, that protection is not demanded
                    except in cases where the industry would be exposed to the dangerous or
                    successful rivalry of the foreign manufacturer, and therefore is carried on
                    under circumstances which, by increasing the cost of production, render the
                    employment of labour and capital on the industry in question a less advantageous
                    outlay than they could be in other objects. If it comes to pass that under
                    favourable circumstances the protected industry can cope with unprotected rivals
                    in a common market, it is clear that the necessity for protection has passed
                    away, and that the existence of the restraint is needless and vexatious. Thus,
                    for example, if it be true that American cotton cloth can successfully compete
                    against Manchester goods in China, or Japan, or Central Africa, it can, <hi
                    rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> compete successfully against Manchester goods in
                    the United States themselves. But it also follows that, if this position be not
                    attained, the existence of the restraint is a constant impediment to its being
                    attained, because the industry, as estimated by the cost at which its product is
                    attained, invariably accommodates itself to the circumstances which naturally or
                    artificially control its production, especially, in reference to the amount of
                    capital and labour devoted to it, and the rate of profit which the manufacturer
                    enjoys. There is no reason to believe that in the protected manufactures of
                    Germany, France, and the United States the profit of the manufacturers is
                    greater than is derived from unprotected industries,—that, for example, the
                    French ironmaster or cotton-spinner gains a greater advantage from his calling
                    than the wine-grower does. On the contrary, the loudest complaints of declining
                    trade, and the baneful influence of foreign rivalry, are heard from the
                    industries which have successfully demanded the assistance of protective duties.
                    It is always the case, and it always will be the case, that the opulence and
                    prosperity of a country will depend on the success with which its natural
                    industries are prosecuted, and on the prudence which it shows in hitting the
                    proper time in which other industries may be attempted with a reasonable
                    prospect of remunerative profit. For just as weakly plants and animals are the
                    first to succumb to those climatal or atmospheric conditions which are
                    unfavourable to health and vigour, as in the struggle for existence feeble
                    stocks disappear and more energetic forms occupy their place, so industries
                    which need artificial support are the first to feel commercial adversity, and
                    the last to recover from it. It is stated, and the statement is not seriously
                    controverted, however much the true interpretation of the facts is disguised or
                    resisted, that during the period of commercial depression which began after 1874
                    the countries in which the greatest efforts have been made to sustain artificial
                    industries have suffered more than England, which has conceded no such
                    assistance whatever.</p>
                <p>But it is not only in the fact that the producer is able in an atmosphere of free
                    action to interpret the prospects of his own market best, and to solve most
                    readily the problem as to what is the relation between cost of production and
                    possible profit, that the value of free-trade principles is discerned. The same
                    principles which in England have been happily recognized as fundamental have
                    indirectly done more to soften the differences between employer and labourer
                    than anything else. No civilized country has had <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0794-0759"/> more reason to fear the consequences of hostility
                    between capital and labour than England has. For nearly five centuries the
                    legislature of this country strove to regulate the rate of wages in the interest
                    of employers. To the numberless and severe statutes of labourers, which began
                    with 1350 and were continued in full force up to 1825, when they were relaxed
                    rather than repealed, we owe the English poor law in the first place and the
                    trade union in the second. It was natural, when the English Government had been
                    attempting for so long a time to keep down wages by law, and looked with so much
                    hostility on any organization among the working classes which seemed likely to
                    better their lot, that when the severity of these laws was relaxed the labourers
                    should eagerly adopt the machinery from the use of which they had been so long
                    debarred. But deplorable as has been the combat between labour and capital, and
                    blameworthy as many acts have been on both sides, no one who has given any
                    attention to the subject can fail of noticing that the aims of the trade unions
                    are simple and intelligible, that the representatives of these combinations
                    court debate, criticism, and sympathy from the public to which they appeal, and
                    that the struggle is carried on with increasing mildness and forbearance, The
                    English unions do not aim at reconstructing society, nor demand subventions from
                    the state as a means by which they may resist the power of the capitalist, nor
                    adopt those projects which give from time to time such trouble to Continental
                    Governments. The fact is, the English parliament has withdrawn all artificial
                    aids from the capitalist, and the workman is content to stand on the same level
                    with his employer as far as the state is concerned. But where, as in other parts
                    of the civilized world, the state, for some reason or the other, has determined
                    on fostering the existence of an industry which cannot exist without state help,
                    or does not think it can, the workman is sure to attempt, with what success he
                    can, either to appropriate a part of the extraordinary profit which the
                    Government, in the early stages of its action, accords to the capitalist, or to
                    demand that an analogous benefit should be conferred on him by the operation of
                    law. The protective system of Continental Europe is the source and the strength
                    of European socialism, and is responsible for its fallacies and its excesses.
                    Those Englishmen who lived through and watched the simultaneous energies of the
                    Chartist movement and the free-trade agitation had abundant opportunities for
                    inferring what turned out to be the fact, that the success of the latter
                    movement would be a death-blow to the former project. When at the outbreak of
                    the civil war in the United States a rigidly protective tariff was imposed on
                    the Union in lieu of a more moderate system, those who had busied themselves
                    with the phenomena of production and the social relations of economical forces
                    were able to predict that, apart from the more obvious evils which ensue from a
                    false step in the political economy of a nation, the attitude of labour towards
                    capital would be aggressive, distrustful, and menacing, and that the mischief,
                    when once generated, would be growing and permanent. Government in England
                    interferes very little with the action of individuals, but this is possible
                    because Government in England abstains as much as possible from meddling with
                    those relations which can be made to adjust themselves. In England the adage of
                    Mr J. S. Mill, that “the best remedy for the evils of liberty is more liberty,”
                    may be a wise generalization, but when the liberty of labour is curtailed, it is
                    not quite so clear that a Government can with safety to itself dispense with
                    that control from which English social life is happily free.</p>
                <p>The adoption of protectionist principles in civilized and industrial communities
                    is undoubtedly an injury to such other communities as have adopted free-trade
                    principles, because it curtails their market, and induces an uncertainty as to
                    whether the produce of their labour will find a sale. This mischief is
                    exaggerated when the prohibitory or protecting tax is a variable amount. Thus
                    during the existence of the English corn laws the foreign agriculturist was
                    unable to foresee whether the demand for his produce in England, under the
                    pressure of scarcity, would be admissible for him at remunerative rates, and he
                    was consequently deterred from anticipating this demand. If indeed the demand
                    did arise, his gains might be enormous, provided he had it in his power to
                    satisfy the demand. For example, at one time the sliding scale was fixed so high
                    that foreign corn was admitted duty free only when the market prices in England
                    marked 84s. a quarter. If such a price were reached, and the importer was in
                    possession of a considerable stock, which he had been able to store in bond at
                    35s., he could instantly take advantage of the situation, and greatly to his own
                    advantage. It is true that such an occasional contingency did not compensate for
                    the general insecurity of his industry, and the risk which he ran in waiting on
                    a market into which he might never be able to enter. Hence the repeal of the
                    English corn laws has given a very powerful stimulant to agricultural industry
                    over the whole world.</p>
                <p>Fixed duties do not operate so disastrously on foreign trade, even when the fixed
                    duty is levied on such products as vary in quantity, and therefore in price,
                    with the seasons. For in the vast majority of products values conform generally
                    to the cost of production, and even in those which, like food, are determined
                    also by the relations of demand and supply the wider the area is from which they
                    are derived, the less are they liable to variation in supply, the element of
                    demand being nearly a uniform quantity. Still it must be remembered that all
                    duties on imports check consumption, and, by implication, discourage production.
                    The proof of this is seen in the fact that the reduction of any duty on an
                    article in general demand is always followed by a rise in price, which continues
                    till supply corresponds to the new demand. If therefore duties levied for the
                    purposes of revenue have this effect, then, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi>
                    duties designedly imposed for the sake of protection will have a similar effect
                    If the protective enactment has any force at all, it must diminish the market of
                    the country against which it is levelled. It may not be wholly effective, but it
                    must have some effect. Thus, when under the Berlin and Milan decrees the first
                    Napoleon strove to expel all British manufactures, and all the produce of the
                    British colonies, from such parts of Europe as he could control, it is
                    unquestionable that these decrees were a hindrance to British commerce, though
                    to a considerable extent English manufacturers were able to elude them.</p>
                <p>Still the country which adopts free trade has a great advantage in trade over
                    such countries as adopt protection even in its commercial intercourse with them.
                    There is no country which wishes to curtail the export of its raw materials, in
                    the production of which it has natural advantages, and of course it is equally
                    willing to export its protected manufactures. Now it is plain that it would
                    prefer to deal with a country which, unlike itself, imposes the least possible
                    restraint on importation, and that the most advantageous market would be that in
                    which no restraint at all was put. In order to use this market then, it will be
                    content to offer its goods on the most favourable terms, and under the
                    conditions of the strictest competition. It knows that a country which adopts
                    free trade is best able to interpret its own demands, and its own power to
                    satisfy the demand of other countries. Hence a free-trade country is a national
                    entrepôt, in which foreign goods are procurable at the lowest rates. In
                    addition, as has been stated before, the country which puts no artificial
                    restraint on its power of general purchase has always a great advantage in all
                    commercial<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n795/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0795-0760"/> transactions over a country which does put such a
                    restraint on itself.</p>
                <p>Free trade then, as understood in England, means such a liberty of production and
                    exchange as is unfettered by any of the restraints which have been imposed, in
                    order that special industries may be artificially stimulated, by the machinery
                    of a fiscal system. But there are other uses of the term which may be touched
                    on, and in particular the application of it to labour and land. It was stated at
                    the commencement of this article that Governments, in pursuance of their
                    standing duty, that of protecting the weak against the strong, may and should
                    put limits on free action as regards labour, and it is alleged that the
                    expression free trade in land is a misnomer. We shall attempt, in concluding
                    this article, to give a brief explanation of the historical and other
                    circumstances which have brought about the present state of things in England,
                    and to define the economical conditions under which the relations of labour to
                    production, aud land to agriculture, are capable of an economical estimate.</p>
                <p>As the policy of ancient states did not attempt to control trade in the interest
                    of their own citizens, so it did not hinder the individual in the prosecution of
                    any industry. There is no evidence that the professions were practised by
                    persons specially licensed for that purpose, and it is certain that the
                    craftsmen of antiquity were not compelled to pass through a period of
                    apprenticeship before they could follow their calling. In modern times, however,
                    the practice of licensing the members of certain professions, and of exacting a
                    period of servitude in all crafts and trades, under the name of apprenticeship,
                    has been nearly universal Up to comparatively recent times the same legal
                    instrument was employed as a preliminary to the study of law and physic as was
                    demanded from the trader and the artisan. The origin of the custom, which was
                    assailed on principle by Adam Smith, is to be found in the history of the
                    charters which were obtained by towns. These charters were purchased from
                    sovereigns or such lay and spiritual proprietors as possessed towns in fee. The
                    privileges which such instruments conferred were considerable and valuable, were
                    eagerly sought after and guarded with jealousy. Among the most important of
                    these <hi rend="smallcaps">ìq</hi> England was the right of assuring, after a
                    short uninterrupted residence within a walled town, the franchise of a free man
                    to the resident serf. It was therefore expedient, and in order to avoid arousing
                    any suspicion that the franchises of the town were abused, that some significant
                    limit should be put on the acquisition of these privileges by individuals.
                    Hence, at a very early period, guilds were established in chartered towns;
                    enrolment in some guild became a necessary prelude to sharing the franchises of
                    the town; and apprenticeship was made the condition under which persons could
                    ordinarily enter the guild and practise the craft or trade. There is reason to
                    believe that the customs of these trading companies put it into the power of
                    those who administered the affairs of these companies to exercise a large and
                    arbitrary control over all the members of the guild. The practice of
                    apprenticeship began, in all likelihood, at an early date, but the earliest
                    instruments which the writer has seen are of the 15th century. It is only, of
                    course, by accident that any have been preserved, since they had only a
                    temporary and personal interest. In course of time the legislature exacted the
                    condition of apprenticeship from all artisans and traders, notably by the 6th of
                    Elizabeth, for during a long period it was the policy of the English parliament
                    to put every possible hindrance on the migration of the agricultural labourer to
                    the towns, and the most successful expedient by which this migration could be
                    checked was that of imposing the servitude of apprenticeship on every one
                    besides the agricultural labourer. A custom then, which commenced with the
                    interest which the trading company had in its chartered monopoly, and which
                    closely resembled the machinery of the regulated companies for foreign trade,
                    was strengthened and finally enforced by the parliament itself. In course of
                    time the legislature abandoned its ancient policy, except in so far as it
                    exacted from certain professions the equivalent of apprenticeship, on the ground
                    that by so doing it protected the public against incompetence and fraud. The
                    retention of apprenticeship in certain kinds of manual labour is due to the
                    action of trade unions, voluntary associations which occupy a somewhat similar
                    position to the guild companies of the Middle Ages, and which exercise an
                    influence over a far larger number of persons than are formally contained in the
                    association. The object of apprenticeship in handicrafts is to maintain a high
                    rate of wages by stinting the number of persons who are engaged in the
                    occupation. Hence, and for the same reason, artisans object to the importation
                    of foreign labour, especially in such callings as are protected by
                    apprenticeship. On no other ground, at least, would it be consistent to
                    acquiesce in the importation of the products of labour and, by free trade in
                    food, of what may be called the raw material of labour, and to object to the
                    free circulation of labour itself.</p>
                <p>It is a question of merely speculative interest to ask whether a Government does
                    wisely in restraining the practice of certain callings to those who have been
                    certified to have passed through a preparatory training for the calling. It is
                    only a little over sixty years since it put the restraint on medical practice,
                    aud the limits which have similarly been imposed on the legal profession
                    originated in the recognition of certain persons only in certain courts of law.
                    But there is no theoretical defence for the privilege accorded to such certified
                    persons, except it be that by these means the public is protected from the
                    danger of employing incompetent practitioners. The police which the legislature
                    exercises over unlicensed persons must not be supposed to be in the interests of
                    those who are permitted to practice, but in that of those who employ
                    professional services. There is, however, a tendency towards increasing the area
                    over which this police is exercised, and latterly some public teachers, for
                    example, who are employed in primary schools are made liable to the obligation
                    of satisfying some public authority as to their competence for the work which
                    they undertake. On the other hand, there are writers who argue that all such
                    restraints are mischievous, not only because they control the choice of
                    occupation, and are, therefore; invasions of natural and innocent liberty, but
                    because they do not and cannot supply any proof of practical ability on the part
                    of those who are certified, and because they weaken the habit of caution and
                    prudence which all persons should possess as far as possible in selecting those
                    in whom they may place their confidence. Why, it may be asked, they say, should
                    a lawyer be certified to carry on his calling on the ground that the trust
                    reposed in him makes it expedient that the law should exercise a control over
                    this calling, and a similar restraint be not extended over bankers, whose
                    relations to their customers are even more delicate and confidential than those
                    of lawyers <hi rend="italic">ì</hi></p>
                <p>Again, there are callings in which no restraint is put on the choice of the
                    calling, but an energetic control is exercised over the practice of the calling,
                    a control which sometimes extends so far as to prohibit some practices which are
                    historically connected with the calling. Thus, since 1844, no new English bank
                    is allowed to issue and circulate notes payable to bearer, such a note being
                    virtually a cheque payable at sight, and drawn by the banker on his own assets.
                    The motive for putting this disability on bankers was to prevent the undue
                    extension of a paper currency. But even though it may be doubted whether such a
                    result was effected, or even that there was danger of such a result, the
                    restraint on free action can be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0796-0761"/> defended on the ground that the acceptance of
                    such a note puts a risk on the holder to which he should not be subject, and
                    that the refusal to accept such notes suggests a suspicion that the issuing
                    parties are of doubtful solvency. Again, there are certain callings over which a
                    police is exercised in the interests of the revenue, as on those persons who are
                    engaged in the manufacture of excisable articles. There can be no doubt that
                    such a supervision is a hindrance to trade, and some persons who advocate direct
                    taxation have alleged, as one of the strongest arguments in favour of their
                    theory, that the abandonment of all excise and customs regulations would make
                    England a free port for the whole world, would greatly extend its commerce and
                    its manufacturing energy, and widen its markets. And lastly, there are certain
                    callings which are permitted, but watched and controlled in the interests of
                    morality. Of these the most notable is the occupancy of houses where
                    intoxicating liquors are sold, and of other places of public entertainment. Few
                    persons doubt that an efficient and incessant supervision should be exercised
                    over these places, though they differ widely as to the extent and character of
                    the control, and the agencies by which the control should be put into operation.
                    The regulation of public houses is the oldest form of domestic police over
                    occupations in England, for it can be traced back to the manorial inspection
                    which was general after the Conquest, even if it did not exist in the
                    Anglo-Saxon village. English law, therefore, exercises a control or restraint of
                    trade over industries which are laudable, or innocent, or legal, because it is
                    found, or is thought to be found, that they may be abused to serious public
                    inconvenience or mischief. Some amusing illustrations of the extent to which the
                    privilege of unlimited issue of bankers’ paper may be abused are afforded in the
                    history of what was called “wild-cat banking” in the Western States of the
                    American Union. It is remarkable that the United States, which have adopted, and
                    to a great extent with evident sincerity, extreme views in favour of the policy
                    of protection against foreign rivals, have also permitted from time to time, and
                    with scarcely any check, extreme licence in the conduct of business within the
                    limits of the Union itself.</p>
                <p>With the exception of these and analogous instances,— when the safety and morals
                    of the public justify, to a larger or smaller extent, the supervision of the
                    state over the free choice of industry,—the concession of that free trade in
                    labour which puts the minimum of hindrance on the field of employment and the
                    character of employment which the producer selects is quite as important to the
                    wellbeing of a state as the concession of a free agency to its capital and a
                    free market for its products. For as all wealth is the produce of labour, and as
                    the efficiency of labour is the first and last condition of national progress,
                    as the efficiency of labour is primarily brought about by the division of
                    employments, and as the division of employments knows no limit as long as the
                    market of products is extended, so it is of the highest interest to the
                    efficiency of labour that the field of its operations should be as open and free
                    as possible. But here it is to the purpose to observe that the natural
                    distribution of labour/very often masks the effect of a mischievous economical
                    system. There is no country in which this fact has been so systematically
                    ignored as in the American Union. In the United States, economists who have
                    steadily maintained, with the best arguments at their disposal, that the growth
                    and progress of their country has been assisted by the adoption of a protective
                    system, have omitted, in all their estimates of what constitutes the material
                    progress of the Union, the fact that, in whatever other directions they have
                    regulated industry and commerce on a protectionist basis, they have always, and
                    to an extent that no other country has done, accepted and insisted on free trade
                    in labour. They have not only welcomed all comers,—some little irritation at
                    Irish labour, and a more serious objection to Chinese immigration excepted,—but
                    they have imposed no tariff on the importation of labour, nor even contemplated
                    such an extension of protection to American industry. It would not, however, be
                    difficult to show that, on the grounds ordinarily taken by American statesmen
                    and publicists, they would be consistent in denouncing the immigration of
                    aliens. They have, however, with a happy inconsistency, not only; not taken this
                    step, but they have wisely and advantageously insisted that the Old World notion
                    of indefeasible allegiance shall be relaxed, at least on behalf of those who
                    have made the United States their home. Here they have been free traders without
                    stint. And it has been fortunate for America that they have not extended such
                    prohibitions to alien humanity as they have to the products of that labour which
                    alien humanity has offered them for sale. For several years the United States
                    received about 200,000 emigrants annually from the Old World. It is a moderate
                    estimate that each of these persons represented an outlay of at least £150 in
                    his bringing up, or in other words that, had he been born in the United States,
                    he would have cost at least as much as this sum to bring him into that state of
                    efficiency which he carries to his new home. The Old World has therefore been
                    bestowing a voluntary tribute of £30,000,000 annually on the United States, a
                    contribution which is quite sufficient to balance the mischievous effects of
                    economical fallacies, though it is possible that these fallacies may be so
                    disastrous as to neutralize the value of this branch of American imports, or
                    even to check the importation altogether. Not, indeed, that the effects of
                    unwise economical action are easily or rapidly discovered. The present advantage
                    of restraint for the benefit of the producer is obvious; the consumer is left
                    out of sight, and is commonly unconscious of the process which is narrowing his
                    powers. At last, when the consequences do come, sophistry and self-interest are
                    both active in assigning the facts to other causes than those which are really
                    dominant, and in resenting and resisting all change.</p>
                <p>When it is said that the principles of free trade should be applied to land, it
                    is meant that a natural object, the products of which are of supreme necessity
                    to mankind, is not rendered accessible to purchasers, or not rendered so
                    profitable to occupiers as the interest of the public requires. Land in populous
                    countries is, relative to the community, very limited in amount, and as it is
                    the <hi rend="italic">locus standi</hi> of all industries, its distribution, as
                    is alleged, should not be so restrained as to induce a restraint on the
                    efficiency of industry. No economist worthy of the name has ever disputed the
                    sacredness of private property. To do so would be to undermine the very
                    foundations of his science. No economist, even though he may be betrayed into
                    heresies as to the nature and extent of free exchange, has ever doubted that
                    within certain geographical limits the fullest freedom of innocent production
                    and trade should be accorded. No American protectionist has yet argued that it
                    is expedient, in order to develop at the earliest period the possible
                    manufactures of the Western States, that these States should be allowed to
                    restrain by prohibitive duties the cotton and hardware of New England. All
                    discussions therefore about free trade in any commodity, and among others in
                    land, must presuppose that property should be respected, and exchange should be
                    free. If the so-called economist denies the name of property to that which must
                    be secured to its owner, in order that industry may be exercised in the best
                    possible way, he has abandoned the principles of his science. And if, on the
                    other hand, it be insinuated that, while he is seeking to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n797/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0797-0762"/> point out the manner in which industry may be
                    most productive, he is assailing the ownership of that kind of property on which
                    all industry is exercised, the criticism is invidious and unfair. It needs no
                    proof that the success of industry and the material progress of society cannot
                    be expected, except under the guarantee of private property in land, as well as
                    in its products. And furthermore, there is no reason for objecting on economical
                    grounds to the process by which the distribution of land in England is
                    restrained, unless it can be shown that the existing system is a check to
                    industry, or a hindrance to supply, or an impediment to the effective
                    development of agricultural skill.</p>
                <p>It cannot be denied that, if the claim to free trade in land is intended to imply
                    that, under existing circumstances, a very small portion of that which would be
                    distributed by sale is brought into the market, the fact corresponds with the
                    statement. The custom of primogeniture directly tends towards the restraint of
                    distribution, and the power of settlement acts more energetically in the same
                    direction. Nor can any one doubt that there are circumstances under which the
                    custom and the power operate disadvantageously. When the owner of land is
                    virtually bankrupt, it would clearly be far better if the estate which he cannot
                    improve were in the hands of those who can improve it, for the misuse of a
                    necessary industrial instrument has worse effects on the economy of society than
                    the ill use of the products of industry. The one is the same as inducing
                    artificial barrenness on a portion of that which is limited in amount and is of
                    supreme utility, and the other is the waste of that which is practically
                    unlimited, and which can be supplemented from other sources. Again, the ill use
                    of land is a total loss; but the prodigality of one who squanders the produce of
                    labour is only a partial waste, for much of the wealth which seems to be
                    expended on the pleasures and follies of individuals is really transferred to
                    those who are capable of making a better use of it than its original possessor
                    does. Hence, when land is in the hands of bankrupt proprietors to such an extent
                    as seriously to hinder its adequate occupancy, it has not been thought a
                    violation of the rights of property to dispossess the bankrupt owner by a
                    compulsory sale, and to put a new and more competent proprietor in his place.
                    Such a step was taken, and with very satisfactory results, in Ireland, and there
                    is reason to believe that similar powers might on many occasions be exercised
                    with advantage in England. In a minor degree charges on land are a hindrance to
                    its adequate improvement, for the means of the proprietor of a burdened estate
                    are diminished, while if the land were in other hands its resources would be
                    developed. Analogous to these inconveniences are the costs of conveyance, and
                    the demand of superfluous guarantees of title.</p>
                <p>But the phrase “free trade in land” has been obscured by its connexion with
                    another aspect of the relations between the owner of land and its adequate
                    cultivation, the interpretation, namely, which divers disputants give to the
                    freedom which accompanies contracts for the occupancy of land. In England, as is
                    well known, the owner and the occupant of land are, unlike the case in most
                    other countries, almost universally different persons. Such a difference began
                    very early in English society, that is, towards the latter end of the 14th
                    century, and has no doubt become more marked by the peculiar customs which
                    affect the ownership of land in England. Now it is alleged that under existing
                    circumstances no true freedom of contract exists on the part of the
                    occupant,—that the power which custom has given to the owner, and which law has
                    strengthened, is so great that the occupier is virtually helpless; that the
                    legitimate progress of agriculture is checked; and that a supply which skill
                    could make almost indefinite, and which might be made to satisfy the wants of
                    the population, is wholly inadequate for the purpose, the deficiency being
                    wastefully supplemented from foreign importations. For it is asserted that one
                    of the contracting parties has it in his power, by the extent of his resources,
                    to reduce the other party to the most disadvantageous terms of a precarious
                    occupancy, and that, though the occupant may be blamed for submitting to such
                    terms, or at least be held responsible for the bargain which he has voluntarily
                    made, the public is interested to a very serious extent in a better and freer
                    relation between owner and occupier. And it is further urged that freedom of
                    contract is not to be limited to the moment in which the bargain is struck, but
                    must in continuous relations be so continuously present that neither of the
                    contracting parties should be able to inflict a permanent loss on the other,—or,
                    in other words, that contracts cannot be called free unless they are constantly
                    liable to an equitable revision. The controversy has been carried on in England
                    and Scotland in the form of an attack in the latter kingdom on the local law of
                    hypothec, in the former, and to a less extent in the latter, under the claim of
                    compensation for unexhausted improvements. As yet no legislation of a practical
                    character has been the result of a controversy in which some intelligent tenant
                    farmers on the one hand, and principally on the other the duke of Argyll, have
                    been the disputants.</p>
                <p>It is probable that on the whole successful agriculture, that is, the production
                    of the largest quantity in value from the soil at the least cost, has made more
                    progress in the United Kingdom than in any other country. This has been
                    especially the case with stock breeding, the preeminence of the United Kingdom
                    being marked and admitted in this department of agriculture. But this fact
                    itself, as the occupier is less within the power of the owner as a stock-breeder
                    than he is as a mere cultivator, seems to suggest that the relations of the two
                    parties need a better understanding than they have yet received, or that their
                    contracts will at some time or the other require the interpretation of law. The
                    difficulties, however, of any question as to the limits and control of freedom
                    in the contracts entered into between the subjects or citizens of the same
                    Government are great and nice. There is but little difficulty in showing that
                    the best interests of the whole human race are consulted when the fullest
                    freedom is given to the exchange of products, however much the process is
                    hindered by passion or self-interest, and however great may be the practical
                    hindrances in the way of a principle which few men have the hardihood to deny in
                    the abstract. But there are serious difficulties in interpreting the relations
                    in which capitalist and labourer, owner and occupier, stand to each other, and
                    in deciding how the just rights of property may be harmonized with the just
                    claims of industry, and the paramount consideration of the public good. <hi
