                    beyond it in ths widely remote Australian region; thus the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pelodry-</hi><hi rend="italic">ad&lt;x,</hi> a family of tree-frogs, is
                    peculiar to the two; the genus <hi rend="italic">Litoria</hi> is confined to
                    Australia, with the exception of a single species occurring in Paraguay; while
                    the only frog known in New Zealand has its nearest allies in South America.
                    Those regions bear also a negative resemblance in the total absence from both of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Rana,</hi> the 60 species of which are distributed
                    throughout the other quarters of the globe. These facts, among others, have been
                    adduced in support of the theory that at one time the continents of South
                    America and Australia had a land connexion. Frogs are almost totally absent from
                    oceanic islands, a single species <hi rend="italic">(Liopelma Hochstetteri)</hi>
                    occurring in New Zealand, and one or two others in the Pacific islands, as far
                    east as the Fijis, beyond which they are unknown. On the assumption that those
                    islands obtained their present fauna from the nearest continental land, the
                    absence of frogs can be readily explained by the fact that salt water is alike
                    fatal to the adult frog and to its spawn, and thus formed an insuperable barrier
                    to their migration.</p>
                <p>Frogs, as is shown by their wide distribution, are capable of enduring a
                    considerable degree of both heat and cold; they are, however, altogether
                    intolerant of long-continued drought, a desert forming as certain a barrier to
                    their migration as an ocean. Both during their larval stage and afterwards, for
                    the purpose of cutaneous respiration, abundant moisture is a necessity of their
                    existence; consequently, whether they live on the ground or on trees, they are
                    never found far from rivers, marshes, or lakes. In winter the frogs of northern
                    climates hibernate, burying themselves in the mud at the bottom of pools, and
                    lying clustered together in a state of complete torpidity. In hot climates they
                    are said to go into a similar condition, known as “aestivation,” during periods
                    of exceptional heat and drought, in order to retard the dissipation of the
                    moisture in their bodies. On reappearing from their long winter sleep the work
                    of reproduction is at once entered upon, the males making their presence known
                    to the females by the vigorous exercise of their vocal organs. The croaking of
                    the common frog can only be regarded as pleasant from its association with the
                    welcome advent of spring; still more unpleasant, however, is the much louder
                    croak of the edible frog of the Continent, the species to which Horace probably
                    refers in the lines</p>
                <p>“ranaeque palustres</p>
                <p>Avertunt somnos.”</p>
                <p>The eggs of the frog, consisting of little black specks surrounded by an
                    albuminous envelope, are fertilized during their extrusion from the body of the
                    female, and are generally deposited at the bottom of the water, ascending,
                    however, soon after to the surface, owing to the swelling and partial
                    decomposition of the glairy substance surrounding the ova. There are several
                    species known in which the eggs are deposited in an exceptional manner. Those of
                    a small frog <hi rend="italic">(Alytes</hi><hi rend="italic">obstetricans)</hi>
                    found in France and Germany form a long chain, which the male twines round his
                    thighs, retiring with them into seclusion until the young are ready to leave,
                    when he enters the water, and the tadpoles immediately make their escape. The
                    female of an American tree-frog <hi rend="italic">(Nototrema marsupiatum)</hi>
                    has a pouch along the whole extent of its back for the reception of its eggs;
                    and Professor Peters of Berlin has recently drawn attention to a tree-frog of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Polypedates</hi> found in tropical West Africa, in
                    which the female, after depositing her eggs in the usual mass of albuminous
                    jelly, attaches them to the leaves of trees overhanging a dry water-hole or
                    pool. The albumen speedily dries and forms a horny coating on the leaf, under
                    which lie the unimpregnated eggs. On the advent of the rainy season the albumen
                    becomes softened, and the eggs are washed into the pool below, now filled with
                    water, where they are fecundated by the male.</p>
                <p>The development of the egg after impregnation proceeds more or less rapidly
                    according to the temperature, the young of the common frog being hatched,
                    according to Rusconi, in 4 days, in a temperature varying from 70° to 80° Fahr.,
                    while in the climate of England this does not take place in less than a month.
                    The creature which emerges from the egg is altogether unlike a frog, consisting
                    mainly of a bulky head and tail, and wholly destitute of limbs. This is the
                    tadpole or larval stage in the development of the frog, when it is essentially a
                    fish, capable only of existing in water, breathing by gills, and having like a
                    fish a twochambered heart. At first the gills or branchiae are external, but
                    they are soon withdrawn within the branchial cavity, and concealed by an
                    opercular membrane. As the process of development proceeds, the limbs begin to
                    bud forth, the posterior pair appearing first; and with their growth the tail
                    begins to dwindle, not falling off, but being gradually absorbed. At the same
                    time vast changes are taking place in the blood-vascular system, the gills
                    gradually disappearing, two lungs being developed, and the heart becoming
                    three-chambered as in reptiles. The young frog must now come to the surface to
                    breathe, and soon leaves the water altogether. On emerging from the egg, the
                    tadpole at first feeds upon the gelatinous mass which before had formed a
                    protective covering. It is unprovided with teeth, but has two minute horny jaws,
                    which enable it to feed on decaying animal and vegetable matter. According to
                    Bell <hi rend="italic">(British Reptiles),</hi> tadpoles sometimes kill and feed
                    upon each other. “I observed,” he says, “that almost as soon as one had acquired
                    its limbs it was found dead at the bottom of the water, and the remaining
                    tadpoles feeding <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n831/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0831-0796"/> upon it. This took place with all of them
                    successively, excepting the last, which lived on to complete its change.” After
                    leaving the water they feed almost entirely on insects and slugs.</p>
                <p>The form of the frog is too well known to require description, but there are many
                    almost unique features in its organization that may be noticed. Respiration in
                    the adult frog is partly pulmonary; but as it is destitute of ribs, this
                    operation in the frog cannot be performed by the alternate expansion and
                    contraction of the chest, as in other air-breathing animals. The air has to be
                    swallowed in order to be conveyed to the lungs, and the mechanism by which this
                    operation is performed necessitates the closing of its mouth and the admission
                    of air by the nostrils, so that a frog can be most readily suffocated by having
                    its mouth gagged open. Respiration is also partly cutaneous, experiment having
                    shown that the skin gives off carbonic acid gas in sufficient quantity to enable
                    the creature to live for a very considerable time after pulmonary respiration
                    has been stopped. Moisture is as necessary to the skin in the performance of
                    this function as it is to the gills of a fish, and in order to preserve to the
                    utmost its humidity, frogs avoid as much as possible the hot sunlight,
                    sheltering themselves beneath stones or under loose turf, and reappearing on the
                    advent of rain, sometimes in such numbers in a single locality as to have given
                    rise to stories of frog showers. The skin of the frog, however, readily absorbs
                    water; and this it stores up in an internal reservoir, from which it can in
                    seasons of drought moisten the surface of its skin. When a frog is suddenly
                    caught it frequently ejects a quantity of water, and thus suddenly diminishes
                    its volume. The water avoided is not urine, nor is the receptacle containing it
                    the urinary bladder, as was at one time supposed. The skin of frogs is perfectly
                    smooth, having neither plates nor scales, except in the American genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Cera-lophrys</hi> (fig. 1), in certain species of which a few
                    bony plates are enclosed in the skin of the back. The tongue in frogs is
                    probably employed more for the capture of its insect prey than as the organ of
                    taste. It is fixed in front of the mouth, and free behind, and in seizing its
                    prey, the free end, which possesses a viscid secretion, is darted suddenly
                    forward, the captured insect being as suddenly transported to the back part of
                    the mouth. Nothing can exceed the rapidity with which this motion is performed.
                    Minute teeth are present in the upper jaw, and on the palate, in the true frogs.
                    The vocal organs by which the characteristic croaking is produced differ
                    somewhat in different species, a similar variety appearing in the quantity and
                    quality of their song. The male of the edible frog is provided with bladder-like
                    cheek pouches—the so-called vocal sacs—which it distends with air when in the
                    act of croaking, an operation which it performs to such purpose as to have
                    received the name of “Dutch nightingale” on the Continent, and “Cambridgeshire
                    nightingale” in England. The bull-frog <hi rend="italic">{Rana</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mugiens)</hi> has a laryngeal mechanism which Cuvier compared
                    to a kettledrum, by which it produces a sound not unlike the bellowing of a bulL
                    The sound produced by the tree frogs is both loud and shrill, but in certain
                    circumstances it seems to be somewhat pleasing. Thus Darwin says, “Near Rio de
                    Janeiro I used often to sit in the evening to listen to a number of little <hi
                        rend="italic">Hylae,</hi> which, perched on blades of grass close to the
                    water, sent forth sweet chirping notes in harmony.” The voice of another
                    tree-frog <hi rend="italic">{Hyla</hi><hi rend="italic">crepitans)</hi> has been
                    compared to the sound produced “by the cracking of a large piece of wood;” while
                    another, belonging to Surinam, has an extremely disagreeable voice, and
                    unfortunately so much of it that, when a number of them combine, they at times
                    drown the orchestra of the Paramaribo theatre. No frog, so far as yet known,
                    possesses any poison organs. A species found in France <hi rend="italic"
                        >{l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">elo-</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">bates</hi><hi rend="italic">fuscus),</hi> when disturbed,
                    emits a strong odour, somewhat resembling garlic, and of sufficient pungency to
                    make the eyes water; another <hi rend="italic">{Hyla micans)</hi> exudes from
                    the surface of its body a slimy substance having luminous properties, which
                    probably acts as a defence by frightening its enemies. Many of the tree-frogs
                    are of a green colour, while others are brown, “and these,” says Mr Wallace <hi
                        rend="italic">{Tropical Nature,</hi> 1878), “usually feed at night, sitting
                    quietly during the day so as to be almost invisible, owing to their colour and
                    their moist shining skins so closely resembling vegetable substances.” The
                    majority of tree-frogs have their colour thus adapted to their surroundings, and
                    are thus enabled the more readily to elude their enemies; for, so far as yet
                    known, all the species protectively coloured are edible, forming the chief food
                    of many mammals, birds, and reptiles. A few, however, are brilliantly and
                    conspicuously coloured, as if courting observation; and such species, there is
                    reason to believe (the reader will find evidence of this in Belt’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Naturalist in Nicaragua),</hi> are rejected by frog-eating
                    animals on account of their nauseous secretions, or some other unknown property
                    which renders them unpalatable. The bright colours thus become directly useful
                    to the species by making them readily recognizable as uneatable.</p>
                <p>The Common Frog <hi rend="italic">{Rana</hi><hi rend="italic">temporaria)</hi> is
                    the most widely distributed species of the group, occurring throughout tho
                    temperate regions of both hemispheres, including North Africa, and Asia as far
                    east as Japan. It does not occur in Iceland. Both in England and in Scotland it
                    is abundant, nor is it uncommon in Ireland, although popularly supposed to be
                    absent from that island. It varies very considerably in colour, being either a
                    reddish, yellowish, or greenish-brown above, with irregular spots and fasciae,
                    and of a lighter colour beneath, but having almost invariably an oblong patch of
                    brown behind the eyes, by which it may be readily distinguished from other
                    European species. Although not an article of human food, the common frog in its
                    various stages of growth forms the staple diet of many other animals. The
                    tadpoles are eaten by newts and the smaller fishes, and frogs of all ages by
                    weasels, waterfowl, pike, and snakes. By those agencies their numbers, which
                    otherwise would be enormous, are greatly reduced. This species is said to take
                    five years in attaining its full growth, and to live for about fifteen years.
                    Like the toad it can be rendered tame and domesticated, having been known to
                    take up its abode in a moist corner of a kitchen, and to come forth regularly at
                    meal time to be fed. The Edible .Frog <hi rend="italic">{Rana</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">esculenta)</hi> is very widely distributed throughout the
                    temperate regions of the earth, but is not found in America, where, however, a
                    closely allied species occurs (fig. 2). It is found in England, where it was
                    first observed in a Cambri&lt;lgeshire fen is 1843, to which probably it had <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0832-0797"/> been introduced from the Continent. It has
                    since been introduced into various parts of the south of England, but apparently
                    without much success, the summer heat there being, it is said, insufficient to
                    enable the tadpole to attain its full development before the advent of autumnal
                    cold. It may be readily distinguished from the common species by the yellowish
                    mesial line which runs down the whole length of its back, by the absence of the
                    characteristic brown spot behind the eyes, and by the presence in the males of
                    “vocal sacs.” It is also more aquatic than the common frog, seldom leaving the
                    banks of its native pond or stream, into which it is always ready to dip on the
                    slightest appearance of danger. It is very abundant throughout central and
                    southern Europe, and forms, especially in France, a valued article of food, the
                    hind legs when cooked being regarded as a luxury. Regarding a dish of these, Mr
                    F. Buckland says, “Most excellent eating they were, tasting more like the
                    delicate flesh of the rabbit than any thing else I can think of.” The edible
                    frog has been lately introduced into Ireland. The Bull-frog <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Rana</hi><hi rend="italic">mugiens)</hi> is one of the largest species,
                    measuring sometimes 8 inches in length, exclusive of the hind legs, and having a
                    gape sufficiently wide to swallow ducklings whole. It inhabits North America,
                    where it is said to haunt the pools formed at the origin of springs, the waters
                    of which it was supposed to keep pure—a belief which long afforded it
                    considerable protection; lately, however, the Americans have taken to
                    frog-eating, and the bull-frog, in the absence of <hi rend="italic">R.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">esculenta,</hi> h is been selected among others for this
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>The Tree-frogs (fig. 3) are readily distinguished from all others by having the
                    ends of their toes dilated into knobs or discs, generally provided with a sticky
                    secretion, by means of which they can cling to the leaves and branches of trees.
                    They are small, elegant, and exceedingly active creatures, the males possessing
                    loud voices, of which they make copious use during the breeding season and on
                    the approach of rain. Frogs have from remote times been regarded as weather
                    prophets, and at the present day, in some parts of Germany, the European
                    Tree-frog <hi rend="italic">(Hyla arborea)</hi> is used as a barometer. A few of
                    them are placed in a tall bottle provided with miniature ladders, the steps of
                    which they ascend during fine weather, seeking the bottom again on the approach
                    of rain. AU frogs, whether arboreal or not, have their hind feet webbed, and in
                    at least one treefrog <hi rend="italic">(Rhacophorus)</hi> the webs on all the
                    feet are so largely developed as to render it probable that by their means the
                    frog is able to execute flying leaps. This “flying frog” was brought to Mr
                    Wallace, while travelling in Borneo, by a Chinaman, who assured him “that he had
                    seen it come down in a slanting direction as if it flew.” Its body was about 4
                    inches in length, and the expanded webs of each hind foot covered a space of 4
                    square inches, while its forelegs were bordered by a membrane—features highly
                    suggestive of aerial locomotion.</p>
                <p>Fossil remains of the frog do not occur in strata older than the Tertiary, being
                    found in greatest abundance in the Miocene deposits. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
