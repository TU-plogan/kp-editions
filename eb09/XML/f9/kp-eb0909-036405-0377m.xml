                    teachers, who readily appreciated these, were anxious to allure him into their
                    order, but his father had designed him for the bar, and an advocate accordingly
                    he became; but, having lost the first cause which was entrusted to him, he soon
                    abandoned law in disgust and gave himself wholly to literary pursuits. His
                    attention was first directed to poetical composition; and more than once he
                    competed for the poetry prizes of the French Academy, but never with success. He
                    had also the sorrow of witnessing, in 1680, the total failure of his tragedy <hi
                    rend="italic">Aspar,</hi> a failure which was all the more mortifying because,
                    for the purpose of annoying Racine, Thomas Corneille had previously sounded
                    forth in the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> the praises of his nephew as the
                    most gifted of all the younger dramatists. Fontenelle afterwards acknowledged
                    the justice of the public verdict by burning his unfortunate drama, of which
                    nothing but the name now survives. But for several years he persisted in the
                    belief that poetry was his true vocation, and continued to produce dramatic
                    compositions, the mediocrity of which, considering the author’s real talent, is
                    positively astonishing. His opera of <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Pêlée,</hi> though highly praised by
                    Voltaire, cannot be said to rise much above the others; and it is significant
                    that of all his dramatic works, not one has kept the stage. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Poésies</hi><hi rend="italic">Pastorales</hi> have no greater
                    claim to permanent repute, being characterized by stiffness and affectation; and
                    the utmost that can be said for his poetry in general is that it displays much
                    of the <hi rend="italic">limae labor,</hi> great purity of diction, and
                    occasional felicity of expression. It was by his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues des
                    Morts,</hi> published in 1683, that Fontenelle first established a genuine claim
                    to high literary rank; and that claim was very much enhanced three years later
                    by the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Entretiens sur la Pluralité des
                    Mondes,</hi> a work which was among the very first to illustrate the possibility
                    of being scientific without being either uninteresting or unintelligible to the
                    ordinary reader. It was precisely the kind of work which Fontenelle was capable
                    of executing well, both from the natural bent of his intellect and from the
                    course of his previous studies. His object was to popularize among his
                    countrymen the astronomical theories of Descartes; and it may well be doubted if
                    that philosopher ever ranked a more ingenious or successful expounder among the
                    number of his disciples. Hitherto Fontenelle had continued to reside in Rouen,
                    but in 1687 he removed to Paris for permanent residence there; and in the same
                    year he published his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Oracles,</hi> a book which made a considerable noise in the theological as well
                    as in the philosophical world. It was not so much an original work as a
                    reduction from the Latin of Van Dale, and consisted of two essays, the first of
                    which was designed to prove that oracles were not given by the supernatural
                    agency of demons, and the second, that they did not cease with the birth of
                    Christ. The clearness and precision of the style, and the smooth flow of the
                    reasoning in this treatise, have been always much admired. It excited the
                    suspicion of the church, however, and a Jesuit, by name Bιltus, published a
                    ponderous refutation of it; but the peace-loving disposition of its author
                    impelled him to leave his opponent unanswered. He was too busy, he wrote to
                    Leclerc, and added, “Enfin, je n’ai point du tout l’humeur polémique, et toutes
                    les querelles me déplaisent. J’aime mieux que le diable ait été prophète,
                    puisque le père jésuite le veut, et qu’il croit cela plus orthodoxe.” To the
                    following year (1688) belongs his <hi rend="italic">Digression</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les</hi><hi rend="italic">Anciens
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">les</hi><hi rend="italic">Modernes,</hi> in which he
                    took the modem side in a somewhat unnecessary controversy then raging; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Doutes sur le Système Physique des Causes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Occasionelles</hi> (against Malebranche) appeared shortly afterwards. In 1691
                    he was received into the French Academy in spite of the determined efforts of
                    Racine and Boileau, who on four previous occasions had secured his rejection. He
                    subsequently was admitted a member both of the Academy of Inscriptions and of
                    the Academy of Sciences; and in 1699 he became perpetual secretary to the latter
                    body. This office he actually held for the long period of forty-two years; and
                    it was in this official capacity that he wrote the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Académie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> containing extracts and
                    analyses of the proceedings, and also the <hi rend="italic">Eloges</hi> of the
                    members. These last are written with great simplicity and delicacy; while of the
                    prefaces to the <hi rend="italic">Histoire,</hi> Sainte-Beuve declares that in
                    them “il à atteint à une véritable perfection, encore agréable et presque
                    sévère.” The only other works of Fontenelle that require to be mentioned are his
                    <hi rend="italic">Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Infini</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Apologie des
                    Tourbillons.</hi> Of the former, his Academy composition, he himself is reported
                    to have said (so far, justly)—“There, now, is a book which only eight men in
                    Europe can understand, and the author is not one of the eight.” Fontenelle forms
                    a link of connexion between two very widely different periods of French
                    literature, that of Corneille, Racine, and Boileau on the one hand, and that of
                    Voltaire, D’Alembert, and Diderot on the other. It is not in virtue of his great
                    age alone that this can be said of him; he actually had much in common with the
                    <hi rend="italic">beaux</hi><hi rend="italic">esprits</hi> of the 17th century,
                    as well as with the <hi rend="italic">philosophes</hi> of the 18th. But it is to
                    the latter rather than to the former period that he properly belongs; and it is
                    not a little significant that while as a poet and man of fashion he was “the
                    butt of all the clever men in Paris” during the first fifty years of his life,
                    he latterly came to be “a force and an authority in the intellectual life” of
                    the period. He has no claim to be regarded as a genius; but, as Sainte-Beuve has
                    said, he well deserves a place “dans la classe des esprits infiniments
                    distingués ”— distinguished, however, it ought to be added by intelligence
                    rather than by intellect, and less by the power of saying much than by the power
                    of saying a little well. In personal character he has sometimes been described
                    as having been revoltingly heartless; and it is abundantly plain that he was
                    singularly incapable of feeling strongly the more generous emotions—a
                    misfortune, or a fault, which revealed itself in many ways. “Il faut avoir de
                    l’âme pour avoir du goût” But the cynical expressions of such a man are not to
                    be taken too literally; and the mere fact that he lived and died in the esteem
                    of many friends suffices to show that the theoretical selfishness which he
                    sometimes professed cannot have been consistently and at all times carried into
                    practice.</p>
                <p>There have been several collective editions of Fontenelle’s works. The best are
                    those of Paris, in 8 vols. 8vo, 1790, and 5 vols. 8vo, 1825. Some of his
                    separate works have been very frequently reprinted and also translated. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Pluralité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Mondes</hi> was translated
                    into modem Greek in 1794. Sainte-Beuve has an interesting essay on Fontenelle,
                    with several useful references, in the <hi rend="italic">Causeries</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic">Lzιndi,</hi> vol. iii.</p>
