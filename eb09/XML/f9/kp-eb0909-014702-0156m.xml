                    (1790-1836), assassin, the chief conspirator in the attempt on the life of Louis
                    Philippe in July 1835, was a native of Murato in Corsica, and was baptized
                    there. December 3, 1790. After following his father’s occupation, that of a
                    shepherd, he enlisted at the age of eighteen in the Corsican Legion at Naples,
                    and passed with it into the service of Murat, king of Naples. In 1814 he
                    returned to Corsica, and in the following year took part in the fatal expedition
                    of Murat for the recovery of his crown. Sentence of death was passed on him and
                    his companions, but it was not executed; and Fieschi once more returned to his
                    native land. In 1816 he was convicted of theft and forgery, and was condemned to
                    imprisonment for ten years. After his release he led for several years a
                    restless miserable life, working only by fits, and eking out his resources by
                    fraud and swindling. He went to Paris after the Revolution of July (1830), and
                    by means of forged papers passed himself off as a victim of the Restoration, and
                    obtained a pension and official employment. He affected a zealous devotion to
                    the Government, entered the police, and displayed much energy in the suppression
                    of disturbances. But meanwhile bis house was the scene of violent proceedings,
                    and the neighbourhood was kept in alarm by frequent noises, cries, and
                    pistol-shots in and around it. Facts were brought to light which cost him his
                    friends and his employments. Exasperated by dismissal and the “ingratitude of
                    the Government,” he vowed a terrible vengeance. He took lodgings on the
                    Boulevard du Temple, and there, with several infamous confederates, contrived
                    his “infernal machine,” constructed with twenty gun barrels, to be fired
                    simultaneously. In July 1835 the fifth anniversary of the Revolution was to be
                    celebrated. Vague rumours getting afloat of some impending catastrophe, of some
                    horrible attempt on the life of the king, prudential measures were taken. On the
                    28th, as Louis Philippe was holding a grand review, and was passing along the
                    boulevard accompanied by his three sons and a numerous staff, a sudden explosion
                    was heard, followed by others, and the pavement was strewed with dead and
                    wounded men. A ball grazed the king’s forehead, and his horse, with those of the
                    duke of Nemours and the prince de Joinville, was shot; but the king and the
                    princes escaped as if by miracle. Fieschi himself was severely wounded by the
                    discharge of his machine, and vainly attempted to escape. The attentions of the
                    most skilful physicians were lavished upon him, and his life was saved for the
                    stroke of justice. On his trial he named his accomplices, displayed much
                    bravado, and expected or pretended to expect ultimate pardon. He was condemned
                    to death, and was guillotined, February 19, 1836, making on the scaffold a
                    premeditated theatrical display at the feet of his confessor. Of his accomplices
                    two were executed, one was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment, and one was
                    acquitted. A full account of the trial, <hi rend="italic">Procès</hi><hi
