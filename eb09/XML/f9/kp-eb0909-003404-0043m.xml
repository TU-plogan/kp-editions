                    acquired a considerable reputation, but in 1843 his political opinions brought
                    him under the suspicion of the police, and caused his expulsion from the Papal
                    States. He then resided successively at Marseilles, Paris, Florence, and Turin,
                    taking advantage of the facilities afforded him in each place to perfect his
                    medical skill; but by the amnesty granted by Pius IX. on the 16th July 1846 he
                    was permitted to return to the States, and he received soon afterwards the
                    professorship of clinical surgery at Osimo. In 1845 he published a pamphlet on
                    the cultivation of rice in Italy. In 1847 he was induced to take advantage of an
                    opportunity which then presented itself of entering political life, and became
                    under secretary of state, holding office, however, for little more than a month,
                    since, along with his colleagues, he disapproved of the policy of the pope in
                    siding with Austria against the Italian states. Elected in 1848 member of the
                    reformed parliament for Faenza, he was named director general of health and
                    prisons, but refusing to adhere to the proclamation of a republic, he resigned
                    the office in February 1849, and passed into Tuscany. When the French army
                    entered Rome in the following July he resumed his office, but the triumvirate of

                    into exile, he took up his residence at Turin, where he published a satirical

                    1850. In the same year ho was named by the Sardinian Government member of the
                    upper council of health; and in 1851 he was appointed minister of public
                    instruction, an office which he held till May 1852. As a member of the Sardinian
                    parliament, and as proprietor and editor of a political journal, <hi
                    rend="italic">Il Piemonte,</hi> Farini was one of the most influential
                    supporters of the policy of Cavour, and in 1859 he was sent by the latter on a
                    political mission to Parma and Modena. On the flight of the duke of Modena in
                    June 1859, Farini was entrusted with the provisional government of the town, in
                    which capacity he negotiated the annexation of the duchy to Piedmont. The same
                    year saw the publication of the second volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Storia.</hi> In June 1860 he was named by Cavour minister of the interior, but
                    resigned the office on the death of Cavour in June of the following year. On the
                    8th December 1862 he succeeded Rattazzi as president of the cabinet, in which
                    office he endeavoured to carry out the policy inaugurated by Cavour.
                    Over-exertion, however, brought on softening of the brain, which compelled him
                    to resign his office 24th March 1863, and ultimately resulted in his death at
                    Quarto, near Genoa, 1st August 1866. His remains, originally buried at Turin,
                    were in 1878 removed to his native town of Russi, and monuments to his memory
                    have been erected both there and at Ravenna.</p>
                <p>Several letters addressed by Farini to Mr Gladstone and Lord John Russell, on the

                    historical work was translated into English, the first part by Mr Gladstone, and
                    the second by a lady under his superintendence. A French translation of the work
                    appeared in 1862. See Ettori Parri, <hi rend="italic">Luigi Carlo Farini:
