                    William Rufus, was a Norman of low birth, who came to England in the train of
                    William the Conqueror in 1066. He took holy orders, obtained several church
                    preferments, and was appointed chaplain to the bishop of London, and made
                    prebendary of St Paul’s. He demanded the deanery also, and this being refused
                    him, he left the bishop’s service. He afterwards passed into the service of the
                    king, William II., who made him his chaplain. Ambitious, greedy, and
                    unscrupulous, ho flattered and ministered to the vices of his master, and
                    thereby raised himself to the highest places in church and state. To fill the
                    royal coffers he suggested various arbitrary and oppressive measures, by which
                    he earned the hatred of the people, and at the same time the eulogy of the king,
                    that he was the only man who, to please a master, dared to brave the vengeance
                    of mankind. Flambard appears to have been the first to apply the feudal theory
                    to the estates of the church. He suggested that they should be considered as
                    fiefs or benefices held of the king, and that as such at every vacancy they
                    devolved to the crown till the vacancy was supplied. The lesson was quickly
                    learnt, and the immediate consequence was that benefices were kept vacant during
                    the king’s pleasure, and refilled only on payment of a large sum of money. It
                    was not till after the death of Lanfranc that the king gave himself up
                    unreservedly to the influence of Flambard. The justiciar obtained for himself
                    the custody of the vacant abbeys of Winchester and Chertsey, the bishopric of
                    Lincoln, and the archbishopric of Canterbury. His extortion and oppressions drew
                    upon him the curses of the clergy as well as of the people, and in 1099 an
                    attempt was made to murder him at sea. But a storm arose and his murderers
                    quarrelled, and Flambard was allowed to land again. Ho then reappeared at court
                    and was rewarded with the see of Durham, But he was at last “hoist with his own
                    petard”; forat his consecration he had to make the king a present of £1000. On
                    the death of William IL, in the following year, the bishop, to satisfy the
                    outcries of the people, was sent to the Tower, “the first man,” says Mr Freeman,
                    “recorded to have dwelled as a prisoner in the Conqueror’s fortress.” He fared
                    sumptuously in his confinement, treated his keepers, and at length, in February
                    1101, managed to escape from the Tower, and fled to Normandy. There he joined
                    Duke Robert, instigated him to the invasion &lt; f England, and returned to
                    England with him. He was ultimately restored to his see, and appears to have
                    occupied himself thenceforward with its duties, and in various architectural
                    works—the completion of his cathedral, the building of Norham Castle, and the
                    fortification of Durham. He endowed the college of Christchurch and founded the
                    priory of Mottisford. Flambard died September 5, 1128.</p>
