                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0172-0163"/> his childhood, his parents must have been in easy
                    circumstances, and the supposition is confirmed by the fact that he enjoyed all
                    the advantages of a liberal education, first under the Jesuits of Florence, and
                    then in the university of Pisa. At Pisa his mind became stored, not only with
                    the results of patient study in various branches of letters, but with the great
                    historical associations linked with the former glory of the Pisan republic, and
                    with one remarkable institution of which Pisa was the seat. To the tourist who
                    now visits Pisa the banners and emblems of the order of St Stephen are mere
                    matter of curiosity, but they had a serious significance two hundred years ago
                    to the young Tuscan, who knew that these naval crusaders formed the main defence
                    of his country and commerce against the Turkish, Algerine, and Tunisian
                    corsairs. After a five years’ residence in Pisa he returned to Florence, where
                    he married Anna, daughter of the senator and marquis Scipione Capponi, and
                    withdrew to a small villa at Figline, not far from the city. Abjuring the
                    thought of writing amatory poetry in consequence of the premature death of a
                    young lady to whom he had been attached, he occupied himself chiefly with
                    literary pursuits, above all the composition of Italian and Latin poetry. His
                    own literary eminence, the opportunities enjoyed by him as a member of the
                    celebrated Academy Della Crusca for making known his critical taste and
                    classical knowledge, and the social relations within the reach of a noble
                    Florentine so closely allied with the great house of Capponi, sufficiently
                    explain the intimate terms on which he stood with such eminent men of letters as
                    Magalotti, Menzini, Gori, and Redi. The last-named, the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacchus in Tuscany,</hi> was not only one of the most brilliant
                    poets of his time, and a safe literary adviser; he was the court physician, and
                    his court influence was employed with zeal and effect in his friend’s favour.
                    Filicaia’s rural seclusion was owing even more to his straitened means than to
                    his rural tastes. If he ceased at length to pine in obscurity, the change was
                    owing not merely to the fact that his poetical genius, fired by the deliverance
                    of Vienna from the Turks in 1683, poured forth the right strains at the right
                    time, but also to the influence of Redi, who hot only laid Filicaia’s verses
                    before his own sovereign, but had them transmitted with the least possible delay
                    to the foreign princes whose noble deeds they sung. The first recompense came,
                    however, not from those princes, but from Christina, the ex-queen of Sweden,
                    who, from her circle of savans and courtiers at Rome, spontaneously and
                    generously announced to Filicaia her wish to bear the expense of educating his
                    two sons, enhancing her kindness by the delicate request that it should remain a
                    secret. And now the tide of Filicaia’s fortunes turned. The grand-duke of
                    Tuscany, Cosmo III., conferred on him an important office, the commissionership
                    of official balloting. He was named governor of Volterra in 1696, where he
                    strenuously exerted himself to raise the tone of public morality. Both there and
                    at Pisa, where he was subsequently governor in 1700, his popularity was so great
                    that on his removal the inhabitants of both cities petitioned for his recall. He
                    passed the close of his life at Florence; the grand duke raised him to the rank
                    of senator, and he died in that city on the 24th of September 1707. He was
                    buried in the family vault in the church of St Peter, and a monument was erected
                    to his memory by his sole surviving son Scipione Filicaia. In the six celebrated
                    odes inspired by the great victory of Sobieski, Filicaia took a lyrical flight
                    which has placed him at moments on a level with the greatest Italian poets. They
                    are, however, unequal, like all his poetry, reflecting in some passages the
                    native vigour of his genius and purest inspirations of his tastes, whilst in
                    others they are deformed by the affectations of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seiceηtisti.</hi> When thoroughly natural and spontaneous,—as in the two
                    sonnets “Italia, Italia, o tu cui feo la sorte” and “Dov’ è, Italia, il tuo
                    braccio? ø a ehe ti serve;” in the verses “Alla beata Vergine,” “Al divino
                    amore;” in the sonnet “Sulla fede nelle disgrazie ”— the truth and beauty of
                    thought and language recall the verse of Petrarch. Besides the poems published
                    in the complete Venice edition of 1762, several other pieces appeared for the
                    first time in the small Florence edition brought out by Barbera in 1864.</p>
