                    considerable number of towns succeeded, in the midst of the dynastic confusion
                    of the Middle Ages, in maintaining or acquiring more or less complete
                    independence of the state or sovereign within whose territory they were
                    situated. This they effected partly by forming defensive leagues with each
                    other, and partly by procuring, in return for service or money, privileges and
                    protection from the successive occupants of the imperial throne. Of these free
                    towns a certain proportion rose by commerce and industry to a position of great
                    influence, and ultimately took rank along with kingdoms and principalities as
                    integral members of the body politic of the empire. They first appear distinctly
                    in this character in the reign of Henry VII. (1308- 1313). Their number was
                    continually fluctuating, for their liberties were almost as easily lost as they
                    were with difficulty acquired. Most of them had to maintain a continual conflict
                    by war or diplomacy with the ecclesiastical or secular potentates of their
                    district, and not unfrequently their interests were betrayed by the emperors
                    themselves. Mainz, which in the 13th century was at the head of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rheinisches Städtebund,</hi> or confederation of the cities of the
                    Rhine, was conquered in 1462, and subjected to the bishop’s see; Zwickau,
                    Altenburg, and Chemnitz, put in pawn first by Frederick II. and afterwards by
                    several of the later emperors, thus fell into the hands of the dukes of Saxony;
                    other free cities placed themselves of their own accord under the control of
                    prince or bishop; some, as Donauworth, were deprived of their privileges by the
                    emperors on account of real or alleged offences; others again were separated
                    from the empire by foreign conquest, as Hainault or Hagenau, Colmar,
                    Schlett-stedt, Weissenburg, Landau, and Besançon by Louis XIV.; and Basel
                    notably preferred to cast in its lot with the rising confederation of
                    Switzerland. At the diet of Augsburg in 1474 the free imperial cities divided
                    themselves for the first time into two benches, the Rhenish and the Swabian, the
                    former also including those of Alsace, Wetterau, Thuringia, and Saxony, and the
                    latter those of Franconia. They were formally constituted the third collegium of
                    the diet by the peace of Westphalia in 1648. At the time of the French
                    Revolution they still numbered 51,—the Rhenish bench comprising Cologne,
                    Aix-la-Chapelle or Aachen, Lübeck, Worms, Spires, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Goslar,
                    Bremen, Hamburg, Mühlhausen, Nordhausen, Dortmund, Friedberg, and Wetzlar; and
                    the Swabian bench, Ratisbon or Regensburg, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Esslingen,
                    Reutlingen, Nördlingen, Rothenburg on the Tauber, Schwäbisch-Hall, Roth weil,
                    Ueberlingen, Heilbronn, Gmünd, Memmingen, Lindau, Dinkelsbühl, Biberach,
                    Ravensburg, Schweinfurt, Kempten, Windsheim, Kaufbeuem, Weil, Wangen, Isny,
                    Pfullendorf, Offenburg, Leutkirchen, Wimpfen, Weissenburg in the Nordgau,
                    Giengen, Gengenbach, Zeíl on the Hammerbach, Buchhorn, Ahlen, Buchau, Bopfingen.
                    A large proportion of these towns had then at least as little claim to their
                    exceptional position as the pocket-burghs of England before the passing of the
                    Reform Act. By the decision of the imperial deputation of 1803 <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Reichsdeputationshauptschluss)</hi> Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Worms, and
                    Spires were assigned to France; only six, Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen, Augsburg,
                    Frankfort-on-the-</p>
                <p>Main, and Nuremberg were allowed to retain their <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reichsfreiheit,</hi> or, in other words, to hold directly of the empire. On the
                    dissolution of the empire in 1806, Augsburg and Nuremberg were given to Bavaria,
                    and Frankfort was made the seat of Count Dahlberg, the archbishop and electoral
                    prince of Mainz, who was appointed primate of the confederation of the Rhine. On
                    the establishment of the German confederation in 1815, Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen,
                    and Frankfort were recognized as free cities, and the first three still hold
                    that position in the new German empire; but Frankfort, in consequence of the
                    part it took in the war of 1866, has been degraded to the rank of an ordinary
                    Prussian town.</p>
                <p>In the earlier centuries of their existence the free cities of the empire were
                    under the jurisdiction of two imperial officers, one of whom, the imperial
                    advocate or <hi rend="italic">Reichsvogt,</hi> took charge of criminal cases,
                    and the other, the imperial procurator or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reichs-Schultheiss</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Schuldheiss,</hi> dealt with the
                    civil cases. As time went on many of the cities purchased the right of filling
                    these offices with members of the principality; and in several instances the
                    imperial authority fell practically into desuetude except when it was roused
                    into action by peculiar circumstances, such as a dispute between the citizens
                    and their magistrates. The internal constitution of the cities was organized
                    after no common type; but there w ere several of them whose privileges were
                    drawn up in imitation of those of Cologne, which had been one of the very first
                    to assert its independence.</p>
