                    (1750-1774), one of the minor poets of Scotland, owes his chief fame to the fact
                    that he was, in a very special sense, the precursor of Burns. He was the
                    youngest of three sons of William Fergusson, a man of superior intelligence, who
                    removed from Aberdeen to Edinburgh in 1746, and there ultimately found
                    employment with the British Linen Company as accountant Robert was born 17th
                    October 1750, and grew up a delicate youth, with a nervous susceptibility which
                    increased with years, and unfitted him for the prosaic duties of daily life. His
                    health did not admit of his being sent to. school till his sixth year; but both
                    there and at the university of St Andrews he manifested great quickness, though
                    accompanied by an impulsive fickleness not uufrequently characteristic of the
                    poetical temperament. Among his fellow students he was distinguished for his
                    vivacity and humour. His conversation was singularly fascinating, his powers of
                    mimicry were great, and he sang Scottish songs with fine effect. In one of his
                    frolics he undertook <pb break="no"

                    singer; and, in suitable disguise, furnished with a large bundle of ballads, he
                    disposed of the whole, while he attracted the crowd by his spirited rendering of
                    popular songs. Hence, both at college and in subsequent years, his company was
                    sought after; and in an age when the convivial habits of society were under
                    little restraint, he was exposed to temptations in all respects prejudicial to
                    him. His father died while he was still at college; but a bursary which he held
                    enabled him to complete his four years of study. The loss of his father was
                    nevertheless an irreparable one at the most critical stage of life. His studies
                    appear to have been subsequently pursued in a desultory fashion. He abandoned
                    all thought of the clerical profession, for which he had been preparing, and
                    returned to his widowed mother without any definite plan or prospect for life.
                    While still at college he had made more than one attempt at dramatic
                    composition, and wrote two acts of a tragedy, of which the hero of Scottish
                    romance, Sir William Wallace, was the central figure. But in the desultory
                    efforts of his erratic muse there is no indication of dramatic power. The
                    sprightly gaiety which made him so covetable a companion inspired his best
                    poems, which are more noticeable for their graphic humour than for tenderness or
                    depth of feeling.</p>
                <p>After a brief sojourn with a maternal uncle at Aberdeen, Fergusson returned to
                    Edinburgh, and ere long obtained employment as copying clerk in a lawyer’s
                    office. In this humble occupation he passed the remainder of his brief life,
                    relieving the .irksome drudgery by poetical composition, and by evenings passed
                    in the convivial gatherings which then formed a peculiar feature of the social
                    life of Edinburgh. He was a member of one of its most noted clubs, celebrated by
                    him in his poem of <hi rend="italic">Auld Peekie.</hi> “The Knights of the
                    Cape,” as they dubbed themselves, were wont to assemble at a tavern in Craig’s
                    Close, in the vicinity of the Cross; each member had a name and character
                    assigned to him, which he was required to maintain at all gatherings of the
                    order. Dâvid Herd, the editor of what Scott styled the first classic edition of
                    Scottish song, was sovereign of the Cape when Fergusson was dubbed a knight of
                    the order, with the title of <hi rend="italic">Sir Precentor</hi> in allusion to
                    his fine voice. Alexander Run ciman, the historical painter, his pupil Jacob
                    More, and Sir Henry Raeburn were all members. The old minute books of the club
                    abound with pencilled sketches by them, one of the most interesting of which,
                    ascribed to Runciman’s pencil, is a sketch of Fergusson in his character of <hi
                        rend="italic">Sir Precentor.</hi></p>
                <p>In the case of Fergusson, as in that of Burns, critical censors have been too apt
                    to ascribe to them excesses of a wholly exceptional nature; whereas they (Λιly
                    conformed to the habits of society at a time when clergymen, judges, and men of
                    all ranks habitually frequented the tavern, and sought intellectual as well as
                    social pleasures in convivial clubs. In such assemblies Fergusson appears to
                    have been the life of the company. In a letter addressed to Burns, Mr Peter
                    Stuart, then editor of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post,</hi> refers to
                    Fergusson as his “inestimable friend,” and bears testimony to the fascinating
                    social attractions of his society. “There was,” he says, “such a richness of
                    conversation, such a plenitude of fancy. . . . His manner was so felicitous,
                    that he enraptured every person around him, and infused into the hearts of the
                    young and old the spirit and animation which operated on his own mind.” In
                    person he is described as of a slender, handsome figure, his forehead high, his
                    countenance open and pleasing, though somewhat effeminate, and characterized by
                    extreme pallor, but kindled into life by the animation of his large black eyes,
                    whenever he became interested in the conversation. His light brown hair was worn
                    unpowdered, with long waving curls on each side of the head, and tied into a
                    queue behind with a black silk riband.</p>
                <p>From time to time Fergusson contributed to Ruddiman’s <hi rend="italic">Weekly
                        Magazine</hi> grave and humorous pieces, both in English and in the Scottish
                    dialect; but in 1773, when he was in his twenty-fourth year, his poems were
                    collected and published in a volume. The event is not without its significance
                    in English literature. Robert Burns was then in his fifteenth year. The volume
                    ere long came under his notice, and the generous poet made no stinted
                    acknowledgment of all that he owed to his predecessor. But ere such appreciative
                    recognition could be rendered, its unhappy author had died in a maniac’s cell. A
                    fall, by which his head was severely injured, greatly aggravated symptoms of
                    mental aberration, from which he had seemed to be recovering; and after about
                    two months’ confinement in the old Darien House,—then the only public asylum in
                    Edinburgh,—the poet died on the 16th October 1774, within one day of completing
                    his twenty-fourth year.</p>
                <p>The influence of Fergusson’s writings on the Ayrshire poet is undoubted. He is
                    thus apostrophized by Burns :— “Oh, thou my elder brother in misfortune,</p>
                <p>By far my elder brother in the muses, With tears I pity thy unhappy fate !”</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Leith Paces</hi> unquestionably supplied the model for the
                        <hi rend="italic">Holy Fair.</hi> Not only is the stanza the same, but the
                    Mirth who plays the part of conductor to Fergusson, and the Fun who renders a
                    like service to Burns, are manifestly conceived on the same model, and even in
                    part in the same terms. <hi rend="italic">The mutual complaint of Plaiηstanes
                        and Causey</hi> probably suggested <hi rend="italic">The Brigs of Ayr; On
                        seeing a Butterfly in the Street</hi> has reflections in it which strikingly
                    correspond with <hi rend="italic">To a Mouse,</hi> one of the most exquisite of
                    all Burns’s minor poems; nor will a comparison of <hi rend="italic">The Farmer's
                        Ingle</hi> of the elder poet with <hi rend="italic">The Cottar's Saturday
                        Night</hi> admit of doubt as to the influence of the city-bred poet’s muse
                    on that exquisite picturing of homely peasant life. But the Ayrshire poet was
                    himself the first to render a generous tribute to the merits of Fergusson. On
                    his visit to Edinburgh in 1787 he sought out, not without difficulty, the
                    nameless grave mound of the poet, and forthwith petitioned the authorities of
                    the Canongate burying ground for permission to erect the memorial stone which
                    still enables the visitor to identify the poet’s grave. The inscription on the
                    stone is as follows :—</p>
                <p>“Here lies Robert Fergusson, Poet.</p>
                <p>Born September 5th 1751—Died 16th October 1774.</p>
                <p>No sculptured marble here, nor pompous lay,</p>
                <p>* No storied urn, nor animated bust; ’ This simple stone directs pale Scotia’s
                    way To pour her sorrows o’er her poet’s dust."</p>
                <p>On the reverse of the stone is this record of its origin :— “By special grant of
                    the managers to Robert Burns, who erected this stone, this burial-place is to
                    remain for ever sacred to the memory of Robert Fergusson.” The simple stone has
                    since been rescued from decay, and inserted in a monumental structure of a more
                    ornate character. The date assigned as that of his birth differs, as will be
                    seen, from the one given above, which rests on the authority of his younger
                    sister, Margaret, the wife of Mr Alexander Duval, purser in the royal navy.
                    According to her statement, the birthday of the poet’s elder sister Barbara had
                    been assigned by mistake to him.</p>
                <p>The first edition of Fergusson’s poems was published by Ruddiman, at Edinburgh,
                    in 1773, and a supplement, containing additional poems, in 1779. A second
                    edition appeared in 1785, and another in 1807, with a biographical sketch by
                    Alexander Peterkin. A life of Fergusson is included in Dr David Irving’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Lives of the Scottish Poets;</hi> and the chief points in
                    various biographical sketches are embodied in Dr Robert Chambers’s article in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Lives of Illustrious and Distinguished Scotsmen.</hi> (D.
