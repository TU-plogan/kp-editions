                    twenty Johannes Fyt entered the guild of St Luke as a master, and from that time
                    till his death in 1661, he produced a vast number of pictures in which the bold
                    facility of Snyders is united to the powerful effects of Rembrandt, and
                    harmonies of gorgeous tone are not less conspicuous than freedom of touch and a
                    true semblance of nature. There never was such a master of technical processes
                    as Fyt in the rendering of animal life in its most varied forms. He may have
                    been less correct in outline, less bold in action than Snyders, but he was much
                    more skilful and more true in the reproduction of the coat of deer, dogs,
                    greyhounds, hares, and monkeys, whilst in realizing the plumage of peacocks,
                    woodcocks, ducks, hawks, and cocks and hens, he had not his equal, nor was any
                    artist even of the Dutch school more effective in relieving his compositions
                    with accessories of tinted cloth, porcelain ware, vases, and fruit. He was not
                    clever at figures, and he sometimes trusted for these to the co-operation of
                    Cornelius Schut or Willeborts, whilst his architectural backgrounds were
                    sometimes executed by Quellyn. Silenus amongst Fruit and Flowers, in the Harrach
                    collection at Vienna, Diana and her Nymphs with the Produce of the Chase, in the
                    Belvedere at Vienna, and Dead Game and Fruit in front of a Triumphal Arch,
                    belonging to Baron Anselm von Rothschild at Vienna, are specimens of the
                    co-operation respectively of Schut, Willeborts, and Quellyn. They are also Fyt’s
                    masterpieces. The earliest dated work of the master is a cat grabbing at a piece
                    of dead poultry near a hare and birds, belonging to Baron Cetto at Munich, and
                    executed in 1644. The latest is a Dead Snipe with Ducks, of 1660, sold with the
                    Jäger collection at Cologne in 1871. Great power is shown in the bear and boar
                    hunts at Munich and Ravensworth castle. A Hunted Roedeer with Dogs in the Water,
                    in the Berlin Museum, has some of the life and more of the roughness of Snyders,
                    but lacks variety of tint and finish. A splendid specimen is the Page and Parrot
                    near a table covered with game, guarded by a dog staring at a monkey, in the
                    collection of Sir Richard Wallace. It is curious that Antwerp should possess
                    only two examples of Fyt. The Madrid Museum contains 11, the Lichtenstein
                    Gallery at Vienna 8, the Berlin, Vienna, and Dresden Museums 5 each, the Louvre
                    3, and the London National Gallery 1. With the needle and the brush Fyt was
                    equally clever. He etched 16 plates, and those representing dogs are of their
                    kind unique. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j. a. c.)</hi></p>
