                <p><label type="entry">FLINT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Timothy</hi></label> (1780-1840),
                    an American clergyman and writer, was born in Reading, Massachusetts, July 11,
                    1780. He graduated at Harvard College in the close of 1800. Settled as a
                    Congregational minister in Lunenburg, Massachusetts, he pursued scientific
                    studies with interest; and his labours in his laboratory seemed so strange to
                    the people of that retired region, that some persons supposed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0339-0328"/> and asserted that lie was engaged in
                    counterfeiting. This led to disagreeable complications, which resulted in his
                    leaving his parish and becoming a missionary in the valley of the Mississippi.
                    There could have been no discipline better adapted to correct his natural
                    sensitiveness than his work at the West in those days, where he came into
                    contact with many rough people and peculiar social habits. His observations on
                    the manners and character of the settlers of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys
                    were recorded in a very picturesque work called <hi rend="italic">Recollections
                    of Ten Years passed in the Valley of the Mississippi,</hi> Boston, 1826. This
                    book passed to a second edition, and excited so much interest as to be
                    translated into French as well as reprinted in England. Indeed, it was the first
                    account of the Western States of America which brought to light the real life
                    and character of the people. Flint had acquired this knowledge of the young
                    communities of the West, not only by his journeys among them as an itinerant
                    preacher, but also by having been for a short period teacher and farmer on the
                    banks of the Mississippi and Red Rivers. The success which this work met with,
                    together with the failing health of the writer, led him to relinquish his more
                    active labours for literary pursuits. His subsequent publications were as
                    follows :— <hi rend="italic">Francis Berrian, or the Mexican Patriot,</hi>
                    1826,—a novel, the scene of which is laid in Mexico at the period of the
                    revolution in which Iturbide was overthrown; <hi rend="italic">A Condensed
                    Geography and History of the Western States in the Mississippi Valley,</hi> 2
                    vols. 8vo. Cincin., 1828; <hi rend="italic">Arthur Clenning,</hi> a novel, 1828;
                    <hi rend="italic">George Mason, the Young Backwoodsman,</hi> a novel; <hi
                    rend="italic">Indian Wars in the</hi><hi rend="italic">JYest,</hi> 1833; <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoir of Daniel Boone,</hi> 1834. In addition to these works,
                    Flint published several translations from the French, and essays in the London
                    <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Western Review,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">New York Knickerbocker,</hi> of which last two magazines
                    he was at different times editor. His style was vivid, plain, and forcible, and
                    his matter interesting; the spirit of his writings was always humane and genial;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> in a notice of his first book,
                    says: “These pages reflect a sincere, humane, and liberal character, a warm and
                    gentle heart, and hardly even a prejudice which is not amiable.” He was very
                    industrious, and had acquired such a power of abstraction that he prosecuted the
                    labour of translating the <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi> in a
                    room where other persons were engaged in work or conversation, being so absorbed
                    in his work as to lose all consciousness of where he was or who was present. He
                    died in Salem, August 16, 1840. His works on the Western States are still among
                    the best we have on the subject.</p>
