                    intimate adhesion of fibrous materials among themselves, and is not, like
                    ordinary cloth, produced by any spinning and weaving processes. All ordinary
                    textile fibres possess sufficient adhesive tendency to enable them to be handled
                    for spinning; but it is only in certain animal fibres that the peculiarity is so
                    marked as to fit them for felting. The property results chiefly from the
                    serrated or jagged structure of wool and hair, and efficient felting is also
                    promoted by the crimped or wavy form which some fibres naturally assume. These
                    properties are best developed in the short “carding” wool of such sheep as the
                    merino and Saxony breeds, long “combing” wools possessing them in a less degree.
                    Unwashed wool, being coated with the natural grease, does not felt. The hair of
                    other animals, as of the rabbit, hare, coypu, vicugna, musquash, and ox, is
                    employed for making felt of various kinds and for different purposes. Felt has
                    been made and used from the most remote antiquity, and indeed, considering the
                    simplicity of the material and the readiness with which wool felts, it is quite
                    probable that it was known before woven fabrics. From time immemorial it has
                    been employed for clothing and tent covers by the tribes of Central Asia, and to
                    the present day it remains in extensive use among the Circassian, Armenian, and
                    Tartar tribes. It is mentioned by Xenophon and Pliny, and Marco Polo describes
                    its manufacture and applications in Central Asia. Felting results from combined
                    pressure and moisture, and is favoured by heat. Ordinary broad-cloth and all
                    “fulled” woollen textures are partly felted, the fulling process having for its
                    object a partial felting of the previously woven material; and the shrinking of
                    woollen garments after washing, with which all are familiar, results from a
                    felting by which the fibres draw closer together, the cloth gaining in thickness
                    and solidity what it loses in superficial extent. The applications of felt are
                    numerous, a certain range of qualities being used for clothing, domestic, and
                    upholstery purposes, while other and generally rougher felts are employed for
                    mechanical appliances. The manufacture of felt hats constitutes its most
                    extensive application, for which see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hat.</hi>
                    Its manufacture in the form of carpets, drugget, table covers, and articles of
                    clothing is also important and extensive. The felt for these purposes is made
                    chiefly from wool, which is, after washing, first carded out into exceedingly
                    fine uniform gossamer-like laps. These laps, of the length and breadth of the
                    web to be made, are superimposed on each other in numbers corresponding to the
                    thickness desired in the finished article. The superficial stratum is usually of
                    finer texture than the body, and the mass when ready for felting has the
                    appearance of a huge sheet of cotton wadding. In this state the compound lap is
                    passed between a series of opposite pressing rollers partly immersed in water,
                    some of which are solid and heavy and others hollow and heated internally by
                    steam. In its progress the lap is not only squeezed between the rollers, but an
                    oscillating motion being given to the upper series, it is at the same time
                    submitted to a rubbing action, the result being that it issues a dense compact
                    sheet of felt of uniform thickness. Felt so made is subsequently dyed, printed,
                    and otherwise finished by the ordinary processes applicable to woven tissues. A
                    patent has recently been secured for a carpet made of uniform strips of felt set
                    on edge and tightly laced <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n78/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0078-0069"/> through the centre. Such a carpet is the same on
                    both sides, and for it great durability, thickness, softness, and elasticity are
                    claimed. Among the leading mechanical applications of felt may be enumerated the
                    covering of steam boilers and cylinders, the lining of damp walls, steampacking,
                    non-conductors for kilns and refrigerators, filters, polishing wheels, lining
                    between the planking and metal sheathing of ships, printers’ blankets, and the
                    covering of roofs. In the coarser qualities of felt cow-hair is the leading
                    ingredient, and waterproof felting for roofs, &lt;fcc., is impregnated with
                    artificial asphalt and like substances. This manufacture was originally
                    introduced by Croggon and Co. of London under a patent of Dr Ritchie of Belfast;
                    but the “roofing felt” now made is a misnomer, seeing it is a bituminous
                    compound simply held together by waste flax and other vegetable fibres.</p>
