                    (1398-1481), was born in 1398 at Tolentino, in the March of Ancona. When he
                    appeared upon the scene of human life, Petrarch and the students of Florence had
                    already brought the first act in the recovery of classic culture to conclusion.
                    They had created an eager appetite for the antique, had disinterred many
                    important Roman authors, and had freed Latin scholarship to some extent from the
                    barbarism of the Middle Ages. Filelfo was destined to carry on their work in the
                    field of Latin literature, and to be an important agent in the still
                    unaccomplished recovery of Greek culture. His earliest studies in grammar,
                    rhetoric, and the Latin language were conducted at Padua, where he acquired so
                    great a reputation for learning that in 1417 he was invited to teach eloquence
                    and moral philosophy at Venice. According to the custom of that age in Italy, it
                    now became his duty to explain the language, and to illustrate the beauties of
                    the principal Latin authors, Cicero and Virgil being considered the chief
                    masters of moral science and of elegant dictioD. Filelfo made his mark at once
                    in Venice. He was admitted to the society of the first scholars and the most
                    eminent nobles of that city; and in 1419 he received an appointment from the
                    state, which enabled him to reside as secretary to the consul-general of the
                    Venetians in Constantinople. This appointment was not only honourable to Filelfo
                    as a man of trust and general ability, but it also gave him the opportunity of
                    acquiring the most coveted of all possessions at that moment for a scholar—a
                    knowledge of the Greek language. Immediately after his arrival in
                    Constantinople, Filelfo placed himself under the tuition of John Chrysoloras,
                    whose name was already well known in Italy as brother of Manuel, the first Greek
                    to profess the literature of his ancestors in Florence. At the recommendation of
                    Chrysoloras he was employed in several diplomatic missions by the emperor John
                    Palaeologus. Before very long the friendship between Filelfo and his tutor was
                    cemented by the marriage of the former to Theodora, the daughter of John
                    Chrysoloras. He had now acquired a thorough knowledge of the Greek language, and
                    had formed a large collection of Greek manuscripts. There was no reason why he
                    should not return to his native country. Accordingly, in 1427 he accepted an
                    invitation from the republic of Venice, and set sail for Italy, intending to
                    resume his professorial career. From this time forward until the date of his
                    death, Filelfo’s history consists of a record of the various towns in which he
                    lectured, the masters whom he served, the books he wrote, the authors he
                    illustrated, the friendships he contracted, and the wars he waged with rival
                    scholars. He was a man of vast physical energy, of inexhaustible mental
                    activity, of quick passions, and violent appetites; vain, restless, greedy of
                    gold and pleasure and fame; unable to stay quiet in one place, and perpetually
                    engaged in quarrels with his compeers.</p>
                <p>When Filelfo arrived at Venice with his family in 1427, he found that the city
                    had almost been emptied by the plague, and that his scholars would be few. He
                    therefore removed to Bologna; but here also he was met with drawbacks. The city
                    was too much disturbed with political dissensions to attend to him; so Filelfo
                    crossed the Apennines and settled in Florence. At Florence began one of the most
                    brilliant and eventful periods of his life. During the week he lectured to large
                    audiences of young and old on the principal Greek and Latin authors, and on
                    Sundays he explained Dante to the people in the Duomo. In addition to these
                    labours of the chair, he found time to translate portions of Aristotle,
                    Plutarch, Xenophon, and Lysias from the Greek. Nor was he dead to the claims of
                    society. At first he seems to have lived with the Florentine scholars on
                    tolerably good terms; but his temper was so arrogant that Cosimo αe <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Medici’s friends were not long able to put up with
                    him. Filelfo hereupon broke out into open and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0171-0162"/> violent animosity; and when Cosimo was exiled by
                    the Albizzi party in 1433, he urged the signoria of Florence to pronounce upon
                    him the sentence of death. On the return of Cosimo to Florence, Filelfo’s
                    position in that city was no longer tenable. His life, he asserted, had been
                    already once attempted by a cut-throat in the pay of the Medici; and now he
                    readily accepted an invitation from the state of Siena. In Siena, however, he
                    was not destined to remain more than four years. His fame as a professor had
                    grown great in Italy, and he daily received tempting offers from princes and
                    republics. The most alluring of these, made him by the duke of Milan, Filippo
                    Maria Visconti, he decided on accepting; and in 1440 he was received with honour
                    by his new master in the capital of Lombardy.</p>
                <p>Filelfo’s life at Milan curiously illustrates the multifarious importance of the
                    scholars of that age in Italy. It was his duty to celebrate his princely patrons
                    in panegyrics and epics, to abuse their enemies in libels and invectives, to
                    salute them with encomiastic odes on their birthdays, and to compose poems on
                    their favourite themes. For their courtiers he wrote epithalamial and funeral
                    orations; ambassadors and visitors from foreign states he greeted with the
                    rhetorical lucubrations then so much in vogue. The students of the university he
                    taught in daily lectures, passing in review the weightiest and lightest authors
                    of antiquity, and pouring forth a flood of miscellaneous erudition. Not
                    satisfied with these outlets for his mental energy, Filelfo went on translating
                    from the Greek, and prosecuted a paper warfare with his enemies in Florence. He
                    wrote, moreover, political pamphlets on the great events of Italian history; and
                    when Constantinople was taken by the Turks, he procured the liberation of his
                    wife’s mother by a message addressed in his own name to the sultan. In addition
                    to a fixed stipend of some 700 golden florins yearly, he was continually in
                    receipt of special payments for the orations and. poems he produced; so that,
                    had he been a man of frugal habits or of moderate economy, he might have amassed
                    a considerable fortune. As it was, he spent his money as fast as he received it,
                    living in a style of splendour ill befitting a simple scholar, and indulging his
                    taste for pleasure in more than questionable amusements. In consequence of this
                    prodigality, he was always poor. His letters and his poems abound in impudent
                    demands for money from patrons, some of them couched in language of the lowest
                    adulation, and others savouring of literary brigandage.</p>
                <p>During the second year of his Milanese residence Filelfo lost his first wife,
                    Theodora. He soon married again; and this time he chose for his bride a young
                    lady of good Lombard family, called Orsina Osnaga. When she died, he took in
                    wedlock for the third time a woman of Lombard birth, Laura Magiolini. To all his
                    three wives, in spite of numerous infidelities, he seems to have been warmly
                    attached; and this is perhaps the best trait in a character otherwise more
                    remarkable for arrogance and heat than for any amiable qualities.</p>
                <p>On the death of Filippo Maria Visconti, Filelfo, after a short hesitation,
                    transferred his allegiance to Francesco Sforza, the new duke of Milan; and in
                    order to curry favour with this parvenu, he began his ponderous epic, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sforziad,</hi> of which 12,800 lines were written, but which was
                    never published. When Francesco Sforza died, Filelfo turned his thoughts towards
                    Rome. He was now an old man of seventy-seven years, honoured with the friendship
                    of princes, recognized as the most distinguished of Italian humanists, courted
                    by pontiffs, and decorated with the laurel wreath and the order of knighthood by
                    kings. Crossing the Apennines and passing through Florence, he reached Rome in
                    the second week of 1475. The terrible Sixtus IV. now ruled in the Vatican; and
                    from this pope Filelfo had received an invitation to occupy the chair of
                    rhetoric with good emoluments. At first he was vastly pleased with the city and
                    court of Rome; but his satisfaction ere long turned to discontent, and he gave
                    vent to his ill humour in a venemous satire on the pope’s treasurer, Milliardo
                    Cicala. Sixtus himself soon fell under the ban of his displeasure; and when a
                    year had passed, he left Rome never to return. Filelfo reached Milan to find
                    that his wife had died of the plague in his absence, and was already buried. His
                    own death followed speedily. For some time past he had been desirous of
                    displaying his abilities and adding to his fame in Florence. Years had healed
                    the breach between him and the Medicean family; and on the occasion of the Pazzi
                    conspiracy against the life of Lorenzo de’ Medici, he had sent violent letters
                    of abuse to his papal patron Sixtus, denouncing his participation in a plot so
                    dangerous to the security of Italy. Lorenzo now invited him to profess Greek at
                    Florence, and thither Filelfo journeyed in 1481. But two weeks after his arrival
                    he succumbed to dysentery, and was buried at the age of eighty-three in the
                    church of the Annunziata.</p>
                <p>Filelfo deserves commemoration among the greatest humanists of the Italian
                    Renaissance, not for the beauty of his style, not for the elevation of his
                    genius, not for the accuracy of his learning, but for his energy, and for his
                    complete adaptation to the times in which he lived. His erudition was large but
                    ill-digested; his knowledge of the ancient authors, if extensive, was
                    superficial; his style was vulgar; he had no brilliancy of imagination, no
                    pungency of epigram, no grandeur of rhetoric. Therefore he has left nothing to
                    posterity which the world would not very willingly let die. But in his own days
                    he did excellent service to learning by his untiring activity, and by the
                    facility with which he used his stores of knowledge. It was an age of
                    accumulation and preparation, when the world was still amassing and cataloguing
                    the fragments rescued from the wrecks of Greece and Rome. Men had to receive the
                    very rudiments of culture before they could appreciate its niceties. And in this
                    work of collection and instruction Filelfo excelled, passing rapidly from place
                    to place, stirring up the zeal for learning by the passion of his own
                    enthusiastic temperament, and acting as a pioneer for men like Poliziano and
                    Erasmus. All that is worth knowing about Filelfo is contained in Rosmini’s
                    admirable <hi rend="italic">Vita di Filelfo,</hi> Milan, 1808; but the student
