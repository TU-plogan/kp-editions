                <p><label type="entry">FINE ART</label> is the abstract or collective name given to
                    the results of a whole group of human activities; the activities themselves
                    which constitute the group being severally called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fine
                    Arts.</hi> In antiquity the fine arts were not explicitly named, nor even
                    distinctly recognized, as a separate class. In other modern languages besides
                    English they are called by the equivalent name of the beautiful arts <hi
                    rend="italic">(belle arti, beaux arts,</hi><hi rend="italic">schöne
                    Künste).</hi> The fine or beautiful arts, then, are those among the arts of man
                    which minister, not to his material necessities or conveniences, but to his love
                    of beauty (using the word beauty in its widest sense); or if any art fulfils
                    both these purposes at once, still as fulfilling the latter only is it called a
                    fine ark Thus architecture, in so far as it provides shelter and accommodation,
                    is one of the useful or mechanical arts, and one of the fine arts only in so far
                    as its structures give pleasure by the aspect of strength, fitness, harmony and
                    proportion of the masses, by disposition and contrast of light and shade, by
                    colour and enrichment, by variety and relation of lines, surfaces, and
                    intervals.</p>
                <p>There is no difference of opinion concerning the nature of fine art and the fine
                    arts as thus generally described, and as contra-distinguished from art and the
                    arts mechanical. It is acknowledged that the one set of arts exists to satisfy
                    practical needs, and the other set exists to give delight and satisfy the sense
                    of beauty, while as to an intermediate set of arts which exist for both
                    purposes, it is possible to distinguish in each case the part which is beautiful
                    or pleasurable from the part which is mechanical or merely useful. But as soon
                    as we inquire further, and seek for more precise definitions, we find ourselves
                    confronted with a mass of speculation and discussion as formidable as has been
                    accumulated in any department of human thought. Granting that the fine arts are
                    those of which the end is beauty, or beauty and use conjointly, the question
                    next arises, what is beauty 1 and next, how does the beauty of art differ from
                    the beauty of nature? and then, what place do the arts of beauty hold in the
                    general scheme of things 1—what are the relations of these activities and their
                    results to the idea of the universe, to the faculties of man, and to each other
                    <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> To such inquiries as these, enormous in extent and
                    enormous in complexity, a separate place has been given in modern philosophy
                    under the name AEsthetics. “It is the province of aesthetics,” says Professor
                    Ruskin, “to tell you (if you did not know it before) that the taste and colour
                    of a peach are pleasant, and to ascertain (if it be ascertainable, and you have
                    any curiosity to know) why they are so.” But in a less sarcastic and more
                    extended definition, it would be said that the name AEsthetics is intended to
                    designate a scientific doctrine or account of beauty in nature and art, and of
                    the faculties for enjoying and for originating beauty which exist in man.
                    Instead, however, of an accepted or uniform science, we find on these subjects a
                    multitude of speculations as conflicting as they are voluminous; but yet
                    conflicting more in appearance than in reality, because the source of their
                    contradictions lies less in difference of judgment concerning the facts
                    themselves, than in difference of doctrine concerning the abstract order of the
                    universe in which those facts find a place, and in consequent diversity of
                    method in arranging and of formula in interpreting the facts.</p>
                <p>Of the principal speculations of AESTHETICS the reader already possesses a
                    synopsis under the proper heading. Our present task is of a different kind. We
                    shall, indeed, as well as our space admits, endeavour to state what characters
                    all the fine arts possess in common, and in what they severally differ from one
                    another, as well as to lay down certain leading facts of their history; in other
                    words, we shall submit (1) a definition of fine art in general, (2) a definition
                    and classification of the fine arts severally, (3) some observations on their
                    historical development. But in so doing, we shall not profess even to state the
                    deeper problems either of metaphysics or psychology which will lie to right and
                    left of our path, still less, as the exponents of any <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n204/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0204-0195"/> one philosophical system, to solve them. We shall
                    simply take account of the facts and phenomena of the several arts as we find
                    them in experience, and sum them up in the language of every day; keeping of
                    necessity in view only the most salient features of the vast provinces of
                    inquiry before us, and leaving particulars to be supplied under the headings of
                    the individual arts. And when, as will sometimes happen, we do quote the
                    formulas and refer to the systems of philosophers, it will be, not as adopting
                    any of them for better for worse, but as finding suggestions in all of them by
                    turns; since, though one body of speculative doctrine may be no truer than
                    another, yet each brings forward some aspect and contains some presentment of
                    the truth; and a complicated mass of facts, when it is arranged in the order and
                    expressed in the terms of a system, may not be essentially the clearer, but is
                    usually the better marshalled for review.</p>
                <p>At the threshold it will be necessary that we should call to mind the terms of
                    our own definition of art in general (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Art).</hi>
                    According to the popular distinction between art and nature, the idea of art
                    only includes phenomena of which man is the cause—and that, when he acts not
                    spontaneously but with calculation, not from impulse but from forethought; while
                    the idea of nature includes all phenomena, both in man and in the world outside
                    him, which take place without forethought or studied initiative of his own. This
                    distinction we saw reason to recognize as practically valid. Art, we said
                    accordingly, means every regulated operation or dexterity whereby we pursue ends
                    which we know beforehand; and it means nothing but such operations and
                    dexterities. That which any one does without thinking about it, and without
                    considering what he is doing it for, is not art at all. Hence we shall not allow
                    the title of fine art to natural eloquence, to charm or dignity of manner, to
                    delicacy and tact in social intercourse, and other graces of life and conduct
                    for which such a title is sometimes claimed, though they really proceed from an
                    unconscious gift or unreflecting habit in those who exhibit them. All these are
                    manifestations of the beautiful, and in witnessing them we experience a pleasure
                    analogous, no doubt, to the pleasures of fine art. Nevertheless, so far as such
                    manifestations are spontaneous, they are not arts, but, as we have called them,
                    graces; they are due, as Greek theology would have expressed it, not to the
                    teaching of Athênê but to the gift of the Charites. When the exigencies of a
                    deductive and ontological system lead a writer like Dr Robert Zimmermann, of
                    Vienna, to co-ordinate these spontaneous acts or traits of beautiful and
                    expressive behaviour with the deliberate artistic activities of the race, we
                    feel that he is sacrificing to system a distinction which is essential That
                    distinction common parlance very justly observes, with its opposition of “art”
                    to “nature,” and its phrase of “second nature” for those habits which have
                    become so ingrained as to seem spontaneous, whether originally the result of
                    discipline or not. One of the essential qualities of art is premeditation; and
                    when Shelley talks of the skylark’s profuse strains of <hi rend="italic"
                    >unpremeditated art,</hi> he in effect lays emphasis on the fact that it is only
                    by a metaphor that he uses the word art in this case at all; he calls attention
                    to that which (if the songs of birds are as instinctive as we suppose) precisely
                    makes the difference between the skylark’s outpourings and his own. For example,
                    when we see a person in all whose ordinary movements there is freedom and
                    beauty, we put down the charm of these to inherited and inbred physical
                    aptitudes of which the person has never thought, and call it nature; but when we
                    go on to notice that the same person is beautifully and appropriately dressed,
                    since we know that it is impossible to dress without thinking of it, we put down
                    the charm of this to judicious forethought and calculation, and call it art.
                    Again, it is an established and a just practical maxim of the dramatic art, that
                    the actor who in the moment of performance really and involuntarily surrenders
                    himself to the emotions of his part and situation, though he may rouse the
                    sympathies of the audience by a natural exhibition of feeling, yet is not acting
                    like an artist, and does not produce as much effect, nor an effect of the same
                    kind, as he does when, master of himself, he goes through a series of utterances
                    and gestures which he has deliberately conceived and rehearsed beforehand. The
                    task of art is not, in either of the above instances, to create a product
                    outsideof or separate from the artist. The material upon which the artist has in
                    these cases to work consists of his or her own natural aptitudes; aptitudes, in
                    the one case, of personal charm, which have to be made the most of by
                    appropriate adornment; aptitudes, in the other case, for mimicry and emotional
                    expression, which have to be made the most of by study and practice. In such
                    instances, it may often be hard to separate the share of nature from the share
                    of art in the result—to determine where grace ends and calculation begins, or
                    where ends the sympathetic power of natural expression, and where begins the
                    properly artistic power of studied and premeditated expression. Perhaps no
                    writer has observed the differences or laid down the boundary lines between
                    these adjacent kingdoms of artlessness and art with more acuteness than
                    Schleiermacher. But we have said enough to mark for the present purpose the
                    reality and importance of the distinction. And having thus secured ourselves
                    against the intrusion among fine arts of those phases of beauty in human act and
                    utterance which justly belong not to art at all but nature, we can enter upon
                    what is our proper business, the delimitation of the separate place and
                    functions of the fine arts among the rest of the arts and among each other.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Of Fine Art in general.</hi></p>
                <p>When we say of the fine arts as a group that they are activities which minister
                    to the love of beauty in man, it is as if we said, the tailor’s art is an
                    activity which ministers to his need of clothes; and the inference is, in the
                    one case as in the other, that a separate class of men is to be found in every
                    community devoted to this particular employment. Aud such, practically, we all
                    know to be the case; the gifts and calling of the artist constitute a separate
                    profession, a profession of the producers, so to speak, of fine art, while the
                    rest of the community are enjoyeſs or recipients of the fine art produced. In
                    the most primitive societies, undoubtedly, this was not so, and we can go back
                    to an original or rudimentary stage of every fine art at which the separation
                    between a class of producers or performers, and a class of recipients, does not
                    exist. Such an original or rudimentary stage of the dramatic art, for instance,
                    we are accustomed to witness in children, who will occupy themselves at all
                    moments with mimicry and make-believe for their own satisfaction, and without
                    the least regard to the presence or absence of witnesses. The original or
                    rudimentary type of the profession of imitative sculptors or painters is the
                    cave-dweller of the palaeolithic age, who, when he rested from his day’s
                    hunting, first took up the bone handle of his weapon, and with a flint either
                    carved it into the shape, or on its surface scratched the outlines, of the
                    animals of the chase. The original or rudimentary type of the architect,
                    considered not as a mere builder but as an artist, is the savage who, when his
                    tribe had taken to live in tents or huts instead of caves, first arranged the
                    skins and timbers of his tent or hut in one way because it pleased his eye,
                    rather than in some other way which was as good for shelter. The original <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n205/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0205-0196"/> type of the artificer or maker of household
                    implements, considered in the same light, was the other savage who first took it
                    into his head to fashion his club or spear in one way rather than in another way
                    as good for killing, and to ornament it with tufts or markings. In none of these
                    cases had the primitive artist any reason for pleasing anybody but himself.
                    Again, the original or rudimentary type of lyric song and dancing arose when the
                    first reveller clapped hands and stamped or shouted in time, in honour of his
                    god, in commemoration of a victory, or in mere obedience to the blind stirring
                    of a rhythmic impulse within him; and to such a display the presence or absence
                    of witnesses does not signify at all. The original type of the instrumental
                    musician is the shepherd who first notched a reed and drew sounds from it while
                    his sheep were cropping. The father of all artists in dress and personal
                    adornment was the first wild man who tattooed himself or bedecked himself with
                    shells and plumes. But in both of these last instances, it may be said, the
                    primitive artist surely had the motive of pleasing not himself only, but his
                    mate, or the female whom he desired to be his mate? However that may be, it is
                    clear that what any one can eñjoy by himself, whether in the way of musical
                    sounds or personal adornments, or in the way of mimicry, of rhythmical
                    movements, of imitative or ornamental carving and drawing, of the disposition
                    and adornment of dwelling places and utensils—the same things, it is clear,
                    others <hi rend="italic">can</hi> also enjoy with him. For these and similar
                    things to give pleasure, it is not essential that others should be by; but the
                    pleasures they give are essentially of a kind in which others can, if they are
                    by, participate.</p>
                <p>And so, with the growth of societies, it comes about that one class of persons
                    separate themselves, and become the ministers or producers of this kind of
                    pleasures, while the rest become the persons ministered to, the participators in
                    or recipients of the pleasures. Artists are those members of a society who are
                    so constituted as to feel more acutely than the rest certain classes of
                    pleasures which all can feel in their degree. By this fact of their constitution
                    they are impelled to devote their active powers to the production of such
                    pleasures, to the making or doing of some of those things which they enjoy so
                    intensely when they are made and done by others. At the same time the artist
                    does not, by assuming these ministering or creative functions, surrender his
                    enjoying or receptive functions. He continues to participate in the pleasures of
                    which he is himself the cause, and remains a conscious member of his own public.
                    The architect, sculptor, painter, are able respectively to stand off from and
                    appreciate the results of their own labours; the singer enjoys the sound of his
                    own voice, and the musician of his own instrument; the poet, according to his
                    temperament, furnishes the most enthusiastic or the most fastidious reader for
                    his own stanzas. Neither, on the other hand, does the person who is a habitual
                    recipient from others of the pleasures of fine art, forfeit the privilege of
                    producing them according to his capabilities, and of becoming, if he has the
                    power, an amateur or occasional artist. Nay, these opposite functions of
                    producing and enjoying the fruits of production, of ministering and being
                    ministered to, are much more commonly combined in this than in other
                    de-Íiartments of human exertion. Nearly every one is ready to )e the minister,
                    if he can, of his own higher pleasures, and therefore to be his own singer or
                    poet, his own architect, sculptor, or painter. Few are ready to be ministers of
                    their own lower needs, and to be their own tailors, their own butchers (except
                    in the case of wild game, the killing of which, being superfluous, possesses an
                    attraction of which necessary killing is devoid), their own cobblers, cooks,
                    servants, and the rest. In spite, however, of such combination or interchange of
                    functions, we may, both practically and for the purposes of the present
                    discussion, regard the artist as belonging generally to one category and the
                    rest of the world to another. We may separate in our consideration those
                    phenomena which attend the production of fine art, or exercise of the aesthetic
                    activities, from those phenomena which attend the enjoyment of fine art, or
                    contemplation of the results of such exercise.</p>
                <p>For the rest, of the two parts of which our preliminary definition consisted, we
                    shall gain most by letting alone the one and following out the other. If we take
                    up the affirmative part, in which we said that the fine arts are those which
                    minister to our love of beauty, and if we try to develop and complete that, we
                    shall have, for one thing, to explain how the love of beauty, in the wide and
                    somewhat loose sense in which we here use the phrase, means a faculty which man
                    possesses for taking keen and permanent delight in the contemplation and the
                    imagination of many kinds of things, including some not strictly to be called
                    beautiful, such as grotesqueness, comicality, even ugliness itself, when they
                    are presented in typical forms. For another thing, we shall be very apt to find
                    ourselves arguing in a circle, and saying, such and such an art is fine because
                    it produces beauty, and such and such a thing is beautiful because it is
                    produced by fine art. But if we take up the negative part of our definition, in
                    which we only said that the fine arts are arts which exist independently of
                    practical necessity or utility, and if we try to follow out this, we shall find
                    that here we have got hold of a character of the fine arts which at once
                    presents instructive aspects and far-reaching consequences. Indeed, the greater
                    part of those other characters, or common properties of whatever kind, which
                    have been recognized by consent as peculiar to the group of fine arts, will
                    appear on examination to be implied in, or deducible from, this one fundamental
                    character.</p>
                <p>Let us take first, among such common properties, one relating to the frame of
                    mind, or moral attitude, so to call it, which accompanies the reception as
                    distinguished from the production of aesthetic pleasure. It is an observation as
                    old as Aristotle that such pleasures differ from most other pleasures of
                    experience in that they are disinterested. That is to say, of course not
                    disinterested in the sense in which that word implies the positive ethical
                    virtue of self-abnegation, or preferring others to one’s self; but disinterested
                    in the sense that they are not such as nourish a man’s body nor add to his
                    riches; they are not such as can gratify him, when he receives them, by the
                    sense of advantage or superiority over his fellow creatures; they are not such
                    as one human being can in any sense receive exclusively from the object which
                    bestows them. We have partly learnt as much already in glancing at the origins
                    or rudimentary stages of the several fine arts, when we saw that, whether the
                    primitive artist meant it or not, his operations were capable at any rate of
                    pleasing others besides himself. To turn to their developed stages, it is
                    evidently characteristic of a beautiful building that its beauty cannot be
                    monopolized, but can be seen and admired by the inhabitants of a whole city and
                    by all visitors for all generations. The same thing is true of a picture or a
                    statue, except in so far as an individual possessor may choose to keep such a
                    possession to himself, in which case his pride of monopoly is a sentiment wholly
                    independent of his pleasure in artistic contemplation; (and as a rule we
                    practically find that the heir or collector who takes most pleasure in his
                    treasures of art is also the readiest to make them accessible to others).
                    Similarly, music is composed to be sung or played for the enjoyment of many at a
                    time, and for such enjoyment a hundred years hence as much as <hi
                    rend="subscript"> A</hi> to-day. Poetry is written to be read by all readers for
                    ever who care for the ideas and feelings of the poet, and can apprehend the
                    meaning and melody of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0206-0197"/> language. If we consider other pleasures which
                    might seem to be analogous to those of fine art, but to which common consent yet
                    declines to allow that character, we shall see that one reason is, that such
                    pleasures are not in their nature thus disinterested. Thus the senses of smell
                    and taste have pleasures of their own like the senses of sight and hearing, and
                    pleasures neither less poignant nor very much less capable of fine graduation
                    and discrimination than those. Why, then, are the experiences of these senses
                    not called beautiful? and why is the title of fine art not claimed, or only
                    claimed in jest, for any skill in arranging and combining them? Why are there no
                    arts of savours and perfumes corresponding in rank to the arts of forms,
                    colours, and sounds? An answer commonly given is that sight and hearing are
                    intellectual and therefore higher senses, that through them we have our avenues
                    to all knowledge and all ideas of things outside us; while taste and smell are
                    unintellectual and therefore lower senses, through which few such impressions
                    find their way to us as help to build up our knowledge and our ideas. To this it
                    may be replied that music, in its perfect or developed state, the accomplished
                    fine art, that is, of sounds, deals precisely with those modes and relations of
                    sound, pure sound as apart from words, which least convey knowledge or definite
                    ideas, and can so far at least be called intellectual. The reply is far from
                    complete; still, a more satisfactory reason than the above why there are no fine
                    arts of taste and smell, or at best but humble fine arts half ironically so
                    called, is this, that savours and perfumes yield only private pleasures, which
                    it is not possible to build up into separate and durable schemes such that every
                    one may have the benefit of them, and such as cannot be monopolized or used up.
                    If against this it is contended that what the programme of a performance is in
                    the musical art, the same is a <hi rend="italic">menu</hi> in the culinary, and
                    that practically it is no Jess possible to serve up a thousand times and to a
                    thousand different companies the same dinner than the same symphony, we must
                    fall back upon that still more fundamental form of the distinction between the
                    aesthetic and non-aesthetic bodily senses, upon which the physiological
                    psychologists of the English school lay stress. We must say that the pleasures
                    of taste and smell cannot be aesthetic pleasures, or pleasures of fine art,
                    because their enjoyment is too closely associated—in the case of taste of
                    inseparably—with the most indispensable and the most strictly personal of
                    utilities, eating and drinking. To pass from these lower pleasures to the
                    highest; consider the nature of the delight derived from the contemplation, by
                    the person who is happy enough to be their object, of the signs and
                    manifestations of love. That at least is a beautiful experience; why is the
                    pleasure which it affords not an artistic pleasure either? Why, in order to
                    receive an artistic pleasure from human signs and manifestations of this kind,
                    are we compelled to go to the theatre, and see them exhibited in favour of a
                    third person, who is not really their object any more than ourselves? This is
                    so, for one reason, evidently, because of that difference between art and nature
                    on which we have already dwelt Not to art, but to nature and life, belongs love
                    where it is really felt, with its attendant train of hopes and fears, momentous
                    passions and contingencies. To art belongs love displayed where it is not really
                    felt; and in this sphere, along with reality and spontaneousness of the display,
                    and along with its momentous bearings, there disappear all those elements of
                    pleasure in its contemplation which, however exquisite, are not
                    disinterested—the elements of personal exultation, of gratitude and
                    self-congratulation, the pride of favour found, the delight of exclusive
                    possession or acceptance, all these emotions, in short, which can be summed up
                    in the lover’s triumphant monosyllable, “Mine.” Only when those personal
                    emotions are absent can the properly aesthetic emotions or pleasures of fine art
                    find place. That in witnessing a dramatic performance, part of the spectator’s
                    enjoyment consists in sympathetically identifying himself with the lover, may be
                    true, but cannot affect the argument, since at the same time he is well aware
                    that every other spectator present may be similarly engaged with himself.</p>
                <p>Thus, from the lowest point of the scale to the highest, we may observe that the
                    element of personal advantage or monopoly in human gratifications seems to
                    exclude them from the kingdom of fine art. The pleasures of fine art seem to
                    define themselves as pleasures of delighted contemplation, but of such
                    contemplation only when it is disinterested. Now, the negative part of our first
                    definition was that the fine arts were arts having nothing to do with the
                    satisfaction of practical necessities or supply of practical utilities. So far
                    as the necessity of anything implies its necessity to the sustenance or comfort
                    of the individual apart from others, and so far as its utility implies its
                    capacity of being used by one to the exclusion of others, our new observation,
                    it is evident, does but confirm that first statement; repeating it as to a part
                    of the ground which it covers, and drawing out a part of its consequences in the
                    moral and social sphere.</p>
                <p>Next, let us consider another generally accepted observation concerning the
                    nature of the fine arts, and one, this time, relating to the disposition and
                    state of mind of the artist himself. The observation we mean is this, that while
                    for success in other arts it is only necessary to learn their rules, and to
                    apply them until practice gives facility, in the fine arts rules and their
                    application will carry but a little way towards success. All that can depend on
                    rules, on knowledge, and on the application of knowledge by practice, the artist
                    must indeed acquire, and the acquisition is often very complicated and
                    laborious. But outside of and beyond such acquisitions, he must trust to what is
                    called genius or imagination, that is, to the spontaneous working together of an
                    incalculably complex group of faculties, reminiscences, preferences, emotions,
                    instincts, in his constitution. Now, if we consider this characteristic of the
                    activities of the artist, we shall see that it is a direct consequence or
                    corollary of the fundamental fact that the art he practises is independent of
                    utility: thus. A useful end is necessarily a determinate and prescribed end. To
                    every end which is determinate and prescribed there must be one road which is
                    the best. Skill in any useful art means knowing practically, by rules and the
                    application of rules, the best road to the particular ends of that art. Thus the
                    farmer, the engineer, the carpenter, the builder so far as he is not concerned
                    with the look of his buildings, the weaver so far as he is not concerned with
                    the designing of the patterns which he weaves, these and the hundred other
                    varieties of craftsmen or artificers in a community, possess each his separate
                    skill, but a skill to which fixed problems are set, and which, if it indulges in
                    new inventions and combinations at all, can indulge them only for the sake of an
                    improved solution of those particular problems and no others. The solution once
                    found, the invention once made, its rules can be written down, or at any rate
                    its practice can be imparted to others, who will apply it in their turn. Whereas
                    no man can write down, in a way that others can act upon in their turn, how
                    Beethoven conquered unknown kingdoms in the world of harmony, and established
                    new laws by the inspired violation of old; or how Rembrandt turned the aspects
                    of spiritual abjectness and physical gloom into pictures as worthy of
                    contemplation as those into which the Italians had for ages turned the aspects
                    of spiritual exaltation and shadowless day. The reason why the operations of the
                    artist thus differ from the operations of the ordinary craftsman or artificer is
                    that his ends, being ends other than useful, are not determinate nor fixed as
                    theirs are. He has <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n207/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0207-0198"/> large liberty to choose his own problems, and may
                    solve each of them in a thousand different ways according to the prompting of
                    his own ordering or creating instincts. The musical composer has the largest
                    liberty of all. Having learned what is learnable in his art, having mastered the
                    complicated and laborious rules of musical form, having next determined the
                    particular class of the work which he is about to compose, he has then before
                    him the whole inexhaustible world of appropriate successions and combinations of
                    emotional sound. He is merely directed and not fettered, in the case of song,
                    cantata, oratorio, or opera, by the sense of the words which he has to set. The
                    poverty or splendour of the result depends absolutely on his possessing or
                    failing to possess powers which can neither be trained in, nor communicated to,
                    any man. And this double freedom, alike from practical service and from the
                    representation of definite objects, is what makes music in a certain sense the
                    typical fine art, or art of arts. Architecture shares one half of this freedom.
                    It has not to imitate natural objects; for this service it calls in sculpture to
                    its aid; but architecture is without the other half of freedom altogether. The
                    architect has a sphere of liberty in the disposition of his masses, lines,
                    colours, alternations of light and shadow, of plain and ornamented surface, and
                    the rest; but upon this sphere he can only enter on condition that he at the
                    same time fulfils the strict practical task of supplying the required
                    accommodation, and obeys the strict mechanical necessities imposed by the laws
                    of weight, thrust, support, resistance, and other properties of solid matter. In
                    the imitative arts, the sculptor, the painter, the poet, has each in like manner
                    his sphere of necessary facts, rules, and conditions corresponding to the nature
                    of his task. The sculptor must be intimately versed in the facts of the human
                    frame and the rules and conditions for its representation in solid form; the
                    painter in a much more extended range of natural facts and appearances, and the
                    rules and conditions for representing them on a plane surface; the poet’s art of
                    words has its own not inconsiderable basis of positive and disciplined
                    acquisition. So far as rules, precepts, measurements, and other communicable
                    laws or secrets can carry the artist, so far also the spectator can account for,
                    analyse, and, so to speak, tabulate the effects of his art. But the essential
                    character of the artist’s operation, its very bloom and .virtue, lies in those
                    parts of it which fall outside this range of regulation on the one hand and
                    analysis on the other. His merit varies according to the felicity with which he
                    is able, in that region, to exercise his free choice and frame his individual
                    ideal, and according to the tenacity with which he strives to grasp and realize
                    his choice, or to attain perfection according to that ideal. Of the amplitude of
                    that freedom, of the complex and unsearchable secrets of that felicity, of the
                    honourableness of that pursuit after perfection, men in general have expressed
                    their consciousness when they have called these the fine or beautiful arts;
                    thereby signifying not less their admiration of the nature of the operation than
                    their pleasure in its results. Corresponding, then, to the fact, concerning the
                    ends or purposes of the mechanical and the fine arts respectively, that those
                    exist for use and these independently of use— we get the further fact,
                    concerning the respective modes of their pursuit, that the mechanical arts can
                    be rightly practised by strict adherence to rule and precept, while the fine
                    arts, though they have technical foundations which are matters of rule and
                    precept too, can yet be rightly practised only by following, in a region outside
                    the reach of rule and precept, the free prompting of some of the finest
                    faculties of the spirit.</p>
                <p>In an age when the power and province of mechanical art are daily expanding, it
                    is worth while in this connexion to inquire in what way such expansion affects
                    the power and province of fine art. The great practical movement of the world in
                    our age is a movement for the development of mechanical inventions and
                    multiplication of mechanical products. So far as these inventions are applied to
                    purposes purely useful, and so far as their products do not profess to offer
                    anything delightful to contemplation, this movement in no way concerns our
                    argument. But there is a vast multitude of products which do profess qualities
                    of pleasantness, and upon which the ornaments intended to make them pleasurable
                    are bestowed by machinery, and in speaking of which we are accustomed to the
                    phrases art-industry, industrial art, art manufactures, and the like. It
                    concerns us to know what relation the fine arts really hold to these. The answer
                    is, that the industry or ingenuity which directs the machine is not fine art at
                    all, since the object of the machine is simply to multiply as easily and as
                    perfectly as possible a definite and prescribed impress or pattern. This is
                    equally true whether the machine is a perfectly simple one, like the engraver’s
                    press, for producing and multiplying impressions from an engraved plate, or a
                    highly complex one, like the loom, in which elaborate patterns of carpet or
                    curtain are set for weaving. In both cases there exists behind the mechanical
                    industry an industry which is one of fine art in its degree. In the case of the
                    engraver’s press, there exists behind the industry of the printer the art of the
                    engraver, which, if the engraver is also the free inventor of the design, is
                    then a fine art, or if he is but the interpreter of the invention of another, is
                    then in its turn a semi-mechanical appliance in aid of the fine art of the first
                    inventor. In the case of the weaver’s loom there is, behind the mechanical
                    industry which directs the loom at its given task, the fine art, or what ought
                    to be the fine art, of the designer who has contrived the pattern. In the case
                    of the engraving, the mechanical industry of printing only exists for the sake
                    of bringing out and disseminating abroad the fine art employed upon the design.
                    In the case of the carpet or curtain, the fine art is only called in to make the
                    product of the useful or mechanical industry of the loom acceptable, since the
                    eye’of man is so constituted as to receive pleasure or the reverse of pleasure
                    from whatever it rests upon, and it is to the interest of the manufacturer to
                    have his product so made as to give pleasure if it can. Whether the machine is
                    thus a humble servant to the artist, or the artist a kind of humble purveyor to
                    the machine, the fine art in the result is due to the former alone; and in any
                    case it reaches the recipient at second-hand, having been put in circulation by
                    a medium not artistic but mechanical. So far, then, as the adoption of
                    mechanical agencies causes an increasing number of people to buy the same print,
                    or decorate their apartments with the same hangings, or wear the same pattern,
                    where before each community or section of a community used products according to
                    its individual taste and tradition, so far such adoption tends to reduce the
                    number of first-hand artistic inventions, or total quantity of fine art, in the
                    world. There is no greater mistake than to suppose that the expansion of what
                    are called artindustries is necessarily tantamount to an increase or propagation
                    of fine art; it is only tantamount to an increase or propagation of particular
                    decorations mechanically multiplied; and is a thing desirable or not according
                    as the decorations so multiplied replace something better or worse than
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Again, with reference not to the application of mechanical contrivances but to
                    their invention,—is not, it may be inquired, the title of artist due to the
                    inventor of some of the astonishingly complex and astonishingly efficient
                    machines of modern times 1 Does he not spend as much thought, labour, genius, as
                    any sculptor or musician in perfecting his <pb break="no"

                    the construction when it is done—so finished, so responsive in all its parts, so
                    almost human—is not that worthy of the name of fine art? Nay, we must reply, for
                    the inventor has a definite and practical end before him; his ideal is not <hi

                    instrument for a prescribed function, but an artist, a free follower of the fine
                    arts, he is not</p>
                <p>Lastly, let us consider one common observation more concerning the nature of the
                    fine arts, though in effect it too does but affirm, in a somewhat new light,
                    that negative definition on which we have dwelt so much already. The fine arts,
                    it is said, are activities which men put forth, not because they need but
                    because they like. They have the activity to spare, and to put it forth in this
                    way pleases them. Fine art is to mankind what play is to the individual, a free
                    and arbitrary vent for energy which is not needed to be spent upon tasks
                    concerned with the conservation, perpetuation, or protection of life. To insist
                    on the superfluous or optional character of the fine arts, to call them the play
                    or pastime of the human race as distinguished from its inevitable and sterner
                    tasks, is obviously only to reiterate our fundamental distinction between the
                    fine arts and the useful or necessary. But the distinction, as expressed in this
                    particular form, has been interpreted in a great variety of ways, and followed
                    out to an infinity of conclusions, conclusions regarding both the nature of the
                    activities themselves and the character and value of their results.</p>
                <p>For instance, starting from this saying that the aesthetic activities are a kind
                    of play, the English psychology of association goes back to the spontaneous
                    cries and movements of children, in which their superfluous energies find a
                    vent. It then enumerates pleasures of which the human constitution is capable
                    apart from direct advantage or utility. Such are the primitive or organic
                    pleasures of sight and hearing, and the secondary or derivative pleasures of
                    association or unconscious reminiscence and inference that soon become mixed up
                    with these. Such are also the pleasures derived from following any kind of
                    mimicry, or representation of things real or like reality. It describes the
                    grouping within the mind of predilections based upon these pleasures; it shows
                    how the growing organism learns to govern its play, or direct its superfluous
                    energies, in obedience to such predilections, till in mature individuals, and
                    still more in mature societies, a highly regulated and accomplished group of
                    leisure activities are habitually employed in supplying to a not less highly
                    cultivated group of disinterested sensibilities their appropriate artistic
                    pleasures.</p>
                <p>Again, in the views of an ancient philosopher, Plato, and a modern poet,
                    Schiller, the consideration that the artistic activities are in the nature of
                    play, and the manifestations in which they result independent of realities and
                    utilities, has led to judgments so differing as the following.</p>
                <p>Plato held that the daily realities of things in experience are not realities
                    indeed, but only far-off shows or reflections of the true realities, that is, of
                    certain ideal or essential forms which can be apprehended as existing by the
                    mind. Holding this, Plato saw in the works of fine art but the reflections of
                    reflections, the shows of shows, and depreciated them according to their degree
                    of remoteness from the ideal, typical, or sense-transcending existences. He sets
                    the arts of medicine, agriculture, shoemaking, and the rest, above the fine
                    arts, inasmuch as they produce something serious or useful (σπoυδαt0v τt). Fine
                    art, he says, produces nothing useful, and makes only semblances <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pd&gt;ωλoπouκη),</hi> whereas what mechanical art produces are
                    utilities, and even in the ordinary sense realities (αυτo7roι- <hi rend="italic"
                    >ητικη</hi> ∖</p>
                <p>In another age, and thinking according to another system, Schiller, so far from
                    holding thus cheap the kingdom of play and show, regarded his sovereignty over
                    that kingdom as the noblest prerogative of man. Schiller wrote his famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters on the Aesthaetic Education of Man</hi> in order to throw
                    into popular currency, and at the same time to modify and follow up in a
                    particular direction, certain systematic doctrines which had lately been
                    launched upon the schools by Kant. The spirit of man, said Schiller after Kant,
                    is placed between two worlds, the physical world or world of sense, and the
                    moral world or world of will. Both of these are worlds of constraint or
                    necessity. In the sensible world, the spirit of man submits to constraint from
                    without; in the moral world, it imposes constraint from within. So far as man
                    yields to the importunities of sense, in so far he is bound and passive, the
                    mere subject of outward shocks and victim of irrational forces. So far as be
                    asserts himself by the exercise of will, imposing upon sense and outward things
                    the dominion of the moral law within him, in so far he is free and active, the
                    rational lord of nature and not her slave. Corresponding to these two worlds, he
                    has within him two conflicting impulses or impulsions of his nature, the one
                    driving him towards one way of living, the other towards another. The one, or
                    sense-impulsion, Schiller thinks of as that which enslaves the spirit of man as
                    the victim of matter, the other or moral impulsion as that which enthrones it as
                    the dictator of form. Between the two the conflict at first seems inveterate.
                    The kingdom of brute nature and sense, the sphere of man’s subjection and
                    passivity, wages war against the kingdom of will and moral law, the sphere of
                    his activity and control, and every conquest of the one is an encroachment upon
                    the other. One of the two, it seems, must win. The man, it seems, must either be
                    slave or master; he must either obey the impulsion of matter, and let sense and
                    outward shocks lay upon him the constraint of nature, or he must obey the
                    impulsion of form, and must control and subjugate sense under the constraint of
                    moral reason and the will. Is there, then, no hope of truce between the two
                    kingdoms, no ground where the two contending impulses can be reconciled î Must a
                    man either abandon law and give way to sense absolutely, or else absolutely set
                    up law and put down sense? Nay, the answer comes, there is such a hope; such a
                    neutral territory there exists. Between the passive kingdom of matter and sense,
                    where man is compelled to blindly feel and be, and the active kingdom of law and
                    reason, where he is compelled sternly to will and act, there is a kingdom where
                    both sense and will may have their way, and where man may give the rein to all
                    his powers. But this middle kingdom does not lie in the sphere of practical life
                    and conduct. In practical life and conduct you cannot yield to both impulsions
                    at once; let yourself go, in that sphere, to the allurements of sense, and you
                    cast off law; maintain law, and you mortify sense. It is in the sphere of those
                    activities which neither subserve any necessity of nature, nor fulfil any moral
                    duty, that the middle kingdom lies where sense and reason can be reconciled.
                    Towards activities of this kind we are driven by a third impulsion of our nature
                    not less essential to it than the other two, the impulsion, as Schiller calls
                    it, of Play. Relatively to real life and conduct, play is a kind of harmless
                    show; it is that which we are free to do or leave undone as we please, and which
                    lies alike outside the sphere of needs and duties. In play we may do as we like,
                    and no mischief will come of it. In this sphere man may put forth all his powers
                    without risk of conflict, and may invent activities which will give it a
                    complete ideal satisfaction to the contending faculties of sense and will at
                    once, to the impulses which bid him feel and enjoy the shocks of physical and
                    outward things, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n209/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0209-0200"/> the impulse which bids him master such things,
                    control, and regulate them. In play you may impose upon Matter what Form you
                    choose, and the two will not interfere with one another or clash. The kingdom of
                    Matter and the kingdom of Form thus harmonized, thus reconciled by the
                    activities of play and show, will in other words be the kingdom of the
                    Beautiful. Follow the impulsion of play, and to the beautiful you will find your
                    road; the activities you will find yourself putting forth will be the activities
                    of aesthetic creation—you will have discovered or invented the fine arts,
                    “Midway,” these are Schiller’s own words, “midway between the formidable kingdom
                    of natural forces and the hallowed kingdom of moral laws, the impulse of
                    «aesthetic creation builds up a third kingdom unperceived, the gladsome kingdom
                    of play and show, wherein it emancipates man from all compulsion alike of
                    physical and of moral forces.” Schiller, the poet and enthusiast, thus making
                    his own application of the Kantian metaphysics, goes on to set forth how the
                    fine arts, or activities of play and show, are for him the typical, the ideal
                    activities of the race, since in them alone is it possible for man to put forth
                    his whole, that is his ideal self. “Only when he plays is man really and truly
                    man.” “Man ought only to play with the beautiful, and he ought to play with the
                    beautiful only.” “Education in taste and beauty has for its object to train up
                    in the utmost attainable harmony the whole sum of the powers both of sense and
                    spirit.” And the rest of Schiller’s argument is addressed to show how the
                    activities of artistic creation, once invented, quickly react upon other
                    departments of human life, how the exercise of the play impulse prepares men for
                    an existence in which the inevitable collision of the two other impulses shall
                    be softened or averted more and more. That harmony of the powers which clash so
                    violently in man’s primitive nature, having first been found possible in the
                    sphere of the fine arts, reflects itself, in his judgment, upon the whole
                    composition of man, and attunes him, as an aesthetic being, into new
                    capabilities for the conduct of his social existence.</p>
                <p>Our reasons for dwelling on this wide and enthusiastic formula of Schiller’s are
                    both its importance in the history of reflection—it produced, indeed, so great
                    an impression that it may still be called a formula almost classical—and its
                    positive value. The notion of a sphere of voluntary activity for the human
                    spirit, in which, under no compulsion of necessity or conscience, we order
                    matters as we like them apart from any practical end, seems at least
                    co-extensive with the widest conception of fine art and the fine arts. It
                    insists on and brings into the light the essential point of the free, or as we
                    have called it, the optional character of these activities, as distinguished
                    from others to which we are compelled by necessity or duty. It also insists on
                    and brings into the light what is no less essential, the fact that these
                    activities, superfluous as they are from the points of view of necessity and of
                    duty, spring nevertheless from an imperious and a saving instinct of our nature.
                    It does justice to the part which is, or at any rate may be, filled in the world
                    by pleasures which are apart from profit, and by delights for the enjoyment of
                    which men cannot quarrel. It claims the dignity they deserve for those shows and
                    pastimes in which we have found a way to make permanent all the transitory
                    delights of life and nature, to turn our very tears and yearnings, by their
                    artistic utterance, into sources of appeasing joy, to make amends to ourselves
                    for the confusion and imperfection of reality by conceiving and imaging forth
                    the semblances of things clearer and more complete, since in contriving them we
                    incorporate with the experiences we have had the better experiences we have
                    dreamed of and longed for.</p>
                <p>Schiller’s theory may thus be no explanation of the essential nature and place in
                    the universe of these activities and their results; it will certainly be none
                    for those to whom the Kantian doctrine of metaphysical opposition between the
                    senses and the reason has no meaning. Neither can his particular application of
                    that doctrine, with its terminology of <hi rend="italic">Stoff trieb,
                    Formtrieb,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Spieltrieb,</hi> the three impulses, or
                    impulsions, of Matter, Form, and Play, be considered altogether happy.
                    Nevertheless the theory furnishes us with a suggestive approach to a working
                    definition, and has remained a fruitful one for many minds independently of the
                    metaphysical doctrines upon which it was based. Its great fault is that, though
                    it asserts that man ought only to play with the beautiful, and that he is his
                    best or ideal self only when he does so, yet it does not sufficiently determine
                    what kinds of play are beautiful nor why we are moved to adopt them. It does not
                    sufficiently show how the delights of the eye and spirit in contemplating forms,
                    colours, and movements, of the ear and spirit in apprehending musical and verbal
                    sounds, or of the whole mind at once in following the comprehensive current of
                    images called up by poetry—it does not sufficiently show how delights like these
                    differ from those yielded by other kinds of play or pastime, and between them
                    make up the whole kingdom of artistic pleasures.</p>
                <p>The chase, for instance, is a play or pastime which gives scope for any amount of
                    premeditated skill; it has pleasures, for those who take part in it, which are
                    in some degree analogous to the pleasures of the artist; and we all know the
                    claims made on behalf of the noble art of venerie by the knights and woodmen of
                    Walter Scott’s romances. But here we must remember that, though the chase is
                    play to us, who in civilized communities follow it on no plea of necessity, yet
                    to a not remote ancestry it was earnest; in primitive societies hunting does not
                    belong to the class of optional activities at all, but is among the most
                    pressing of utilitarian needs. And this character of its origin and history
                    might exclude it from the class of fine arts, even if there were not the further
                    fact that the pleasures of the sportsman are the only pleasures arising from the
                    chase; his exertions afford pain to the victim, and no satisfaction to any class
                    of recipients but himself; or at least the pleasures of the bystanders at a meet
                    or a battue are hardly to be counted as pleasures of artistic contemplation.
                    Again, it may be said that such a theory does not sufficiently exclude from
                    among the fine arts the class of athletic games or sports, not connected with
                    the chase, though these do afford pleasure to multitudes, and most communities,
                    especially our own, are accustomed to devote to them much trained skill and a
                    large portion of their leisure activity. Here the difference is, that the event
                    which excites the spectator’s interest and pleasure at a race or athletic
                    contest is not a wholly unreal or simulated event; true, it is less real than
                    life, but it is more real than art. The contest has not, indeed, any momentous
                    practical consequences, but it is a contest in which competitors put forth real
                    strength, and one really wins, and others are defeated. Such a contest, in which
                    the exertions are real and the issue uncertain, we follow with an excitement and
                    an expectancy which are different in kind from the feelings with which we
                    contemplate any fictitious representation of which the issues aro arranged
                    beforehand. For example, let the reader recall the feelings with which he has
                    watched a real fencing bout, and compare them with those with which he watches
                    the simulated fencing bout in Hamlet. The instance is a crucial one, because the
                    simulated contest is made infinitely more exciting than such contests in general
                    by the introduction of the poisoned foil, and by the tremendous consequences
                    which we are aware will turn, in the representation, on the issue. Yet because
                    the fencing scene in Hamlet <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a representation, and not
                    real, we find ourselves <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0210-0201"/> watching it in a mood wholly different from that
                    in which we watch the most ordinary real fencing-match with vizors and blunt
                    foils; a mood much more exalted, if the representation is good, but amid the
                    aesthetic emotions of which those other fluctuations of direct, even if trivial,
                    excitement, of participation, approval, disappointment, suspense, eagerness,
                    find no place. Again, of athletics in general, they are pursuits to a
                    considerable degree definitely utilitarian, having for their specific end the
                    training and strengthening of the human body. Here, however, our argument
                    touches ground which is not free from debate; inasmuch as in some systems the
                    title of fine arts has been consistently claimed, if not for athletics
                    technically so-called, and involving the idea of competition and defeat, at any
                    rate for gymnastics, regarded simply as a display of the physical frame of man
                    cultivated by exercise—as, for instance, it was cultivated by the ancient
                    Greeks—to an ideal perfection of beauty and strength.</p>
                <p>Divesting the view of Schiller, then, of the Kantian metaphysic, and adding to it
                    those provisions on which, in the course of our argument, we have seen the
                    necessity of laying stress, we might put the matter thus. There are some things
                    which we do because we must; those are our necessities. There are other things
                    which we do because we ought; those are our duties. There are other things which
                    we do because we like; those are our play. <hi rend="italic">Among the various
                    kinds of things done by men only because they like, the fine arts are those of
                    which the results afford to many permanent and disinterested delight, and of
                    which the performance, calling for premeditated skill, is capable of regulation
                    up to a certain point, but, that point passed, has secrets beyond the reach and
                    a freedom beyond the restraint of rules.</hi> We believe that this definition or
                    description, avoiding barren controversy concerning the nature of beauty, will
                    be found both to state the limits of the group of undisputed fino arts, and to
                    enunciate some of its chief characteristics.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Of the Fine Arts severally.</hi></p>
                <p>Architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and poetry are by common consent the
                    five principal or greater fine arts.</p>
                <p>It is possible in thought to group these five arts in as many different orders as
                    there are among them different kinds of relation or affinity. One thinker fixes
                    his attention upon one kind of relations as the most important, and arranges his
                    group accordingly; another upon another; and each, when he has done so, is very
                    prone to claim for his arrangement the virtue of being the sole essentially and
                    fundamentally true. For example, we may ascertain one kind of relations between
                    the arts by inquiring which is the simplest or most limited in its effects,
                    which next simplest, which less simple still, which least simple or most complex
                    of them all. This, the relation of progressive complexity or comprehensiveness
                    between the fine arts, is the relation upon which an influential thinker of
                    recent times, Auguste Comte, has fixed his attention, and it yields in his
                    judgment the following order :—Architecture lowest in complexity, because both
                    of the kinds of effects which it produces, and the material conditionsand
                    limitations under which it works; sculpture next; painting third; then music;
                    and poetry highest, as the most complex or comprehensive art of all, both in its
                    own special effects and in its resources for ideally calling up the effects of
                    all the other arts, as well as all the phenomena of nature and experiences of
                    life. A somewhat similar grouping was adopted, though from the consideration of
                    a wholly different set of relations, by Hegel. Hegel fixed his attention on the
                    varying relations borne by the idea, or spiritual element, to the embodi ∙ ment
                    of the idea, or material element, in each art Leaving aside that part of his
                    doctrine which concerns, not the phenomena of the arts themselves, but their
                    place in the dialectical world-plan, or scheme of the universe—Hegel said in
                    effect something like this. In certain ages and among certain races, as in Egypt
                    and Assyria, and again in the Gothic age of Europe, mankind has only dim ideas
                    for art to express, ideas insufficiently disengaged and realized, of which the
                    expression cannot be complete or lucid, but only adumbrated and imperfect; the
                    characteristic art of those ages is a symbolic art, with its material element
                    predominating over and keeping down its spiritual, and such a symbolic art is
                    architecture. In other ages, as in the Greek age, the ideas of men have come to
                    be definite, disengaged, and clear; the characteristic art of such an age will
                    be one in which the spiritual and material elements are in equilibrium, and
                    neither predominates over or keeps down the other, but a perfectly distinct idea
                    is expressed in a perfectly adequate form; this is the mode of expression called
                    classic, and the classic art is sculpture. In other ages, again, and such are
                    the modern ages of Europe, the idea grows in power and becomes importunate; the
                    spiritual and material elements are no longer in equilibrium, but the spiritual
                    element predominates; the characteristic arts of such an age will be those in
                    which thought, passion, sentiment, aspiration, emotion, emerge in freedom,
                    dealing with material form as masters, or declining its shackles altogether;
                    this is the romantic mode of expression, and the romantic arts are painting,
                    music, and poetry. Next let us take another point of view, and turn our
                    attention, with one of the acutest of recent critics of aesthetic systems, Dr
                    Hermann Lotze, to the relative degrees of freedom or independence which the
                    several arts enjoy— their freedom, that is, from the necessity of either
                    imitating given facts of nature or ministering, as part of their task, to given
                    practical uses. In this grouping, instead of the order architecture, sculpture,
                    painting, music, poetry—music will come first, because it has neither to imitate
                    any natural facts nor to serve any practical end; architecture next, because
                    though it is tied to useful ends and material conditions, yet it is free from
                    the task of imitation, and pleases the eye in its degree, by pure form, light
                    and shade, and the rest, as music pleases the ear by pure sound; then, as arts
                    all tied to the task of imitation, sculpture, painting, and poetry, taken in
                    progressive order according to the progressing comprehensiveness of their
                    several resources.</p>
                <p>Again, besides the enumeration of the five greater fine arts, which is fixed, and
                    their classification, which is thus unfixed and variable, the thinker on these
                    subjects has to consider the enumeration and classification of the lesser or
                    subordinate fine arts. Whole clusters or families of these occur to the mind at
                    once; such as acting, an art auxiliary to poetry, but quite different in kind;
                    dancing, an art not auxiliary but subordinate to music, from which in kind it
                    differs no less; eloquence in all kinds, so far as it is studied and not merely
                    spontaneous; and among the arts which fashion or dispose material objects,
                    embroidery and the weaving of patterns, pottery, glassmaking, goldsmith’s work
                    and jewellery, joiner’s work, gardening, according to the claim of some, and a
                    score of other dexterities and industries which are more than mere dexterities
                    and industries because they add elements of beauty and pleasure to elements of
                    serviceableness and use. To decide whether any given one of these has a right to
                    the title of fine art, and if so, to which of the greater fine arts it should be
                    thought of as appended and subordinate, or between which two of them
                    intermediate, is often no easy task.</p>
                <p>The weak point of all classifications of the kind of which we have above given
                    examples is that each is intended to be final, and to serve instead of any
                    other. The truth is, that the relations between the several fine arts are much
                    too complex for any single classification to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0211-0202"/> bear this character. Every classification of the
                    fine arts must necessarily be provisional, according to the particular class of
                    relations which it keeps in view. And for practical purposes it is requisite to
                    bear in mind not one classification but several. Fixing our attention not upon
                    complicated or problematical relations between the various arts, but only upon
                    their simple and undisputed relations, and giving the first place in our
                    consideration to the five greater arts of architecture, sculpture, painting,
                    music, and poetry, we shall find at least three principal modes in which every
                    fine art either resembles or differs from the rest.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Shaping and the Speaking Arts.—</hi> Each art either
                    makes something, or does not make anything, that can be seen and handled. The
                    arts which make something that can be seen and handled are architecture,
                    sculpture, and painting. In the products or results of all these arts external
                    matter is in some way or another manually put together, fashioned, or disposed.
                    But music and poetry do not produce any results of this kind. What music
                    produces is something that can be heard, and what poetry produces, is something
                    that can be either heard or read—which last is a kind of ideal hearing, having
                    for its avenue the eye instead of the ear, and for its material, written signs
                    for words instead of the spoken words themselves. Now what the eye sees from any
                    one point of view, it sees all at once; in other words, the parts of anything we
                    see fill or occupy not time but space, and reach us from various points in space
                    at a single simultaneous perception. If we are at the proper distance we see at
                    one glance the whole height and breadth of a house from the ground to the
                    chimneys, the whole of a statue from head to foot, and in a picture at once <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> the foreground and background, and everything that is
                    within the four corners of the frame. On the other hand, the parts of anything
                    we hear, or, reading, can imagine that we hear, fill or occupy not space but
                    time, and reach us from various points in time through a continuous series of
                    perceptions, or, in the case of reading, of images raised by words in the mind.
                    We have to wait, in music, while one note follows another in a bar, and one bar
                    another in an air, and one air another in a movement; and in poetry, while one
                    line with its images follows another in a stanza, and one stanza another in a
                    canto, and so on. It is a convenient form of expressing both aspects of this
                    difference between the two groups of arts, to say that architecture, sculpture,
                    and painting are arts which give shape to things in space, or more briefly,
                    shaping arts; and music and poetry arts which give utterance to things in time,
                    or more briefly, speaking arts. These simple terms of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shaping</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> arts are not usual in
                    English; but they seem appropriate and clear, and we shall adopt them for
                    denoting the distinction we are now considering between the group that work in
                    space, architecture, sculpture, and painting, and the group that work in time,
                    music and poetry. (The distinction is best expressed in the German <hi
                    rend="italic">bildende</hi> and <hi rend="italic">redende Künste;</hi> for which
                    the words <hi rend="italic">manual</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vocal,</hi> or
                    else <hi rend="italic">formative,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plastic,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">rhetorical,</hi> are sometimes used, not too happily, in
                    English.) This is practically, if not logically, the most substantial and vital
                    distinction upon which a classification of the fine arts can be based. The arts
                    which surround us in space with stationary effects for the eye, as the house we
                    live in, the picture on the walls, the marble figure in the vestibule, are
                    stationary, hold a different kind of place in our experience—not a greater or a
                    higher place, but essentially a different place—from the arts which provide us
                    with transitory effects in time, effects capable of being awakened for the ear
                    or mind at any moment, as a symphony is awakened by playing and an ode by
                    reading, but lying in abeyance until we bid that moment come, and passing away
                    when the performance or the reading is over. Such, indeed, is Ehe practical
                    force of the distinction that in modern usage the expression <hi rend="italic"
                    >fine art,</hi> or even <hi rend="italic">art,</hi> is often used by itself in a
                    sense which tacitly excludes music and poetry, and signifies the group of manual
                    or shaping arts alone.</p>
                <p>As between any two of the five greater arts, the distinction on which we are now
                    dwelling is sharp and absolute. Buildings, statues, pictures, belong absolutely
                    to sight and space; to time and to hearing, real through the ear, or ideal
                    through the mind in reading, belong absolutely music and poetry. Among the
                    lesser or subordinate arts, however, there are several in which this distinction
                    finds no place, and which produce, in space and time at once, effects midway
                    between the stationary or stable, and the transitory or fleeting. Such, first of
                    all, is the dramatic art, in which the actor makes with his actions and
                    gestures, or several actors make with the combination of their different actions
                    and gestures, a kind of shifting picture, which appeals to the eyes of the
                    witnesses while the sung or spoken words of the drama appeal to their ears; thus
                    making of them spectators and auditors at once, and associating with the pure
                    time-art of words the mixed time-and-space art of bodily movements. As all <hi
                    rend="italic">movement</hi> whatsoever is necessarily movement through space,
                    and takes time to happen, so every other fine art which is wholly or in part an
                    art of movement partakes in like manner of this double character. Along with
                    acting thus comes dancing. Dancing, when it is of the mimic character, may
                    itself be a kind of acting, and is, whether apart from or in conjunction with
                    this mimic element, at any rate an art in which bodily movements obey,
                    accompany, and as it were accentuate in space the time effects of music.
                    Eloquence or oratory in like manner, so far as its power depends on studied and
                    premeditated gesture, is also an art which to some extent enforces its primary
                    appeal through the ear in time by a secondary appeal through the eye in space.
                    So much for the first distinction, that between the shaping or space-arts and
                    the speaking or time-arts, with the intermediate and subordinate class of arts
                    which, like acting, dancing, oratory, add to the pure time element a mixed
                    time-and-space element. These can hardly be called shaping arts, because it is
                    his own person, and not anything outside himself, which the actor, the dancer,
                    the orator disposes or adjusts; they may perhaps best be called arts of motion,
                    or moving arts. We must postpone further description of the functions of the
                    several fine arts until we have taken account of the second great principle of
                    classification among them, which is as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Imitative and the Non^imitative
                    Arts.—</hi> Each art either represents or imitates something, or does not
                    represent or imitate anything, which exists already in nature. Of the five
                    greater fine arts, those which thus represent objects existing in nature, are
                    sculpture, painting, and poetry. Those which do not represent anything so
                    existing are music and architecture. So that on this principle we get a
                    different grouping from that which we got on the principle last explained. Two
                    space-arts and one time-art now form the imitative group of sculpture, painting,
                    and poetry; while one space-art and one time-art form the non-imitative group of
                    music and architecture. The mixed space-and-time arts of the actor, and of the
                    dancer so far as he or she is also a mimic, belong of course, by their very name
                    and nature, to the imitative class.</p>
                <p>It was this imitative character of the arts which chiefly occupied the attention
                    of Aristotle. But Aristotle had not realized that there existed, along with the
                    great group of imitative arts, another group strictly non-imitative. In his mind
                    the idea of imitation or representation (mimesis) was extended so as to denote
                    the expressing, uttering, or making manifest of anything whatever. Music and
                    dancing, by which utterance or expression is given to emotions that may be quite
                    detached from all definite ideas or images, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n212/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0212-0203"/> are thus for him varieties of imitation. He says,
                    indeed, <hi rend="italic">most</hi> music and dancing, as if he was aware that
                    there were exceptions, but he does not indicate what the exceptions are; and
                    under the head of imitative music, he distinctly reckons some kinds of
                    instrumental music without words. But in our own more precise usage, to imitate
                    is necessarily to imitate some individual thing, some definite reality of
                    experience; and we can only call those imitative arts which tell us of such
                    things, either by showing us their actual likeness, as sculpture does in solid
                    form, and as painting does by means of lines and colours on a plane surface, or
                    else by calling up ideas or images of them in the mind, as poetry and literature
                    do by means of words. It is by a stretch of ordinary usage that we apply the
                    word imitation even to this last way of representing things; since words are no
                    true likeness of, but only arbitrary signs for, the thing they represent. And
                    those arts we cannot call imitative at all which by indefinite utterance or
                    expression produce in us emotions unattended by the recognizable likeness, idea,
                    or image of anything.</p>
                <p>Now the emotions of music, when music goes along with words, whether in the shape
                    of actual song, or even of the instrumental accompaniment of song, are no doubt
                    in a certain sense attended with definite ideas. But the ideas then in question
                    are the ideas expressed by the words themselves; and the same ideas would be
                    conveyed to the mind equally well by the same words if they were not sung or
                    accompanied, but simply spoken. What the music contributes is a special element
                    of its own, an element of pure emotion which heightens the effect of the words
                    upon the feelings, without in the least helping to elucidate them for the
                    understanding. Nay, it is well known that a song produces its intended effect
                    upon the feelings almost as well though we fail to catch the words or are
                    ignorant of the language to which they belong. Thus the view of Aristotle cannot
                    be defended on the ground that he was familiar with music only in an elementary
                    form, and principally as the direct accompaniment of words, and that in his day
                    the modern development of the art, as an art for building up immense
                    constructions of independent sound, glorious and intricate fabrics of melody and
                    harmony detached from words, was a thing neither imagined nor imaginable. That
                    is perfectly true; but the essential character of musical sound is the same in
                    its most elementary as in its most complicated stage. Its privilege is to give
                    delight, not by communicating definite ideas, or calling up particular images,
                    but by expressing on the one part, and arousing on the other, a unique kind of
                    emotion. The emotion caused by music may be altogether independent of any ideas
                    conveyable by words. Or it may serve to intensify and enforce other emotions
                    arising at the same time in connexion with the ideas conveyed by words; and a
                    distinguished composer and energetic musical reformer of our own day insists
                    that in the former phase the art is now exhausted, and that only in the latter
                    are new conquests in store for it. But in either case the music is the music,
                    and <hi rend="italic">is like nothing else;</hi> it is no representation or
                    similitude of anything whatsoever.</p>
                <p>But does not instrumental music really, it may be urged, sometimes imitate the
                    sounds of nature, as the piping of birds, the whispering of woods, the moaning
                    of storms, or very explosion of the thunder; or does it not at any rate suggest
                    these things by resemblances so close that they almost amount to imitation!
                    Occasionally, it is true, music does allow itself these playful excursions into
                    a region of quasi-imitation or mimicry, It modifies the character of its
                    abstract sounds into something, so to speak, more concrete, and, instead of
                    sensations which are like nothing else, affords us sensations which recognizably
                    resemble those we receive from some of the sounds of nature. But such excursions
                    are hazardous, and to make them often is the surest proof of vulgarity in a
                    musician. Neither are those effects of the great composers in accompanying the
                    verbal descriptions of natural phenomena, which we recognize as most appropriate
                    to the phenomena described, generally in the nature of real imitations or
                    representations of them. The notes of the dove and nightingale in Haydn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Creation</hi> must be acknowledged to be instances of true though
                    highly idealized imitation; but in such other instances of direct, obvious, and
                    suggestive appropriateness of the music to the words as even the “Hailstone”
                    chorus and the “Darkness” chorus of the <hi rend="italic">Israel in Egypt,</hi>
                    the music in no true sense imitates the phenomena, or <hi rend="italic">shows us
                    how</hi> fire mingled with the hail ran along upon the ground, or how there came
                    over all the land of Egypt thick darkness—even a darkness which might be felt.
                    Again, it is an acknowledged fact concerning the operation of instrumental music
                    on its hearers, that all hearers will finxi themselves in tolerable agreement as
                    to the meaning of any passage so long as they only attempt to describe it in
                    terms of vague emotion, and to say, such and such a passage expresses, as the
                    case may be, dejection or triumph, effort or the relaxation of effort, eagerness
                    or languor, suspense or fruition, anguish or glee. But their agreement comes to
                    an end the moment they begin to associate, in their interpretation, definite
                    ideas with these vague emotions; then we find that what suggests in idea to one
                    hearer the vicissitudes of war will suggest to another, or to the same at
                    another time, the vicissitudes of love, to another those of spiritual yearning
                    and aspiration, to another, it may be, those of changeful travel by forest,
                    champaign, and ocean, to another those of life’s practical struggle and
                    ambition. The infinite variety of the ideas which may thus be called up in
                    different minds by the same strain of music is proof enough that the music is
                    not like any particular thing. The torrent of entrancing emotion which it pours
                    along the heart, emotion latent and undivined until the spell of sound begins,
                    that is music’s achievement and its secret; the ideas which may spring up in
                    attendance on the emotion are no more than as the rainbow colours which come and
                    go in the torrent spray.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps hardly necessary to add, that the latest physiological explanation
                    of the source of -music’s power within us in no way shakes or interferes with
                    this fundamental character of the art. According to that explanation, the charm
                    of musical sounds depends on susceptibilities which have gone on accumulating in
                    the fibres of the human constitution, by hereditary transmission through
                    uncounted generations, ever since our brute progenitors found favour with their
                    mates by wooing them (as other brutes are known to woo theirs now) with
                    love-cries which in their regulated time and pitch contained the rudimentary
                    elements of music. If this explanation is true, that does not of course mean
                    that the musical utterance of to-day is any copy or imitation of those
                    aboriginal love-cries; only that it is an infinitely complex and remote
                    development of faculties which had in them their earliest exercise.</p>
                <p>Aristotle endeavoured to frame a classification of the arts, in their several
                    applications and developments, on two grounds—the nature of the objects imitated
                    by each, and the means or instruments employed in the imitation. But in the case
                    of music the first part of this endeavour falls to the ground, because the
                    object imitated has, in truth, no existence. The means employed by music are
                    successions and combinations of vocal or instrumental sounds regulated according
                    to the three conditions of time or interval, tone or pitch (which together make
                    up melody), and harmony, or the relations of different strains of time and tone
                    coopérant but not parallel. With these means, music either creates her
                    independent constructions, or else accompanies, adorns, enforces, the imitative
                    art of speech—but herself imitates not; and may best be defined simply as <hi
                    rend="italic">a speaking</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n213/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0213-0204"/><hi rend="italic">art, of which the business is to
                    utter and arouse emotion by successions and combinations of regulated
                    sound.</hi></p>
                <p>That which music is thus among the speaking or time-arts, architecture is among
                    the shaping or space-arts. As music appeals to our faculties for taking pleasure
                    in non-imitative combinations of transitory sound, so architecture appeals to
                    our faculties for taking pleasure in non-imitative combinations of stationary
                    mass. Corresponding to the system of ear-effects or combinations of time, tone,
                    and harmony with which music works, architecture works with a system of
                    eye-effects or combinations of line, light and shade, colour, proportion,
                    interval, alternation of plane and decorated parts, regularity and variety in
                    regularity, apparent stability, vastness, appropriateness, and the rest. Such
                    pleasures of the eye and ear, depending on abstract relations of sounds in time
                    and sights in space, and not all on concrete imitation, are one half of those
                    disinterested pleasures of which we are capable, and which the play-impulse
                    within us finds out and turns to account. Only, the materials of architecture
                    are not volatile and intangible like sound, but solid brick, stone, metal, and
                    mortar, and the laws of weight and force according to which these materials have
                    to be combined are much more severe and cramping than the laws of melody and
                    harmony which regulate the combinations of music. The architect is further
                    subject up to a certain point, which the musician is not, to the dictates and
                    precise prescriptions of utility. Hence the effects of architecture are
                    necessarily less full of various, rapturous, and unforeseen enchantment than the
                    effects of music. Yet for those who possess sensibility (which many persons
                    without knowing it completely lack) to the pleasures of the eye and the
                    perfections of shaping art, the architecture of the great ages has yielded
                    combinations which, so far as comparison is permissible between things unlike in
                    their materials, fall no whit short of the achievements of music in those kinds
                    of excellence which are common to them both. Thus in the virtues of lucidity, of
                    just proportion and organic interdependence of the several parts or members, in
                    exquisite subtlety of their mutual relations, and of the transitions from one
                    part or member to another, in consummate purity and consummate finish of
                    individual forms, in the character of one thing growing naturally out of another
                    and everything serving to complete the whole—in all these qualities, no musical
                    combination can surpass a typical Doric temple such as the Hecatompedon at
                    Athens. None, again, can surpass the great cathedrals of the Middle Age in the
                    qualities of sublimity, of complexity, in the power both of expressing and
                    suggesting spiritual aspiration, in the invention of intricate developments and
                    ramifications about a central plan, in the union of greatness and majesty in the
                    main conception with inexhaustible fertility of adornment in detail. In
                    fancifulness, in the unexpected, in capricious opulence and far-sought
                    splendour, in filling the mind with mingled enchantments of East and West and
                    South and North, none can surpass a building like St Mark’s at Venice, with its
                    blending of Byzantine elements, Italian elements, Gothic elements, each carried
                    to the utmost pitch of elaboration and each enriched with a hundred caprices of
                    ornament, but all working together, all in obedience to a law, and “all
                    beginning and ending with the Cross.” It would be tempting to carry further, and
                    into more particular applications, the parallel between the space-effects of
                    architecture and the time-effects of music. But we must be content with having
                    indicated it here. It is no fanciful similitude, but constitutes, so to speak,
                    the positive aspect of that affinity between music and architecture, of which we
                    bring forward the negative aspect only when we separate these two arts, as being
                    non-imitative, from the imitative arts of sculpture, painting, and poetry.</p>
                <p>In the case of architecture, however, as in the case of music, this non-imitative
                    character must not be stated quite without exception or reserve. There have been
                    styles of architecture in which forms suggesting or imitating natural or other
                    phenomena have held a place among the abstract forms proper to the art. Often
                    the mode of such suggestions is rather symbolical to the mind than really
                    imitative to the eye; as when the number and relations of the heavenly planets
                    were imaged in the seven concentric walls of their great temple, and in many
                    other architectural constructions, by that race of astronomers the Babylonians;
                    or as when the shape of the cross was adopted, with innumerable slight varieties
                    and modifications, for the ground plan of the churches of Christendom. Passing
                    to examples of imitation more properly so-called, it may be true, and was at any
                    rate long believed, that the aisles of Gothic churches had reference to or were
                    inspired by the aspect of the natural forest aisles amid which they rose, and
                    that the upsoaring forest trunks and meeting branches were imaged in their piers
                    and vaultings. In the temple-palaces of Egypt, one of the regular architectural
                    members, the sustaining pier, is often systematically wrought in the actual
                    likeness of a conventionalized cluster of lotus stems, with lotus flowers for
                    the capitals. When we come to the fashion, not rare in Greek architecture, of
                    carving this same sustaining member, the column, in complete human likeness, and
                    employing Caryatids, Canephori, Atlases, or the like, to carry the architrave of
                    a building, it then becomes difficult to say whether we have to do with the work
                    of architecture or of sculpture. The case, at any rate, is different from that
                    in which the sculptor is called in to supply surface decoration to the various
                    members of a building, or to fill with the products of his own art spaces in the
                    building specially contrived and left vacant for that purpose. When the
                    imitative feature is in itself an indispensable member of the architectural
                    construction, to architecture rather than sculpture (not that such niceties of
                    appropriation are important) we shall probably do best to assign it. Defining
                    architecture, then (apart from its utility, which for the present we leave out
                    of consideration), as <hi rend="italic">a shaping art, of which the function is
                    to arouse emotion by combinations of ordered and decorated mass,</hi> we pass
                    from the characteristics of the non-imitative to those of the imitative group of
                    arts.</p>
                <p>The second half of the disinterested pleasures of which we are capable, and which
                    the play impulse finds out and turns to account in us, are the pleasures
                    afforded by imitation, that is, by the showing of shows or the telling of
                    stories which bring before us things like what we know in reality. In the
                    consideration of the arts which minister to these pleasures, we cannot do better
                    than follow that Aristotelian division to which we have already alluded, and
                    which describes each art according, first, to the objects it imitates, and
                    secondly, to the means or instruments it employs.</p>
                <p>Sculpture, then, may have for its objects of imitation the shapes of whatever
                    things possess length, breadth, and magnitude. For its means or instruments it
                    has solid form, which the sculptor either carves out of a hard substance, as in
                    the case of wood and stone, or models in a yielding substance, as in the case of
                    clay and wax, or casts in a dissolved or molten substance, as in the case of
                    plaster and of metal in certain uses, or beats, draws, or chases in a malleable
                    and ductile substance, as in the case of metal in other uses, or stamps from
                    dies or moulds, a method sometimes used in all soft or fusible materials. Thus a
                    statue or statuette may either be carved straight out of a block of stone or
                    wood, or first modelled in clay or wax, then moulded in plaster or some
                    equivalent material, and then carved in stone or cast in bronze. A gem is
                    wrought in stone by cutting and grinding. Figures in jeweller’s work <pb

                    by beating and chasing or else by stamping from a die; a coin by stamping from a
                    die; and so forth. The process of modelling (Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >πλaττeιγ)</hi> in a soft substance being regarded as the typical process of the
                    sculptor, the name <hi rend="italic">plastic art</hi> has beeu given to his
                    operations in general.</p>
                <p>In general terms, the task of sculpture is to imitate solid form witlι solid
                    form. But sculptured form may be either completely or incompletely solid.
                    Sculpture in completely solid form exactly reproduces, whether on the original
                    or on a different scale, the relations or proportions of the object imitated in
                    the three dimensions of length, breadth, and depth or thickness. Sculpture in
                    incompletely solid form reproduces the proportions of the objects with exactness
                    only so far as concerns two of its dimensions, namely those of length and
                    breadth; while the third dimension, that of depth or thickness, it reproduces in
                    a diminished proportion, leaving it to the eye to infer, from the partial degree
                    of projection given to the work, the full projection of the object imitated. The
                    former, or completely solid kind of sculpture, is called sculpture in the round;
                    its works stand free, and can be walked round and seen from all points. The
                    latter, or incompletely solid kind of sculpture, is called sculpture in relief;
                    its works do not stand free, but are engaged in or attached to a background, and
                    can only be seen from in front. According, in the latter kind of sculpture, to
                    its degree of projection from the background, a work is said to be in high or in
                    low relief. Sculpture in the round and sculpture in relief are alike in this,
                    that the properties of objects which they imitate are their outlines, or the
                    boundaries and circumscriptions of their masses, and their light and shade—the
                    lights and shadows, that is, which diversify the curved surfaces of the masses
                    in consequence of their alternations and gradations of projection and recession.
                    But the two kinds of sculpture differ in this. A work of sculpture in the round
                    imitates the whole of the outlines of any given object, and presents to the eye,
                    as the object itself would do, a new outline succeeding the last every moment as
                    you walk round it. Whereas a work of sculpture in relief imitates only one
                    outline of any object; it takes, so to speak, a section of the object as seen
                    from a particular point, and traces on the background the boundary-line of that
                    particular section; merely suggesting, by modelling the surface within such
                    boundary according to a regular, but a diminished, ratio of projection, the
                    other outlines which the object would present if seen from all sides
                    successively.</p>
                <p>As sculpture in the round reproduces the real relations of a solid object in
                    space, it follows that the only kind of object which it can reproduce with
                    pleasurable effect must be one not too vast or complicated, one that can afford
                    to be detached and isolated from its surroundings, and of which all the parts
                    can easily be perceived and apprehended in their organic relations. Further, it
                    will need to be an object interesting enough to mankind in general to make them
                    take delight in seeing it reproduced with all its parts in complete imitation.
                    And again, it must be such that some considerable part of the interest lies in
                    those particular properties of outline and light and shade which it is the
                    special function of sculpture to reproduce. Thus a sculptured representation in
                    the round, say, of a mountain with cities on it, would hardly be a sculpture at
                    all; it could only be a model, and as a model might have value; but value as a
                    work of fine art it could not have, because the object imitated would lack
                    organic definiteness and completeness; it would lack universality of interest,
                    and of the interest which it did possess, a very inconsiderable part indeed
                    would depend upon its properties of outline and light and shade. Obviously there
                    is no kind of object in the world that so well unites the required conditions
                    for pleasurable imitation in sculpture as the human body. It is at once the most
                    complete of organisms, and the shape of all others the most subtle as well as
                    the most intelligible in its outlines; the most habitually detached in active or
                    stationary freedom; the most interesting to mankind, because its own; the
                    richest in those particular effects, contours and modulations, contrasts,
                    harmonies, and transitions of modelled surface and circumscribing line, which it
                    is the prerogative of sculpture to imitate. Accordingly the object of imitation
                    for this art is pre-eminently the body of man or woman. That it has not been for
                    the sake of representing men and women as such, but for the sake of representing
                    gods in the likeness of men and women, that the human form has been most
                    enthusiastically studied, does not affect this fact in the theory of the art,
                    though it is a consideration of great importance in its history. Besides the
                    human form, sculpture may imitate the forms of those of the lower animals whose
                    physical endowments have something of a kindred perfection, with other natural
                    or artificial objects as may be needed merely by way of accessory or symbol. The
                    body must for the purposes of this art be divested of covering, or covered only
                    with such tissues as reveal, translate, or play about without concealing it.
                    Only in lands and ages where climate and social use have given the sculptor the
                    opportunity of studying human forms so draped or undraped has this art attained
                    perfection, or become exemplary and enviable to that of other races.</p>
                <p>Relief sculpture is more closely connected with architecture than the other kind,
                    and indeed is commonly used in subordination to it. But if its task is thus
                    somewhat different from that of sculpture in the round, its principal objects of
                    imitation are the same. The human body remains the principal theme of the
                    sculptor in relief; but the nature of his art allows, and sometimes compels, him
                    to include other objects in the range of his imitation. As he has not to
                    represent the real depth or projection of things, but only to suggest them
                    according to a ratio which ho may fix himself, so he can introduce into the
                    third or depth dimension, thus arbitrarily reduced, a multitude of objects for
                    which the sculptor in the round, having to observe the real ratio of the three
                    dimensions, has no room. He can place one figure in slightly raised outline
                    emerging from behind the more fully raised outline of another, and by the same
                    system can add to his representation rocks, trees, nay mountains and cities, and
                    birds on the wing.</p>
                <p>But the more he uses this liberty, the less will he be truly a sculptor. Solid
                    modelling, and real light and shade, are the special means or instruments of
                    effect which the sculptor alone among imitative artists enjoys. Single outlines
                    and contours, the choice of one particular section and the tracing of its
                    circumscription, are means which the sculptor enjoys in common with the painter
                    or draughtsman. And indeed, when we consider works executed wholly or in part in
                    very low relief, whether Assyrian battle-pieces and hunting pieces in alabaster
                    or bronze, or the backgrounds carved in bronze, marble, or wood by the Italian
                    sculptors who followed the example set by Ghiberti at the Renaissance, we shall
                    see that the principle of such work is not the principle of sculpture at all.
                    Its effect depends not at all on qualities of surface-light and shadow, but
                    exclusively on qualities of contour, as traced by a slight line of shadow on the
                    side away from the light, and a slight line of light on the side next to it. And
                    we may fairly hesitate whether we shall rank the artist who works on this
                    principle, which is properly a <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> rather than a <hi
                    rend="italic">plastic</hi> principle, among sculptors or among draughtsmen. The
                    above are cases in which the relief sculptor exercises his liberty in the
                    introduction of other objects besides human figures into his sculptured
                    compositions. But there is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n215/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0215-0206"/> another kind of relief sculpture în which the
                    artist has less choice. That is the kind in which the sculptor is called in to
                    decorate with carved work parts of an architectural construction which are not
                    adapted for the introduction of figure subjects, or for their introduction only
                    as features în a scheme of ornament that comprises many other elements. To this
                    head belongs most of the carving of capitals, mouldings, friezes (except the
                    friezes of Greek temples), bands, cornices, and in the Gothic style, of doorway
                    arches, niches, canopies, pinnacles, brackets, spandrils, and the thousand
                    members and parts of members which that style so exquisitely adorned with true
                    or conventionalized imitations of natural forms. This is no doubt a subordinate
                    function of the art; and it is impossible, as we have seen already, to find a
                    precise line of demarcation between carving, in this decorative use, which is
                    properly sculpture, and that which belongs properly to architecture.</p>
                <p>Leaving such discussions, we may content ourselves with the definition of
                    sculpture as <hi rend="italic">a shaping art, of which the business is to
                    imitate natural objects, and principally the human body, by reproducing in solid
                    form either their true proportions in all dimensions, or else their true
                    proportions in the two dimensions of length and breadth only, with a diminished
                    proportion in the third dimension of depth or thickness.</hi></p>
                <p>In considering bas-relief as a form of sculpture, we have found ourselves
                    approaching the confines of the second of the shaping-imitative arts, the
                    graphic art, or art of painting. Painting, as to its means or instruments of
                    imitation, dispenses with the third dimension altogether. It imitates natural
                    objects by representing them as they are represented on the retina of the eye
                    itself, simply as an assemblage of lines and colours on a flat surface. The
                    character and disposition of the lines and colours in painting are determined by
                    two things, the local colours of the objects themselves, and their shapes and
                    positions in space. Painting does not reproduce the third dimension of reality
                    by any third dimension of its own whatever; but leaves the eye to infer the
                    solidity, the recession and projection, the nearness and remoteness of objects,
                    by the same perspective signs by which it also infers those facts in
                    nature—namely, by the direction of their several boundary lines, the incidence
                    and distribution of their lights and shadows, the strength or faintness of their
                    tones of colour. Hence this art has an infinitely greater range and freedom than
                    any form of sculpture. Near and far is all the same to it, and whatever comes
                    into the field of vision can come also into the field of a picture; trees as
                    well as personages, and clouds as well as trees, and stars as well as clouds;
                    and on earth the remotest mountain snows as well as the violet of the
                    foreground, and far-off multitudes of people as well as one or two near the eye.
                    Whatever any man has seen, or can imagine himself as seeing, that he can also
                    fix by painting, subject only to one great limitation,—that of the range of
                    brightness which he is able to attain in imitating natural colour illuminated by
                    light. In this particular his art can but correspond according to a greatly
                    diminished ratio with the effects of nature. But excepting this it can do for
                    the eye almost all that nature herself does; or at least all that nature would
                    do if man had only one eye; since the three dimensions of space produce upon our
                    binocular machinery of vision a particular stereoscopic effect of which a
                    picture, with its two dimensions only, is incapable. The range of the art being
                    thus almost unbounded, its selections have naturally been dictated by the
                    varying interest felt in this or that subject of representation by the societies
                    among whom the art has at various times been practised. As in sculpture, so in
                    painting, man, whether as figuring God, or for the sake of his own looks and
                    doings, has always held the first place.</p>
                <p>For the painter, the intervention of costume between man and his environment is
                    not a misfortune in the same degree as it is for the sculptor. For him, clothes
                    of whatever fashion or density have their own charm; they serve to diversify the
                    aspect of the world, and to express the characters and stations, if not the
                    physical frames, of his personages; and he is as happy or happier among the
                    brocades of Venice as among the bare limbs of the Spartan palaestra. Along with
                    man, there come into painting all animals and vegetation, all man’s furniture
                    and belongings, his dwellingplaces, fields, and landscape; and in modern times
                    also landscape and nature for their own sakes, skies, seas, mountains, and
                    wildernesses apart from man.</p>
                <p>Besides the two questions about any art, what objects does it imitate, and by the
                    use of what means or instruments, Aristotle proposes (in the case of poetry) the
                    further question, which of several possible forms does the imitation in any
                    given case assume! We may transfer very nearly the same inquiry to painting, and
                    may ask, concerning any painter, according to which of three possible systems he
                    works. The three possible systems are (1) that which attends principally to the
                    configuration and relations of natural objects as indicated by their
                    circumscribing lines— this may be called for short the system of line; ∙(2) that
                    which attends chiefly to their configuration and relations, as indicated by the
                    incidence and distribution of their lights and shadows—this may be called the
                    system of light-and-shade; and (3) that which attends chiefly, not to their
                    configuration at all, but to the distribution, qualities, and relations of
                    colours upon their surface—this is the system of colour. Line, light-and-shade,
                    and colour, these three kinds of appearances between them make up the whole
                    world of sight. (We do not pause to insist on the fact that line is in truth
                    partly an invention of the mind; those divisions between objects which the
                    painter or draughtsman indicates with an outline or dark marking being in nature
                    only indicated by the even edge where one colour ends and another begins.) It is
                    not possible for a painter to imitate natural objects to the eye at all without
                    either defining their masses by outlines, or suggesting them by juxtapositions
                    of light and dark or of local colours. In the complete art of painting, of
                    course, all three methods are employed at once. But in what is known as outline
                    drawing and outline engraving, one of the three methods only is employed, line;
                    in <hi rend="italic">grisaille</hi> pictures, and in shaded drawings and
                    engravings, two only, line with light-and-shade; and in the shadowless pictures
                    of the early religious schools, a different two only, line with colour. And even
                    in the most accomplished examples of the complete art of painting, as has been
                    justly pointed out by Professor Ruskin, we find that there almost always
                    prevails a predilection for some one of these three parts of painting over the
                    other two. Thus among the mature Italians of the Renaissance, Titian is above
                    all things a painter in colour, Michelangelo in line, and Leonardo in
                    light-and-shade,</p>
                <p>The value of a pictorial imitation is by no means necessarily in proportion to
                    its completeness. Many accomplished pictures, in which all the resources of
                    line, colour, and light-and-shade have been used to the uttermost of the
                    artist’s power for the imitation of all that he could see in nature, are
                    worthless in comparison with a few faintly-touched outlines or lightly-laid
                    shadows or tints of another artist who could see nature better. The fine art of
                    painting addresses not merely the eye but the imagination. Unless the painter
                    knows how to choose and combine the elements of his finished work so that it
                    shall contain in every part suggestions and delights over and above the mere
                    imitation, it will fall short, in that which is the essential charm of fine art,
                    not only of any scrap of a great master’s handiwork, such as an outline sketch
                    of a child by Raphael, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0216-0207"/> or a colour sketch of α boat or a mackerel by
                    Turner, but even of any scrap of the merest journeyman’s handiwork produced by
                    an artistic race, such as the first Japanese drawing for children in which a
                    water-flag and kingfisher, or a spray of peach or almond blossom across the sky,
                    is dashed in with a mere hint of colour, but a hint that tells a whole tale to
                    the imagination. This, however, is an order of considerations belonging rather
                    to particular criticism than to general classification.</p>
                <p>It remains to consider, for the purposes of our classification, what are the
                    technical varieties of the painter’s craft. Since we gave the generic name of
                    painting to all imitation of natural objects by the assemblage of lines,
                    colours, and lights and darks on a single plane, we most include as varieties of
                    painting, not only the ordinary crafts of spreading or laying pictures on an
                    opaque surface in fresco, oil, or water-colour, but also the craft of arranging
                    a picture to be seen by the transmission of light through a transparent
                    substance, in glass painting; the craft of fitting together a multitude of solid
                    cubes or cylinders so that their united surface forms a picture to the eye, in
                    mosaic; the craft of spreading vitreous colours in a state of fusion so that
                    they form a picture when hardened, as in enamel; and even, it would seem, the
                    crafts of tapestry and embroidery, since these also yield to the eye a plane
                    surface figured in imitation of nature. As drawing we must also count incised or
                    engraved work of all kinds representing merely the outlines of objects and not
                    their modellings, as for instance the mythological subjects incised upon the
                    bronze mirrors and dressing cases of Etruscan ladies; while raised work in low
                    relief, in which outlines are plainly marked and modellings neglected,
                    furnishes, as we have seen, a doubtful class between sculpture and painting. In
                    all figures that are first modelled in the solid and then variously coloured,
                    sculpture and painting bear a common part; as for instance when the sculptor
                    Praxiteles handed his finished statue to the painter Nicias to receive its <hi
                    rend="italic">circumlitio</hi> or tinting. But as the special characteristic of
                    sculpture, the third dimension, is here present, it is to that art and not to
                    painting that we shall still ascribe the resulting work. The system of more or
                    less highly colouring stone statues, that is, of <hi rend="italic">painting
                    sculpture,</hi> which the moderns have disused, prevailed alike in the Greek and
                    Gothic ages; and solid form and local colour have been similarly combined in the
                    productions of pottery in all ages, from those of Corinth and Tanagra down to
                    those of Dresden and Sèvres.</p>
                <p>With these indications, which the reader can easily follow up for himself, we may
                    leave the art of painting defined in general terms as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >shaping art, of which the business is to imitate all kinds of natural objects
                    by reproducing on a plane surface the relations of their boundary lines, lights
                    and shadows, or colours, or all three of these appearances together.</hi></p>
                <p>The next and last of the imitative arts is the speaking art of poetry. The
                    transition from sculpture and painting to poetry is, from the point of view not
                    of our present but of our first division among the fine arts, abrupt and
                    absolute. It is a transition from space into time, from the sphere of material
                    forms to the sphere of immaterial images. This is not the place for any detailed
                    exposition of the principles of poetry. But for the sake of the due
                    co-ordination of this art in our general scheme, we are bound as briefly as we
                    can to state its functions among the rest. In so doing we will again adopt the
                    several heads of description with which the reader is already familiar from
                    Aristotle, The objects of poetry’s imitation, then, we shall define as
                    everything of which the idea or image can be called up by words, that is, every
                    force and phenomenon of nature, every operation and result of art, every fact of
                    life and history, or every imagination of such a fact, every thought and feeling
                    of the human spirit, for which mankind in the course of its long evolution has
                    been able to create in speech an explicit and appropriate sign. The means or
                    instruments of poetry’s imitation are these verbal signs or words, arranged in
                    lines, strophes, or stanzas, so that their sounds have some of the regulated
                    qualities of music. The three chief modes or forms of the imitation may still be
                    defined as they were defined by Aristotle himself. First comes the epic or
                    narrative form, in which the poet speaks alternately for himself and his
                    characters, now describing their situations and feelings in his own words, and
                    anon making each of them speak in the first person for himself. Second comes the
                    lyric form, in which the poet speaks in his own name exclusively, and gives
                    expression to sentiments which are purely personal. Third comes the dramatic
                    form, in which the poet does not speak for himself at all, but only puts into
                    the mouths of each of his personages successively such discourse as he thinks
                    appropriate to the part. The last of these three forms of poetry, the dramatic,
                    calls, if it is merely read, on the imagination of the reader to fill up those
                    circumstances of situation, action, and the rest, which in the first or epic
                    form are supplied by the narrative between the speeches, and for which in the
                    lyric or personal form there is no occasion. To avoid making this call upon the
                    imagination, to bring home its effects in full reality, dramatic poetry has to
                    call in the aid of several subordinate arts, the shaping or space art of the
                    scene-painter, the mixed time and space arts of the actor and the dancer.
                    Occasionally also, or in the case of opera throughout, dramatic poetry heightens
                    the emotional effect of its words with music. A play or drama is thus, as per
                    formed upon the theatre, not a poem merely, but a poem accompanied, interpreted,
                    completed, and brought several degrees nearer to reality by a combination of
                    auxiliary effects of the other arts. Besides the narrative, the lyric, and
                    dramatic forms of poetry, the didactic, that is, the teaching or expository
                    form, has usually been recognized as a fourth. Aristotle refused so to recognize
                    it, regarding a didactic poem in the light not so much of a poem as of a
                    treatise. But from the <hi rend="italic">Works and Days</hi> down to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Loves of the Plants</hi> there has been too much literature
                    produced in this form for us to follow Aristotle here. We shall do better to
                    regard didactic poetry as a variety corresponding, among the speaking arts, to
                    architecture and the other manual arts of which the first purpose is use, but
                    which are capable of accompanying and adorning use by a pleasurable appeal to
                    the emotions.</p>
                <p>We shall hardly make our definition of poetry, considered as an imitative art,
                    too extended if we say that it is <hi rend="italic">a speaking art, of which the
                    business is to represent by means of verbal signs arranged with musical
                    regularity everything for which verbal signs have been invented.</hi></p>
                <p>Neither the varieties of poetical form, however, nor the modes in which the
                    several forms have been mixed up and interchanged—as such mixture and
                    interchange are implied, for instance, by the very title of a group of Mr
                    Browning’s poems, the <hi rend="italic">Dramatic Lyrics,—</hi> the observation
                    of neither of these things concerns us here so much as the observation of the
                    relations of poetry in general, as an art of representation or imitation, to the
                    other arts of imitation, painting and sculpture.</p>
                <p>Verbal signs have been invented for innumerable things which cannot be imitated
                    or represented at all either in solid form or upon a coloured surface. You
                    cannot carve or paint a sigh, or the feeling which finds utterance in a sigh;
                    you can only suggest the idea of the feeling, and that in a somewhat imperfect
                    and uncertain way, by representing the physical aspect of a person in the act of
                    breathing the sigh. Similarly you cannot carve or paint any movement, but only
                    figures or groups in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n217/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0217-0208"/> which the movement is represented as arrested in
                    some particular point of time; nor any abstract idea, but only figures or groups
                    in which the abstract idea, as for example release, captivity, mercy, is
                    illustrated in the concrete shape of allegory. The whole field of thought, of
                    propositions, arguments, injunctions, and exhortations, is open to poetry but
                    closed to sculpture and painting. Poetry, by its command over the regions of the
                    understanding, of abstraction, of the movement and succession of things in time,
                    by its power of instantaneously associating one delightful image with another
                    from the remotest regions of the mind, by its names for every shade of feeling
                    and experience, exercises a sovereignty a hundred times more extended than that
                    of either of the two arts of manual imitation. But on the other hand, words do
                    not as a rule bear any sensible resemblance to the things of which they are the
                    signs. There are few things that words do not stand for or cannot call up; but
                    they stand for things, as it were, only at second hand, and call them up only in
                    idea, and not in actual presentment to the senses. And just in this lies the
                    strength of painting and sculpture, that though there are countless things which
                    they cannot represent at all, and countless more which they can only represent
                    by suggestion more or less ambiguous, yet there are a few things which they
                    represent more effectually and directly than poetry can represent any thing at
                    all. These are, for sculpture, the forms or configurations of things, which that
                    art represents directly to the senses both of sight and touch; and for painting
                    the forms or configurations, colours, and relative positions of things, which
                    the art represents to the sense of sight, directly so far as regards surface
                    appearances, and indirectly so far as regards solidity. For many delicate
                    qualities and differences in these visible relations of things, there are no
                    words at all—the vocabulary of colours, for instance, is in all languages
                    surprisingly scanty and primitive. And those visible qualities for which words
                    exist, the words still call up indistinctly and at second hand. Poetry is almost
                    as powerless to bring before the mind’s eye with precision a particular shade of
                    red or blue, as sculpture is to relate a continuous experience, or painting to
                    enforce an exhortation or embellish an abstract proposition. The wise poet, as
                    has been justly remarked, when he wants to produce a vivid impression of the
                    beauty of a visible thing, does not attempt to catalogue or describe its
                    stationary beauties. In representing the perfections of form in a bride’s
                    slender foot, the speaking art, poetry, would find itself distanced by either of
                    the shaping arts, painting or sculpture; the wise poet calls up the charm of
                    such a foot by describing it not at rest but in motion, and in the feet
                    which</p>
                <p>“Beneath the petticoat, Like little mice, went in and out,”</p>
                <p>leaves us an image which baffles the power of the other arts. Shakespeare, when
                    he wants to make us realize the perfections of Perdita, puts into the mouth of
                    Florizel, not, as a bad poet would have done, a description of her lilies and
                    carnations, and the other charms which a painter could make us realize better,
                    but the praises of her ways and movements; and with the final touch—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ When you do dance, I wish you A wave o’ the sea, that you might ever do
                    Nothing but that,”</p>
                <p>he leaves upon the mind a twofold image of beauty in motion, of which one-half
                    might be the despair of those painters who designed the dancing maidens of the
                    walls of Herculaneum, and the other half the despair of all artists who in
                    modern times have tried to fix upon their canvas the buoyancy and grace of
                    dancing waves.</p>
                <p>The difference between the means and capacities of representation proper to the
                    shaping arts of sculpture and painting, and those proper to the speaking art of
                    poetry, which we have unsystematically glanced at in the above, were for a long
                    while overlooked or misunderstood. The maxim of Simonides, that poetry was a
                    kind of articulate painting, and painting a kind of mute poetry, was vaguely
                    accepted until the days of Lessing, and first overthrown by the famous treatise
                    of that writer on the Laocoön. Following in the main the lines laid down by
                    Lessing, other writers have worked out the conditions of representation or
                    imitation proper, not only to sculpture and painting as distinguished from
                    poetry, but to sculpture as distinguished from painting, until there is perhaps
                    no part of artistic theory so well or so generally understood as this. The chief
                    points, with some of which we have become acquainted already, may really all be
                    condensed under the simple law, <hi rend="italic">that the more direct and
                    complete the imitation effected by any art, the less is the range and number of
                    phenomena which that art can imitate.</hi> Thus sculpture in the round imitates
                    its objects much more completely and fully than any other single art,
                    reproducing one whole set of their relations which no other art attempts to
                    reproduce at all, namely, their solid relations in space. Precisely for this
                    reason, such sculpture is limited to a narrow class of objects. As we have seen,
                    it must represent human or animal figures; nothing else has enough of organic
                    beauty and perfection, or enough of universal interest. It must represent such
                    figures in combinations and with accessories comparatively simple, on pain of
                    puzzling and embarrassing the eye with a complexity and entanglement of masses
                    and lights and shadows; and in attitudes comparatively quiet, on pain of
                    violating, or appearing to violate, the conditions of mechanical stability.
                    Being a stationary or space-art, it can only represent a single action, which it
                    fixes and perpetuates for ever; and it must therefore choose for that action one
                    as significant and full of interest as is consistent with duo observation of the
                    above laws of simplicity and stability. Such actions, and the facial expressions
                    accompanying them, must not be those of sharp crisis or transition, because
                    sudden movement or flitting expression, thus arrested and perpetuated in full
                    and solid imitation by bronze or marble, would be displeasing and not pleasing
                    to the spectator. They must be actions and expressions in some degree settled,
                    collected, and capable of continuance, aud in their collectedness must at the
                    same time suggest to the spectator as much as possible of the circumstances
                    which have led up to them and those which will next ensue. These conditions
                    evidently bring within a very narrow range the phenomena with which this art can
                    deal, and explain why, as a matter of fact, by far the greater number of statues
                    represent simply a single figure in repose, with the addition of one or two
                    symbolic or customary attributes. Paint the statue and you bring the imitation
                    to a still further point of completeness by the addition of local colour; but
                    you do not thereby lighten in any degree the restrictions which are inevitably
                    laid upon sculpture so long as it undertakes to reproduce in full the third or
                    solid dimension of bodies. You only begin to lighten its restrictions when you
                    begin to relieve it of that duty. We have traced how sculpture in relief, which
                    is satisfied with only a partial reproduction of the third dimension, is free to
                    introduce a larger range of objects, bringing forward secondary figures and
                    accessories, indicating distant planes, indulging even in some violence and
                    complexity of motion, since limbs attached to a background do not alarm the
                    spectator by any idea of danger or fragility; though for the due effect of the
                    work, aud the pleasurable distinctness and diversity of its lights and shadows,
                    such complexity must not, even in relief, be carried too far. And so by degrees
                    we arrive at painting, in which the third dimension is dismissed altogether, and
                    nothing is actually reproduced, in full or partially, except the effect made by
                    the appearance of natural objects upon the retina of the eye. The conse∙</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0218-0209"/>
                <p>quence is that this art can range over distance and multitude, can represent
                    complicated relations between its various figures and groups of figures,
                    extensive backgrounds, and all those subtleties of appearance in natural things
                    which depend upon local colour and incidence of light and shade. These last
                    phenomena of natural things are in our experi-eice subject to change, in a sense
                    in which the substantial or solid properties of things are not so subject.
                    Colours, shadows, and atmospheric effects are to some extent associated with
                    ideas of transition, mystery, and evanescence. Hence painting is able to extend
                    its range to another kind of facts over which sculpture has no power. It can
                    perpetuate in its imitation, without breach of its true laws, certain classes of
                    facts which arc themselves fugitive and transitory, as a smile, the glance of an
                    eye, a gesture of horror or of passion, the waving of the young Achilles’ hair
                    “not unstirred,” as the old description has it, by the wind, the toss and
                    gathering of ocean waves, even the flashing of lightning across the sky. Still,
                    any long or continuous series of changes, actions, or movements is quite beyond
                    the means of this art to represent. Painting remains, in spite of its
                    comparative width of range, tied down to the inevitable conditions of a
                    space-art: that is to say, it has to delight the mind by a harmonious variety in
                    its effects, but by a variety apprehended not through various points of time
                    successively, but from various points in space at the same moment. Lastly, a
                    really ample range is only attained by the art which does not give a full and
                    complete reproduction of any natural fact at all, but represents or brings
                    natural facts before the mind merely by the images which words convey. The whole
                    world of movement, of continuity, of cause and effect, of the successions,
                    alternations, and interaction of events, characters, and passions, of everything
                    that takes time to happen and time to declare, is open to poetry as it is open
                    to no other art. We speak only of those parts of poetry which may properly be
                    called its imitative or representative parts, and not of its other parts or
                    applications, in reasoning, in exhortation, in denunciation, and the like. As an
                    imitative or representative art, then, poetry is subject to no limitations
                    except those which spring from the poverty of human language, and from the fact
                    that its means of imitation are indirect. Poetry’s report of the visible
                    properties of things is from these causes much less full, accurate, and
                    efficient than the reproduction or delineation of the same properties by
                    sculpture and painting. And this is the sum of the conditions concerning the
                    respective functions of the three arts of imitation which had been overlooked,
                    in theory at least, until the time of Lessing.</p>
                <p>To this law, in the form in which we have expressed it, it may perhaps be
                    objected that the acted drama is at once the most full and complete reproduction
                    of nature which we owe to the fine arts, and that at the same time the number of
                    facts over which its imitation ranges is the greatest. The answer is that our
                    law applies to the several arts only in that which we may call their pure or
                    unmixed state. Dramatic poetry is in that state only when it is read or spoken
                    like any other kind of verse. When it is witnessed on the stage, it is in a
                    mixed or impure state; the art of the actor has been called in to give actual
                    reproduction to the gestures and utterances of the personages, that of the
                    costumier to their appearances and attire, that of the stage-decorator to their
                    furniture and surroundings, that of the scene-painter to imitate to the eye the
                    dwellingplaces and landscapes among which they move; and only by the combination
                    of all these subordinate arts does the drama gain its character of imitative
                    completeness or reality.</p>
                <p>Throughout the above account of the imitative and non-imitative groups of fine
                    arts, we have so far followed Aristotle as to give the name of imitation to all
                    recognizable representation whatever of realities. By realities we have meant
                    not only phenomena as they actually or literally exist, or may have existed in
                    the past. Imitation, as we understand it, is not tied to such strict veracity of
                    positive delineation or report. It includes the representation of things which,
                    though similar to things actually existing, have themselves never actually
                    existed—the invention of phenomena, and of relations and combinations among
                    phenomena, derived from those of actual experience, but not identical with them.
                    Such shadowing forth of the unknown by means of the known is part of the work of
                    that comprehensive faculty which we call the imagination. But the materials or
                    elements with which the imaginative faculty is at liberty thus to deal are
                    materials or elements supplied by real experience. When we find among the ruins
                    of a Greek temple the statue of a beautiful young man at rest, or above the
                    altar of a Christian church the painting of one transfixed with arrows, we know
                    that the statue is intended to bring to our minds no mortal youth, but the god
                    Hermes or Apollo, the transfixed victim no simple captive, but Sebastian the
                    holy saint. At the same time we none the less know that the figures in either
                    case have been studied by the artist from living models before his eyes. In like
                    manner, in all the representations alike of sculpture, painting, and poetry, the
                    things and persons represented may bear symbolic meanings and imaginary names
                    and characters; they may be set in a land of dreams, and grouped in relations
                    and circumstances upon which the sun of this world never shone—and such in truth
                    was the purpose to which the arts were almost universally put until but the
                    other day; but it is from real things and persons that their lineaments and
                    characters have been taken in the first instance, in order to be attributed by
                    the imagination to another and more exalted order of existences.</p>
                <p>The law which we have last laid down is a law defining the relations of
                    sculpture, painting, and poetry, considered simply as arts having their
                    foundations at any rate in reality, and drawing from the imitation of reality
                    their indispensable elements and materials. It is a law defining the range and
                    character of the elements or materials in nature which each art is best fitted,
                    by its special means and resources, to imitate. But we must remember that, even
                    in this fundamental part of its operations, none of these arts proceeds by
                    imitation pure and simple. None of them contents itself with seeking to
                    represent realities, however literally taken, exactly as those realities are. A
                    portrait in sculpture or painting, a landscape in painting, a passage of local
                    description in poetry, maybe representations of known things taken literally or
                    for their own sakes, and not for the sake of carrying our thoughts to the
                    unknown; but none of them ought to be, or indeed can possibly be, a
                    representation of all the observed parts and details of such a reality on equal
                    terms and without omissions. Such a representation, were it possible, would be a
                    mechanical inventory and not a work of fine art. That only, we know, is fine art
                    which affords keen and permanent delight to contemplation. Such delight the
                    artist can never communicate by the display of a callous and pedantic
                    impartiality in presence of the facts of life and nature. His delineation or
                    report of realities will only strike or impress others in so far as it directs
                    their attention to things by which he has been struck and impressed himself. To
                    excite emotion, he must have felt emotion: and emotion is only another word for
                    partiality. The constitution which observes and registers every detail of an
                    experience with uniform and equal minuteness is a constitution which has been
                    strongly affected by no part of that experience. Such a constitution will never
                    make an artist. The ulterior imaginative meanings and combinations of art being
                    left out of the question, the artist is one who instinctively tends to modify
                    and work <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0219-0210"/> upon every reality before him in conformity with
                    some poignant and sensitive principle of preference or selection in his mind. He
                    instinctively adds something to nature in one direction and takes away something
                    in another, overlooking this kind of fact and insisting on that, suppressing
                    many particulars which he holds irrelevant in order to insist on and bring into
                    prominence others by which he is attracted and arrested. To do this is called to
                    idealize, and the faculty by which an artist prefers, selects, and brings into
                    the light one order of facts or aspects in the thing before him rather than the
                    rest, is called the idealizing or ideal faculty. To the definitions of the
                    imitative arts above given, in which we said that their business was to imitate
                    natural facts,—one by solid form, another by line, lightand-shade, and colour, a
                    third by words in regulated combination,—to these definitions, then, we must now
                    add that the imitation of natural fact in question is not an imitation pure and
                    simple, but an <hi rend="italic">idealized imitation,</hi> in which the mind
                    acts upon the facts of nature, and sifts and sorts them at its choice, before it
                    represents or puts them on record.</p>
                <p>This idealizing faculty is also one of that great cluster of faculties or powers
                    within us for mentally making the most of the world we live in, which are
                    commonly associated together under the comprehensive name imagination.
                    Interminable discussion has been spent on the questions,— What is the ideal, and
                    how do we idealize? The answer has been put in the most sensible form by those
                    thinkers <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Vischer and &lt; Lotze), who have pointed
                    out that the process of aesthetic idealization carried on by the artist is only
                    the higher development of a process carried on in an elementary fashion by all
                    men, from the very nature of their constitution. The physical organs of sense
                    themselves do not retain or put on record all the impressions made upon them.
                    When the nerves of the eye receive a multitude of different stimulations at once
                    from different points in space, the sense of eyesight, instead of being aware of
                    all these stimulations singly, only abstracts and retains a total impression of
                    them together. In like manner we are not made aware by the sense of hearing of
                    all the several waves of sound that strike in a momentary succession upon the
                    nerves of the ear; that sense only abstracts and retains a total impression from
                    the combined effect of a number of such waves. And the office which each sense
                    thus performs singly for its own impressions, the mind performs in a higher
                    degree for the impressions of all the senses equally, and for all the other
                    parts of our experience. We are always dismissing or neglecting a great part of
                    our impressions, and abstracting and combining among those which we retain. The
                    ordinary human consciousness works like an artist up to this point; and when we
                    speak of the ordinary or inartistic man as being impartial in the retention or
                    registry of his daily impressions, we mean, of course, in the retention or
                    registry of his impressions as already thus far abstracted ‘and assorted in
                    consciousness. The artistic man, whose impressions affect him much more
                    strongly, carries much farther these same processes of abstraction and
                    combination among his impressions, and according to the complexion of his
                    feelings imparts a colour from his own mind both to the literal record of his
                    experiences and to the imaginary constructions which he builds upon them.</p>
                <p>It will further help our understanding of what is meant by the ideal in art, if
                    we observe that into the framing of every ideal there enter two parts or
                    elements. These are, a subjective and an objective part or element—or so we may
                    for convenience call them. The artist, affected more than other men by his daily
                    impressions, grows up with certain innate or acquired predilections which become
                    a part of his constitution whether he will or no,—predilections, say, if he is a
                    dramatic poet, for certain types of character and situation; if he is a
                    sculptor, for certain proportions and a certain habitual carriage and
                    disposition of the limbs; if he is a figure painter, for certain moulds of
                    figure and airs and expressions of countenance; if a landscape painter, for a
                    certain class of character, configuration, and sentiment in natural scenery.
                    This is the subjective or purely personal part of the artistic ideal. But on the
                    other hand, as an imitator of fact, the artist has to recognize and accept the
                    character of the facts which he finds at any given moment before him. All facts
                    cannot be of the cast which he prefers, and in so far as he undertakes to deal
                    with facts of an opposite cast he must submit to them; he must study them as
                    they actually are, must abstract, retain, bring into prominence, and carry out
                    their own dominant tendencies. If he cannnot find in them what is most pleasing
                    to himself, he will still be led by the abstracting and discriminating powers of
                    his observation to discern what is most significant in <hi rend="italic"
                    >them,</hi> he will emphasize and put on record this, idealizing the facts
                    before him not in his direction but in their own. This, the disengaging and
                    bringing forward of the characteristics actually dominant in any object as he
                    finds it, is the second or objective half of the artist’s task of idealization.
                    It is this half upon which Μ. Taine has dwelt almost exclusively, and on the
                    whole with a just insight into the principles of the operation, in his well-know
                    n treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Ideal in Art.</hi> These two modes of
                    idealization, the subjective and the objective, are not always easy to be
                    reconciled. Though the perfect artist would no doubt be he who should combine
                    the strongest personal instincts of preference with the keenest power of
                    observing characteristics as they are, yet in fact we find few artists in whom
                    both these elements of the ideal faculty have been equally developed. To take
                    some familiar instances among painters: Leonardo da Vinci, haunted as he was
                    above all men by a particular human ideal of intellectual sweetness and alluring
                    mystery, which perpetually recurs in the faces of his women and young men, has
                    yet left us a vast number of exercises which show him as an indefatigable
                    student of objective characteristics and psychological expressions of an order
                    the most opposed to this. An older painter of the same period, Sandro
                    Botticelli, is on the other hand as good an example as can be named of an artist
                    who could never escape from the dictation of his own personal ideals, in
                    obedience to which he invested all the creations of his art with nearly the same
                    conformation of brows, lips, cheeks, and chin, nearly the same looks of wistful
                    yearning and dejection. If, again, we desire an example of the opposite
                    principle, of that idealism which idealizes above all things objectively, and
                    disengages the very inmost and individual characters, however unattractive or
                    unseemly, of the thing or person before it, we must turn to the northern
                    schools, and especially to the work of Rembrandt; though, indeed, that master’s
                    profound sense of human sympathy and commiseration, and his predilection for a
                    certain class of light-and-shade effects, throw in this case, too, a veil of
                    distinct personal feeling over his representations.</p>
                <p>Sculpture, painting, and poetry, then, are arts which represent things known and
                    real, either for their own sakes literally, or for the sake of shadowing forth
                    things not known but imagined. In either case they represent their originals,
                    not indiscriminately as they are, but bettered, completed, or at the least
                    simplified and enforced to our apprehensions, partly by the transmuting power of
                    the artist’s own instincts and partly by his discriminating, selecting, and
                    rejecting power among the facts before him. But before we dismiss these arts, we
                    must remember that imitation is not the whole of their task. Just as music and
                    architecture, we saw, though non-imitative arts in the main, admitted occasional
                    and partial elements of imitation, so sculpture, painting, and poetry include
                    non-imitative elements in their <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0220-0211"/> turn. Part of the pleasures of sculpture, and a
                    larger part of those of painting, are independent of the representation of
                    natural facts, and depend only, like the pleasures of architecture, on abstract
                    properties of line, colour, andlightand-shade. In like manner part of the
                    pleasures of poetry are independent of the images which the words in poetry call
                    up, and depend only, like the pleasures of music, on the melody and emotional
                    suggestiveness of the sounds of those words as they are combined in the line or
                    stanza. It is impossible to distinguish how much of this pleasure which is
                    received by the eye and ear respectively apart from imitation is purely organic
                    pleasure of the senses, and how much is pleasure derived from the association of
                    particular forms, hues, and sounds with desirable and beneficent qualities.
                    Certain it is that there are figures and combinations of line, and patterns and
                    arrangements of colour, and successions, transitions, and oppositions of sound,
                    which affect our senses with an organic pleasure; and certain it is no less that
                    there are others which seem to affect them with a similar pleasure from being
                    unconsciously associated in our minds with experiences of efficiency,
                    beneficence, or power. The point at which these kindred pleasures merge into one
                    another it does not here concern us to distinguish, if we could. It is
                    sufficient that the effects of architecture and music depend, as we have
                    learned, almost entirely on their appeal to these pleasures; while the effects
                    of sculpture, painting, and poetry, depending mainly on the pleasures derived
                    from idealized representation of fact, depend on the others also in a secondary
                    but none the less in an indispensable degree. Thus, the outlines, intervals, and
                    shadows of the masses in a work of sculpture are bound to be such as would
                    please the eye, whether the statue or relief represented the figure of anything
                    real in the world or not. The flow and balance of line, and the distribution of
                    colours and light-and-shade,in a picture are bound to be such as would make an
                    agreeable pattern although they bore no resemblance to natural fact (as, indeed,
                    many subordinate applications of this art, in decorative painting and
                    geometrical and other ornaments, do, we know, give pleasure though they
                    represent nothing). The sound of a line or verse in poetry is bound to be such
                    as would thrill the physical ear in hearing, or the mental ear in reading, with
                    a delightful excitement even though the meaning went for nothing. If the
                    imitative arts are to touch and elevate the emotions, if they are to afford
                    permanent delight of the due pitch and volume, it is not a more essential law
                    that their imitation should be of the order which we have defined as ideal, than
                    that they should at the same time exhibit these independent effects which they
                    share with the non-imitative group.</p>
                <p>Having now sufficiently drawn attention to the effects presented by the several
                    greater fine arts as divided into an imitative and a non-imitative group, and
                    having found that division the most convenient for the general discussion of the
                    nature of the several arts, if not the most important for practice, we may now
                    pass to another point of view, and consider very briefly the results which are
                    gained by a third mode of classification.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Serviceable and the Non-Serviceable Arts.—</hi> It has
                    been established from the outset that, though the essential distinction of fine
                    art is to minister not to necessity but to delight, yet among the arts of men
                    there are some which do both these things at once, and add beauty, or the
                    quality which gives us delight, to use, or the quality which satisfies our
                    needs. This double character is inseparable, among the five greater arts, from
                    architecture. We build in the first instance for the sake of necessary shelter
                    and accommodation. By and by we find out that the aspect of our constructions is
                    pleasurable or the reverse. Architecture is the art of building at once as we
                    need and as we like, and a practical treatise on architecture must treat the
                    beauty and the utility of buildings as bound up together. But for our present
                    purpose it has been proper to take into account one half only of the vocation of
                    architecture, the half by which it gives delight, and belongs to that which is
                    the subject of our study, to fine art; and to neglect the other half of its
                    vocation, by which it belongs to what is not the subject of our study, to useful
                    or mechanical art. It is plain, however, that the presence or absence of this
                    foreign element, the element of utility, constitutes a fair ground for a
                    separate classification of the fine arts. If we took the five greater arts only,
                    architecture would on this ground stand alone in one division, as the useful or
                    serviceable fine art; with sculpture, painting, music, and poetry together in
                    the other division, as fine arts unassociated with direct use or service. Not
                    that the divisions would, even thus, be quite sharply and absolutely separated.
                    Didactic poetry, we have already acknowledged, is a branch of the poetic art
                    which aims at practice and utility. Again, the hortatory and patriotic kinds of
                    lyric poetry, from the strains of Tyrtaeus to those of Arndt or Rouget de Lisle,
                    may fairly be said to belong to a phase of fine art which is directly concerned,
                    if not with practical needs, at any rate with practical duties. So may the
                    strains of music which accompany such poetry. The same practical character, as
                    stimulating and attuning the mind to definite ends and actions, might indeed
                    have been claimed for the greater part of the whole art of music, as that art
                    was practised in antiquity, when each of several prescribed and highly
                    elaborated moods, or modes, of melody were supposed to have a known effect upon
                    the courage and moral temper of the hearer. In modern music, of which the
                    elements, much more complex in themselves than those of ancient music, have the
                    effect of stirring our fibres to moods of rapturous contemplation rather than of
                    action, military strains in march time are the only purely instrumental variety
                    of the art which may still be said to retain this character.</p>
                <p>To reinforce, however, the serviceable or useful division of fine arts in our
                    present classification, it is not among the greater arts that we must look. We
                    must look among the lesser or auxiliary arts of the manual or shaping group. The
                    potter, the joiner, the weaver, the smith, the goldsmith, the glass-maker, these
                    and a hundred artificers who produce wares primarily for use, produce them in a
                    form or with embellishments that have the secondary virtue of giving pleasure to
                    the user. Much ingenuity has been spent to little purpose in attempting to group
                    and classify these lesser shaping arts under one or other of the greater shaping
                    arts, according to the nature of the means employed in each. Thus the potter’s
                    art has been classed under sculpture, because he moulds in solid form the shapes
                    of his cups, plates, and ewers; the art of the joiner under that of the
                    architect, because his tables, seats, and cupboards, are fitted and framed
                    together, like the houses they furnish, out of solid materials previously
                    prepared and cut; and we ourselves had occasion above to class the weaver and
                    embroiderer, from the point of view of the effects produced by their art, among
                    painters. But the truth is, that each one of these auxiliary handicrafts has its
                    own materials and technical procedure, which cannot, without forcing and
                    confusion, be described by the name proper to the materials and technical
                    procedure of any of the greater arts. The only satisfactory classification of
                    these handicrafts is that now before us, according to which we think of them all
                    together in the same group with architecture, not because any one or more of
                    them may be technically allied to that art, but because, like it, they all yield
                    products capable of being at the same time useful and beautiful. Architecture is
                    the art which fits and frames together, of stone, brick, timber, or iron, the
                    abiding and assembling places of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0221-0212"/> man, all his houses, palaces, temples, workshops,
                    roofed places of meeting and exchange, theatres for spectacle, fortresses of
                    defence, bridges, aqueducts, and ships for seafaring. The wise architect having
                    fashioned any one of these great constructions at once for service and beauty in
                    the highest degree, the lesser or auxiliary manual arts come in, to fill,
                    furnish, and adorn it with things of service and beauty in a lower degree, each
                    according to its own technical laws and capabilities; some, like pottery,
                    delighting the user at once by beauty of form, delicacy of substance, and
                    pleasantness of imitative or non-imitative ornament; some, like embroidery, by
                    richness of tissue, and by the same twofold pleasantness of ornament; some, like
                    goldsmith’s work, by preciousness of fancy and workmanship proportionate to the
                    preciousness of the material. To this vast group of workmen, whose work is at
                    the same time useful and fine in its degree, the ancient Greek gave the place
                    which is most just and convenient for thought, when he classed them all together
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">τeκτove&lt;s</hi> or artificers, and called
                    the builder by the name of <hi rend="italic">apχιτiκτωv,</hi> arch-artificer or
                    artificer-in-chief.</p>
                <p>Of the manner in which the operation of these auxiliary manual arts has been
                    modified in later times by the increase of mechanical agencies, and of the
                    degree to which the intervention of such agencies, in multiplying one uniform
                    design upon a vast number of wares, is compatible with the true characters of
                    fine art in the product, we have said enough further back. It is time now to
                    turn to the last section of our inquiry.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Of the History of the Fine Arts.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this heading it will not be expected, nor will our space allow, that we
                    should do more than touch in the most general terms on some of the great facts
                    and divisions in the history of the several arts. The students of human culture
                    have within the last hundred years concentrated a great deal of attentive
                    thought upon the history of fine art, and have put forth various comprehensive
                    generalizations intended at once to sum up, and to account for, the phases and
                    vicissitudes of that history. The most famous formula of all is that of Hegel,
                    to which we have already alluded. Hegel, we learned, regarded particular arts as
                    being characteristic of and appropriate to particular forms of civilization and
                    particular ages of history. For him, architecture was the symbolic art
                    appropriate to ages of obscure and struggling ideas, and characteristic of the
                    Egyptian and the Asiatic races of old and of the mediaeval age-in Europe.
                    Sculpture was the classical art appropriate to ages of lucid and self-possessed
                    ideas, and characteristic of the Greek and Roman period. Painting, music, and
                    poetry were the romantic arts, appropriate to the ages of complicated and
                    overmastering ideas, and characteristic of modern humanity in general. In the
                    working out of these generalizations, Hegel has brought together a great mass of
                    judicious and striking observations; and that they are generalizations
                    containing on the whole a preponderance of truth may be admitted. It has been
                    objected against them, from the philosophical point of view, that they too much
                    mix up the definition of what the several arts theoretically are with
                    considerations of what in various historical circumstances they have practically
                    been. From the historical point of view, there can be taken what seems a more
                    valid objection, that these formulas of Hegel tend too much to concentrate the
                    attention of the student upon the one dominant art chosen as characteristic of
                    any period, and to give him false ideas of the proportions and relations of the
                    several arts at the same period,—of the proportions and relations which poetry,
                    say, really bore to sculpture among the Greeks and Romans, or sculpture to
                    architecture among the Christian nations of the Middle Age. The truth is, that
                    the historic survey gained over any field of human activity from the height of
                    generalizations so vast in their range and scope as these are, must needs, in
                    the complexity of earthly affairs, be a survey too distant to give much guidance
                    until its omissions are filled up by a great deal of nearer study; and such
                    nearer study is apt to compel the student in the long run to qualify the
                    theories with which lie has started until they are in danger of disappearing
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>Another systematic exponent of the universe, whose system is very different from
                    that of Hegel, Mr Herbert Spencer, has brought the great scientific
                    generalization of our time, the doctrine of Evolution, to bear, not without
                    interesting results, upon the history of the fine arts and their development. Mr
                    Herbert Spencer sets forth how the manual group of fine arts, architecture,
                    sculpture, and painting, were in their first rudiments bound up together, and
                    how each of them in the course of history has liberated itself from the rest by
                    a gradual process of separation. These arts did not at first exist in the
                    distinct and developed forms in which we have above described them. There were
                    no statues in the round, and no painted panels or canvasses hung upon the wall.
                    Only the rudiments of sculpture and painting existed, and that only as ornaments
                    applied to architecture, in the shape of tiers of tinted reliefs, representing,
                    in a kind of picture-writing, the exploits of kings upon the walls of their
                    temple-palaces. Gradually sculpture took greater salience and roundness, and
                    tended to disengage itself from the wall, while painting found out how to
                    represent solidity by means of its own, and dispensed with the raised surface
                    upon which it was first applied. But the old mixture and union of the three
                    arts, with an undeveloped art of painting and an undeveloped art of sculpture
                    still engaged in or applied to the works of architecture, continued on the whole
                    to prevail through the long cycles of Egyptian and Assyrian history. In the
                    Egyptian palace-temple we find a monument at once political and religious, and
                    into this one class of monument we find concentrated all the energies and
                    faculties of all the artificers of the race. With its incised and pictured
                    walls, its half-detached colossi, its open and its colonnaded chambers, the
                    forms of the columns and their capitals recalling the stems and blossoms of the
                    lotus and papyrus, with its architecture everywhere taking on the charactersand
                    covering itself with the adornments of immature sculpture and painting—this
                    structure exhibits within its single fabric the origins of the whole subsequent
                    group of shaping arts. From hence it is a long way to the innumerable artistic
                    sur roundings of later Greek and Roman life, the many templc&gt; with their
                    detached and their engaged statues, the theatres, the porticoes, the baths, the
                    training schools, with free and separate statues both of gods and men adorning
                    every building and public place, the frescoes upon the walls, the panelpictures
                    hung in temples and public and private galleries. In the terms of the theory of
                    evolution, the advance from the early Egyptian to the later Greek stage is an
                    advance from the one to the manifold, from the simple to the complex, from the
                    homogeneous to the heterogeneous, and affords a striking instance of that vast
                    and ceaseless process of differentiation and integration which it is the law of
                    all things to undergo. In the Christian monuments of the early Middle Age,
                    again, the arts have gone back to the rudimentary stage, and are similarly
                    attached to and combined with each other. The single monument, the one great
                    birth of art, in that age, is the Gothic church. In this we find the art of
                    applied sculpture exercised in fashions infinitely rich and various, but
                    entirely in the service and for the adornment of the architecture; we find
                    painting exercised in fashions more rudimentary still, principally in the forms
                    of coloured imagery in the chancel windows and illuminated miniι-tures<pb

                    from this stage again the process of the differentiation of the arts is
                    repeated. It is by a new evolution or unfolding, and by oue carried to much
                    farther and more complicated stages than the last had reached, that the arts
                    since the Middle Age have come to the point where we find them to-day; when
                    architecture is applied to a hundred secular uses with not less magnificence, or
                    at least not less desire of magnificence, than that with which it fulfilled its
                    single sacred use of old; with sculpture adorning, or intended to adorn, all our
                    streets and commemorating all our likenesses; with the subjects of painting
                    extended from religion to all life and nature, until this one art has been
                    divided into the dozen branches of history, landscape, still life, genre,
                    anecdote, and the rest Such being in brief the successive stages, and such the
                    reiterated processes, of evolution among the shaping arts, the action of the
                    same law can be traced in the growth of the speaking or time arts also.
                    Originally poetry aud music, the two great speaking arts, were not separated
                    from each other and from the art of bodily motion, dancing. The father of song,
                    music, and dancing, all three, was that savage of whom we have already spoken,
                    who first clapped hands and leapt and shouted in time at some festival of his
                    tribe. From the clapping, or rudimentary rhythmical noise, has been evolved the
                    whole art of instrumental music, down to the entrancing complexities of the
                    modern symphony. From the shout, or rudimentary emotional utterance, has
                    proceeded by a kindred evolution the whole art of vocal music down to the modern
                    opera or oratorio. From the savage leap, or rudimentary expression of emotion by
                    rhythmical movements of the body, has descended every variety of dancing, from
                    the stately figures of the tragic chorus of the Greeks to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kordax</hi> of their comedy or the <hi rend="italic">cancan</hi> of modern
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>That the theory of evolution serves well to group and to interpret many facts in
                    the history of art we are not disposed to deny, though it would be easy to show
                    that Mr Herbert Spencer’s instances and applications are not sufficient to
                    sustain all the conclusions that he seems to draw from them. Thus, it is
                    perfectly true that the Egyptian or Assyrian palace wall is an instance of
                    rudimentary painting and rudimentary sculpture in subservience to architecture.
                    But it is not less true that races who had no architecture at all, but lived in
                    caverns of the earth, exhibit, as we have already had occasion to notice, the
                    rudiments of the other two arts, in a different form, in the carved or incised
                    handles of their weapons. And it is almost certain that, among the nations of
                    Oriental antiquity themselves, the art of decorating solid walls so as to please
                    the eye with patterns and resentations of natural objects was itself borrowed
                    from the precedent of an older art, which works in easier materials, the art of
                    weaving or tapestry. It would be in the perished textile fabrics of the earliest
                    dwellers in the valley of the Nile and the Euphrates that we should find, if
                    anywhere, the origins of the systems of surface design, whether conventional or
                    imitative, which those races afterwards applied to the decoration of their solid
                    constructions. Not in any one exclusive type of primitive artistic activity, but
                    in a score of such types equally, varying according to race, region, and
                    circumstances, shall we find so many germs or nuclei from which whole families
                    of fine arts have in the course of the world’s history differentiated and
                    unfolded themselves. And once at least during that history, a cataclysm of all
                    the political and social forces has not only checked the process of the
                    evolution of the fine arts, but from an advanced stage of development has thrown
                    them back again—we speak especially of the manual group—to the primitive stage
                    where they are all practised conjointly and in mutual interdependence. By Mr
                    Herbert Spencer’s application of the theory of evolution, not less than by
                    Hegel’s theory of the historic periods, attention is called to the fact that
                    Christian Europe, during several centuries of the Middle Age, presents to our
                    study a civilization analogous to the civilization of the old Oriential empires
                    in this respect, that its ruling aud characteristic manual art is architecture,
                    to which sculpture and painting are, as in the Oriental empires, once more
                    subjugated and attached. It does not of course follow that such periods of
                    fusion or mutual dependence among the arts are periods of bad art. On the
                    contrary, each stage of the evolution of any art has its own characteristic
                    excellence. There is an excellence of sculpture as a decorative or subsidiary
                    art, and that it reached in the Gothic age. There is an excellence of sculpture
                    as an independent art, and that it reached in Greece in the 5th century B.c.,
                    and again approached in Tuscany in the 15th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >λ.d.</hi> The arts can be employed in combination, and yet be all severally
                    excel lent. When music, dancing, acting, and singing were combined in the
                    performanceof the Greek chorus, the combination no doubt presented a relative
                    perfection of each of the four elements analogous to the combined perfection, in
                    the contemporary Doric temple, of pure architectural form, sculptured enrichment
                    of spaces specially contrived for sculpture in the pediments and frieze, and
                    coloured decoration over all. Tlιe extreme differentiation of any art from every
                    other art, and of the several branches of one art among themselves, does not by
                    any means tend to the perfection of that art. The process of evolution among the
                    fine arts may go, and, indeed, in the course of history has gone, too far. Thus
                    an artist of our own day is usually either a painter only or a sculptor only;
                    but yet it is acknowledged that the painter who can model a statue, or the
                    sculptor who can paint a picture, is likely tobe the more efficient master of
                    both arts; and in the best days of Florentine art the greatest men were
                    generally painters, sculptors, architects, aud goldsmiths all at once. In like
                    manner a landscape painter who paints landscape only is apt not to paint it so
                    well as one who paints the figure too; and in recent times the skill of
                    engraving had almost perished from the habit of allotting one part of the work,
                    as skies, to one hand, another part, as figures, to a second, and another part,
                    as landscape, to a third. This kind of continually progressing subdivision of
                    labour, which seems to be the necessary law of industrial processes, is fatal to
                    any skill which demands, as skill in the fine arts, we have seen, demands, the
                    free exercise and direction at every moment of a highly complex cluster both of
                    faculties and sensibilities. Turning to the other group of arts, there are
                    reformers who say that the process of evolution and differentiation has in like
                    manner gone too far with music. Music, as separated from words and actions, say
                    Dr Wagner aud his followers,—independent orchestral and instrumental music,—has
                    reached its utmost development, and its farther advance can only be an advance
                    into the inane; while the music that is still associated with words, operatic
                    music, has broken itself up into a number of set and separate forms, as aria,
                    scena, recitative, which correspond to no real varieties of instinctive
                    emotional utterance, and in the aimless production of which the art is in dinger
                    of paralysing and stultifying itself. This process, they say, must be checked;
                    music and words must be brought back again into close connexion and mutual
                    dependence; the artificial opera forms must be abolished, and a new and
                    homogeneous musical drama must be created, of which the author shall combine in
                    himself the now differentiated functions of poet, composer, inventor, and
                    director of scenery and stage appliances, so that the entire creation may bear
                    the impress of a single mind.</p>
                <p>It is thus evident that the evolution theory furnishes us with some instructive
                    points of view for the history of the fine arts as for other things. Another key
                    to what is called the philosophy of that history, although one which has been
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n223/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0223-0214"/> employed with results perhaps less really
                    luminous than they are certainly showy and attractive, is that supplied by a
                    distinguished French writer, Μ. Taine. Μ. Taine’s philosophy, which might
                    perhaps be better called a natural history, of fine art, consists in regarding
                    the fine arts as the necessary result of the general conditions under which they
                    are at any time produced—conditions of race, conditions of climate, conditions
                    of religion, civilization, and manners. Acquaint yourself with these conditions
                    as they existed in any given people at any given period, and you will be able to
                    account for the characters assumed by the arts of that people at that period and
                    to reason from one to the other, as a botanist can account for the flora of any
                    given locality and can reason from its soil, exposure, and temperature, to the
                    orders of vegetation which it will produce. This method of treating the history
                    of the fine arts, again, is one which can be pursued with profit, in so far as
                    it makes the student realize the connexion of fine art with human culture in
                    general, and teaches him how the arts of any age and country are not an
                    independent or arbitrary phenomenon, but are essentially an outcome, or
                    efflorescence, to use a phrase of Professor Ruskin’s, of many deep-seated
                    elements in the civilization which produces them. But it is a method which,
                    rashly used, is very apt to lead to a hasty and onesided handling both of
                    history and of art. It is easy to fasten on certain obvious relations of fine
                    art to general civilization when you know a few of the facts of both, and to
                    say, the cloudy skies and mongrel industrial population of Amsterdam at such and
                    such a date had their inevitable reflexion in the art of Rembrandt; the wealth
                    and pomp of the full-fleshed burghers and burgesses of Antwerp had theirs in the
                    art of Rubens. But to do this in the precise and conclusive manner of Μ. Taine’s
                    treatises on the philosophy of art always means to ignore a large range of
                    conditions or causes for which no corresponding effect is on the surface
                    apparent, and generally, also, a large number of effects for which appropriate
                    causes cannot easily be discovered either. The truth is, that this particular
                    efflorescence of human culture depends for its character at any given time upon
                    combinations of causes which are by no means simple, but generally highly compl
                    ex, obscure, and nicely balanced. F or instance, the student who should try to
                    reason back from the holy and beatified character which prevails in much of the
                    devotional painting of the Italian schools down to the Renaissance would make a
                    great mistake if he were to conclude, “like art, like life, thoughts, and
                    manners.” He would not understand the relation of the art to the general
                    civilization of those days, unless he were to remember that one of the chief
                    functions of the imagination is to make up for the shortcomings of reality, and
                    to supply to contemplation images of that which is most lacking in actual life;
                    so that the visions at once peaceful and ardent of the religious schools of the
                    Italian cities are to be explained, not by the peace, but rather in great part
                    by the dispeace, of contemporary existence.</p>
                <p>Either of thej three modes of generalization to which we have referred might no
                    doubt yield, however, supposing in the student the due gifts of patience and of
                    caution, a working clue to guide him through that immense region of research,
                    the history of the fine arts. But it is hardly possible to pursue to any purpose
                    the history of the two great groups, the shaping group and the speaking group,
                    together. Words are a means of expression which men have generally mastered more
                    quickly than any other; and in Greece all three divisions of the art of poetry,
                    the narrative, lyric, andl dramatic, had been perfected, and two of them had
                    again declined, before sculpture reached maturity, or painting had passed beyond
                    the stage of its early severity. Again, many nations have been great in poetry
                    at a time when their other fine arts flourished humbly if at all—as England in
                    the days of Elizabeth. The history of poetry must thus of necessity be a
                    separate study. And so must the history of music. Music in its independent
                    development is an invention,—whether made, as some think, in response to the
                    special needs of modern souls, or, as others hold, simply like other inventions
                    in the progress of human ingenuity—but at any rate an invention of the last two
                    hundred years.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, it is very possible to take the whole of the shaping group of
                    fine arts together, and to pursue connectedly the history, throughout the course
                    of civilization, of architecture, sculpture, and painting, and of their mutual
                    relations with one another. Being all arts of manual dexterity, and all occupied
                    in providing for our delight objects intended for visual contemplation in space,
                    these have a natural and practical affinity. Leaving aside the arts of the races
                    of Egypt and the East, which, profoundly interesting as they are, have had no
                    direct effect upon ourselves except in so far as they communicated the first
                    hints or germs of inspiration to the ancestors and masters of Western
                    civilization, the Greeks,—leaving those aside, the history of the manual arts of
                    architecture, painting, and sculpture, falls naturally into four great periods
                    or divisions :—(1) the Greek and Roman period, from about 700 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to the final triumph of Christianity, say 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> (2) the Christian period, from the triumph of
                    Christianity to about 1260 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> in Italy and about
                    1460 in northern Europe; (3) the Renaissance period, from the above dates till
                    about 1620 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d;</hi> (4) the modern period, from about 1620
                    to our own day. We have not set down, as is usually done, a specifically Gothic
                    age in art, for this reason. The characteristic of the whole Christian period is
                    that its dominant art is architecture, chiefly employed in the service of the
                    church, and with the arts of painting and carving only applied subordinately for
                    its enrichment. It makes no essential difference to this fundamental character
                    that from the 5th to the 12th century the forms of this art were derived in the
                    east of Europe from the Byzantine branch, and in the west from the branch
                    usually called Romanesque, of the round-arched architecture of the empire; and
                    that by the 13th century a new form of architecture, in which the round arch was
                    replaced by the pointed, and the decorations took another character, had been
                    invented in France, and from thence spread abroad to Germany, England, Spain,
                    and last to Italy. The essential difference only begins when the imitative arts,
                    sculpture and painting, begin to develop and detach themselves, to exist and
                    strive after perfection on their own account. This happens in Italy with the
                    artificers of the 13th and 14th centuries, with Niccola Pisano and Giotto; and
                    it happens, though the respective arts are still wholly engaged upon
                    ecclesiastical subjects, in connexion with an incipient study of and passion for
                    antique models. From this time and onward, that movement of men’s minds which
                    gradually enthroned the images of pagan antiquity beside those of Christian
                    worship as the ideal theme of art, continued until, in the 15th century, it
                    communicated itself to the more pious races of the North, and until in Italy
                    reached its culmination in the genius of Michelangelo and of Raphael. The same
                    movement of the arts held on, with its energy exhausted and its inspiration
                    flagging, until, soon after the beginning of the 17th century, the Dutch school
                    of common life appeared and announced the greatest revolution of all. This is a
                    revolution which has its counterpart in literature too, and which proceeds from
                    a modern manner of regarding life totally different from that of either
                    antiquity, the Christian Middle Age, or the Renaissance. By it the fine arts
                    were brought down from the exclusive regions of the religious and the classical
