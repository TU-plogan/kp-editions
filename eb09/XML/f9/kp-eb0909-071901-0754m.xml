                <p><label type="entry">FRANKLIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>
                    (1786-1847), rear-admiral, was born at Spilsby, Lincolnshire, April 16,1786.
                    Sprung from a line of free-holders, or “franklins,” his father inherited a small
                    family estate, which was so deeply mortgaged by his immediate predecessor that
                    it was found necessary to sell it; but by his success in commercial pursuits he
                    was enabled to maintain and educate a family of twelve children. John, the
                    youngest son, was destined for the church by his father, who, with this view,
                    had purchased an advowson for him. He received the rudiments of education at St
                    Ives, and afterwards attended Louth Grammar School for two years; but having
                    employed a holiday in walking 12 miles with a companion to look at the sea,
                    which up to that time he knew only by description, his imagination was so
                    impressed that he determined to be a sailor. In the hope of dispelling what he
                    considered to be a boyish fancy, his father sent him on a trial voyage to Lisbon
                    in a merchantman; but it being found on his return that his wishes were
                    unchanged, an entry on the quarterdeck of the “Polyphemus,” 74, Captain Lawford,
                    was procured for him in 1800; and this ship having led the line in the battle of
                    Copenhagen in 1801, young Franklin had the honour of serving in Nelson’s
                    hardest-fought action. Two months after the action of Copenhagen, he joined the
                    “Investigator,” discovery-ship, commanded by his relative Captain Flinders, and
                    under the training of that able scientific officer, while employed in exploring
                    and mapping the coasts of Australia, he acquired a correctness of astronomical
                    observation and a skill in surveying which proved of eminent utility in his
                    future career. Franklin was on board the “Porpoise” when that ship and the
                    “Cato” were wrecked, August 18, 1803, on a coral reef, off the coast of
                    Australia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Flinders).</hi> After this misfortune,
                    Franklin proceeded to Canton, where he obtained a passage to England in the
                    “Earl Camden,” East Indiaman, commanded by Sir Nathaniel Dance, commodore of the
                    China fleet of 16 sail. On the 15th of February 1804 Captain Dance repulsed a
                    strong French squadron, led by the redoubtable Admiral Linois. In this action
                    Franklin performed the important duty of signal midshipman. On reaching England,
                    he joined the “Bellerophon,” 74, and in that ship he was again entrusted with
                    the signals, a duty which he executed with his accustomed coolness and
                    intrepidity in the great battle of Trafalgar. In the “Bedford,” his next ship,
                    he attained the rank of lieutenant, and remaining in her for six years, latterly
                    as first lieutenant, served in the blockade of Flushing, on the coast of
                    Portugal, alιd in other parts of the world, but chiefly on the Brazil station,
                    whither the “Bedford” went as part of the convoy which escorted the royal family
                    of Portugal to Rio de Janeiro in 1808. In the ill-managed and disastrous attack
                    on New Orleans, he commanded the “Bedford’s” boats in an engagement with the
                    enemy’s gunboats, one of which he boarded and captured, receiving a slight wound
                    in the hand-to-hand fight.</p>
                <p>On peace being established, Franklin turned his attention once more to the
                    scientific branch of his profession, and sedulously extended his knowledge of
                    surveying. In 1818 the discovery of a north-west passage became again, after a
                    long interval, a national object, and Lieutenant Franklin was appointed to the
                    “Trent,” as second to Captain Buchan of the “Dorothea,” hired vessels equipped
                    for penetrating to the north of Spitzbergen, and, if possible, crossing the
                    Polar Sea by that route. During a heavy storm, both ships were forced to seek
                    for safety by boring into the closely packed ice, in which extremely hazardous
                    operation the “Dorothea” was so much damaged that her reaching England became
                    doubtful; but the “Trent” having sustained less injury, Franklin requested to be
                    allowed to prosecute the voyage alone, or under Captain Buchan, who had the
                    power of embarking in the “Trent” if be chose. The latter, however, declined to
                    leave his officers and men at a time when the ship was almost in a sinking
                    condition, and directed Franklin to convoy him to England. Though success did
                    not attend this voyage, it brought Franklin into personal intercourse with the
                    leading scientific men of London, and they were not slow in ascertaining his
                    peculiar fitness for the command of such an enterprise. To calmness in danger,
                    promptness and fertility of resource, and excellent seamanship, he added other
                    qualities less common, more especially an ardent desire to promote science for
                    its own sake, and not merely for the distinction which eminence in it confers,
                    together with a love of truth that led him to do full justice to the merits of
                    his subordinate officers, without wishing to claim their discoveries as a
                    captain’s right. Added to this, he had a cheerful buoyancy of mind, which,
                    sustained by religious principle of a depth known only to his most intimate
                    friends, was not depressed in the most gloomy times. It was, therefore, with
                    full confidence in his ability and exertions that he was, in 1819, placed in
                    command of an expedition appointed to travel through Rupert’s Land to the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0755-0720"/> shores of the Arctic Sea, while Lieutenant Parry
                    was despatched with two vessels to Lancaster Sound. At this period, the northern
                    coast of America was known at two isolated points only, viz., the mouth of the
                    Coppermine River, discovered by Hearne,—but placed erroneously by him four
                    degrees of latitude too much to the north,—and the mouth of the Mackenzie.
                    Lieutenant Franklin, accompanied by a surgeon, two midshipmen, and a few
                    Orkney-men, embarked for Hudson’s Bay, in June 1819. His instructions left the
                    route he was to pursue much to his own judgment, guided by the information he
                    might be able to collect at York Factory from the Hudson’s Bay Company’s
                    servants there assembled. Wintering the first year on the Saskatchewan, the
                    expedition was fed by the Hudson’s Bay Company; the second winter was spent on
                    the “barren grounds,” the party subsisting on game and fish procured by their
                    own exertions, or purchased from their native neighbours; and in the following
                    summer the expedition descended the Coppermine River, and surveyed a
                    considerable extent of the sea coast to the eastward. The survivors of this
                    expedition travelled, from their start at York Factory to their return to it
                    again, by land and water, 5550 miles. While engaged on this service, Franklin
                    was promoted to be a commander, and after his return to England in 1822 he
                    obtained the post rank of captain, and was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society. In the succeeding year he married Eleanor, the youngest daughter of Mr
                    Porden, an eminent architect.</p>
                <p>In a second expedition, which left home in 1825 (his wife dying within the same
                    year), Franklin descended the Mackenzie and traced the coast-line through 37
                    degrees of longitude, from the mouth of the Coppermine River, where his former
                    survey commenced, to near the 150th meridian, and approaching within 160 miles
                    of the most easterly point attained by Captain Beechey, who was co-operating
                    with him from Behring’s Strait. His exertions were fully appreciated at home and
                    abroad. He was knighted in 1829, received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the
                    university of Oxford, was awarded the gold medal of the Geographical Society of
                    Paris, and was elected in 1846 correspondent of the Paris Academy of Sciences.
                    Though the surveys executed by himself and by a detachment under command of Dr
                    Richardson comprised one, and within a few miles of two, of the spaces for which
                    a parliamentary reward was offered, the Board of Longitude declined making the
                    award; but a bill was soon afterwards laid before parliament by the secretary of
                    the Admiralty abrogating the reward altogether, on the ground of the discoveries
                    contemplated having been thus effected. The results of these expeditions are
                    described by Franklin and his companion Dr (afterwards Sir John) Richardson in
                    two magnificent works published in 1824-29. In 1828 he married his second wife,
                    Jane, second daughter of Mr John Griffin. His next official employment was on
                    the Mediterranean station, in command of the “Rainbow,” and his ship soon became
                    proverbial in the squadron for the happiness and comfort of her officers and
                    crew.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The sailors, with
                    their usual fondness for epithets, named the ship the “Celestial Rainbow" and
                    “Franklin’s Paradise.”</p></note> As an acknowledgment of the essential service
                    he had rendered off Patras in the “war of liberation,” he received the Cross of
                    the Redeemer of Greece from King Otho, and after his return to England he was
                    created Knight Commander of the Guelphic order of Hanover.</p>
                <p>In 1836 Sir John accepted the lieutenant-governorship of Van Diemen’s Land (now
                    Tasmania). His government, which lasted till the end of 1843, was marked by
                    several events of much interest. One of his most popular measures was the
                    opening of the doors of the legislative council to the public. He also
                    originated a college, endowing it largely from his private funds with money and
                    lands, in the hope that it would eventually prove the means of affording to all
                    parties secular and religious instruction of the highest kind. He requested Dr
                    Arnold to select some one competent to take the direction of this institution;
                    and the choice fell on the Rev. John Philip Gell. In his time also the colony of
                    Victoria was founded by settlers from Tasmania; and towards its close,
                    transportation to New South Wales having been abolished, the convicts from every
                    part of the British empire were sent to Tasmania. On an increase to the
                    lieutenant-governor’s salary being voted by the colonial legislature, Sir John
                    declined to derive any advantage from it personally, while he secured the
                    augmentation to his successors. In 1838 he founded a scientific society at
                    Hobart Town (now called the “Royal Society of Tasmania ”), the meetings of which
                    were held in Government House, and its papers printed at his expense. He
                    welcomed eagerly the various expeditions for exploration and surveying which
                    visited Hobart Town under command of Captains Wickham, Stokes, Owen Stanley, and
                    others. Conspicuous among these, and of especial interest to himself, were the
                    French and English Antarctic expeditions of Dumont D’Urville and Sir James C.
                    Ross,—the latter commanding the “Erebus” and “Terror,” with which the name of
                    Franklin was to be for ever so pathetically connected. A magnetic observatory,
                    fixed at Hobart Town as a dependency of the central establishment under Colonel
                    Sabine, was an object of deep interest up to the moment of his leaving the
                    colony.</p>
                <p>Thus pleasantly occupied, the years allotted to a colonial governorship drew to a
                    close. Franklin had passed through phases of difficulty common to all governors
                    of colonics remote from the imperial centre; and it was impossible for an
                    impartial and high-minded ruler to avoid collision with personal interests. But
                    that his unflinching efforts for the social as well as the political advancement
                    of the colony were already appreciated was abundantly proved by the affection
                    and respect universally testified by the addresses which proceeded from every
                    section of the community, and by the demonstrations from all classes on his
                    departure. A local newspaper, describing the scene in much detail, adds, “Thus
                    departed from among us as true and upright a governor as ever the destinies of a
                    British colony were entrusted to.” That this was no evanescent feeling is
                    attested by the fact that several years afterwards the colonists showed their
                    remembrance of his virtues and services by sending to Lady Franklin a
                    subscription of £1700 in aid of her efforts in the search fortheir former
                    governor, and later still by a unanimous vote of the legislature for the
                    erection of a statue in honour of him at Hobart Town.</p>
                <p>Sir John found, on reaching England, that the confidence of the Admiralty in him
                    was undiminished, as was shown by his being offered in 1845 the command of an
                    expedition for the discovery of the North-West passage; this offer he accepted.
                    The prestige of Arctic service and of his former experiences attracted a crowd
                    of volunteers of all classes, from whom were selected a body of officers
                    conspicuous for talent and energy. Thus supported, with crews carefully chosen
                    (some of whom had been engaged in the whaling service), victualled for three
                    years, and furnished with every appliance then known, Franklin’s expedition,
                    consisting of the “Erebus” and “Terror” (134 officers and men), with a transport
                    ship to convey additional stores as far as Disco in Greenland, sailed from
                    Greenhithe on the 19th of May 1845. The ships were last seen on the 26th of July
                    in Baffin’s Bay by a whaler which was moored to an iceberg in lat. 74° 48' N.
                    and long. 66° 13' W.; and at that time the expedition was proceeding
                    prosperously. Letters written by Franklin a few days <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n756/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0756-0721"/> previous to that date were couched in language of
                    cheerful anticipation of success, while those received from his officers
                    expressed their glowing hope, their admiration of the seaman-like qualities of
                    their commander, and the happiness they had in serving under him.</p>
                <p>Franklin’s instructions were framed (in conjunction with Sir John Barrow and upon
                    his own suggestions) by the eminent explorers with whom his former work had.
                    closely connected him. The experience of Parry made it evident that a fresh
                    attempt to force ships through the heavy ice seen by him to the south-west of
                    Nfelville Island would be futile, as his since been fully proved. On the other
                    hand, Franklin’s surveys of the north coast of America had long before satisfied
                    him that a navigable passage existed along it, from the Fish River to Behring’s
                    Strait. He was therefore directed to pursue a course towards the coast after he
                    had approached the longitude of about 98° W., and was allowed the single
                    alternative of previously examining Wellington Channel if the navigation were
                    open. An explicit prohibition was given against a westerly course beyond the
                    longitude of 98° W.</p>
                <p>In 1817, though there was no real public anxiety as to the fate of the
                    expedition, preparations began to be made for the possible necessity of
                    succouring the explorers. As time passed, however, and no tidings of the
                    expedition reached England, the search began in earnest; expedition after
                    expedition was despatched in quest of them in 1848 and succeeding years,
                    regardless of cost or hazard. In this great national undertaking Sir John’s
                    heroic wife took a part which will ennoble her name for all time Between 1818
                    and 1854 about fifteen expeditions were sent out by England and America in the
                    hope of rescuing, or at least finding traces of, the missing explorers. The
                    details <hi rend="italic">A</hi> the work done by those expeditions will be
                    given in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Polar Regions</hi>; here we shall
                    confine ourselves to the results, so far as the search for Franklin w as
                    concerned. Lady Franklin’s exertions were unwearied; she exhausted her private
                    funds in sending out auxiliary vessels to quarters not comprised in the public
                    search, and by her pathetic appeals she roused the sympathy of the whole
                    civilized world. Traces of the missing ships were discovered by Ommanney and
                    Penny in August 1850, and were brought home by the “Prince Albert,” fitted out
                    by Lady Franklin with the especial object of following to the southward the
                    route which ’ would be almost certainly taken by Franklin in carrying out his
                    instructions. It was thus ascertained that the first winter had been spent
                    behind Beechey Island, where they had remained at least as late as April 1846.
                    No further tidings were obtained until the spring of 1854, when Dr Rae, then
                    conducting an exploring party of the Hudson’s Bay Company from Repulse Bay, was
                    told by the Eskimo that (as was inferred) in 1850 white men, to the number of
                    about forty, had been seen dragging a boat over the ice near the north shore of
                    King William’s Island, and that later in the same season, but before the
                    breaking up of the ice, the bodies of the whole party were found by the natives
                    at a point a short distance to the north-west of Back’s Great Fish River, where
                    they had perished from the united effects of cold and famine. The latter
                    statement was afterwards disproved by the discovery of skeletons upon the
                    presumed line of route; but indisputable proof was given that the Eskimo had
                    communicated with members of the missing expedition, by the various articles
                    obtained from them and brought home by Dr Rae, who, on his return to England,
                    claimed, and succeeded in obtaining, the reward of £10,000 offered by the
                    Admiralty in 1849, “to any party or parties who, in the judgment of the Board of
                    Admiralty, shall, by virtue of his or her efforts, first succeed in
                    ascertaining” the fate of the missing expedition. On account of the information
                    obtained by Dr Rae, a party in two canoes under Messrs Anderson and Stewart was
                    in 1855 sent by Government down the Great Fish River, and they succeeded in
                    obtaining from the Eskimo at the mouth of the river a considerable number of
                    articles which had evidently belonged to the Franklin expedition; and many
                    others were picked up on Montreal Island, articles evidently belonging to a boat
                    which, it was reported, had been cut up by the Eskimo. This expedition was
                    unable to make so thorough a search as was desirable, but it was clear from the
                    results obtained by it, and from the examinations which had been made by the
                    many other expeditions of all straits and inlets and coasts except the region to
                    the north of Great Fish River, that King William’s Island,'the west coast of
                    Boothia, and the neighbouring sea were the fields likely to yield the most
                    satisfactory results. It was clear that a party from the “Erebus” and “Terror”
                    had endeavoured to reach by the Fish River route the settlements of the Hudson
                    Bay Company, and equally evident that the expedition in making a southerly
                    course had been arrested within the channel into which the Great Fish River
                    empties itself. At this time Government was wholly taken up with the events in
                    the East, and when the war was over, it was deemed useless to spend any more
                    money and risk any more lives in what was regarded as a hopeless quest. But Lady
                    Franklin’s pious devotion to the memory of her noble husband prompted her to
                    make one last effort to ascertain his fate; to this object she dedicated all her
                    available means, aided, as she had been before, by the subscriptions of
                    sympathizing friends, her judgment being confirmed by the opinion of all those
                    best able to form one as to the hopefulness as well as the feasibility of such
                    an attempt. Accordingly she purchased and fitted out the little yacht “Fox,”
                    which sailed from Aberdeen in July 1857; the command was accepted by Captain
                    (afterwards Sir) Leopold M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clintock, whose high
                    reputation had been won in three of the Government expeditions sent out in
                    search of Franklin. Having been compelled to pass the first winter in Baffin’s
                    Bay, it was not till the autumn of 1858 that the expedition passed down Prince
                    Regent’s Inlet, and the “Fox” put into winter quarters at Port Kennedy at the
                    eastern end of Bellυt Strait, between North Somerset and Boothia Felix. In the
                    spring of 1859 three sledging parties went out, Captain (now Sir) Allen Young to
                    examine Prince of Wales Island, Lieutenant (now Captain) Hobson the north and
                    west coasts of King William’s Island, and M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Clintock the east and south coasts of the latter, the west coast of Boothia, and
                    the region about the mouth of Great Fish River. The search was successful so far
                    as ascertaining the course and fate of the expedition is concerned. From the
                    Eskimo in Boothia many relics were obtained, and reports as to the fate of the
                    ships and men; all along the west and south coast of King William’s Island
                    remains of articles belonging to the ships were discovered, and skeletons that
                    told a terrible tale of disaster. Above all, in a cairn at Point Victory a
                    precious record was discovered by Lieut. Hobson that briefly told the history of
                    the expedition up to April 25, 1848, three years after it set out full of hope.
                    In 1845-6 the “Erebus” and “Terror” wintered at Beechey Island on the S.W. coast
                    of North Devon, in lat. 74° 43' 28'' N.,long. 9T 39' 15" W., after having
                    ascended Wellington Channel to lat. 77 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> and
                    returned by the west side of Cornwallis Island. This statement was signed by
                    Graham Gore, lieutenant, and Charles F. Des Voeux, mate, and bore date May
                    28,1847. These two officers and six men, it was further told, left the ships on
                    May 24, 1847, no doubt for an exploring journey, at which time all was well.</p>
                <p>The success of the first year’s work, thus briefly stated, was greater than has
                    been since attained within any one <pb break="no"

                    permitted by Franklin’s instructions had been attempted but was not pursued, and
                    in the autumn of 1846 he followed that which was especially commended to him.
                    But on his attempting to reach the coast of America, the obstruction of heavy
                    ice, which presses down from Melville Island through M'Clintock Channel (not
                    then known to exist) upon King William’s Island had finally arrested his
                    progress. It must be remembered that in the chart carried out by Franklin this
                    island was laid down as a part of the mainland of Boothia, and he therefore
                    could pursue his way <hi rend="italic">only</hi> down its western coast. The
                    record that revealéd all which has been briefly stated was written upon one of
                    the forms supplied by the Admiralty to surveying vessels, to be thrown overboard
                    after the required data had been filled in. But upon the margin around the
                    printed form was an addendum dated the 25th April 1848, which extinguished all
                    hopes of a successful termination of their grand enterprise. The facts are best
                    conveyed by the terse and expressive words of the record, which is therefore
                    given <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>:—“April 25th 1848. H. Μ. Ships ‘Terror’
                    and ‘Erebus’ were deserted on 22d April, five leagues N.N.W. of this, having
                    been beset since 12th September 1846. The officers and crews, consisting of 105
                    souls under the command of Captain F. R. Μ. Crozier, landed here in lat. 69° 37'
                    42" N., long. 98° 4Γ W. Sir John Franklin died on the 11th June 1847; and the
                    total loss by deaths in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15
                    men.” The handwriting is that of Captain Fitzjames, to whose signature is
                    appended that of Captain Crozier, who also adds the words of chief importance,
                    namely, that they would “start on tomorrow 26th April 1848 for Back’s Fish
                    River.” A briefer record has never been told of so tragic a story. Thus it was
                    reserved for the latest effort of Lady Franklin to develop not only the fate of
                    her husband’s expedition, but also the steps of its progress up to crowning
                    success, mingled indeed with disaster almost unprecedented.</p>
                <p>All of the party had without doubt been greatly reduced through want of
                    sufficient food, and the injurious effects of three winters in these regions.
                    They had greatly overrated their strength in attempting to drag with them two
                    boats, besides heavily laden sledges, and doubtless had soon been compelled to
                    abandon much of their burden, and leave one boat on the shore of King William’s
                    Island, where it was found, near the middle of the west coast, by M'Clintock; it
                    contained two skeletons. From the Eskimo we learn that the men dropped down as
                    they walked, and often had to be left unburied. Although many relics were found
                    in possession of the Eskimo, there seems no reason to believe that the
                    retreating crews met with foul play. From all that can be gathered, one of the
                    vessels must have been crushed in the ice and the other stranded on the shore of
                    King William’s Island, where it lay for years, forming a mint of wealth for the
                    neighbouring Eskimo. MOlintock examined all the shores of the island with the
                    greatest care, but found no trace of a stranded vessel.</p>
                <p>This is all we know of the fate of Franklin and his brave men. His memory is
                    cherished as one of the most conspicuous of the naval heroes of Britain, and as
                    one of the most successful and daring of her explorers. He is certainly entitled
                    to the honour of being the first discoverer of the North-West Passage; the point
                    reached by the ships brought him to within a few miles of that attained from the
                    westward by the explorations of earlier years; he had -indeed all but traversed
                    the entire distance between Baffin’s Bay and Behring’s Strait. On the monument
                    erected to Franklin by his country, in Waterloo Place, London, the honour of
                    discovering the passage is justly awarded to him and his companions,—a fact
                    which was also affirmed by the president of the Royal Geographical Society, when
                    presenting to Lady Franklin in 1860 their gold medal. More recently a fine
                    monument, erected in 1875 in Westminster Abbey, commemorates the heroic deeds
                    and fate of Sir John Franklin, the death (which occurred in that year) of Lady
                    Franklin, and the inseparable connexion of her name with the fame of her
                    husband. Most of the Franklin relics brought home by MOlintock were presented by
                    Lady Franklin to the United Service Museum, while those given by Dr Rae to the
                    Admiralty are deposited in Greenwich Hospital· Captain Hall, so well known in
                    connexion with the “Polaris” expedition, spent five years with the Eskimo, and
                    made two journeys in endeavouring to trace the remnant of Franklin’s party,
                    bringing back in 1869 a number of additional relics and some information
                    confirmatory of that given by M'Clintock. In 1878 a search expedition was sent
                    out from America in consequence of a tale told to Mr Barry, the mate of a
                    whaler, by some Nechelli Eskimo met by him at Whale Point, Hudson’s Bay. He
                    obtained from these Eskimo some spoons bearing Franklin’s crest. The Eskimo were
                    understood to say that these were received from a party of white men, who passed
                    a winter near their settlement, and all died. The white men, the Eskimo stated,
                    left a number of books with writing in them, which were buried. The story has
                    some points about it that make one inclined to doubt its accuracy. Still it is
                    satisfactory that the search party has been sent out, and we can only hope that
                    it will be rewarded by discovering some of the records of the unfortunate
                    expedition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first
