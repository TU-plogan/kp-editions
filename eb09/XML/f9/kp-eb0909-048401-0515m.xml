                    have arrangements of human art at a point where the water emerges. Pure water is
                    so necessary to man, and the degree of plenty, constancy, and purity in which it
                    is procured, transported, prepared for use, and distributed in populous
                    districts is so fair a standard of civilization, that it hardly seems
                    unreasonable in Pausanias to put it among the criteria, asking, with reference
                    to Panopaeus, if that can rightly be called a city which has neither ruler,
                    gymnasium, forum, nor fountain of water. Among the Greeks we learn, mainly from
                    Pausanias, that fountains were very common in the cities; and springs being very
                    plentiful in Greece, little engineering skill was required to convey the water
                    from place to place. Receptacles of sufficient size were made for it at the
                    springs; and to maintain its purity, structures were raised inclosing and
                    covering the receptacle.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising that so beneficent an object as a spring of water should be
                    connected with religious belief. It is certain that until modern times fountains
                    have been in some way connected with the religion of the people among whom they
                    sprang, and dedicated to one or other of its personalities. In Greece they were
                    dedicated to gods and goddesses, nymphs and heroes, and were frequently placed
                    in or near temples. The references to fountains by <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0516-0485"/> Pausanias aro frequent, but he gives no full
                    descriptions. That of Pirene at Corinth (mentioned also by Herodotus) was formed
                    of white stone, and contained a number of cells from which the pleasant water
                    flowed into an open basin. Legend connects it with the nymph Pirene, who shed
                    such copious tears, when bewailing her son who had been slain by Diana, that she
                    was changed into a fountain. The city of Corinth possessed many fountains. In
                    one near the statues of Diana and Bellerophon, the water flowed through the
                    hoofs of the horse Pegasus. The fountain of Glauce, inclosed in the Odeum, was
                    dedicated to Glauce, because she was said to have thrown herself therein,
                    believing that its waters could counteract the poisons of Medea. Another
                    Corinthian fountain had a bronze statue of Neptune standing on a dolphin from
                    which the water flowed. The fountain constructed by Theagenes at Megara was
                    remarkable for its size and decorations, and for the number of its columns. One
                    at Lerna was surrounded with pillars, and the structure contained a number of
                    seats affording a cool summer retreat. Near Pharae was a grove dedicated to
                    Apollo, and in it a fountain of water. Pausanias gives a definite architectural
                    detail when he says that a fountain at Patrae was reached from without by
                    descending steps. Mystical, medicinal, surgical, and other qualities, as well as
                    supernatural origin, were ascribed to fountains. One at Cyanae near Lycia was
                    said to possess the quality of endowing all persons descending into it with
                    power to see whatever they desired to see; while the legends of fountains and
                    other waters with strange powers to heal are numerous in many lands. The
                    fountain Enneacrunus at Athens was called Callirrhoe before the time the water
                    was drawn from it by the nine pipes from which it took its later name. Two
                    temples were above it, according to Pausanias, one dedicated to Demeter and
                    Proserpine, and the other to Triptolemus. The fountain in the temple of
                    Erechtheus at Athens was supplied by a spring of salt water, and a similar
                    spring supplied that in the temple of Poseidon Hippias at Man tinea.</p>
                <p>Though no doubt most tribes of other than nomadic habits of life must have
                    contrived, in their settlements, appliances of some kind for maintaining the
                    supply of water constant and pure, very few remains of these have been found
                    that possess any degree of architectural importance. Layard mentions an Assyrian
                    fountain, found by him in a gorge of the river Gomel, which consists of a series
                    of basins cut in the solid rock, and descending in steps to the stream. The
                    water had been originally led from One to the other by small conduits, the
                    lowest of which was ornamented by two rampant lions in relief.</p>
                <p>The water-supply of Rome and the works auxiliary to it were on a scale to be
                    expected from a people of such great practical power. The remains of the
                    aqueducts which stretched from the city across the Campagna are amongst the most
                    striking monuments of Italy. Vitruvius (book viii.) gives minute particulars
                    concerning the methods to be employed for the discovery, testing, and
                    distribution of water, and describes the properties of different waters with
                    great care, proving the importance which was attached to these matters by the
                    Romans. The aqueducts supplied the baths and the public fountains, from which
                    last all the populace, except such as could afford to pay for a separate pipe to
                    their houses, obtained their water. These fountains were therefore of large size
                    and numerous. They were formed at many of the <hi rend="italic">castella</hi> of
                    the aqueducts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqueduct).</hi>. According to Vitruvius,
                    each <hi rend="italic">castellum</hi> should have three pipes,—one for public
                    fountains, one for baths, and the third for private houses. Considerable revenue
                    was drawn from the possessors of private water-pipes. The Roman fountains were
                    generally decorated with figures and heads. Fountains were often also the
                    ornament of Roman villas and country houses; in those so situated the water
                    generally fell from above into a large marble basin, with at times a second fall
                    into a still lower receptacle.</p>
                <p>To the remains of Pompeii we are indebted for much exact knowledge of Roman
                    antiquity in its minutest particulars; and not the least interesting of the
                    disinterred forms are those of the public and private fountains which the city
                    possessed. Two adjacent houses in Pompeii had very remarkable fountains. One,
                    says Gell, “is covered with a sort of mosaic consisting of vitrified tesserae of
                    different colours, but in which blue predominates. These are sometimes arranged
                    in not inelegant patterns, and the grand divisions as well as the borders are
                    entirely formed and ornamented with real sea-shells, neither calcined by the
                    heat of the eruption nor changed by the lapse of so many centuries” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pompeiana,</hi> i. 196). Another of large size was similarly
                    decorated with marine shells, and is supposed to have borne two sculptured
                    figures, one of which, a bronze, is said to be in the museum at Naples. This
                    fountain projects 5 feet 7 inches from the wall against which it is placed, and
                    is 7 feet wide in front, while the height of the structure up to the eaves of
                    the pediment is 7 feet 7 inches. On a central column in the piscina was a statue
                    of Cupid, with a dove, from the mouth of which water issued. Cicero had, at his
                    villa at Formiae, a fountain which was decorated with marine shells.</p>
                <p>Fountains were very common in the open spaces and at the crossways in Pompeii.
                    They were supplied by leaden pipes from the reservoirs, and had little ornament
                    except a human or animal head, from the mouth of which it was arranged that the
                    water should issue. Not only did simple running fountains exist, but the remains
                    of <hi rend="italic">jets dſeau</hi> have been found; and a drawing exists
                    representing a vase with a double jet of water, standing on a pedestal placed in
                    what is supposed to have been the impluvium of a house. There was also a <hi
                    rend="italic">jet d'eau</hi> at the eastern end of the peristyle of the
                    Fullonica at Pompeii</p>
                <p>As among the Greeks, so with the early Celts, traces of superstitious beliefs and
                    usages with relation to fountains can be traced in monumental and legendary
                    remains. Near the village of Primaleon in Brittany was a very remarkable
                    monument,—one possibly unique, as giving distinct proof of the existence of an
                    ancient cult of fountains. Here, according to Freminville, is a dolmen composed
                    of a horizontal table supported by two stones only, one at each end. All the
                    space beneath this altar is occupied by a long square basin formed of large flat
                    stones, which receives a fountain of water. At Lochrist is another vestige of
                    the Celtic cult of fountains. Beneath the church, and at the foot of the hill
                    upon which it is built, is a sacred fountain, near which is erected an ancient
                    chapel, which with its ivy-covered walls has a most romantic appearance. A
                    Gothic vault protects this fountain. Miraculous virtues are still attributed to
                    its water, and on certain days the country people still come with offerings to
                    draw it (see La Poix de Freminville, <hi rend="italic">Áivtiquités de la
                    Bretagne,</hi> i. 101). In the enchanted forest of Broche-lande, so famous from
                    its connexion with Merlin, was the fountain of Baranton, which was said to
                    possess strange characteristics. Whoever drew water from it, and sprinkled the
                    steps therewith, produced a tremendous storm of thunder and hail, accompanied
                    with thick darkness.</p>
                <p>The Christian missionaries could not easily overcome beliefs so planted in the
                    heart of the people, and so strengthened by daily practices. By a wise stroke,
                    whether of policy or instinct, finding themselves unable to eradicate the
                    superstitions which ascribed miraculous power to rocks and woods, streams and
                    fountains, and connected <pb break="no"

                    they changed their form and direction by dedicating these objects to the Virgin
                    and to saints, so making the force of the old belief an instrument for its own
                    overthrow.</p>
                <p>Fountains were attached to the new religion by the erection of statues of the
                    Virgin or of saints upon the possibly rude structures that collected the water
                    and preserved its purity. There is some uniformity in the architectural
                    characteristics of these structures during the Middle Ages. A very common form
                    in rural districts was that in which the fountain was reached by descending
                    steps <hi rend="italic">(fontaine grotte).</hi> A large basin received the
                    water, sometimes from a spout, but often from the spring itself. This basin was
                    covered by a sort of porch or vault, with at times moulded arches and sculptured
                    figures and escutcheons. On the bank of the Clain at Poitiers is a fountain of
                    this kind, the Fontaine Joubert, which though restored in 1597 was originally a
                    structure of the 14th century. This kind of fountain is frequently decorated
                    with figures of the Virgin or of saints, or with the family arms of its founder;
                    often, too, the water is the only ornament of the structure, which bears a
                    simple inscription. A large number of these fountains are to be found in
                    Brittany and indeed throughout France, and the great antiquity of some of them
                    is proved by the superstitions regarding them which still exist amongst the
                    peasantry. A form more common in populous districts was that of a large open
                    basin, round, square, polygonal, or lobed in form, with a columnar structure at
                    the centre, from the lower part of which it was arranged that spouts should
                    issue, playing into an open basin, and supplying vessels brought for the purpose
                    in the cleanest and quickest manner. The columns take very various forms, from
                    that of a simple regular geometrical solid, with only grotesque masks at the
                    spouts, to that of an elaborate and ornate Gothic structure, with figures of
                    virgins, saints, and warriors, with mouldings, arches, crockets, and finials. At
                    Provins there is a fountain said to be of the 12th century, which is in form an
                    hexagonal vase with a large column in the centre, the capital of which is
                    pierced by three mouths, which are furnished with heads of bronze projecting far
                    enough to cast the water into the basin. In the public market-place at Brunswick
                    is a fountain of the 15th century, of which the central structure is made of
                    bronze. Many fountains are still existing in France and Germany which, though
                    their actual present structure may date no earlier than the 15 th or 16th
                    century, have been found on the place of, and perhaps may almost be considered
                    as restorations of, pre-existing fountains. Except in Italy few fountains are of
                    earlier date than the 14th century. Two of that date are at the abbey of
                    Fontaine Daniel, near Mayenne, and another, of granite, is at Limoges. Some of
                    these Middle Age fountains are simple, open, reservoirs inclosed in structures
                    which, however plain, still carry the charm that belongs to the stone-work of
                    those times. There is one of this kind at Cully, Calvados, walled on three
                    sides, and fed from the spring by two circular openings. Its only ornamentation
                    is a small empty niche with mouldings. At Lincoln is a fountain of the time of
                    Henry VIII., in front of the church of St Mary Wickford. At Durham is one of
                    octangular plan, which bears a statue of Neptune.</p>
                <p>The decay of architectural taste in the later centuries is shown by the fountain
                    of Limoges. It is in form a rock representing Mount Parnassus, upon which are
                    carved in relief Apollo, the horse Pegasus, Philosophy, and the Nine Muses. At
                    the top Apollo, in 16th century costume, plays a harp. Rocks, grass, and sheep
                    fill up the scene.</p>
                <p>About the earliest drawing of any drinking fountain in England occurs in Moxon’s

                    and set upon a composite column at Leadenhall corner, in the majoralty of Sir
                    John Dethick, Knight.” The water springs from the top and base of the column,
                    which stands upon a square pedestal and bears four female figures, one at least
                    of which represents the costume of the period. This fountain is referred to and

                    > i</hi> very common and quite secular objects. In the East they are a very
                    important institution. In Cairo alone there are 300. These “sebeels” are not
                    only to be seen in the cities, but are plentiful in the fields and villages, and
                    the great number of them endowed for the gratuitous supply of water to the
                    passengers is referred to by Lane as proving the possession by the Egyptians of
                    a benevolent and charitable character.</p>
                <p>Purely ornamental fountains and jets d’eau are found in or near many large
                    cities, royal palaces, and private seats. The Fontana di Trevi, at Rome, is very
                    large and very celebrated, but from an artistic point of view about as bad work
                    as could possibly be conceived. It was erected early in the last century under
                    Pope Clement XII., and has all the characteristics of decadence. La Fontana
                    Paolina and those in the piazza of St Peter’s are perhaps next in celebrity to
                    that of Trevi, and are certainly in better taste. At Paris, the Fontaine des
                    Innocens (the earliest) and those of the Place Royal, of the Champs Elysées, and
                    of the Place de la Concorde are the most noticeable. The fountain of the lions
                    and other fountains in the Alhambra Palace are, with their surroundings, a very
                    magnificent sight. The largest <hi rend="italic">jets</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    exception of the last, these are supplied from artificial elevated
                    reservoirs.</p>
