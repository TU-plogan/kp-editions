                    Newstead Abbey, which afterwards appeared on the title page of Moore’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Lord Byron.</hi> In early youth he travelled through a
                    great part of Britain, and in 1820 settled in London, where he proved an active
                    member of the British Association for the advancement of science. In 1827 he
                    distinguished himself as a traveller in Switzerland, and discovered the modern
                    route to the top of Mont Blanc. After the death of his mother in 1832, he gave
                    full scope to his natural bent, and passed the greater portion of each of the
                    next ten years in Italy or Greece, or on the shores of the Levant. The numerous
                    sketches he executed were largely used by Mr Murray in illustrating <hi
                    rend="italic">Childe Harold.</hi> In 1838 Fellows, induced by his passion for
                    natural beauty and his preference of a simple peasant life to an artificial
                    civilization, started for Asia Minor, where Smyrna was the centre of his
                    travels. His explorations of parts of the interior and south led him to
                    districts practically unknown to Europeans, and he thus discovered ruins of a
                    number of ancient cities which existed earlier than 300 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> He entered Lycia and explored the Xanthus from the mouth at Patara
                    upwards. Nine miles from Patara, he discovered the ruins of Xanthus, the ancient
                    capital of Lycia, finely situated on hills, and abounding in magnificent
                    remains. About fifteen miles further up he came upon the ruins of Tlos. After
                    taking sketches of the most interesting objects and copying a number of
                    inscriptions, he returned to Smyrna through Caria and Lydia. Actuated by
                    enlightened zeal, he soon brought his discoveries before European men of
                    letters; and the publication of <hi rend="italic">A Journal written during
                    anExcursion in Asia Minor</hi> (London, 1839) roused such strong interest in
                    England that Lord Palmerston, at the request of the British Museum authorities,
                    asked the English consul at Constantinople to get leave from the sultan to ship
                    a number of the Lycian works of art. Late in 1839 Fellows, under the auspices of
                    the British Museum, again set out for Lycia, accompanied by George Scharf, who
                    assisted him materially in sketching. This second visit issued in the discovery
                    of thirteen ancient cities, all enriched by works of art; and in 1841 appeared
                    <hi rend="italic">An Account of Discoveries in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycia,</hi><hi rend="italic">being a Journal kept during a Second Excursion in
                    A sia Minor.</hi> A third visit was made late in 1841, after Fellows had
                    obtained the “firman” by personal application at Constantinople; and he and his
                    party had the pleasure of pitching their tents under the town of Xanthus on the
                    30th of December. They shipped a number of works of art for England, and in the
                    fourth and most famous expedition (1844) twenty-seven cases of marbles were
                    despatched for the British Museum, where they are now to be seen in the Lycian
                    Saloon. The most noteworthy places on which the labours of Fellows cast a flood
                    of light are Xanthus, Pinara, Patara, Tlos, Myra, and Olympus. The theatres in
                    Lycian towns show the influence of the Greek drama among the so-called
                    “barbarians”; and Lycian sculpture and architecture almost rival the Greek
                    masterpieces. The arched tombs, one of which is in the British Museum, are
                    compared by Fellows to Gothic architecture. These tombs are very common in
                    Lycia. At <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0077-0068"/> Pinara, he says, “rises a singular round rocky
                    cliff literally specked all over with tombs.” For further information about
                    Lycia compare with the works of Fellows Leake’s <hi rend="italic">Asia

                    arc appended to the works of Fellows. In 1844 Fellows presented to the British
                    Museum his portfolios, accounts of his expeditions, and specimens of natural
                    history illustrative of Lycia. In 1845 he received the order of knighthood “as
                    an acknowledgment of his services in the removal of the Xanthian antiquities to
                    this country.” Fellows was twice married. He died in 1860.</p>
