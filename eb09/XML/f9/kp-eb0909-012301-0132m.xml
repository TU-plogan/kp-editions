                    he evinced a religious turn of mind from an early age, and he matriculated at
                    the university of Heidelberg with the intention of studying divinity. His
                    ardour, however, was soon diverted to metaphysical pursuits; he repaired to
                    Berlin, became an auditor of Hegel, and, in spite of his father’s vehement
                    opposition, devoted himself to the career of a teacher of philosophy. The
                    history of his life henceforward is that of his gradual emancipation from the
                    yoke he had thus imposed upon himself. Even his first work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thoughts on Death and Immortality</hi> (1830), exhibits the marked divergence
                    between his mental characteristics and those of the Hegelian school· The
                    conclusion, indeed, is Hegelian, but the author’s method is dogmatic rather than
                    dialectical, his cast of thought mystical, his phraseology original, animated
                    with humour and pathos, and strikingly concrete. His negation of personal
                    immortality rendered him obnoxious to the Government, and frustrated his
                    endeavours to obtain a professorship. His embarrassed manner and awkward
                    delivery debarred him from success a3 a private tutor and lecturer. After some
                    years of disappointment he renounced the attempt to gain a livelihood by
                    philosophy, and married a lady whose scanty dower, derived from a share in a
                    small manufactory, included free apartments in the castle of Bruckberg, and the
                    use of a vegetable garden and shooting in the adjacent woods. In these idyllic
                    circumstances the philosopher supported his family for nearly a quarter of a
                    century,—learning, as he declared, more from his peasant associates than he had
                    learned at the university. “Berlin opened my mouth, Bruckberg my eyes.” During
                    his early struggles and the period of his betrothal he had produced his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Modern Philosophy,</hi> a series of criticisms of
                    leading thinkers from Bacon to Leibnitz, and his monograph on Pierre Bayle, whom
                    he sets forth as the type of the antithesis between faith and knowledge. His
                    rupture with Hegelianism was first indicated in his <hi rend="italic">Critique
                    of Hegel</hi> (1839). It was grounded on his growing aversion to mere verbal
                    juggles, and his strengthening conviction that philosophical research must be
                    based upon the investigation of actual phenomena. The enthusiast for metaphysics
                    had ceased to be a metaphysician, and had become the mouthpiece of a reaction
                    the more remarkable from its independence of the contemporaneous development of
                    physical science. The phenomena with which Feuerbach dealt were nevertheless
                    wholly psychological. Those referring to the religious sentiment formed the
                    subject of his next and most celebrated work, <hi rend="italic">The Essence
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic">Wesen)</hi><hi rend="italic">of Christianity</hi>
                    (1841). In this famous treatise Feuerbach shows that every article of Christian
                    belief corresponds to some instinct or necessity of man’s nature, from which he
                    infers that it is the creation and embodiment of some human wish, hope, or
                    apprehension. The same process of interpretation is applied to natural religion
                    in his essay on that subject (1845), and in his lectures delivered at Heidelberg
                    during the revolutionary troublée of 1848 and 1849. This period of anarchy
                    promised for a moment to bring Feuerbach prominently before the world; the
                    inglorious collapse of the revolution gave an irrecoverable blow to his
                    influence. Notwithstanding his own very reserved attitude, he had become
                    identified in the public mind with the agitators who had made a watchword of his
                    name, and unjustly participated in their discredit. He returned to Brockberg,
                    and occupied himself partly in scientific research, partly in the composition of
                    his last important work, the <hi rend="italic">Theogoηy</hi> (1857). Days of
                    tribulation were now in store for him. Driven from his retreat at Bruckberg by
                    the failure of the manufactory on which he had so long depended, too proud to
                    implore aid, and incapable of writing for mere bread, he would have suffered the
                    extremity of want but for the unsolicited contributions of a few friends,
                    assisted shortly before his death by a public subscription. His intellectual
                    faculties were impaired by successive strokes of paralysis, and he had ceased to
                    take any active interest in human affairs when he expired on September 13,
                    1872.</p>
                <p>Feuerbach is a remarkable figure in the history of modern thought. As a
                    philosopher, he personifies at once the intellectual bankruptcy of mere verbal
                    metaphysics, and the reaction towards empiricism based on the actual observation
                    of nature and society. He reaches substantially the same conclusions as the
                    modern professor of physical science, but by a different path, and independently
                    reproduces the scientific spirit of Positivism, with a total suppression of its
                    sacerdotal element. As a writer on religion his position is ambiguous. Following
                    up the hint of one of the oldest Greek philosophers, he demonstrates that
                    religious ideas have their counterparts in human nature, and assumes that they
                    must be its product. “All theology is anthropology.” It does not seem to have
                    struck him that the proposition might equally well be inverted, and might afford
                    scope for a problem as insoluble as that concerning the priority of the owl and
                    the egg. His principal work, however, is rather remarkable for depth and truth
                    of feeling than exactness of reasoning; it wears indeed a semblance of logical
                    consecutiveness, but consists essentially of a series of aphorisms, enunciated
                    dogmati-cially, somewhat in the manner of Emerson. Ethically, his system has
                    done much good by its lofty views of human nature, and the consecration with
                    which it dignifies the most ordinary passages of human life; and not a little
                    harm by the encouragement which an anthropocentric theory necessarilyaffords to
                    excessive individual pretensions, and thus indirectly to political and social
                    discontent. Its strongest points are its vigorous grasp of reality, embodiment
                    of ideal aspirations in familiar forms, healthy optimism, and recognition of the
                    value of everything human as such. “Only in action,” said Feuerbach, “do we feel
                    ourselves free.” “Let us concentrate ourselves on what is real; and great men
                    will revive, and great actions return.” “Health is more than immortality.” His
                    antagonism to the idea of personal immortality is one of his <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0133-0124"/> most distinctive traits, but here as elsewhere he
                    deals with the problem solely from the psychological side. Hence he can neither
                    be classed with materialists norimmaterialists; and, with all his frank honesty
                    and uncompromising energy of language, the same duality of attitude
                    characterizes his position throughout. He is from one point of view irreligious,
                    from another deeply religious, logical and mystical, positive and speculative,
                    academically cultured and a man of the people.</p>
                <p>Feuerbach’s personal character was highly estimable, fully conformed to the
                    philosophic ideal in simplicity, independence, disinterestedness, and fidelity
                    to conviction. His erudition is extensive and accurate. He possessed no
                    brilliant or superficially attractive qualities; his manner was shy and
                    embarrassed, and his literary composition tardy and laborious. His style,
                    nevertheless, is sufficiently clear and even epigrammatic to make him a popular
                    writer in his own country, but hardly in any other. His chief work, though
                    translated by the first of living English prose writers, produced little
                    impression in England. Out of Germany he will be most esteemed by those who have
                    attained his results by other processes, and most memorable as an instance of
                    the empirical spirit of modern physical science asserting itself in the region
                    of abstract speculation, with little assistance from scientific study.</p>
                <p>Feuerbach’s <hi rend="italic">Essence of Christianity</hi> has been translated
                    into the principal European languages; the English version is by George Eliot.
                    His correspondence has been edited, with a confused and imperfect biography, by
