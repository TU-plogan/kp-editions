                    Ordinary fusel oil yields besides another isomeric amylic alcohol, boiling at
                    about 128°, and laevorotatory. The formation of amylic alcohol is stated by

                    prepared from fusel oil and from American petroleum agree in specific gravity
                    and boiling point, and are therefore to be regarded as identical. Variable
                    quantities of fusel oil, less or greater according to the stage of ripening,
                    exist in commercial spirits. Administered in small amount, it exercises a

                    alcohol were instantaneously fatal to them, and even diluted to as much as 500
                    times its bulk that body exercised on them a poisonous influence. The widely
                    different actions of common alcohol and of such compounds as the potato-oils in
                    intoxicating drinks, he points out, render it necessary to distinguish between
                    the excitable <hi rend="italic">ethylism</hi> produced by the former, and the
                    dull and heavy <hi rend="italic">amylism,</hi> or more properly <hi

                    from spirits, a matter of prime importance to the distiller, a great number of
                    methods have been resorted to. A practically pure spirit can be obtained by
                    rectification several times after dilution with water, or by the use of
                    specially constructed stills, as Coffey’s (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Distillation,</hi> vol. vii. pp. 265-6). Among the materials which have been
                    employed for the complete defuselation of spirit are the powder of freshly burnt
                    charcoal, which acts best when the vapour of the liquid is passed through it,
                    and charcoal with manganese peroxide, with slaked lime, and with soap-boilers’
                    lye; also saturated solution of chloride of lime, alone or with zinc chloride;
                    and calcium chloride, olive oil, soda-soap, and milk. The presence of fusel oil
                    in spirit may be suspected when the addition of four parts of water causes
                    milkiness. It is detected by its odour when the spirit is diluted with warm
                    water, or when its ethylic alcohol has been allowed to evaporate. To remove the
                    last-named body and water from fusel oil calcium chloride has been employed. The
                    estimation of the alcohols of fusel oil may be effected by Dupré’s process, in
                    which their corresponding acids are obtained by oxidizing with sulphuric acid
                    and potassium dichromate, and eventually the quantity of barium in the barium
                    salts of the purified acids is determined (see <hi rend="italic">Analyst,</hi>
                    Mar. 31, 1871). Fusel oil is employed in the arts as a source of amylic
                    alcohol.</p>
