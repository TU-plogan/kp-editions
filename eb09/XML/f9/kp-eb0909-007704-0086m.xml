                    imbibed strong anti-Protestant sentiments is said to have taken a solemn vow
                    before the altar that, on receiving the imperial crown, promised him by his
                    cousin Matthias IL, he would at whatever cost re-establish the Roman Catholic
                    religion throughout all his states. In 1618 Matthias abdicated the thrones of
                    Bohemia and Hungary in his favour, and on the death of Matthias in 1619 he laid
                    claim to the imperial crown. His keen Roman Catholic sympathies, allied to a
                    character gloomy, fanatical, and cruel, had already led him to disregard the
                    guarantees of toleration by which his election to the thrones of Bohemia and
                    Hungary had been acceded to; and on that account the Bohemians, shortly after
                    the death of Matthias, rose in revolt, and under the leadership of Count Thurn
                    besieged him in Vienna, until the arrival of an army under General Bouquoi
                    forced them to retreat, and enabled him to proceed to Frankfort to receive the
                    imperial crown. The Bohemians, notwithstanding their defeat, chose as their king
                    the elector-palatine Frederick V., son-in-law of James I. of England, and with
                    the assistance of Bethlen Gabor, prince of Transylvania, who revolted against
                    Ferdinand in Hungary, virtually inaugurated the long struggle for religious
                    liberty known as the Thirty Years’ War. Ferdinand, however, with the support of
                    the Catholic league and the alliance of John George I., elector of Saxony, was
                    able completely to subdue them after a short campaign, and having totally
                    defeated them near Prague, November 8, 1620, he deprived them of their
                    constitutional rights, banished the leading Protestant families, expelled the
                    Reformed preachers and recalled the Jesuits, and by cruel persecutions totally
                    quelled every manifestation of Protestant belief. But in Hungary he was not so
                    successful as to enable him to put such extreme measures into execution; on the
                    contrary, he thought it prudent to conclude a peace on the 3lst December 1621,
                    by which he agreed to cede one half of the country to Bethlen Gabor, and to
                    grant religious toleration to the other half. In Germany fortune was for a time
                    more favourable to the Roman Catholic cause; several of the German princes had
                    entered into a league with Christian IV. of Denmark, but that monarch was
                    defeated by Ferdinand’s general, Wallenstein, and a peace between him and
                    Ferdinand was concluded in 1629. Taking advantage of his opportunity, Ferdinand
                    in the same year passed the famous Edict of Restitution, which enforced the
                    restoration of all German ecclesiastical property that had passed into other
                    hands since the treaty of Passau in 1552. The full execution of the edict was,
                    however, prevented,—partly by the unwillingness of the Roman Catholic princes to
                    give up the property of -which they had becomed possessed, partly by the
                    intrigues of Cardinal Richelieu, who was jealous of the increasing influence of
                    the emperor, but principally through the arrival of Gustavus Adolphus. Uniting
                    with the Protestant princes of Germany, Gustavus inflicted a succession of
                    defeats on Ferdinand, who, having at the urgent representations of the Catholic
                    princes dismissed Wallenstein from the command of the imperial army, possessed
                    no general at all adequate to cope with the genius and energy of the king of
                    Sweden. Gustavus was subsequently joined by the elector of Saxony, and fortune
                    failed to smile on the arms of Ferdinand even after the recall of Wallenstein,
                    who was defeated at the battle of Lützen, 16th November 1632. The victory was
                    dearly bought by the death of the king of Sweden, <pb break="no"

                    great loss thus sustained by the Protestant cause; and the emperor, learning
                    that he finally meditated treachery, caused him to be assassinated, February 25,
                    1634. In the same year the imperial army was successful at the battle of
                    Nordlingen, and after this victory the elector of Saxony separated himself from
                    the Swedish alliance and made peace with Ferdinand; but the Swedes continuing
                    the struggle with great determination, and being afterwards joined by France,
                    Ferdinand, when he died on the 15th February 1637, was uncomforted by the hope
                    of any near fulfilment of the purpose expressed in his oath, and attempted by
                    such ruthless persecutions and at such an expense of treasure and of human
                    life.</p>
