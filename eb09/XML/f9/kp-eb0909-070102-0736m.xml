                    German writer of the Reformation period, was born about 1500 at Donauworth, and
                    regularly styled himself Franck of Word. Of his early years nothing is known
                    except by inference. It appears that he studied at Heidelberg, and about 1524
                    was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. In 1528 he married Ottilia Behaim at
                    Nuremberg; and the same year he produced his German translation of Althamer’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Diallage, or Reconciliation of the Contradictions of the
                    Scriptures,</hi> and wrote a treatise against the <hi rend="italic">Horrible
                    Vice of Drunkenness.</hi> Two years later appeared, with an introduction by
                    Luther, his translation of a <hi rend="italic">Chronicle and Description of
                    Turkey, written by a Transylvanian who had been Twenty-two Years in Turkish
                    Captivity.</hi> In 1531 he was in Strasburg, and published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronika,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitbuch, und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichtbibel,</hi> one of the first German works in which an attempt was made
                    to give a survey of universal history. From Strasburg he removed to Esslingen;
                    and there during 1532 and 1533 he attempted to support himself by soap-boiling,
                    but found it on the whole an unprofitable occupation. In hope of a better market
                    for his wares he went to Ulm, where in 1534 he received the freedom of the city.
                    For some time he remained peacefully printing his books, but on the publication
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Parodoxa</hi> his privileges were withdrawn, and he was
                    ordered to depart. A promise to submit his writings to censure procured a
                    temporary reprieve of the sentence, but in 1539 he was finally banished, and
                    from that time he appears never to have settled long in one place. He was
                    engaged as a printer and publisher at Basel when he died, in 1543 or 1545.
                    Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote also a collection of proverbs <hi
                    rend="italic">(Spruch-Wörter)</hi> in 1532, which appeared in fuller form in
                    1591, a <hi rend="italic">Germanice</hi><hi rend="italic">Chronicon,</hi> 1538,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Guldin Arch or</hi><hi rend="italic">Arca Aurea,</hi>
                    1538, a collection of Scripture doctrines with proof passages, not only from the
                    Bible itself, but also from pagan writers. Franck’s position as α thinker was a
                    peculiar one. Though associated at first with the Reformers, he soon showed that
                    he was out of sympathy with their dogmatic tendencies, and at length was branded
                    by Luther as a “devil’s mouth.” He was naturally inclined to subjectivity and
                    mysticism, and may to a certain extent be regarded as a forerunner of modern
                    German idealism. His religion was practically pantheistic, and tended to foster
                    a spirit of tolerance that found good in everything. Amid the bitter
                    controveries of contending sects it was rare to find a professed theologian
                    maintaining that the true church consisted of “all pious and good-hearted men in
                    all the world, even among the heathen.” As an historian, while still credulous
                    enough to believe in the Trojan myths of the Middle Ages, he displayed a
                    remarkably modern spirit in the attention he gave to social conditions. The
                    first part of his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon,</hi> &amp;c., contains the
                    history of antiquity, the second includes the period from Christ to Charles V.,
                    and the third gives account of the popes, councils, heretics, ceremonies,
                    &lt;fcc. His German style is plain, vigorous, and idiomatic, and ranks him high
                    among the founders of German prose.</p>
