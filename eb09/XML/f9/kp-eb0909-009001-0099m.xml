                    S.E. is 45 miles; its greatest breadth N.E. and S.W. is 29 miles. The area
                    extends to 457,369 statute acres, or 714^ square miles, of which 106,530 acres
                    are under tillage, 243,251 in pasture, 5909 in plantations, 55,248 in waste,
                    bog, mountain, &amp;c., and 46,431 under water. The county is divided into eight
                    baronies: viz., Clanawley, Clankelly, Coole, Knockninny, Lurg, Magheraboy,
                    Magherastephana, and Tirkennedy; and these are subdivided into 23 parishes, and
                    2183 townlands.</p>
                <p>The chief town in Fermanagh is Enniskillen, population (1871) 5836. The only
                    other towns of any importance are—Lisnaskea (857), Irvinestown, formerly
                    Lowtherstown (787), Maguire’s Bridge (685), Tempo (460), Newtownbutler (418),
                    Brookborough (390), Rosslea (371), Ederney (332), Belleek (327), Derrygonnelly
                    (302), Kesh (296), in all of which fairs are held and post-offices established.
                    The Irish North-Western division of the Great Northern Railway passes through
                    the most populous portion of the county, one branch connecting Enniskillen with
                    Clones, another connecting Enniskillen with Londonderry, <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Omagh, and a third connecting Enniskillen with Bundoran.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> Fermanagh is situated mostly in the
                    basin of the Erne, which divides the county into two nearly equal sections. It
                    presents a hilly, and in many parts a somewhat sterile appearance, though in the
                    main, and especially in the neighbourhood of Lough Erne, it is picturesque and
                    attractive. The climate though moist is healthy, and the people generally are
                    tall and robust. The chief mountains are Cuilcagh (partly in Leitrim and Cavan)
                    2188 feet high, Belmore 1312 feet, Glenkeel 1223, North Shean 1135, Tappahan
                    1110, Carnmore 1034. Tossett or Toppid and Turaw mountains command extensive
                    prospects, and form striking features in the scenery of the county. But the most
                    distinguishing feature of Fermanagh consists in the great extent of its surface
                    being occupied by the Upper and Lower Loughs Erne, which stretch for 45 miles
                    from S.E. to N.W. These lakes are formed by the expansion of the river Erne,
                    which enters the county from Cavan at Wattle Bridge, and spreads out its waters
                    in the Upper Lough, broken by innumerable islets. Contracting itself again, the
                    river flows in a meandering course to the town of Enniskillen, where it expands
                    itself once more in the Lower Lough, which extends in a N.W. direction for about
                    20 miles, till the river again issues from it a mile above Belleek. Of the two
                    loughs the lower and larger one is most famed for its picturesque scenery. Both
                    are dotted with many islands, the number of which has been stated as high as
                    199. The largest islands are Boa (or “<hi rend="italic">Cow</hi> ”),
                    Ennismacsaint, Devenish, Eagle, Innisnakill Gully, Cor, Ferney, Herring,
                    Innismore, and Bellisle. It is navigable throughout, during the winter season, a
                    small steamer plying between Enniskillen and Belleek. The other lakes next in
                    size are Loughs Melvin and Macnean on the border of Leitrim, and draining into
                    the Drowes river. The chief river is the Erne, which, rising in Cavan, passes
                    through Belturbet, Lough Erne, and Belleek on its way to the Atlantic, into
                    which it descends at Ballyshannon. At Belleek it forms a considerable waterfall,
                    well known to sportsmen for its good salmon-fishing. There are several mineral
                    springs in the county, some of them chalybeate, others sulphureous. At Belcoo,
                    near Enniskillen, there is a famous well called Daragh Phadric, held in repute
                    by the peasantry for its cure of paralytic and other diseases; and four miles
                    N.W. of the same town, at a place called “the Daughton,” are natural caves of
                    considerable size. The geological formation of the county may be described as
                    consisting mainly of secondary limestone and yellow sandstone. In the former
                    organic remains are plentiful, some fine specimens of encrinites being easily
                    obtainable. A brown marble excavated at Florence Court is beautifully veined,
                    and susceptible of a splendid polish. Grey marble has been found in the parish
                    of Killasher. Iron and coal have also been traced in various places, but only in
                    small quantities. The best iron ore mine is at Belleek.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industries—Agriculture, &lt;£'c.—</hi> With the exception of
                    the pottery works at Belleek, Fermanagh cannot boast of any distinguishing
                    manufactures. It is chiefly an agricultural county. Of the arable land about the
                    one-half is devoted to pasturage. Oats and potatoes are the crops most
                    extensively cultivated. The next in order are flax, turnips, wheat, barley, rye,
                    beans, and pease. The following table shows the number of acres under the
                    different crops during the years 1874 and 1877 :—</p>

                <p>The live stock (horses, cows, sheep, &amp;c.) in the county was valued in the
                    census of 1871 at £839,899, but this estimate was on the basis of the values
                    fixed by the census commissioners of 1841, and is therefore much below the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population of Fermanagh steadily
                    increased up till the year 1841. The famine and subsequent emigration
                    intervening between that year and the next parliamentary census (1851), the
                    population showed a decrease at the latter date of about 25 per cent, and since
                    1851 the decrease has continued. The exact decrease during the 30 years 1841 to
                    1871 is 40 ’ 69 per cent. In 1841 the population was 156,481; in 1851," 116,047;
                    in 1861, 105,768; in 1871, 92,794; and on the 31st December 1876 it was
                    estimated at 91,188. From the 1st May 1851 to 31st December 1876, the total
                    number of emigrants from Fermanagh was 34,776, or an average of 1337 per annum.
                    In 1871 55 per cent, of the population were returned as Catholics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> According to Ptolemy, the
                    aborigènes of this county were the <hi rend="italic">Hrdini.</hi> By the ancient
                    Irish it was called <hi rend="italic">Feor-rnagh-Eanagh</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> y</hi> or the “country of the lakes” (lit. “the mountain-valley
                    marsh district ”); and also <hi rend="italic">Magh-uire,</hi> or “the country of
                    the waters.” It was divided into two large portions—the one called Targoll, the
                    other Rosgoll. The latter was occupied by the <hi rend="italic">Guarii,</hi> the
                    ancestors of the MacGuires or Maguires, a name still very common in the
                    district. This tribe or family was so influential that for centuries the county
                    was called after them Maguire’s Country, and one of the towns still existing
                    bears their name, Maguire’s Bridge. Fermanagh was one of the six countiee which
                    reverted to the crown at the time of the flight of the earls of Tyrone and
                    Tyrconnell, and which were included in the well known scheme of colonization of
                    James I., the Plantation of Ulster. Among the principal Scotch and English
                    settlers at the period of the Plantation were Sir Stephen Butler, Sir Wm. Cole,
                    John Archdall, and Sir Gerard Lowther, from whom some of the towns and villages
                    in the county derived their names, and whose descendants form the leading gentry
                    to the present day. During the revolution of 1688 Fermanagh rendered signal
                    service to the cause of William III. by the gallant stand which its yeomen made
                    against the Irish army, and their descendants possess so much of the military
                    spirit of their forefathers as to make the title “Fermanagh men” still
                    Bynonymous with bravery and loyalty to the constitution. In the year 1689
                    battles were fought between William III.’s army and the Irish under Macarthy
                    (for James ∏.) at Lisnaskea (26th July) and Newtownbutler (30th July). The chief
                    place of interest to the antiquary is Devenish Isle in Lough Erne, about 2 J
                    miles N.W. from Enniskillen. It contains about 80 acres of very fertile pasture
                    land, and has long been celebrated for its romantic situation and ecclesiastical
                    ruins. Near the remains of the abbey of St Mary, founded in the 6th century by
                    St Laserian (called also Molaisse or Molush), is one of the best specimens of
                    Ireland’s round towers. It is 82 feet high and</p>
                <p>49 in circumference, with an ingeniously constructed conical roof. About half a
                    century ago it was carefully repaired, and is now in excellent preservation.
                    Pursuant to “Tho Irish Church Act, 1869,” both the round tower and the abbey
                    have been vested in the secretary of the commissioners of public works in
                    Ireland to be preserved as national monuments. In various places throughout the
                    county may be seen the ruins of several ancient castles, Danish raths, and
                    tumuli, in which last have been found at times urns and stone coffins. At
                    Wattlebridge, near Newtownbutler, are the remains of a Druidical temple. (w. <hi
