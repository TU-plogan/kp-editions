                <p><label type="entry">FRERE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Hookham</hi></label>
                    (1769-1841), an English diplomatist and author, was born in London, May 21,
                    1769. His father, John Frere, a gentleman of a good Suffolk family, had been
                    educated at Caius College, Cambridge, and would have been senior wrangler in
                    1763 but for the powerful competition of Paley; his mother, daughter of Mr John
                    Hookham, a rich London merchant, was a lady of no small ability and culture,
                    accustomed to amuse her leisure with the pleasures of versification; and his
                    father’s sister Ellinor was married to Sir John Fenn, the learned editor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Paston Letters,</hi> and contributed with her own pen to the
                    formation of a library of fiction for children. Young Frere was sent to Eton in
                    1785, and there began that intimacy with Canning which so greatly affected his
                    after life. From Eton he went to his father’s college at Cambridge, and
                    graduated B.A. in 1792 and M.A. in 1795. He entered public service in the
                    foreign office under Lord Grenville, and sat from 1796 to 1802 as member of
                    parliament for the close borough of Looe in Cornwall. From his boyhood he had
                    been a warm admirer of Pitt, and along with Canning he entered heart and soul
                    into the defence of his Government, and contributed freely to the pages of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin.</hi> On Canning’s removal to the board of trade
                    in 1799 he succeeded him as under secretary of state; in October 1800 he was
                    appointed envoy extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lisbon; and on September
                    1802 he was transferred to Spain, where he remained for two years. He was
                    recalled on account of a personal disagreement he had with the “Prince of
                    Peace,” but his conduct was approved by the ministry, and in 1808 he was again
                    sent out as plenipotentiary to Ferdinand VII. The condition of Spain rendered
                    his position a very responsible and difficult one, but had it not been for one
                    unfortunate step he would have left the country with greatly increased
                    reputation. When Napoleon began to advance on Madrid it became a matter of
                    supreme importance to decide whether Sir John Moore, who was then in the north
                    of Spain, should endeavour to anticipate the occupation of the capital or merely
                    make good his retreat, and if he did retreat whether he should do so by Portugal
                    or by Galicia. Frere was strongly of opinion that the bolder was the better
                    course, and he urged his views on Sir John Moore with an urgent and fearless
                    persistency that on one occasion at least overstepped the limits of his
                    commission. After the disastrous retreat to Corunna, the public accused Frere of
                    having by his advice endangered the British army, and though no direct censure
                    was passed upon his conduct by the Government, he was called home, and the
                    Marquis of Wellesley was appointed in his place. Thus ended Frere’s public life.
                    He afterwards refused to undertake an embassy to St Petersburg, and twice
                    declined the honour of a peerage. In 1816 he married Elizabeth Jemima, dowager
                    countess of Erroll, and in 1820, on account of her failing health, he went with
                    her to the Mediterranean. There he finally settled in Malta, and though he
                    afterwards visited England more than once, the rest of his life was for the most
                    part spent in the island of his choice. In quiet retirement he devoted himself
                    to various literary labours, studied his favourite Greek authors, and taught
                    himself Hebrew and Maltese. His hospitality was well known to many an English
                    guest, and his charities and courtesies endeared him to his Maltese neighbours;
                    and when he died in 1841, his loss was evidently regarded by rich and poor as a
                    common calamity.</p>
                <p>Frere’s literary ability was early displayed. He was a contributor at Eton to the
                    school magazine known as the <hi rend="italic">Microcosm,</hi> and gained the
                    members’prize at Cambridge in 1792 by an essay on the strange question, “Whether
                    it were possible to hope for improvement in morals and the cultivation of virtue
                    in the rising republic of Botany Bay ?” During the first period of his public
                    life he was one of the chief writers in the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin,</hi>
                    contributing, among other pieces, “The Loves of the Triangles,” a clever parody
                    of Darwin’s “Loves of the Plants,” and sharing with Canning the honour of “The
                    Needy Knife-Grinder” and “The Rovers.” In 1817 he published a mock-heroic poem
                    entitled, <hi rend="italic">Prospectus and Specimen of an intended National Work
                    by William and Robert Whistlecraft, of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Stow∙Markct,</hi><hi rend="italic">in Suffolk, Harness and Collar makers,
                    intended to comprise the most interesting particulars relating to King Arthur
                    and his Round Table.</hi> It attracted considerable attention at the time, and
                    though it was afterwards comparatively forgotten, it served to bring again into
                    fashion the octave stanza of the Italians, and formed, as far at least as its
                    versification was concerned, the acknowledged model of Byron’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bcppo.</hi> Much greater importance attached to the translations of
                    Aristophanes, by which indeed Frere occupies an almost unrivalled position in
                    English literature. The principles according to which lie conducted his task
                    were elucidated in an article on Mitchell’s <hi rend="italic">Aristophanes,</hi>
                    which he contributed to <hi rend="italic">The Quarterly Review,</hi> vol. xxiii.
                    The translations of <hi rend="italic">The Acharnians, The Knights, The
                    Birds,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Frogs</hi> were privately printed, and
                    were first brought into general notice by Sir G. Comewall Lewis in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Classical Museum for</hi> 1847. They were followed some time after
                    by <hi rend="italic">Theognis Restitutus,</hi><hi rend="italic">or the personal
                    history of the poet</hi><hi rend="italic">Theognis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >reduced from an analysis of his existing fragments.</hi> Frere’s complete works
                    were published in 1871, with a memoir by his nephews, W. E. and Sir Bartie
                    Frere, and reached a second edition in 1874. Compare also an article in the <hi
                    rend="italic">North American Review,</hi> vol. cvii∙, 1868.</p>
