                <p><label type="entry">FREDERICK WILLIAM IV</label>. (1795-1861), king of Prussia,
                    the son of Frederick William III., was bora on the 15th October 1795. He took an
                    active part in the War of Liberation, and in 1814 spent some time in Paris, in
                    whose museums and picture galleries he acquired a warm ]ove of art. On returning
                    to Berlin he cultivated his artistic tastes under the guidance of Rauch and
                    Schinkel, receiving at the same time instruction in jurisprudence and finance
                    from Savigny and other distinguished teachers. He married Princess Elizabeth of
                    Bavaria in 1823, but had no children. As he was known to be cultivated,
                    intelligent, and generous, high hopes were formed respecting his reign; and
                    these hopes were fostered by his first acts as king, for he conceded greater
                    freedom of the press than had been allowed under his father, granted an amnesty
                    to political prisoners, and invited to his capital some of the leading writers
                    and artists of the day. He soon, however, disappointed popular expectations. He
                    was a lover rather of large phrases than of great actions, being very willing to
                    benefit his subjects, but on condition that they should accept what he offered
                    them as the gift of an absolute ruler. In 1847 he assembled at Berlin a united
                    diet, made up of representatives of the provincial diets established by his
                    father, and created intense discontent by proclaiming that he would not allow a
                    constitution to stand between him and his people. The revolutionary movement of
                    1848 took him wholly by surprise, and he was so alarmed that he not only
                    promised to institute parliamentary government, but placed himself at the head
                    of the agitation for the unity of Germany. When, however, in 1849 the national
                    assembly at Frankfort offered him the title of emperor, he declined it. He
                    formed an alliance with Hanover and Saxony for the purpose of creating a new
                    German constitution, and summoned a national parliament atr Erfurt. Austria
                    insisted on the old Frankfort diet being re-established, and for a time war
                    appeared to be imminent. Ultimately, by the treaty of Olmütz (1850) Austria
                    prevailed. In 1850 the Prussian constitution was proclaimed, but it was
                    interpreted in a narrow sense, and under the reactionary ministry of Manteuffel
                    some of its most essential provisions were soon changed. In 1848 Neufchatel had
                    been incorporated with Switzerland. Certain royalists having attempted in 1856
                    to secure it again for the king of Prussia, they were seized by the Swiss
                    authorities and accused of high treason. After some angry negotiations they were
                    given up, and Frederick William then formally resigned all claims to the
                    country. On his way back from Vienna in the summer of 1857 he had a stroke of
                    paralysis in Dresden; in October of the same year he had a second stroke in
                    Berlin. From this time, with the exception of brief intervals, his mind was
                    clouded, and the duties of government were undertaken by his brother William,
                    who on October 7, 1858, was formally recognized as regent. The king spent the
                    winter of 1858— 59 in Rome, where his health occasionally improved, but when he
                    returned to Berlin in November 1860, his end was seen to be near, and he died at
                    Sanssouci on the night of January 2, 1861.</p>
