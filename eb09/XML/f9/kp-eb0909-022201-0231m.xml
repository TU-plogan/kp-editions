                <p><label type="entry">FIR</label>, the name originally given by our Scandinavian
                    forefathers to the Scotch piue <hi rend="italic">(Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sylvestris),</hi> is at present not unfrequently employed as a general term for
                    the whole of the true Conifers <hi rend="italic">(Abietinae)·,</hi> but, in a
                    more exact sense, it has been transferred to the “spruce” and “silver firs,” the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Picea</hi> of most
                    modern botanists.</p>
                <p>The firs are distinguished from the pines and larches by having their needle-like
                    leaves placed singly on the shoots, instead of growing in clusters from a sheath
                    or abortive branch. Their cones are composed of thin, rounded,
                    closely-imbricated scales, furnished in some species with bracts springing from
                    the base. The trees have usually a straight trunk, and a tendency to a conical
                    or pyramidal growth,—throwing out each year a more or less regular whorl of
                    branches from the foot of the leading shoot, while the buds of the lateral
                    boughs extend horizontally.</p>
                <p>In the Spruce Firs <hi rend="italic">(Abies),</hi> the cones are pendent when
                    mature and their scales persistent; the leaves are arranged all round the
                    shoots, though the lower ones are sometimes directed laterally. In the sub-genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Picea,</hi> the Silver Firs, the cones are erect, and their
                    scales drop off when the seed ripens; the leaves are placed in distinct rows on
                    each side of the shoot.</p>
                <p>The most important of the firs, in an economic sense, is the Norway Spruce <hi
                    rend="italic">(Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa),</hi> so well known in
                    British plantations, though rarely attaining there the gigantic height and
                    grandeur of form it often displays in its native woods. Under favourable
                    circumstances of growth it is a lofty tree, with a nearly straight, tapering
                    trunk, throwing out in somewhat irregular whorls its wide-spreading branches,
                    densely clothed with dark, clear green foliage. The boughs and their
                    side-branches, as they increase in length, have a tendency to droop, the lower
                    tier, even in large trees, often sweeping the ground,—a habit that, with the
                    jagged sprays, and broad, shadowy, wave-like foliagemasses, gives a peculiarly
                    graceful and picturesque aspect to the Norway spruce. The slender, sharp,
                    slightly curved leaves are scattered thickly around the shoots; the upper ones
                    pressed towards the stem, and the lower directed sideways, so as to give a
                    somewhat flattened appearance to the individual sprays. The elongated,
                    cylindrical cones grow chiefly at the ends of the upper branches; they are
                    purplish at first, but become afterwards green, and eventually light brown;
                    their scales are slightly toothed at the extremity; they ripen in the autumn,
                    but seldom discharge their seeds until the following spring.</p>
                <p>The tree is very widely distributed, growing abundantly on most of the mountain
                    ranges of northern and central Europe; while in Asia it occurs at least as far
                    east as the Lena, and in latitude extends from the Altaic ranges to beyond the
                    Arctic circle. On the Swiss Alps it is one of the most prevalent and striking of
                    the forest trees, its dark evergreen foliage often standing out in strong
                    contrast to the snowy ridges and glaciers beyond. In the lower districts of
                    Sweden it is the predominant tree in most of the great forests that spread over
                    so large a portion of that country. In Norway it constitutes a considerable part
                    of the dense woods of the southern dales, flourishing, according to Schübeler,
                    on the mountain slopes up to an altitude of from 2800 to 3100 feet, and clothing
                    the shores of some of the fjords to the water’s edge; in the higher regions it
                    is generally mingled with the pine. Less abundant on the western side of the
                    fjelds, it again forms woods in Nordland, extending in the neighbourhood of the
                    coast nearly to the 67th parallel; but it is, in that arctic climate, rarely met
                    with at a greater elevation than 800 feet above the sea, though in Swedish
                    Lapland it is found on the slope of the ,Sulitelma as high as 1200 feet, its
                    upper limit being everywhere lower than that of the pine. In all the
                    Scandinavian countries it is known as the <hi rend="italic">Gran</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Grann.</hi> Great tracts of low country along the southern shores
                    of the Baltic and in northern Russia are covered with forests of spruce. It
                    everywhere shows a preference for a moist but well-drained soil, and never
                    attains its full stature or luxuriance of growth upon arid ground, whether on
                    plain or mountain—a peculiarity that should be remembered by the planter. In a
                    favourable soil and open situation it becomes the tallest and one of the
                    stateliest of European trees, rising sometimes to a height of from 150 to 170
                    feet, the trunk attaining a diameter of from 5 to 6 feet at the base. But when
                    it grows in dense woods, where the lower branches decay and drop off early, only
                    a small head of foliage remaining at the tapering summit, its stem, though
                    frequently of great height, is rarely more than IJ or 2 feet <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0232-0223"/> in thickness. Its growth is rapid, the straight
                    leading shoot, in the vigorous period of the tree, often extending 2£ or even 3
                    feet in a single season. In its native habitats it is said to endure for several
                    centuries; but in those countries from which the commercial supply of its timber
                    is chiefly drawn, it attains perfection in from 70 to 90 years, according to
                    soil and situation.</p>
                <p>In the most prevalent variety of the Norway spruce the wood is white, apt to be
                    very knotty when the tree has grown in an open place, but, as produced in the
                    close northern forests, often of fine and even grain. Immense quantités are
                    imported into Britain from Norway, Sweden, and Prussia, under the names of
                    “white Norway,” “Christiania,” and “Danzig deal.” The larger trees are sawn up
                    into planks and battens, much used for the purposes of the builder, especially
                    fcr flooring, joists, and rafters. Where not exposed to the weather, the wood is
                    probably as lasting as that of the pine, but, not being so resinous, appears
                    less adapted for out-door uses. Of late years great quantities have been sent
                    from Sweden in a manufactured state, in the form of door and window-frames and
                    ready-prepared flooring, and much of the cheap “white deal” furniture is made of
                    this wood. The younger and smaller trees are remarkably durable, especially when
                    the bark is allowed to remain on them; and most of the poles imported into
                    Britain for scaffolding, ladders, miningtimber, and similar uses are furnished
                    by this fir. Small masts and spars are often made of it, and are said to be
                    lighter than those of pine. The best poles, according to Monteath, are obtained
                    in Norway from small, slender, drawn-up trees, growing under the shade of the
                    larger ones in the thick woods, these being freer from knots, and tougher from
                    their slower growth. A variety of the spruce, abounding in some parts of Norway,
                    produces a red heartwood, not easy to distinguish from that of the Norway pine
                    (Scotch fir), and imported with it into England as “red deal” or “pine.” This
                    kind is sometimes seen in plantations, where it may be recognized by its
                    shorter, darker leaves, and longer cones. The smaller branches and the waste
                    portion of the trunks, left in cutting up the timber, are exported as fire-wood,
                    or used for splitting into matches, an industry that has lately sprung up in
                    Sweden. Recently, the wood of the spruce has been employed in the manufacture of
                    paper-stuff, being first reduced to a state of fine division, and then deprived
                    of its resin by long boiling in alkaline solutions,—an application that will
                    probably be considerably extended with the wider employment of paperpulp in the
                    useful arts.</p>
                <p>The resinous products of the Norway spruce, though yielded by the tree in less
                    abundance than those furnished by the pine, are of considerable economic value.
                    In Scandinavia a thick turpentine oozes from cracks or fissures in the bark,
                    forming by its congelation a fine yellow resin, known commercially as “spruce
                    rosin,” or “frankincense”; it is also procured artificially by cutting off the
                    ends of the lower branches, when it slowly exudes from the extremities. In
                    Switzerland and parts of Germany, where it is collected in some quantity for
                    commerce, a long strip of bark is cut out of the tree near the root; the resin,
                    that slowly accumulates during the summer, is scraped out in the latter part of
                    the season, and the slit enlarged slightly the following spring to ensure a
                    continuance of the supply. The process is repeated every alternate year, until
                    the tree no longer yields the resin in abundance, which under favourable
                    circumstances it will do for twenty years or more. The quantity obtained from
                    each fir is very variable, depending on the vigour of the tree, and greatly
                    lessens after it has been subjected to the operation for some years. Eventually
                    the tree is destroyed, and the wood rendered worthless for timber, and of little
                    value even for fuel. From the product so obtained most of the better sort of
                    “Burgundy pitch” of the druggists is prepared. The resin collected from the fir
                    is melted and boiled in water, then filtered through a sackcloth bag, and left
                    to congeal in a cask beneath; nearly half the original amount of resin is
                    obtained in this purified condition. Its chief employment is for plasters, much
                    used in disorders of the chest and other complaints in which a mild stimulant to
                    the skin is required. It is often applied in conjunction with the spruce-rosin
                    itself and other ingredients. Much of the so-called Burgundy pitch of the shops
                    is, according to Pereira, a compound of common rosin, palm oil, and water. By
                    distillation with water the resin of the spruce yields oil of turpentine; but
                    only a comparatively small quantity of that of commerce is obtained from this
                    source, and it is considered inferior to that yielded by the pine and larch. By
                    the peasantry of its native countries the Norway spruce is applied to
                    innumerable purposes of daily life. The bark and young cones afford a tanning
                    material, inferior indeed to oak-bark, and hardly equal to that of the larch,
                    but of value in countries where substances more rich iu tannin are not abundant.
                    In Norway the sprays, like those of the juniper, are scattered over the floors
                    of churches and the sitting-rooms of dwelling-houses, as a fragrant and
                    healthful substitute for carpet or matting. The young shoots are also given to
                    oxen in the long winters of those northern latitudes, when other green fodder is
                    hard to obtain. In times of scarcity the Norse peasant-farmer uses the sweetish
                    inner bark, beaten in a mortar and ground in his primitive mill with oats or
                    barley, to eke out a scanty supply of meal, the mixture yielding a tolerably
                    palatable though somewhat resinous substitute for his ordinary <hi rend="italic"
                    >flad∙brod.</hi> A decoction of the buds in milk or whey is a common household
                    remedy for scurvy; and the young shoots or green cones form an essential
                    ingredient in the spruce-beer drank with a similar object, or as an occasional
                    beverage. The well-known “Danzig-spruce” is prepared by adding a decoction of
                    the buds or cones to the wort or saccharine liquor before fermentation. Similar
                    preparations are in use wherever the spruce fir abounds. The wood is burned for
                    fuel, its heat-giving power being reckoned in Germany about onefourth less than
                    that of beech. From the wide-spreading roots string and ropes are manufactured
                    in Lapland and Bothnia: the longer ones which run near the surface are selected,
                    split through, and then boiled for some hours in a ley of "wood-ashes and salt,
                    which, dissolving out the resin, loosens the fibres and renders them easily
                    separable, and ready for twisting into cordage. Light portable boats are
                    sometimes made of very thin boards of fir, sewn together with cord thus
                    manufactured from the roots of the tree.</p>
                <p>The Norway spruce seems to have been the “Picea” of Pliny, but is evidently often
                    confused by the Latin writers with their “Abies,” the <hi rend="italic">Picea
                    pectinata</hi> of modern botanists. From an equally loose application of the
                    word “fir” by our older herbalists, it is difficult to decide upon the date of
                    introduction of this tree into Britain; but it was commonly planted for
                    ornamental purposes in the beginning of the 17th century. In places suited to
                    its growth it seems to flourish nearly as well as in the woods of Norway or
                    Switzerland; but as it needs for its successful cultivation as a timber tree
                    soils that might be turned to agricultural account, it is not so well adapted
                    for economic planting in Britain as the Scotch fir or larch, which come to
                    perfection in more bleak and elevated regions, and on comparatively barren
                    ground, though it may perhaps be grown to advantage on some moist hill-sides and
                    mountain hollows. Its great value to the English forester is as a “nurse” for
                    other trees, for which its dense leafage and tapering form render it admirably
                    fitted, as it protects, without overshading, the young saplings, and yields
                    saleable <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0233-0224"/> stakes and small poles when cut out. For
                    hop-poles it is not so well adapted as the larch. As a picturesque tree, for
                    park and ornamental plantation, it is among the best of the conifers, its colour
                    and form contrasting yet harmonizing with the olive green and rounded outline of
                    oaks and beeches, or with the red trunk and glaucous foliage of the pine. When
                    young its spreading boughs form good cover for game. The fresh branches, with
                    their thick mat of foliage, are useful to the gardener for sheltering wallfruit
                    in the spring. In a good soil and position the tree sometimes attains an
                    enormous size: one in Studley Park, Yorkshire, was, a few years back, nearly 140
                    feet in height, and the trunk more than 6 feet in thickness near the ground. The
                    spruce bears the smoke of great cities better than most of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abietinae;</hi> but in suburban localities after a certain age it soon loses
                    its healthy aspect, and is apt to be affected with blight <hi rend="italic"
                    >fEriosomà),</hi> though not so much as the Scotch fir and most of the
                    pines.</p>
                <p>The Black Spruce (.-16⅛s <hi rend="italic">nigra)</hi> is a tree of more formal
                    growth than the preceding. The branches grow at a more acute angle and in more
                    regular whorls than those of the fir of Norway; and, though the lower ones
                    become bent to a horizontal position, they do not droop, so that the tree has a
                    much less elegant appearance. The leaves, which grow very thickly all round the
                    stem, are short, nearly quadrangular, and of a dark greyish green. The cones,
                    produced in great abundance, are short and oval in shape, the scales with rugged
                    indented edges; they are deep purple when young, but become brown as they ripen.
                    The tree abounds throughout New England, Nova Scotia, and all the countries
                    around the St Lawrence, in Canada growing up to 65°,—in all these regions often
                    forming a large part of the dense forests. A variety with lighter foliage and
                    reddish bark is common in Newfoundland and some districts on the mainland
                    adjacent. The trees usually grow very close together, the slender trunks rising
                    to a great height bare of branches; but they do not attain the size of the
                    Norway spruce, being seldom taller than 60 or 70 feet, with a diameter of 1⅜ or
                    2 feet at the base. This species prefers a peaty soil, and often grows
                    luxuriantly in very moist situations. The wood is strong, light, and very
                    elastic, forming an excellent material for small masts and spars, for which
                    purpose the trunks are used in America, and exported largely to England. The
                    sawn timber is inferior to that of <hi rend="italic">A. excelsa,</hi> besides
                    being of a smaller size. In the countries in. which it abounds, the log-houses
                    of the settlers are often built of the long straight trunks. The spruce-beer of
                    America is generally made from the young shoots of this tree. The small twigs,
                    tied in bundles, are boiled for some time in water with broken biscuit or
                    roasted grain; the resulting decoction is then poured into a cask with molasses,
                    or maple sugar, and a little yeast, and left to ferment. It is often made by the
                    settlers and fishermen of the St Lawrence countries, being esteemed as a
                    preventive of scurvy. The American “essence of spruce,” occasionally used in
                    England for making spruce-beer, is obtained by boiling the shoots and buds and
                    concentrating the decoction. The resinous products of the tree are of no great
                    value.</p>
                <p>The White Spruce <hi rend="italic">(Abies alba),</hi> sometimes met with in
                    English plantations, is a tree of lighter growth than the black spruce, the
                    branches bcihg more widely apart; the foliage is of α light glaucous green; the
                    small light-brown cones are more slender and tapering than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. nigra,</hi> and the scales have even edges. It is of comparatively small
                    size, but is of some importance in the wilds of the Canadian dominion, where it
                    is found further north than any other tree, growing up to at least 69°; the
                    slender trunks yield the only useful timber of some of the more desolate
                    northern regions. In the woods of Canada it occurs frequently, mingled with the
                    black spruce and other trees. The fibrous tough roots, softened by soaking in
                    water, and split, are used by the Indians and voyageurs to sew together the
                    birch-bark covering of their canoes; and a resin that exudes from the bark is
                    employed to varnish over the seams.</p>
                <p>The Hemlock Spruce <hi rend="italic">(A. canadensis)</hi> is a large tree,
                    abounding in most of the north-eastern parts of America up to Labrador; in Lower
                    Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia it is often the prevailing tree. The
                    short leaves are flat, those above pressed close to the stem, and the others
                    forming two rows; they are of a rather light green tint above, whitish beneath.
                    The cones are very small, ovate, and pointed. The large branches droop, like
                    those of the Norway spruce, but the sprays are much lighter and more slender,
                    rendering the tree one of the most elegant of the conifers, especially when
                    young. When old, the branches, broken and bent down by the winter snows, give it
                    a ragged but very picturesque aspect. The trunk is frequently three feet thick
                    near the base. The hemlock prefers rather dry and elevated situations, often
                    forming woods on the declivities of mountains. The timber is very much twisted
                    in grain, and liable to warp and split, but is used for making plasterers’ laths
                    and for fencing; “shingles” for roofing are sometimes made of it. The bark,
                    split off in May or June, forms one of the most valuable tanning substances in
                    Canada. The sprays are sometimes used for making spruce-beer and essence of
                    spruce.</p>
                <p>The Douglas Spruce <hi rend="italic">(A. Douglasü)</hi> is one of the finest
                    trees of the genus, often rising to a height of 200 feet and sometimes
                    considerably more, while the gigantic trunk frequently measures 8 or 10 feet
                    across. The yew-like leaves spread laterally, and are of a deep green tint; the
                    cones are furnished with tridentate bracts that project far beyond the scales.
                    It forms extensive forests in Vancouver’s Island, British Columbia, and Oregon,
                    whence the timber is exported, being highly prized for its strength, durability,
                    and even grain, though very heavy; it is of a deep yellow colour, abounding in
                    resin, which oozes from the thick bark. It was introduced into Britain soon
                    after its discovery by Douglas, and has been planted in some parts of the
                    kingdom experimentally, but does not appear to flourish well in the climate of
                    England generally, though individual plants may be occasionally seen in good
                    condition in ornamental shrubberies.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Picea</hi> group, the Silver Fir <hi rend="italic">(P.
                    pectinata)</hi> may be taken as the type,—a lofty tree, rivalling the Norway
                    spruce in size, with large spreading horizontal boughs curving upward towards
                    the extremities. The flat leaves are arranged in two regular, distinct rows;
                    they are deep green above, but beneath have two broad white lines, which, as the
                    foliage in large trees has a tendency to curl upwards, give it a silvery
                    appearance from below. The large cones stand erect on the branches, are
                    cylindrical in shape, and have long bracts, the curved points of which project
                    beyond the scales. When the tree is young the bark is of a silvery grey, but
                    gets rough with age. This tree appears to have been the true “Abies” of the
                    Latin writers—the “pulcherrima abies” of Virgil. From early historic times it
                    has been held in high estimation in the south of Europe, being used by the
                    Romans for masts and all purposes for which timber of great length was required.
                    It is at present abundant in most of the mountain ranges of southern and central
                    Europe, but is not found in the northern parts of that continent. In Asia it
                    occurs on the Caucasus and Ural, and in some parts of the Altaic chain.
                    Extensive woods of this fir exist on the southern Alps, where the tree grows up·
                    to nearly 4000 feet; in the Rhine countries it forms great part of the extensive
                    forest of the Hochwald, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n234/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0234-0225"/> and occurs in the Black Forest aud in the Vosges;
                    it is plentiful likewise on the Pyrenees and Apennines. The wood is inferior to
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa,</hi> but, being
                    soft and easily worked, is largely employed in the countries to which it is
                    indigenous for all the purposes of carpentry. Articles of furniture are
                    frequently made of it, and it is in great esteem for carving and for the
                    construction of stringed instruments. Deficient in resin, the wood is more
                    perishable than that of the spruce fir when exposed to the air, though it is
                    said to stand well under water. The bark contains a large amount of a fine,
                    highly-resinous turpentine, which collects in tumours on the trunk during the
                    heat of summer. In the Alps and Vosges, this resinous semi-fluid is collected by
                    climbing the trees, and pressing out the contents of the natural receptacles of
                    the bark into horn or tin vessels held beneath them. A fter purification by
                    straining, it is sold as “Strasburg turpentine,” much used in the preparation of
                    some of the finer varnishes. Burgundy pitch is also prepared from it by a
                    similar process as that from <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >excelsa.</hi> A fine oil of turpentine is distilled from the crude material;
                    the residue forms a coarse rosin. Introduced into Britain in the 17th century,
                    the silver fir has become common there as a planted tree, though, like the
                    Norway spruce, it rarely comes up from seed scattered naturally. There are many
                    fine trees in Scotland; one near Roseneath, figured by Strutt in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Sylva Britannica,</hi> then measured more than 22 feet round the
                    trunk. In the more southern parts of the island it often reaches a height of 90
                    feet, and specimens exist considerably above that size; but the young shoots are
                    apt to be injured in severe winters, atid the tree on light soils is also hurt
                    by long droughts, so that it usually presents a ragged appearance; though, in
                    the distance, the lofty top and horizontal boughs sometimes stand out in most
                    picturesque relief above the rounded summits of the neighbouring trees. The
                    silver fir flourishes in a deep loamy soil, and will grow even upon stiff clay,
                    when well drained—a situation in which few conifers will succeed. On such lands,
                    where otherwise desirable, it may sometimes be planted with profit. The cones do
                    not ripen till the second year.</p>
                <p>The Silver Fir of Canada (P. <hi rend="italic">bcdsameſ),</hi> a small tree
                    resembling the last species in foliage, furnishes the “Canada balsam” used in
                    medicine, and highly valued by the microscopist as a “mounting” medium. It is
                    obtained from natural swellings or receptacles in the bark, like the resin of
                    the common silver fir. The tree abounds in Lower Canada and the adjacent
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>Numerous other firs are common in gardens and shrubberies, and some furnish
                    valuable products in their native countries; but they are not yet of sufficient
                    economic or general interest to demand mention here. (c. p. J.)</p>
