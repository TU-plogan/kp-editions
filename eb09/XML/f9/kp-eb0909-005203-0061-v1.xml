                        >Barthélemi</hi></label> (1741- 1819), French geologist and traveller, was
                    bornât Montélimart, May 17, 1741. He was educated at the Jesuits’ College at
                    Lyons; and, showing in his boyhood much poetic sensibility and a propensity to
                    versifying, he received from some of his worldly-wise elders the earnest
                    warning,—If you would succeed, don’t make verses. He appears to have submitted
                    to this counsel; for he went to Grenoble and applied himself to the study of
                    law, and was admitted advocate to the parliament. He rose to be president of the
                    seneschal’s court (1765), a post which he honourably filled, but the duties of
                    which became before long intolerably irksome, for his feeling for nature was not
                    extinguished, and his favourite relaxation was found in visits to the Alps. His
                    final bent, however, was not to the poetic but to the scientific interpretation
                    of nature. In his frequent Alpine rambles he was amassing observations and
                    facts, the full value of which could only be known at a later time. Geology was
                    in its infancy, had scarcely even a name, when Faujas began his studies of the
                    forms, structure, composition, and superposition of rocks, nor was it possible
                    for him to divine how vast the science that was to arise upon the foundation of
                    the facts of which he was so keen and so diligent an observer. In 1776 he put
                    himself in communication with Buffon, who was not slow to perceive that the
                    humble labours of Faujas would be of great service to him <pb break="no"

                    work. Invited by Buffon to Paris, he quitted the law, and was appointed by Louis
                    XVI. assistant naturalist to the museum, to which office was added some years
                    later (1785, 1788) that of royal commissioner for mines. In 1775 he had
                    discovered in the Velay a rich mine of pozzuolana, which he opened, and which
                    was largely worked by the Government. One of the most important of his works was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les volcans eteints du Vivarais et du
                        Velay,</hi> which appeared in 1778. In this work, rich in facts and
                    observations, he developed his theory of the origin of volcanoes. In his
                    capacity of commissioner for mines Faujas travelled in almost all the countries
                    of Europe, everywhere devoting his chief attention to the surface of the globe,
                    and the nature and constituents of the rocks composing it. It was he who first
                    called attention to the basaltic formation of the cave of Fingal (Staffa). He
                    sustained heavy losses during the early years of the Revolution, but for these
                    ho was in 1797 indemnified by a grant made by the council of five hundred.
                    Having been nominated in 1793 professor at the Jardin des Plantes, he held this
                    post till he was nearly eighty years of age, retiring in 1818 to his estate in
                    Dauphin^. Faujas took a warm interest in the balloon experiments of the brothers
                    Montgolfier, and published a very complete <hi rend="italic">Description des
                        experiences de la machine aerostatique de MM. Montgolfier,</hi> &amp;c.
                    (1783,1784). He contributed many scientific memoirs to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Annales</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Memoir es</hi> of the museum of
                    natural history. Among his separate works, in addition to those already named
                    are— <hi rend="italic">Histoire naturelie de la province du Dauphine</hi> (1781,
                    1782); <hi rend="italic">Mineralogie des Volcans</hi> (1784); <hi rend="italic"
                        >Voyage en Angleterre, en Ecosse, et aux Iles Hebrides</hi> (1797); and <hi
                        rend="italic">Essai de geologic</hi> (1803-1809). Faujas died at his estate
                    of Saint-Fond in Dauphin^, July 18, 1819.</p>
