                    flourished from 1423, and to have held many civil and religious offices, but was
                    not related to the patrician family Fuss. The name was always written Fust,
                    until in 1506 Johann Schöffer, in dedicating the German translation of Livy to
                    the emperor Maximilian, called his grandfather Faust. After that the family
                    called themselves Faust, and the Fausts of Aschaffenburg, an old and quite
                    distinct family, placed John Fust in their pedigree as one of their most
                    distinguished ancestors. John’s brother Jacob, a goldsmith, was appointed
                    baumeister of the town in 1445, and was first burgomaster in 1462, when Mainz
                    was stormed and sacked by the troops of Count Adolf of Nassau. There is no
                    evidence that, as is commonly asserted, John Fust was himself a goldsmith. He
                    appears to have been a money-lender or banker and speculator, better known for
                    prudence than for uprightness and disinterestedness. His connexion with
                    Gutenberg, who is now generally, though not universally, admitted to be the real
                    inventor of printing, has been very variously represented, and Fust has been put
                    forward by some as the inventor of typography, and the instructor as well as the
                    partner of Gutenberg, by others as his patron and benefactor, who saw the value
                    of his discovery and had the courage to supply him with means to carry it out.
                    This view has been the most popular; but during the present century Fust has
                    been frequently painted as a greedy and crafty speculator, who took advantage of
                    Gutenberg’s necessity and robbed him of the fruits of his invention. Gutenberg,
                    many years resident in Strasburg, where he was long engaged in the experiments
                    and attempts which resulted in his discovery of typography, is not known to have
                    been there after 1444. His uncle Henne (or Johann) Gutenberg, senior, on 28th
                    October 1443 took the house in Mainz called Zum Jungen, where Gutenberg
                    afterwards carried on printing. Having already exhausted his own resources in
                    his long-continued and costly experiments, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n889/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0889-0854"/> Gutenberg, through his cousin Albrecht Gelthuss
                    zum Echtzeller, borrowed lδθ florins in Mainz 6th October 1448. This sum was
                    quite insufficient for his purposes, and on 22d August 1459, as appears from the
                    amount of interest afterwards claimed, he made an agreement with Fust, who was
                    to advance him 800 gold florins to make and procure his tools and materials,
                    which were to be security for the loan. Fust was also to give him 300 florins a
                    year for expenses, wages, house rent, parchment, paper, ink, &lt;fcc. They were
                    to divide the profits equally, and if they wished to separate, Gutenberg was to
                    return the 800 florins, and the materials were to cease to be security. Fust was
                    to have half the profits, being both holder of a mortgage and partner in the
                    firm. Gutenberg carried on the business at Zum Jungen, where he lived. It is
                    difficult to ascertain precisely what books were printed while the partnership
                    lasted. They first printed, says Trithemius, a vocabulary called <hi
                    rend="italic">Catholicon.</hi> This was not the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon</hi> of Johannes de Janua, a folio of 748 pages, 66 lines to a full
                    page, printed in 1460, and now considered to be the work of Gutenberg alone, but
                    was probably a small glossary for children, now lost; they also printed <hi
                    rend="italic">Donatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de octo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >partibus orationis,</hi> 27 lines to a page, of which two leaves were
                    discovered in Mainz in the original binding of an account book of 1451. Their
                    greatest work was the Latin Bible known as the <hi rend="italic">Bible of</hi>
                    42 <hi rend="italic">lines,</hi> because a page contains 42 lines, and also as
                    the Mazarin Bible, because the first copy described was found in the library of
                    Cardinal Mazarin. It was finished at latest in 1455, and is a folio of 1282
                    printed pages, with spaces left for the illumination of initials, and is in much
                    smaller type than the famous and much-disputed <hi rend="italic">Bible of</hi>
                    36 <hi rend="italic">lines,</hi> also called the <hi rend="italic">Bamberg
                    Bible,</hi> because nearly all the known copies were found in the neighbourhood
                    of Bamberg. It is also calledÄcÄeZAorn’s <hi rend="italic">Bible,</hi> because
                    Schelhorn described it in 1760 as the oldest printed Latin Bible, and <hi
                    rend="italic">PfistePs Bible,</hi> because ascribed to Albert Pfister, a printer
                    of Bamberg, who used the same type for printing many small German books, the
                    chief of which is Boner’s <hi rend="italic">Edelstein,</hi> 1461, 4to, 88
                    leaves, 85 woodcuts, a book of fables in German rhyme. But many eminent
                    bibliographers believe this Bible to have been printed by Gutenberg, who used
                    the same type in the Letters of Indulgence of 1454, and in the 27-line Donatus
                    of 1451. The types used by Pfister are evidently old and worn, except those of
                    the additional letters required for German, <hi rend="italic">k,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ιv, 2,</hi> which are clear and sharp like the types used in the
                    Bible. Ulric Zell states, in the Cologne Chronicle of 1499, that Gutenberg and
                    Fust printed the Bible in large type like that used in missals. It has been said
                    that this description applies to the 42-line Bible, as its type is as large as
                    that of most missals earlier than 1500, and that the size now called missal type
                    (double pica) was not used in missals until late in the 16th century. This is no
                    doubt true of the smaller missals printed before 1500, some of which are in even
                    much smaller type than the 42-line Bible. But many of the large folio missals,
                    as that printed at Mainz by Peter Schöffer in 1483, the Carthusian missal
                    printed at Spires by Peter Drach about 1490, and the Dominican missal printed by
                    Andrea de Torresanis at Venice in 1496 are in as large type as the 36-line
                    Bible. It required scarcely less than such a work, says Madden, to induce Fust
                    to advance such large sums of money. Some other smaller works were printed by
                    the partners, as the Papal Letters of Indulgence of 1454-5, granted 12th April
                    1451 by Nicolas V, in aid of John II., king of Cyprus, against the Turks, and
                    probably many now lost. Peter Schöffer of Gernsheim, between Mainz and Mannheim,
                    who was a copyist in Paris in 1449, and who is called by Fust his servant
                    (famulus), is said by Trithemius to have discovered an easier way of founding
                    characters. Lambin et and others have concluded from this that Schöffer invented
                    the punch. Schöffer himself, in the colophon of the Psalter of 1457, a work
                    which probably was planned and partly printed by Gutenberg, claims only the mode
                    of printing rubrics and coloured capitals. Didot believes that Schöffer
                    discovered the <hi rend="italic">movable</hi> mould, and that Gutenberg alludes
                    to this discovery and to Schöffer’s youth when he says in the colophon of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Catholiaeon</hi> of 1460 that God reveals to babes what He
                    hides from the wise. Fust, quite unexpectedly as it seems, and before the
                    profits of the undertaking could be realized, brought a suit against Gutenberg
                    to recover the money he had lent, claiming 2026 florins for principal and
                    interest He had made a second loan of 800 florins in 1452, but had not paid the
                    300 florins a year, and, according to Gutenberg, had said that he had no
                    intention of accepting interest The suit was decided in Fust’s favour, 6th
                    November 1455, in the great refectory of the Barefooted Friars of Mainz, when
                    Fust made oath by all the saints that he had borrowed 1550 florins and given
                    them to Gutenberg. Fust removed the portion of the printing materials covered by
                    his mortgage, which did not include the types of the 36-line Bible, to a house
                    belonging to him called Zum Humbreicht, where he carried on printing with the
                    aid of Peter Schöffer, to whom he gave his only daughter Dyna or Christina in
                    marriage about 1465. Their first publication was the Psalter, 14th August 1457,
                    a folio of 350 pages, the first printed book with a complete date, and
                    remarkable for the beauty of the large initials printed each in two colours, red
                    and blue, from types made in two pieces, a method patented in England by Solomon
                    Henry in 1780, and by Sir William Congreve in 1819. The Psalter was reprinted
                    with the same types, 1459 (August 29), 1490, 1502 (Schöffer’s last publication),
                    and 1516. Fust and Schöffer’s other works are given below.<note anchored="true"

                    appointed for the church of St Quintin three baumeisters, who were to choose
                    twelve chief parishioners as assistants for life. The first of these “Vorvaren,”
                    who were named on May-day 1464, was Johês Fust, and in 1467 Adam von Hochheim
                    was chosen instead of Johannes Fust. Fust is said to have gone to Paris in 1466,
                    and to have died of the plague, which raged there in August and September. He
                    certainly was in Paris on 4th July, when he gave Louis de Lavernade, a
                    distinguished gentleman of the province of Forez, then chancellor of the Due de
                    Bourbon and first president of the parliament of Toulouse, a copy of his second
                    edition of Cicero, as appears from a note in Lavernade’s own hand at the end of
                    the book, which is now in the library of Geneva. But Fust probably did not die
                    until 30th October, on which day, probably in 1471, an annual mass was
                    instituted for him by Peter Schöffer and Conrad Henlif in the church of St
                    Victor of Paris, where he was buried.</p>
                <p>Fust has been often confounded with the famous magician Dr Johann Faust, no doubt
                    a real person, though the fables gradually gathered round his name have formed a
                    regular mythical saga. Trithemius speaks in 1507 of Magister Georgius
                    Sabellicus, who called himself Faustus J unior. Conradus Metianus Rufus (Conrad
                    Mudt) in 1513 calls him “quidam chiromanticus Georgius Faustus.” But Melanchthon
                    (Manlius, <hi rend="italic">Collectanea</hi><hi rend="italic">communium</hi><hi

                    history of Faust call the magician John, which name has been adopted in the
                    popular books and generally accepted. This change of name, which has been
                    variously explained, allowed the confused traditional remembrance of the printer
                    to be worked into the Faust saga, perhaps the more readily as in his colophons
                    Fust said that his books were not made with pen or pencil, “sed arte quadam
                    perpulchra.” The confusion has been much assisted by the story of Fust’s
                    supposed prosecution for magic, which, widely credited, and frequently repeated
                    as an authentic anecdote, seems to have been first mentioned by Johannes
                    Walchius in his <hi rend="italic">Decas fabularum humani</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >generis,</hi> Argentorati, 1610, foL 181. Ho states on the authority of Hendrik
                    van Schore or Schorus, a Flemish author, then an old man and provost of Surburg,
                    that when Fust sold his Bibles in Paris, the purchasers, surprised to find all
                    the copies agree exactly in every letter, complained of deception (“a Fausto
                    falsos ac deceptos se clamabant”), and bringing back their books demanded their
                    money, and pursued him even in Mainz, so that to escape he removed to Strasburg.
                    Johann Conrad Dürr, professor of theology at Altdorf, wrote an <hi rend="italic"

                    >Literariae,</hi> vol v. pp. 50-80. Dürr (after relating from Emmanuel van
                    Metereu the tale of Koster’s types being stolen on Christmas eve by John Fust
                    his workman, who fled to Amsterdam, then to Cologne, and lastly to Mainz) says
                    that, on showing his books, Fust was suspected of magic, as he could print in
                    one day as much as several men could write in a year, and as the monks and nuns,
                    who had long made great profits by copying, found their kitchens grow cold, and
                    their bright fires extinguished, Fust incurred their hatred and calumny, and was
                    transformed into a magician; and this opinion was confirmed by his printing the

                    >(Histoire de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Imprimerie,</hi>
                    Paris, 1689, p. 12) repeats the story of Fust selling his Bibles in Paris, and
                    adds, as Marchand <hi rend="italic">(Hist,</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l'imprimerie,</hi> La Haye, 1740, p. 27) says, out of his own head (“avance de
                    son chef”), that the purchasers brought a suit against Fust accusing him of
                    magic, so that he had to escape to Mainz, but the parliament of Paris made a
                    decree discharging Fust of all prosecutions as to the sale of his Bibles. The
                    whole story, as Bernard says, is very improbable and scarcely deserves a serious
                    refutation. There is no proof that the monks were hostile to printing, or that
                    it interfered with the profits of the copyists. On the contrary many books were
                    printed by monks, the early printers often set up their presses in monasteries,
                    and Gutenberg, Fust, and Schöffer were on friendly terms with many conventual
                    houses. Dürr himself quotes from the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of
                    Aventinus a statement that, if printing had not been discovered, the old books
                    would have been lost, as they would no longer write in the monasteries. Printing
                    did the mechanical work, and multiplied the material for calligraphy and
                    illumination, and therefore did not at first interfere with the profits of the
                    scribes or excite their hostility. The learned men who bought books in 1463
                    cannot have been ignorant of the invention of printing, which the colophon of
                    the Bible of 1462 expressly mentions. No trace of a suit against Fust has been
                    found in the registers of the parliament of Paris. Shortly before his death Fust
                    was known in Paris to Louis de Lavernade, a magistrate of the highest rank, who
                    could have had no intercourse with a man accused of magic. The confusion is
                    especially seen in the German puppet plays even now placing Dr Faust in Mainz,
                    while the popular histories make him dwell in Wittenberg, the birthplace of</p>
                <p>Protestantism, where Marlowe’s <hi rend="italic">Tragical History of Dr
                    Faustus,</hi> founded on the prose history, places him. Many writers have
                    accepted Dürfe error (see Ristelhuber, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dans l'histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >la</hi><hi rend="italic">legende,</hi> Paris, 1863, p. 173); thus Chasles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Etudes sur le moyen âge,</hi> p. 398) calls Fust “magicien à
                    barbe blanche,” and Victor Hugo’s introduction to Marlowe’s play is based on
                    this error, which, says Heine <hi rend="italic">(Ueber Deutschland),</hi> “is
                    widely spread among the people. They identify the two Fausts because they
                    perceived indistinctly that the mode of thought represented by the magicians
                    found its most formidable means of diffusion in the discovery of printing. This
                    mode, however, is thought itself as opposed to the blind Credo of the Middle
                    Ages.”</p>
