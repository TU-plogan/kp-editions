                <p><label type="entry">FLAGELLANTS</label>. The practice of some form of
                    flagellation as a religious observance is of very early origin, and has been
                    more or less followed by nearly every nation, both savage and civilized. Special
                    whipping ceremonies have also had a wide prevalence. According to Herodotus (it
                    40, 61), it was the custom of the ancient Egyptians to beat themselves during or
                    after the sacrifice at the annual festival in honour of their goddess Isis. In
                    Lacedaemon, at the festival of Artemis Orthia or Orthosia, the chief ceremony
                    was that of the Diamastigosis, or flogging of youths before her altar,—a custom
                    which is said to have been introduced by Lycurgus, and which is known to have
                    existed down to the time of Tertullian. From Sparta it spread to other places in
                    Greece, Asia Minor, and Italy (see vol. ii. p. 644). Flagellation was a
                    prominent feature in the Roman festival of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lupercalia,</hi> at which it was the custom of the Luperci to run through the
                    most frequented parts of the city, having leathern thongs in their hands, with
                    which they struck all whom they met, the blow being believed to have a salutary
                    influence (see Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fasti,</hi> ii. 425 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqq.;</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Caesar,</hi> 61).</p>
                <p>The discipline of flagellation was introduced at a very early period into the
                    Christian Church as a punishment; the first recorded instances of it are
                    isolated cases which happened about the beginning of the 5th century; thus
                    Augustine <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 159 <hi rend="italic">ad Μ ar cell.)</hi>
                    mentions that in his day flogging was resorted to as a means of discipline, not
                    only by parents and schoolmasters, but also by bishops in their courts; and
                    Joannes Cassianus, writing about the same period, says of offending monks, “vel
                    plagis emendantur vel expulsione purgantur.” In the decrees of several
                    provincial councils the practice is referred to as usual and right. But
                    self-flagellation as a voluntary penance was not introduced till a considerably
                    later period. The custom seems to have made but little progress till about the
                    end of the 11th century, when it was largely recommended by the precepts and
                    example of Cardinal Peter Damian; and in the 13th century fraternities were
                    specially formed for its observance as a regular and public religious ceremony.
                    The first of these was instituted about 1210 through the preaching of St Anthony
                    of Padua, but the new order did not make much progress till about 1260, when,
                    finding a favourable soil in the penitence and fear resulting from the
                    disastrous effects of the long-protracted Guelph and Ghibelline wars in Italy,
                    it suddenly sprung up into vigorous growth through the exhortations and example
                    of Rainer, a monk of Perugia. Great numbers of the inhabitants of this city,
                    noble and ignoble, old and young, traversed the streets, carrying in their hands
                    leathern thongs, with which, according to the chronicle of the monk of Padua,
                    “they drew forth blood from their tortured bodies amid sighs and tears, singing
                    at the same time penitential psalms, and entreating the compassion of the
                    Deity.” Many of them soon began a pilgrimage through the neighbouring towns, and
                    increasing in numbers as they went, some journeyed through Lombardy into
                    Provence, and others carried the infection to Rome. As they at first effected a
                    considerable improvement in the habits of the people, the religious authorities
                    gave them their countenance; but the Ghibellines, dreading their political
                    influence, prohibited them from entering their territories. Other bands of
                    flagellants visited Bavaria, Bohemia, Austria, Hungary, and Poland, making many
                    converts on their way; but their exhibitions gradually awakened the disgust of
                    the better classes of society, and the tumult and disorder resulting from such
                    large and promiscuous gatherings soon led to their prohibition both by the
                    clergy and the civil rulers. The fraternities again made their appearance after
                    the great plague in the 14th century, this time in Hungary, and spread thence
                    through Germany. From the Continent <pb break="no"

                    were finally obliged to retire without making a single convert. Pope Clement VI.
                    fulminated a bull against the order 20th October 1349; and the officers of the
                    Inquisition during the papacy of Gregory XI. persecuted them with such vigour
                    that the sect at last disappeared altogether. An attempt made in Thuringia in
                    1414 by Conrad Schmidt to revive the order under the name of Cryptoflagellants
                    was suppressed by the trial and execution of that leader and the more prominent
                    among his followers. In the 16 th century a milder form of the practice was
                    prevalent in France, especially in the southern parts of the kingdom; and in
                    various places flagellating companies were formed, who, however, used the
                    discipline chiefly in private, and only occasionally took part in public
                    flagellating processions. Henry III. of France established a whipping
                    brotherhood in Paris, and himself took part in the processions, but finding that
                    his conduct so far from conferring on him any political benefit awakened only
                    ridicule, he allowed his zeal for self-mortification to abate. The fraternities
                    were suppressed in France by Henry IV., but until recent times the practice of
                    self-flagellation continued to manifest itself intermittently in the south of
                    France, and also in Italy and Spain; and so late as 1820 a procession of
                    flagellants took place at Lisbon.</p>
