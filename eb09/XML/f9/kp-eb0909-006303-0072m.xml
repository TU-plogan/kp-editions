                    flourished in Germany from the end of the 12th century to the middle of the
                    16th, and which, from the extent of their organization and the mystery which
                    surrounded their proceedings, inspired a feeling of dread in all who came within
                    their jurisdiction. Their origin is uncertain. The traditional account is that
                    they were instituted by Charlemagne and Pope Leo III. to prevent the Saxons from
                    relapsing into paganism. It is more probable that they arose from the relics of
                    the ancient Teutonic free courts. Their immediate cause, however, is to be found
                    in the utter lawlessness and disregard of authority then prevailing in Germany,
                    which obliged the weak and the peace-loving to band themselves together as
                    protection against the outrages of the princes and nobles. The birthplace of the
                    Fehmic courts was Westphalia, where they appeared shortly after the deposition
                    of Henry the Lion in 1179. The duchy was in consequence of this event annexed to
                    the archbishopric of Cologne, and the archbishops appear to have had a good deal
                    to do with the origination of the courts. Fehmic courts subsequently made their
                    way into most other parts of Germany, but the institution never seems to have
                    succeeded in gaining a firm footing outside the limits of Westphalia, or the Red
                    Land, as it was called. Within this district, however, which included nearly the
                    entire country between the Rhine and the Weser, they soon acquired an immense
                    power, which was at first used only in a beneficial and upright manner,
                    supplying a means of redress at a time when the public administration of justice
                    was in abeyance. But in the end, as might have been anticipated, the secrecy of
                    their proceedings and the arbitrary nature of their rules converted them into an
                    instrument of tyranny in the hands of the very persons whose lawless deeds they
                    were designed to suppress. The emperors themselves, who had at first encouraged
                    the Fehmic courts, finding them a useful means of keeping their feudal
                    dependants in check, were unable directly to resist their encroachments; and it
                    was only with the restoration of public order and the establishment of a regular
                    judicature that the influence of the Fehmgerichte gradually waned. The last
                    regular court is said to have been held at Celle, in Hanover, in 1568; but there
                    are traces of the institution at a much later date; and in the present century
                    even, a relic of the once famous Fehmgerichte was to be found in Westphalia in
                    the form of a society for the suppression of vice. It was abolished by order of
                    Jerome Bonaparte in 1811.</p>
                <p>It was necessary that a candidate for initiation into the Fehm should be born in
                    wedlock, that he should be a Christian, and neither excommunicated nor outlawed,
                    and that he should not be a party to any process before a Fehmic court.
                    Originally only natives of Westphalia were admitted. At initiation the candidate
                    took a solemn oath to support with his whole powers the Holy Fehm, to conceal
                    its proceedings “from wife and child, father and mother, sister and brother,
                    fire and wind, from all that the sun shines on and the rain wets, and from every
                    being between heaven and earth,” and to bring before the tribunal everything
                    within his knowledge that fell under its jurisdiction. He was then initiated
                    into the signs by which the members recognized each other, and was presented
                    with a rope and a knife, upon which were engraved the mystic letters S.S.G.G.,
                    whose signification is still involved in doubt, but which are supposed to mean
                    <hi rend="italic">Strick, Stein, Gras, Grein.</hi> The emperor was the nominal
                    head of the Fehmic courts. Under him the supreme president was the archbishop of
                    Cologne as duke of Westphalia. The whole country over which the jurisdiction of
                    the Fehmic courts extended was divided iuto districts, in each of which there
                    was at least one court, presided over by a judge called a Freigraf, or free
                    count. Along with him sat an indefinite number of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0073-0064"/> assessors, but never less than seven, called
                    Freischöffen, or Freischöppen, in Latin <hi rend="italic">scabini.</hi> These
                    Freischöffen had the duty of bringing complaints before the courts, and of
                    carrying into execution the sentences which were pronounced. There were two
                    distinct sorts of Fehmic courts,—one which held its sittings openly, and another
                    whose proceedings were conducted in secret. The open court, in one of its
                    branches, exercised a jurisdiction in civil suits and over offences of a
                    trifling description, in which cases it was unnecessary that either plaintiff or
                    defendant should be a member of the Fehm. The other branch of the open court
                    took cognisance of all crimes of an ordinary nature. The accuser was always one
                    of the Freischöffen. The accused was cited by nailing the summons during night
                    to the door of his house, or, if it was not known where he lived, by fixing four
                    copies upon a post at cross roads near his supposed abode. If the accused
                    appeared, the accuser stated the case, and the investigation proceeded by the
                    examination of witnesses as in an ordinary court of law. The judgment was put
                    into execution on the spot if that was possible. The secret court, from whose
                    procedure the whole institution has acquired its evil character, was closed to
                    all but the initiated; any one not a member on being discovered was instantly
                    put to death, and the members present were bound under the same penalty not to
                    disclose what took place. Crimes of a serious nature, and especially those that
                    were deemed unfit for ordinary judicial investigation—such as heresy and
                    witchcraft—fell within its jurisdiction, as also did appeals by persons
                    condemned in the open courts, and likewise the cases before those tribunals in
                    which the accused had not appeared. The accused if a member could clear himself
                    by his own oath, unless he had revealed the secrets of the Fehm. If he were one
                    of the uninitiated it was necessary for him to bring forward witnesses to his
                    innocence from among the initiated, whose number varied according to the number
                    on the side of the accuser, but twenty-one in favour of innocence necessarily
                    secured an acquittal. The only punishment which the secret court could inflict
                    was death. If the accused appeared, the sentence was carried into execution at
                    once; if he did not appear, it was quickly made known to the whole body, and the
                    Freischöffe who was the first to meet the condemned was bound to put him to
                    death. A knife with the cabalistic letters was left beside the corpse to show
                    that the deed was not a murder.</p>
