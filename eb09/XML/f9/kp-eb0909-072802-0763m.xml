                    his lucid exposition and by his graceful and glowing oratory. The freedom of his
                    language in 1809, when Napoleon had arrested the pope and declared the
                    annexation of Rome to France, led to a prohibition of his lectures; and the
                    dispersion of the congregation of Saint Sulpice in 1811 was followed by his
                    temporary retirement from the capital. He returned with the Bourbons, and
                    resumed his conferences, in 1814; but the events of the Hundred Days again
                    compelled him to withdraw into private life, from which he did not emerge until
                    February 1816. As court preacher and almoner to Louis XVIII., he now entered
                    upon the period of his greatest public activity and influence. His <hi

                    to have profoundly impressed the public mind, and their effect was still further
                    deepened by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi

                    (1818). In connexion with the controversy which had been raised by the signing
                    of the reactionary concordat of 1817, he published, also in 1818, a treatise
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Vrais Principes</hi><hi rend="italic">del'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Église Gallicane sur la Puissance Ecclésiastique,</hi> which
                    though unfavourably criticized by the Ultramontane Lamennais, was received with
                    favour by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities. The consecration of
                    Frayssinous as bishop of Hermopolis “in partibus,” his election to the French
                    Academy, and his appointment to the grand-mastership of the university, followed
                    in rapid succession. In 1824, on the accession of Charles X., he became minister
                    of public instruction and of ecclesiastical affairs under the administration of
                    Villèle; and about the same time he was created a peer of France with the title
                    of count. His term of office was chiefly marked by the recall of the Jesuits. In
                    1825 he published his conferences under the title <hi rend="italic">Défense du
                    Christianisme.</hi> The work passed through 15 editions within 18 years,'and was
                    translated into several European languages. In 1828 he, along with his
                    colleagues in the Villèle ministry, was compelled to resign office, and the
                    subsequent revolution of July 1830 led to his retirement to Rome. Shortly
                    afterwards he became tutor to the duke of Bordeaux at Prague, where he continued
                    to live until 1838. The remaining years of his life were passed in great privacy
                    on his native soil. He died at St Gêniez on the 12th of December 1841. His
                    biography by Henrion was published in 1842, and a posthumous volume, containing
                    some of his earlier “conferences,” appeared in 1843 <hi rend="italic"
