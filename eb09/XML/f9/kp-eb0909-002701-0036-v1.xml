                        <hi rend="italic">éventail'),</hi> a light implement used for giving motion

                        >flabellum</hi> are names under which ecclesiastical fans are mentioned in
                    old inventories. Fans for cooling the face have been in use in hot climates from
                    remote ages. A bas-relief in the British Museum represents Sennacherib with
                    female figures carrying feather fans. They were attributes of royalty along with
                    horse-hair fly-flappers and umbrellas. Examples may be seen in plates of the
                    Egyptian sculptures at Thebes and other places, and also in the ruins of
                    Persepolis. In the museum of Boulak, near Cairo, a wooden fan handle showing
                    holes for feathers is still preserved. It is from the tomb of Amen-hotep, of the
                    18th dynasty, 17th century B.c. In India fans were also attributes of men in
                    authority, and sometimes sacred emblems. A heartshaped fan, with an ivory
                    handle, of unknown age, and held in great veneration by the Hindus, was given to
                    the prince of Wales. Large punkahs or screens, moved by a servant who does
                    nothing else, are in common use by Europeans in India at this day.</p>
                <p>Fans were used in the early Middle Ages to keep flies from the sacred elements
                    during the celebrations of the Christian mysteries. Sometimes they were round,
                    with bells attached—of silver, or silver gilt. Notices of such fans in the
                    ancient records of St Paul’s, London, Salisbury cathedral, and many other
                    churches, exist still. For these purposes they are no longer used in the Western
                    church, though they are retained in some Oriental rites. The large feather fans,
                    however, are still carried in the state processions of the supreme pontiff in
                    Rome, though not used during the celebration of the mass. The fan of Queen
                    Theodolinda (7th century) is still preserved in the treasury of the cathedral of
                    Monza. Fans made part of the bridal outfit, or <hi rend="italic">mundus
                        muliebris,</hi> of ancient Roman ladies.</p>
                <p>Folding fans had their origin in Japan, and were imported thence to China. They
                    were in the shape still used—a segment of a circle of paper pasted on a light
                    radiating frame-work of bamboo, and variously decorated, some in colours, others
                    of white paper on which verses or sentences are written. It is a compliment in
                    China to invite a friend or distinguished guest to write some sentiment on your
                    fan as a memento of any special occasion, and this practice has continued. A fan
                    that has some celebrity in France was presented by the Chinese ambassador to the
                    Comtesse de Clauzel at the coronation of Napoleon I. in 1804. When a site was
                    given in 1635, on an artificial island, for the settlement of Portuguese
                    merchants in Nippo in Japan, the space was laid out in the form of a fan as
                    emblematic of an object agreeable for general use. Men and women of every rank
                    both in China and Japan carry fans, even artisans using them with one hand while
                    working with the other. In China they are often made of carved ivory, the sticks
                    being plates very thin and sometimes carved on both sides, the intervals between
                    the carved parts pierced with astonishing delicacy, and the plates held together
                    by a ribbon. The Japanese make the two outer guards of the stick, which cover
                    the others, occasionally of beaten iron, extremely thin and light, damascened
                    with gold and other metals.</p>
                <p>Fans were used by Portuguese ladies in the 14th century,, and were well known in
                    England before the close of the reign of Richard II. In France the inventory of
                    Charles V. at the end of the 14th century mentions a folding ivory fan. They
                    were brought into general use in that country by Catherine de’ Medici, probably
                    from Italy, then in advance of other countries in all matters of personal
                    luxury. The court ladies of Henry VIII.’s reign in England were used to handling
                    fans. A lady in the Dance of Death by Holbein holds a fan. Queen Elizabeth is
                    painted with a round feather fan in her portrait at Gorhambury; and as many as
                    twenty-seven are enumerated in her inventory (1606). Coryat, an English
                    traveller, in 1608 describes them as common in Italy. They also became of
                    general use from that time in Spain. In Italy, France, and Spain fans had
                    special conventional uses, and various actions in handling them grew into a code
                    of signals, by which ladies were supposed to convey hints or signals to admirers
                    or to rivals in society. A paper in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>
                    humorously proposes to establish a regular drill for these purposes.</p>
                <p>The chief seat of the Europeau manufacture of fans during the 17th century was
                    Paris, where the sticks or frames, whether of wood or ivory, were made, and the
                    decorations painted on mounts of very carefully prepared vellum (called latterly
                        <hi rend="italic">chicken skin,</hi> but not correctly),—a material stronger
                    and tougher than paper, which breaks at the folds. Paris makers exported fans
                    unpainted to Madrid and other Spanish cities, where they wero decorated by
                    nativeartists. Many were exported complete; of old fans called Spanish a great
                    number were in fact made in France. Louis XIV. issued edicts at various times to
                    regulate the-manufacture. Besides fans mounted with parchment, Dutch fans of
                    ivory were imported into Paris, and decorated by the heraldic painters in the
                    process called “Vernis Martin,” after a famous carriage painter and inventor of
                    colourless lac varnish. Fans of this kind belonging to the Queen and to the late
                    baroness de Rothschild were exhibited in 1870 at Kensington. A fan of the date
                    of 1660, representing sacred subjects, is attributed to Philippe de Champagne,
                    another to Peter Oliver in England in the <pb break="no"

                    painter of the 17th century devoted himself to fan painting. Some harsh
                    expressions of Queen Christina to the young ladies of the French court are said
                    to have caused an increased ostentation in the splendour of their fans, which
                    were set with jewels and mounted in gold. Rosalba Carriera was the name of a fan
                    painter of celebrity in the 17th century. Lebrun and Romanelli were much
                    employed during the same period. Klingstet, a Dutch artist, enjoyed a
                    considerable reputation for his fans from the latter part of the 17 th and the
                    first thirty years of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The revocation of the edict of Nantes drove many fanmakers out of France to
                    Holland and England. The trade in England was well established under the Stuart
                    sovereigns. Petitions were addressed by the fan-makers to Charles II. against
                    the importation of fans from India, and a duty was levied upon such fans in
                    consequence. This importation of Indian fans, according to Savary, extended also
                    to France. During the reign of Louis XV. carved Indian and China fans displaced
                    to some extent those formerly imported from Italy, which had been painted on
                    swanskin parchment prepared with various perfumes.</p>
                <p>During the 18th century all the luxurious ornamentation of the day was bestowed
                    on fans as far as they could display it. The sticks were made of mother-of-pearl
                    or ivory, carved with extraordinary skill in France, Italy, England, and other
                    countries. They were painted from designs of Boucher, Watteau, Laueret, and
                    other “genre” painters, Hébert, Rau, Chevalier, Jean Boquet, Mad. Vérité, are
                    known as fan painters. These fashions were followed in most countries of Europe,
                    with certain national differences. Taffeta and silk, as well as fine parchment,
                    were used for the mounts. Little circles of glass were let into the stick to be
                    looked through, and small telescopic glasses were sometimes contrived at the
                    pivot of the stick. They were occasionally mounted with the finest point lace.
                    An interesting fan (belonging to Madame de Thiac in France), the work of Le
                    Flamand, was presented by the municipality of Dieppe to Marie Antoinette on the
                    birth of her son the dauphin. From the time of the Revolution the old luxury
                    expended on fans died out. Fine examples ceased to be exported to England and
                    other countries. The painting on them represented scenes or personages connected
                    with political events. At a later period fan mounts were often prints coloured
                    by hand. The events of the day mark the date of many examples found in modern
                    collections. Amongst the fanmakers of the present time the names of Alexandre,
                    Duvelleroy, Fayet, Vanier, may be mentioned as well known in Paris. The sticks
                    are chiefly made in the department of Oise, at Le Déluge, Crèvecoeur, Méry, Ste
                    Geneviève, and other villages, where whole families are engaged in preparing
                    them; ivory sticks are carved at Dieppe. Water-colour painters of distinction
                    often design and paint the mounts, the best designs being figure subjects. A
                    great impulse has been given to the manufacture and painting of fans in England
                    since the exhibition which took place at South Kensington in 1870. Other
                    exhibitions have since been held, and competitive prizes offered, one of which
                    was gained by the Princess Louise. Modern collections of fans take their date
                    from the emigration of many noble families from France at the time of the
                    Revolution. Such objects were given as souvenirs, and occasionally sold by
                    families in straitened circumstances. A large number of fans of all sorts,
                    principally those of the 18th century, Freuch, English, German, Italian,
                    Spanish, &amp;c., have been lately bequeathed to the South Kensington
                    Museum.</p>
