                    twenty-one years of age he composed a treatise on the figure of the earth, and
                    the reputation which he soon acquired led to his appointment by the king of
                    Sardinia to the professorship of philosophy in the college of Casale. His
                    friendship with Radicati, a man of liberal opinions, occasioned Frisi’s removal
                    by his clerical superiors to Novara, where he was compelled to do duty as a
                    preacher. In 1753 he was elected a corresponding member of the Paris Academy of
                    Sciences, and shortly afterwards he became professor of philosophy in the
                    Barnabite College of St Alexander at Milan. An acrimonious attack by a young
                    Jesuit, about this time, upon his dissertation on the figure of the earth laid
                    the foundation of his animosity against the Jesuits, with whose enemies,
                    including D’Alembert, Condorcet, and other Encyclopedists, he later closely
                    associated himself. In 1756 he was appointed by Leopold, grand-duke of Tuscany,
                    to the professorship of mathematics in the university of Padua, a post which he
                    held for eight years. He was made in 1757 an associate of the Imperial Academy
                    of St Petersburg, and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London, and in
                    1758 a member of the Academy of Berlin, in 1766 of that of Stockholm, and in
                    1770 of the Academies of Copenhagen and of Bern. From several European crowned
                    heads he received, at various times, marks of special distinction, and the
                    empress Maria Theresa granted him a yearly pension of 100 sequins (£50). In 1764
                    he was created professor of mathematics in the Palatine Schools at Milan, and
                    obtained from Pope Pius VI. release from ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and
                    authority to become a secular priest. In 1766 he visited France and England, and
                    in 1768 Vienna, and thus formed the acquaintance of the leading men of science
                    of his day. Frisi was in 1777 made director of a school of architecture at
                    Milan. His knowledge of hydraulics caused him to be frequently consulted with
                    respect to the management of canals and other water-courses in various parts of
                    Europe. It was through his means that lightning-conductors were first introduced
                    into Italy for the protection of buildings. He was a man not only of exten sive
                    learning, but .of wide views and fearless spirit, and by his lectures did much
                    to dispel the popular superstitions of his fellow-countrymen concerning magic
                    and witchcraft. He died November 22, 1784. He wrote—</p>
