                    Europe which they still, at least partially, occupy. So far as can be judged
                    they have never been of an aggressive disposition, and it is not improbable that
                    at one time they may have possessed a much wider territory than history usually
                    assigns them. The boundaries of Frisia proper are the Scheldt towards the west,
                    and the Weser towards the east, and it never extended far inland from the coast
                    of the German Ocean. But there is also a district of Schleswig in Denmark,
                    extending along the west coast from the Eider northwards to Töndern, in which
                    the common language still gives evidence of a Frisian population; the same may
                    be said of the neighbouring islands of For, Silt, Heligoland, &amp;c.; and it is
                    no improbable supposition that not only the Ditmarsch district to the south of
                    the Eider, but also the whole maritime country westward to the Weser, was at an
                    earlier period in the hands of distinctly Frisian tribes. If the presence of
                    geographical names ending in <hi rend="italic">urn,</hi> the Frisian equivalent
                    to the German <hi rend="italic">heim</hi> and the Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >ham,</hi> may be taken as sufficient evidence of Frisian occupation, Dr Latham,
                    in his notes to the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> of Tacitus, has elaborately
                    shown that there have been Frisian settlements as far north in Denmark as the
                    Lijmfiord, and as far east as the islands of Funen and Zealand. By the older
                    historians of Denmark and the countries of Lower Germany, the Frisian district
                    in Denmark is frequently called <hi rend="italic">Frisia Minor</hi> or Lesser
                    Frisia, which, however, must not be confounded with the unexplained distinction
                    which Tacitus makes between Frisii Majores and Frisii Minores.</p>
                <p>The history of the Frisians, in spite of the labours of a few investigators like
                    Wiarda and Richthofen, has hitherto been left in many respects in a very
                    fragmentary and untrustworthy condition; and rash assertions of uncritical
                    chroniclers have undisputed currency. For this neglect the principal reason is
                    undoubtedly the fact that the people have, at least in modern times, displayed
                    no strong political individuality, but have allowed themselves peacefully to be
                    merged in more powerful nationalities. The reader who wishes may find the

                <p>The Frisians were so far rendered tributary by Drusus that they continued to pay
                    to the Romans a tax of oxhides until the foolish exactions of Olennius, who
                    demanded that all the hides should be of a certain superlative quality drove
                    them to revolt in 28 A.D. They defeated the Roman forces under Lucius Apronius,
                    and though Corbulo obtained hostages for their future loyalty, and “gave them a
                    senate, magistrates, and a constitution” (Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi>
                    xi. 20), their subjugation was little more than nominal. About 57 A.D. a body of
                    Frisians took possession of lands reserved for the Roman soldiers; and, instead
                    of removing at the threat of the Roman governor, they sent their chiefs to Rome
                    to obtain imperial sanction for their occupancy. In the 13th book of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals,</hi> Tacitus tells how the chiefs, Verritus and Malorix,
                    as he calls them, excited the amusement and admiration of the people by taking,
                    unasked, their seat among the senators in Pompey’s theatre, when they heard that
                    strangers from nations distinguished by their bravery and friendship to the
                    Romans were advanced to that honourable position. Nero gave them both the Roman
                    franchise, but refused to sanction the presumption of their tribe, who were
                    afterwards expelled from the district which they had sought to colonize.</p>
                <p>It is not till the new power of the Franks was beginning to lay the foundations
                    of its empire that the Frisians again come prominently into notice; but it
                    appears probable that in the meantime they had shared with their neighbours, the
                    Angles and the Saxons, in the conquest of England and Scotland, though to what
                    extent it is impossible to ascertain. The Frankish king, Dagobert <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n823/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0823-0788"/> I. (622-638), sought to secure a footing among
                    them by erecting a mission church at U trecht on the Frisian frontiers, but the
                    Frisians captured the place and destroyed the church. The preaching of Amandus
                    aud Eligius had little effect, and the honour of being the first successful
                    missionary among the Frisians was left to Wilfrid of York, who in 677-678 was
                    hospitably received by the king Aldegild (Adgillus or Aldgisl). Under Aldegild’s
                    successor Radbod a persecution of the new faith ensued, and though Radbod was
                    driven from West Friesland by King Pippin, after the battle of Dorstadt in 689,
                    he maintained his independence in Eastern Frisia, and Christianity was safe only
                    as far as the wavering frontier of the Franks extended. On Pippin’s death,
                    Radbod not only recovered his western territory, but sailed up the Rhine as far
                    as Cologne, and defeated Charles Martel. His successor, Aldegild II., was again
                    driven eastward; the western districts fell finally into the power of the
                    Franks; and Willibrord, the missionary, who had begun his labours in the country
                    about 700, obtained a permanent see at Utrecht. The last independent prince of
                    the Frisians, Poppo, was defeated by Charles Martel in 754, and Charlemagne
                    still further extended the Frankish authority. At the same time he granted the
                    Frisians important privileges, gave them the title of freemen, and allowed them
                    to choose their own <hi rend="italic">podestat</hi> (potestas), who should
                    govern them under the protection of the empire. About this time the country of
                    the Frisians was divided into three distinct districts :—Western Frisia,
                    stretching from the Sincfal to the Fly or Flevum, that is, from the modern Zwiu
                    (a branch of the Scheldt northward of Bruges) to the Meuse; Middle Frisia, from
                    the Fly to the Laubach, that is, from the Meuse to the Zuyder Zee; and Eastern
                    Frisia, from the Zuyder Zee to the Weser. At the treaty of Verdun (843) Frisia
                    went with Lotharingia; at the treaty of Mersen (870) the district between the
                    Laubach and the Weser was assigned to the kingdom of the Eastern Franks, while
                    the rest, with Lotharingia, passed to the kingdom of the Western Franks; in 880
                    the whole country was again united with Germany; and in 911, when Lotharingia
                    recognized Charles, the king of the West, Frisia adhered to Conrad, the king of
                    the East. The history of West Frisia gradually loses itself in that of the
                    bishopric of Utrecht and the countship of Holland,—the first count of Holland,
                    Thierry L, being the son of Gerulph, count of Frisia, and practically continuing
                    the Frisian line. In 1248 William of Holland, having become emperor, restored to
                    the Frisians in his country their ancient liberties in reward for the assistance
                    they had rendered him in the siege of Aix la-Chapelle; but in 1254 they
                    revolted, and William lost his life in the contest which ensued. William IV.
                    received a new donation of West Frisia in 1345. Meanwhile, the rest of the
                    Frisians in the more eastern districts maintained their independence, and for a
                    long time governed themselves after a very simple republican fashion. Each of
                    the seven confederated Frisian maritime states— “Sieben Friesischen
                    Seelande”—had its own administration, and consisted of a number of locally
                    independent districts, ï or matters of general concern there was an annual
                    assembly at the Upstalsbom, or “Tree of the Superior Court,” near Aurich.
                    According to Okko Leding, who in 1878 published at Emden an interesting study on
                    <hi rend="italic">Die Freiheit</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Friesen</hi><hi rend="italic">im Mittelalter und ihr Bund mit den Versammlungen
                    bei Upstalsbom,</hi> it appears that these assemblies were allowed to fall into
                    desuetude in the first half of the 13th century, were resumed from 1323 to 1327,
                    anew discontinued, and again resumed in 1361. The counts disappear in East
                    Frisia about the end of the 11th century, and in Middle Frisia after 1233.
                    Though in religious matters nominally subject to the bishopric of Bremen, it was
                    not till the crusade of 1234, aud the famous defeat of the Stedingers (a people
                    of the Weser marches) in the battle of Altenesch or Oldenesch, that the Frisians
                    really recognized the authority of the Romish Church. In the course of the 14th
                    century the whole country was in a state of anarchy; petty lordships sprang into
                    existence, the interests of the common weal were forgotten or disregarded, and
                    district carried on hostilities against district. Thus the Fetkoopers or
                    Fatmongers, as they were called, of Ostergo, had endless feuds with the
                    Schieringers or Eelfishers of Westergo.</p>
                <p>This state of matters favoured the attempts of the counts of Holland to push
                    their conquests further, but the main body of the Frisians were still
                    independent when the countship of Holland passed into the hands of Philip the
                    Good of Burgundy. Philip laid claim to the whole country, but the people
                    appealed to the protection of the empire, and Frederick III. in August 1457
                    recognized their direct dependence on the empire, and called on Philip to bring
                    forward formal proof of his rights. Philip’s successor, Charles the Rash,
                    summoned an assembly of notables at Enckhuysen in 1469, in order to secure their
                    homage; but the conference was without result, and the duke’s attention was soon
                    absorbed by other and more important affairs. In 1498 Maximilian detached the
                    country between the Laubach and the Fly from the empire, and gave it as a fief
                    to Albert of Saxony, but it was the Schieringers alone (the name had by this
                    time become the title of the popular faction) who submitted uncomplainingly to
                    the arrangement, and the Fetkoopers, or faction of the nobility, had to be put
                    down by force of arms. This the duke did with the utmost severity, and his
                    successors carried out his despotic policy with only too faithful
                    consistency.</p>
                <p>In Eastern Frisia the anarchy was brought to a close by the formation of a
                    confederation established in 1430, and the election of Edzard Cirksena to the
                    office of president. Ulrich, the successor of Edzard, was made count of the
                    country between the Ems and the Weser by the emperor Frederick III. in 1454. In
                    the early part of the IGth century the Reformation was introduced by Edzard I.,
                    who patronized the preaching of Meister Jörgen von der Düre, or Magister A
                    portanus, as he was called in Latin. Under the Countess Anna, who ruled during
                    the minority of her son Edzard II., the countship became, mainly through the
                    agency of John a Lasco, the seat of a very flourishing Protestant church, and
                    the refuge of the persecuted of many lands. Edzard II. proved an able ruler,
                    published a body of laws for his people in 1515, introduced primogeniture into
                    his family, extended his authority over Harlinger-land and Jever, and was
                    appointed by Charles V. governor of Groningen. His successor, Edzard III., was
                    made a prince of the empire by Ferdinand III. in 1654. By the death of Charles
                    Edzard, in 1744, the male line of the dynasty came to an end, and the king of
                    Prussia took possession of the countship. After various vicissitudes, it was
                    ceded to Hanover, in 1815.</p>
                <p>The Frisian language is a member of the Low German branch of the Teutonic, and
                    presents special interest to the English philologist as the nearest of all
                    extant forms to the Saxon basis of his own tongue. It is still spoken in the
                    country districts of the present province of West Friesland; in a much more
                    Germanized condition it still exists in Saterland, in East Friesland; in
                    strangely differentiated dialects it holds its own in many of the islands along
                    the coast; and, in spite of the encroachments of Low German on the one hand, and
                    Danish on the other, it survives in the country between Husum and Töndern. Among
                    its peculiarities may be mentioned the dropping of the final <hi rend="italic"
                    >n,</hi> which is such a favourite termination in German (thus even <hi
                    rend="italic">ma</hi> for <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> as in Halbertsma, the

                    when these letters precede <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    as in tserke for kerke, t,e., kirk, church. The explanation of this last
                    peculiarity may perhaps be found in tho contact of the Frisian with Slavonic
                    languages, in which the modification is sufficiently common.</p>
                <p>A brief sketch of Frisian grammar was published along with the poems of Gysbert
                    Japicx; but the first separate treatment of the older forms of ,the language was
                    by Rask, whose <hi rend="italic">Frisisk Sproglaere</hi> (Copenhagen, 1825;
                    German translation by Buss, Freiburg, 1834) brought him into controversy with
                    Grimm, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Deutschen Grammatik,</hi> devoted some
                    attention to the same subject. Moritz Heyne has also given a good treatment of
                    Frisian in his <hi rend="italic">Kurze Laut-und Flexionslehre der
                    Altgermanischen Sprachstämmc,</hi> 1874. Richthofen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Altfriesisches Wörterbuch,</hi> Göttingen, 1840, practically supplanted the
                    older work of Wiarda (Aurich, 1786), and its position has not been affected by
                    the publication of Haan Hattema’s <hi rend="italic">Idioticon Frisicum,</hi>

                    the Low German spoken in East Friesland, which has incorporated comparatively
                    few Frisian words. A list of Frisian personal names forms an appendix to
                    Outzen’s <hi rend="italic">Glossarium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Bernhard
                    Brons, in his <hi rend="italic">Friesische Namen und Mittheilungen Dir
                    über,</hi> Emden, 1877, furnishes lists of East, West, and North Frisian
                    Christian names, and a collection of Frisian family names, with the dates at
                    which they make their first appearance in church books or other historical
                    documents.</p>
                <p>For the older forms of the language the sources are unfortunately scanty: no
                    great literary monument like that of the Heliand or the Nibelunglied has been
                    preserved, and the investigator has mainly to depend on the various legal codes
                    or collections which were formed in the course of the 14th and 15th centuries,
                    and have been published by Richthofen, <hi rend="italic">Friesische
                    Rechtsquellen,</hi> Berlin, 1840. The great <hi rend="italic">Lev Frisionum</hi>
                    is composed in Latin, and only contains a few Frisian terms, of comparatively
                    small linguistic importance. The date of its recension is also a matter of
                    conjecture, as there is no contemporary evidence either internal or external. By
                    the older investigators it was assigned a high antiquity; but the more modern
                    are for the most part of opinion that it is not earlier than the reign of
                    Charlemagne. Haan Hettema in his <hi rend="italic">Oude Fricsche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wetten</hi> gives 802-804 as the probable date; while Richthofen
                    thinks there are three portions, the first composed for use in Middle Frisia in
                    the reign of Charles Martel or of Pippin, another for use in all Frisia,
                    composed after Charlemagne’s conquest in 785, and a third or supplementary and
                    emendatory portion composed in 802. The first edition of tho <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lex Frisionum</hi> was published by B. J. Herold in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Originum ac Germanicarum Antiquitatum libri,</hi> Basel, 1557, but he gives no
                    indication of the source of the manuscripts which he employed. Since his day
                    there have been no fewer than than 13 editions—Lindenbrog, <hi rend="italic"

                    >hist.,</hi> vol. xv., Hanover, 1863. Though it has been supposed that
                    Lindenbrog and Siccama may have had access to some manuscript authority in
                    addition to Herold’s recension, there is no proof that such was the case; and
                    the text still remains to all intents in the same state as when Herold left it.
                    Some investigators have, owing to this absence of original evidence, even cast
                    doubts on the authenticity of the code, but a comparison of the laws with
                    undoubtedly genuine Frisian remains authorizes its acceptance. <hi rend="italic"
                    >“I</hi> am convinced,” says Richthofen, “that no man in the time of Herold, not
                    to say in our own time, could have devised such a forgery as the Heroldian
                    text.” Among the minor collections of Frisian laws in Frisian, Low German and
                    Latin are tho “seventeen general acts or <hi rend="italic">Kürenf</hi> dating
                    from the close of the 12th century, according to Richthofen, but of much earlier
                    origin according to Leding—the Upstalsbom laws of 1323, the local laws of
                    Rüstring, and of the Brockmannen or inhabitants of Brockmerland, published by
                    Wiarda; the “Emsiger Domen,” or Emsig decisions, published by Hettema,
                    Leeuwarden, 1830; the Fivelgo laws,‘published by Hettema, Dokkum, 1841; and the
                    Hunsingo Küren in the 2d volume of the Groningen transactions of the society
                    “pro excolendo jure patrio,” 1778. The title chosen by Wiarda for the laws of
                    Rüstring—the <hi rend="italic">Asegabuch,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> though it
                    has become perhaps the best known word of the whole Frisian vocabulary, is in
                    reality not a genuine Frisian form, and never occurs in a Frisian document. The
                    correct expression, according to Richthofen <hi rend="italic">(Altfries.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wörterbuch,</hi> s.v. “Asebok”), would have been <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asebok</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Asekbok,</hi> the former equivalent to the
                    book out of which the “a” or law is to be <hi rend="italic">seen,</hi> and the
                    latter to tho book in which the law is to be <hi rend="italic">sought.</hi> In
                    West Frisia the native language holds much tho same relation to Dutch as the
                    Scottish language holds to English in Scotland: it has no legal or educational
                    position, but it preserves among the peasantry a considerable degree of
                    vitality, and is even cultivated in a literary way by a small patriotic school.
                    The chief place among West-Frisian authors is duo to Gysbert or Gilbert Japicx,
                    rector at Bolsward, whose <hi rend="italic">Fricsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rijmlerye</hi> was first published at Bolsward in 1668, and has since been
                    frequently reprinted—at Leeuwarden in 1681; at Franeker, 1684; with aglossary by
                    Epkema, 2 vols., Leeuwarden, 1824; and under the editorship of Dykstra, 1853.
                    The volume contains secular, and especially humorous, poems, fifty of the Psalms
                    of David and other religious pieces, a number of letters, one or two prose
                    essays, and fragments of the “Customs” of Leeuwarden. A popular comedy called
                    <hi rend="italic">Waatze</hi><hi rend="italic">Gribbert’s Brilloft,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Gribbcrt's</hi><hi rend="italic">Bridal,</hi> dates from the
                    beginning of the 18th century. The first edition appeared in 1812, at
                    Leeuwarden, and the second in 1820, and there have been several since. Among the
                    writers who have published in West Frisian during the 19th century, it is
                    sufficient to mention Salverda Posthumus, J. H. Halbertsma, Deketh, Windsma, Van
                    der Veen, and Dykstra. A society for the study of Frisian was founded in 1829 at
                    Franeker—“Friesch genootschap voor geschied-oudheid-en taalkunde,”—and since
                    1852 it has published ajournai called <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vrije Fries.</hi> Other Frisian periodicals are <hi rend="italic">Forjü my
                    net,</hi> “Forget me not;” the <hi rend="italic">Sιoannc-blummen,</hi> a
                    Leeuwarden annual; and <hi rend="italic">De Byekocr.</hi> In North Frisian the
                    most valuable literary monument is <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gidtshals,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.c.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geizhals,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Curmudgeon</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> a
                    comedy, composed by J. P. Hunsen, in the Silt dialect. The minor remains have
                    been collected by De Vries, in his <hi rend="italic">Nordfricsische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sprache nach</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Moringer</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundart,</hi> Leyden, 1860; and by Johansen in

                    Föhringcr und</hi><hi rend="italic">Amrumer Mundart,</hi> Kiel, 1862.</p>
                <p>There is one book which, more than any other, has attracted the attention of
                    other than Frisian scholars. If the <hi rend="italic">0era</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Linda</hi> book, as it is called, could be accepted as genuine, it would be,
                    after Homer and Hesiod, the oldest document of European origin; but
                    unfortunately it must be recognized as nothing more than a brilliant forgery.
                    The first part of the manuscript, the book of the followers of Adela, professes
                    to have been copied in 1256 from an ancient original, and gives an account of
                    Neptune, Minerva, Minos, and other personages of classical antiquity, which
                    would make them out to be of Frisian origin. According to J. Beckering Vinckers—
                    who published <hi rend="italic">De Oncchtheid</hi><hi rend="italic">van</hi><hi

                    ship-carpenter in the Royal docks at Den Helder, who was born in 1811, and died
                    in 1873, and who appears to have forged the document for the purpose of giving
                    importance to his invectives against the church, and of shedding dignity on his
                    family, which is traced by the book back for about two thousand years.</p>
