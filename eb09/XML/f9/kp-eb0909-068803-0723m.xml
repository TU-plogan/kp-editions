                    his birth is not definitely ascertained, but probably falls about 1757.
                    According to one account, he was of French descent; but the truth seems to be
                    that his father, Garcia Rodriguez França, was a native of S. Paulo in Brazil,
                    and came to Paraguay to take charge of a plantation of black tobacco for the
                    Government. He studied theology at the college of Cordova de Tucuman, and is
                    said to have been for some time a professor in that faculty; but he afterwards
                    turned his attention to the Jaw, and practised in Asuncion. Having attained a
                    high reputation at once for ability and integrity, he was naturally selected for
                    various important offices, and exercised great personal influence. The
                    Robertsons, whose accounts have done so much to blacken his memory, relate how,
                    when he was requested by one of his friends to undertake an unjust cause in his
                    behalf, he not only refused, but went and offered his services to the man who
                    was likely to be wronged, and by his boldness and energy secured his case. On
                    the declaration of Paraguayan independence in 1811, he was appointed secretary
                    to the national junta, and exercised an influence on affairs greatly out of
                    proportion to his nominal position. When the congress or junta of 1813 changed
                    the constitution and established a duumvirate, Dr Francia and the Gaucho general
                    Fulgencio were elected to the office. A story is told in connexion with their
                    installation, which recalls the self-coronation of William I. of England and
                    Napoleon the great. In theatrical imitation of Roman custom, two curule chairs
                    had been placed in the assembly, one of them bearing the name of Caesar and the
                    other that of Pompey. Francia seated himself in the Caesar chair, and left his
                    colleague to play the part of Pompey as best he might. In 1814 he secured his
                    own election as dictator for three years, and at the end of that period he
                    obtained the dictatorship for life. He was no mere nominal sovereign; but for
                    the next twenty-five years he might have boasted, with even more truth than
                    Louis XIV., “L’état e’est moi.” In the accounts which have been published of his
                    administration we find a strange mixture of capacity and caprice, of far-sighted
                    wisdom and reckless infatuation, strenuous endeavours after a high ideal and
                    flagrant violations of the simplest principles of justice. He put a stop to the
                    foreign commerce of the country, but carefully fostered its internal industries;
                    was disposed to be hospitable to strangers from other lands, and kept them
                    prisoners for years; lived a life of republican simplicity, and punished with
                    Dionysian severity the slightest want of respect. As time went on he appears to
                    have grown more arbitrary and despotic, more determined to maintain his mastery
                    over the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n724/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0724-0689"/> country, and more apprehensive lest he should
                    lose it. And yet at the time of his death it is said that he was generally
                    regretted, and his bitterest opponents cannot deny that if he did much evil he
                    also did much good. Deeply imbued with the principles of the French Revolution,
                    he was a stern antagonist of the church. He abolished the Inquisition,
                    suppressed the college of theology, did away with the tithes, and inflicted
                    endless indignities on the priests. “What are they good for!” was his saying;
                    “they make us believe more in the devil than in God.” He discouraged marriage
                    both by precept and example, and left behind him several illegitimate children.
                    For the extravagances of his later years the plea of insanity has been put
                    forward; and it was evident that his worst characteristics were at their worst
                    when the east wind blew. The circumstances of his death were in strange keeping
                    with his life. He was about to sabre his doctor when he was seized with a fit,
                    and he expired the same day, September 20, 1840. He was buried in the cathedral
                    of Asuncion, but the spot is no longer known, and a story is told by Mr
                    Mansfield and by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomson, to the effect that his body was dug
                    up by some private enemies and flung into the river. On the other hand, it is
                    well known that the greatest respect was shown to his memory by those who
                    succeeded him in the government of Paraguay. Unfortunately for the history of
                    his administration, Francia kept no records; and he caused all his orders to be
                    returned to him with the word “executed” on the margin, and then to be
                    destroyed.</p>

                    The account which they gave of his character and government was naturally of the
                    most unfavourable description, and they rehearsed and emphasized their

                    brilliant defence of the dictator “as aman or sovereign of iron energy and
