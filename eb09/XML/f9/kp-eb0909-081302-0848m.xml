                    was a small farmer, and received the rudiments of his education at the free
                    school of Soham to which place his parents had removed about 1760. Early in life
                    he began to assist in the work of the farm, and he continued to do so till he
                    was twenty years of age. In his seventeenth year he became a member of the
                    Baptist church at Soham, and soon afterwards began to exercise his gifts as an
                    exhorter with so great approval that, in the spring of 1775, he was called and
                    ordained as pastor of that congregation. In 1782 he removed to Kettering in
                    Northamptonshire, where, besides other advantages, he enjoyed that of frequent
                    intercourse with some of the most eminent ministers of the denomination, such as
                    Ryland, Sutcliff, and the Halls. About that time the Calvinism prevalent among
                    the Baptists of England had come to be mingled and overlaid with many crudities
                    which the Genevan Reformer would have disowned as foreign to his system; and for
                    many years Fuller’s intellectual and spiritual development had been much
                    impeded, not only by the narrowness of his outward circumstances, and by the
                    defects of his early education, but also by the contracted religious views of
                    those to whom he had been accustomed to look for guidance. Even before leaving
                    Soham, however, he had written the substance of a treatise, in which he had
                    sought to counteract that hyper-Calvinism which, “admitting nothing spiritually
                    good to be the duty of the unregenerate, and nothing to be addressed to them in
                    a way of exhortation excepting what related to external obedience,” had so long
                    perplexed his own mind. This work he published, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">The Gospel worthy of all Acceptation,</hi> soon after his
                    settlement in Kettering; and although it immediately involved him in a somewhat
                    bitter controversy which lasted for nearly 20 years, it was ultimately
                    successful, as from its ability and force it deserved to be, in considerably
                    modifying the views prevalent among English Dissenters with regard to the
                    matters of which it treats. In 1793 he published a treatise in which the
                    Calvinistic and Socinian systems were examined and compared as to their moral
                    tendency. This work, which, along with another against Deism, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Gospel its own Witness,</hi> is regarded as the production on
                    which his reputation as a theologian mainly rests, was attacked by Toulmin and
                    Kentish, to whom he replied in ε, supplementary pamphlet in which the weak side
                    of Socinianism was still further exposed. Fuller also published an admirable <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoir of the Rev. Samuel Pearce,</hi> of Birmingham, and a volume
                    of <hi rend="italic">Expository Lectures in Genesis,</hi> besides a considerable
                    number of smaller pieces, chiefly sermons and pamphlets, which have been issued
                    in a collected form since his death, and like everything he did gave evidence of
                    great intellectual vigour and acuteness as well as of deep religious
                    convictions. Perhaps the most <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0849-0814"/> important services of his life, however, were
                    those rendered in connexion with the Baptist Missionary Society, which was
                    formed at Kettering in 1792, and of which he was secretary until his death on
                    the 7th of May 1815. The correspondence he maintained, the journeys he
                    undertook, the pamphlets he wrote in defence of the society, and the discourses
                    he preached on its behalf, imply an amount of work which few men could possibly
                    have overtaken, and which ultimately proved too heavy even for his naturally
                    powerful constitution. Several editions of his collected works have appeared,
                    and a <hi rend="italic">Memoir,</hi> principally compiled from his own papers,
                    was published about a year after his decease by Dr Ryland, his most intimate
                    friend and coadjutor in the affairs of the Baptist mission. There are also
                    biographies by his son, the Rev. A. G. Fuller, and by the Rev. J. W. Morris.</p>
