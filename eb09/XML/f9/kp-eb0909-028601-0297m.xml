                    the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, in some of which it is still far
                    from uncommon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Greece

                    common and scientific names are now used in a general sense. The true position
                    of the Flamingoes <hi rend="italic">(Phaenicopteridae)</hi> has been much
                    debated, and ornithologists are as yet by no means agreed upon it. Professor
                    Huxley <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> 1867, p.
                    460) considers the form “so completely intermediate between the Anserine birds
                    on the one side, and the Storks and Herons on the other, that it can be ranged
                    with neither.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus

                    itself as the type of a group <hi rend="italic">Amphimorphae</hi> under the

                    its affinity to the <hi rend="italic">Anatidae</hi> seems on many accounts to be
                    the strongest, but that it should stand as a distinct family is manifest.</p>
                <p>Though not a few birds have in proportion to the size of their body very long
                    legs and a very long neck, yet the way in which both are employed by the
                    Flamingo seems to be absolutely singular. In taking its food this bird reverses
                    the ordinary position of its head so as to hold the crown downwards and to look
                    backwards. The peculiar formation of the bill, which to the ordinary observer,
                    looks as if broken, is of course correlated with this habit of feeding, as well
                    as the fact that the <hi rend="italic">maxilla</hi> is (contrary to what obtains
                    in most birds) not only highly movable, but is much smaller than the <hi
                    rend="italic">mandibula</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> while the latter is
                    practically fixed. Both jaws are, however, beset with <hi rend="italic"
                    >lamellae,</hi> as in most of the Duck-tribe, and the food is thereby sifted out
                    of the mud as the Flamingo wades with its long neck stretching to. the bottom of
                    the shallow waters it frequents. Still more extraordinary is one of the uses
                    made of its long legs. The hen stands upon them<note anchored="true"

                    other birds is rightly called “sitting.” This fact was noticed so long ago as
                    1683 by Dampier, and his statement has been confirmed by the evidence collected
                    by many other travellers. It does not appear, however, that the act has been
                    personally witnessed by any author subsequent to him, and therefore his quai nt
                    and obviously truthful account of the way in which Flamingoes build their nests
                    and hatch their young, as observed by him in the Cape Verd Islands, may here be
                    quoted :—“They build their Nests in shallow Ponds, where there is much Mud,
                    which they scrape together, making little Hillocks, like small Islands,
                    appearing out of the Water a foot and half high from the bottom. They make the
                    foundation of these Hillocks broad, bringing them up tapering to the top, where
                    they leave a small hollow pit to lay their Eggs in; and when they either lay
                    their Eggs, or hatch them, they stand all the while, not on the Hillock, but
                    close by it with their Legs on the ground and in the water, resting themselves
                    against the Hillock, and covering the hollow Nest upon it with their Rumps: For
                    their Legs are very long; and building thus, as they do, upon the ground, they
                    could neither draw their Legs conveniently into their Nests, nor sit down upon
                    them otherwise than by resting their whole bodies there, to the prejudice of
                    their eggs or their young, were it not for this admirable contrivance, which
                    they have by natural instinct. They never lay more than two Eggs, and seldom
                    fewer. The young ones cannot fly till they are almost full grown, but will run
                    prodigiously fast; yet we have taken many of them.”—Dampier, <hi rend="italic"
                    >New Voyage round the World,</hi> ed. 2, corrected, vol. i. p. 71, London,
                    1697.</p>
                <p>It is of course only under very favourable circumstances that such nests as these
                    can be built. When time or place is wanting the hens seem to drop their eggs at
                    random, as Mr J. W. Clark was told they usually do at this day in the South of
                    France <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1870, p. 441), where a nest has not been
                    seen for some years. Flamingoes are eminently gregarious. Their favourite
                    resorts are salt-lakes—indeed these may be said to be a prime necessity; and
                    when, as often happens, they are diminished by drought, the birds have to take
                    long flights in quest of new haunts. Thus some of the wanderers occasionally get
                    separated from the main body, and appear in various unwonted spots. On the wing
                    the Flamingo is described as presenting a singular appearance, its neck and legs
                    being <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"

                    feeding or at rest, a flock of these birds, owing to their red plumage, has
                    often been likened to a body of British soldiers. The young appear to be a long
                    time in arriving at the full beauty of their plumage, and as the sexes are said
                    to differ greatly in size, some of the difficulties which the determination of
                    species in this genus presents may be excused. No fewer than four species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phoenicopterus</hi> have been described as inhabiting the Old
                    World. There is the large bird known to the ancients, Temminck’s <hi
                    rend="italic">P. antiquorum,</hi> which certainly ranges from the Cape Verd
                    Islands to the Caspian and to India, if not further. The <hi rend="italic">P.
                    erythraeus</hi> of Jules Verreaux has been described as differing in its
                    brighter plumage, and is supposed to be a native of Southern and Western Africa,
                    but it is also said to have strayed to Europe. Then two smaller species <hi
                    rend="italic">(P. minor,</hi> Geoffroy, and <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rubidus,</hi> Feilden)—the one from Africa the other from India,
                    have also been described, but whether their existence can be substantiated
                    remains to be seen. Four species have likewise been indicated as belonging to
                    the New World. There is first a large and very brilliantly-coloured bird to
                    which the Linusean name <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    World and of the New are entirely distinct; but the reason for assigning this
                    trivial name to one of the latter has yet to be explained by
                    ornithologists.</p></note><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> has been
                    continued, inhabiting suitable localities from Florida southwards to an
                    undetermined latitude. To this species Mr Salvin <hi rend="italic">(Trans.
                    Zool.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> ix. p. 498) refers the <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. glyphorhynchus</hi> of G. R. Gray, founded on a specimen from the Galapagos.
                    Then there is the <hi rend="italic">P. chilensis</hi> of Gmelin <hi
                    rend="italic">(P. ignipattiatus</hi> of later writers) which in colouring more
                    resembles the European species, and is found in various parts of South America.
                    Lastly comes the <hi rend="italic">P. andinus</hi> of Philippi, which is easily
                    distinguished from all others through the want of a back-toe, and was regarded
                    by Bonaparte as meriting generic separation under the name of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The fossil remains of a Flamingo have been recognized from Lower and Middle
                    Tertiary beds in France, and the species, which appears to have been very close

                    name of <hi rend="italic">P. croizeti</hi> from Professor Gervais. But a more
                    interesting discovery is that by Professor A. Milne-Edwards of no fewer than
                    five species of an extinct form of <hi rend="italic">Phaenicopteridae,</hi>
                    named by him <hi rend="italic">Paloelodus</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ois. Foss, de

                    epoch. The same distinguished zoologist also refers to this family remains
                    designated by him <hi rend="italic">Agnopterus,</hi> and those of the “<hi
