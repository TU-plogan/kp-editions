                    restricted to the high-couraged and long-winged Birds-of-Prey which take their
                    quarry as it moves; but formerly it had a very different meaning, being by the
                    naturalists of the last and even of the present century extended to a great
                    number of birds comprised in the genus <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi> of Linnaeus
                    and writers of his day,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The nomenclature of nearly all the older writers on this point is extremely
                    confused, and the attempt to unravel it would hardly repay the trouble, and
                    would undoubtedly occupy more space than could here be allowed. What many of
                    them, even so lately as Pennant’s time, termed the “Gentle Falcon” is certainly
                    the bird we now call the GosHawk <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> Goose-Hawk),
                    which name itself may have been transferred to the <hi rend="italic">A star
                    palumbarius</hi> of modern ornithologists, from one of the long^winged.
                    Birds-of-Prey.</p></note> while, on the other hand, by falconers, it was, and
                    still is, technically limited to <hi rend="italic">female</hi> of the birds
                    employed by them in their vocation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Falconry),</hi>
                    whether “long-winged” and therefore “noble,” or “short-winged” and
                    “ignoble.”</p>
                <p>According to modern usage, the majority of the Falcons, in the sense first given,
                    may be separated into <hi rend="italic">five</hi> very distinct groups :—(1) the
                    Falcons pure and simple <hi rend="italic">{Falco</hi> proper); (2) the large
                    northern Falcons <hi rend="italic">(Hierofalco,</hi> Cuvier); (3) the “Desert
                    Falcons” <hi rend="italic">(Genncea,</hi> Kaup); (4) the Merlins <hi
                    rend="italic">(sEsalon,</hi> Kaup); and (5) the Hobbies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hypotriorchis,</hi> Boie), The precise order in which these should be ranked
                    need not concern us here, but it must be mentioned that a sixth group, the
                    Kestrels <hi rend="italic">(Tinnunculus,</hi> Vieillot) is often added to them.
                    This, however, appears to have been justifiably reckoned a distinct genus, and
                    its consideration may for the present be deferred.</p>
                <p>The typical Falcon is by common consent allowed to be that almost cosmopolitan
                    species to which unfortunately the English epithet “peregrine” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> strange or wandering) has been attached. It is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Falco peregrinus</hi> of Tunstall (1771) and of most recent
                    ornithologists, though some<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the experience of those who have devoted years of study to the Falcons has
                    supplied.</p></note> prefer the specific name cowwntwtts.applied by J. F. Gmelin
                    a few years later (1788) to a bird which, if his diagnosis be correct, could not
                    have been a true Falcon at all, since it had yellow irides—a colour never met
                    with in the eyes of any bird now called by naturalists a “Falcon.” This species
                    inhabits suitable localities throughout the greater part of the globe, though
                    examples from North America have by some received specific recognition as <hi
                    rend="italic">F. anatum—</hi> the “Duck-Hawk,” and those from Australia have
                    been described as distinct under the name of <hi rend="italic">F.
                    melanogenys.</hi> Here, as in so many other cases, it is almost impossible to
                    decide as to which forms should, and which should not, be accounted merely local
                    races. In size not surpassing a Raven, this Falcon (fig. 1) is perhaps the most
                    powerful Bird-of-Prey for its bulk that flies, and its courage is not less than
                    its power. It is the species, in Europe, most commonly trained for the sport of
                    hawking (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Falconry).</hi> Volumes have been written upon
                    it, and to attempt a complete account of it is, within the limits now available,
                    impossible. The plumage of the adult is generally blackish-blue above, and
                    white, with a more or less deep cream-coloured tinge, beneath—the lower parts,
                    except the chin and throat, being barred transversely with black, while a black
                    patch extends from the bill to the ear-coverts, and descends on either side
                    beneath the mandible. The young have the upper parts deep blackish-brown, and
                    the lower white, more or less strongly tinged with ochraceous-brown, and striped
                    longitudinally with blackish-brown. From Port Kennedy, the most northern part of
                    the American continent, to Tasmania, and from the shores of the Sea of Ochotsk
                    to Mendoza in the Argentine territory, there is scarcely a country in which this
                    Falcon has not been found. Specimens have been received from the Cape of Good
                    Hope, and it is only a question of the technical differentiation of species,
                    whether it does not extend to Cape Horn. Fearless as it is, and adapting itself
                    to almost every circumstance, it will form its eyry equally on the sea-washed
                    cliffs, the craggy mountains, or (though more rarely) the drier spots of a marsh
                    in the northern hemisphere, as on trees (says Schlegel) in the forests of Java,
                    or the waterless ravines of Australia. In the United Kingdom it was formerly
                    very common, and hardly a high rock from the Shetlands to the Isle of Wight but
                    had a pair as its tenants. But the British gamekeeper has long held the mistaken
                    faith that it is his worst foe, and the number of pairs which are now allowed to
                    rear their brood unmolested in these islands must be small indeed. Yet its
                    utility to the game-preserver, by destroying every one of his most precious
                    wards that shews any sign of infirmity, can hardly be questioned by reason, and
                    no one has more earnestly urged its claims to protection than Mr G. E. Freeman
                    <hi rend="italic">(Falconry,</hi> &amp;c., p. 10).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is not to be inferred, however, as many
                    writers have done, that Falcons habitually prey upon birds in which disease has
                    made any <pb corresp="kp-eb0909-0012-0003" xml:id="pbn9003"/> serious progress.
                    Such birds meet their fate from the less noble <hi rend="italic"
                    >Accipitres,</hi> or predatory animals of many kinds. But when a bird is <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> affected by any disorder, its power of taking care of
                    itself is at once impaired, and hence in the majority of cases it may become an
                    easy victim under circumstances which would enable a perfectly sound bird to
                    escape from the attack even of a Falcon.</p></note> Nearly allied to this Falcon
                    <pb corresp="pbn9003" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n12/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0012-0003"/> are several species of which it is impossible
                    here to treat at length, such as <hi rend="italic">F. barbarns</hi> of
                    Mauritania, <hi rend="italic">F. minor</hi> of South Africa, the Asiatic <hi
                    rend="italic">F. babylonicus, F. peregrinator</hi> of India—the Shaheen, and
                    perhaps <hi rend="italic">F. cassini</hi> of South America, with some
                    others.</p>
                <p>Next to the typical Falcons comes a group known as the “great northern” Falcons
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hierofalco').</hi> Of these the most remarkable is the
                    Gyrfalcon <hi rend="italic">(F. gyrfalco),</hi> whose home is in the
                    Scandinavian mountains, though the young are yearly visitants to the plains of
                    Holland and Germany. In plumage it very much resembles <hi rend="italic">F.
                    peregrinns,</hi> but its flanks have generally a bluer tinge, and its
                    superiority in size is at once manifest. Nearly allied to it is the Icelander
                    <hi rend="italic">(F. islanclus),</hi> which externally differs in its paler
                    colouring, and in almost entirely wanting the black mandibular patch. Its
                    proportions, however, differ a good deal, its body being elongated. Its country
                    is shown by its name, but it also inhabits South Greenland, and not unfrequently
                    makes its way to the British Islands. Very close to this comes the Greenland
                    Falcon <hi rend="italic">(F. candicans),</hi> a native of North Greenland, and
                    perhaps of other countries within the Arctic circle. Like the last, the
                    Greenland Falcon from time to time occurs in the United Kingdom, but it is
                    always to be distinguished by wearing a plumage in which at every age the
                    prevailing colour is pure white. In North-Eastern America these birds are
                    replaced by a kindred form <hi rend="italic">(F. labradorns)</hi> first detected
                    by Audubon, and lately recognized by Mr Dresser <hi rend="italic">(Orn.
                    Miscell.,</hi> i. p. 135). It is at once distinguished by its very dark
                    colouring, the lower parts being occasionally almost as deeply tinted at all
                    ages as the upper.</p>
                <p>All the birds hitherto named possess one character in common. The darker markings
                    of their plumage are longitudinal before the first real moult takes place, and
                    for ever afterwards are transverse. In other words, when young the markings are
                    in form of stripes, when old in form of bars. The variation of tint is very
                    great, especially in <hi rend="italic">F. peregrinns;</hi> but the experience of
                    falconers, whose business it is to keep their birds in the very highest
                    condition, shews that a Falcon of either of these groups if light-coloured in
                    youth is light coloured when adult, and if dark when young is also dark when
                    old—age, <hi rend="italic">after the first moult,</hi> making no difference in
                    the complexion of the bird. The next group is that of the so-called
                    “Desert-Falcons” <hi rend="italic">(Genncea'),</hi> wherein the difference just
                    indicated does not obtain, for long as the bird may live and often as it may
                    moult, the original style of markings never gives way to any other. Foremost
                    among these are to be considered the Lanner and the Saker (commonly termed <hi
                    rend="italic">F. lanarius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">F. sacer),</hi> both well
                    known in the palmy days of Falconry, but only within the last forty years or so
                    re-admitted to full recognition. Both of these birds belong properly to
                    South-eastern Europe, North Africa, and South-western Asia. They are, for their
                    bulk, less powerful than the members of the preceding group, and though they may
                    be trained to high flights are naturally captors of humbler game. The precise
                    number of species belonging here is very doubtful, but among the many candidates
                    for recognition are especially to be named the Lugger <hi rend="italic">(F.
                    jugger)</hi> of India, and the Prairie Falcon <hi rend="italic">(F.
                    mexicanus)</hi> of the western plains of North America.</p>
                <p>The systematist finds it hard to decide in what group he should place two
                    somewhat large Australian species <hi rend="italic">(F. hypoleucus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">F. subniger),</hi> both of which are rare in collections—the
                    latter especially; and, until more is known about them, their position must
                    remain doubtful.</p>
                <p>We have then a small but very beautiful group—the Merlins<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>French, <hi rend="italic">Emirillon;</hi>
                    Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Smirill.</hi></p></note><hi rend="italic"
                    >(jEsalon</hi> of some writers, <hi rend="italic">Lithofalco</hi> of others).
                    The</p>
                <p>European Merlin <hi rend="italic">(F. cesalon)</hi> is perhaps the boldest of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Accipitres,</hi> not hesitating to attack birds of twice its
                    own size, and even on occasion threatening human beings. Yet it readily becomes
                    tame, if not affectionate, when reclaimed, and its ordinary prey consists of the
                    smaller <hi rend="italic">Passeres.</hi> Its “pinion of glossy blue” has become
                    almost proverbial, and a deep ruddy blush suffuses its lower parts; but these
                    are characteristic only of the male—the female maintaining very nearly the sober
                    brown plumage she wore when as a nestling she left her lowly cradle in the
                    heather. Very close to this bird comes the Pigeon-Hawk <hi rend="italic">(F.
                    columbarius)</hi> of North America—so close, indeed, that none but an expert
                    ornithologist can detect the difference. The Turumti of Anglo-Indians <hi
                    rend="italic">(F. chicquera'),</hi> and its representative from Southern Africa
                    (X <hi rend="italic">rvficollis),</hi> also belong to this group, but they are
                    considerably larger than either of the former.</p>
                <p>Lastly, we have the Hobbies <hi rend="italic">(Hypotriorchis)</hi> comprising a
                    greater number of forms—though how many seems to be doubtful. They are in life
                    at once recognizable by their bold upstanding position, and at any time by their
                    long wings. The type of this group is the English Hobby <hi rend="italic">(F.
                    subbuteo),</hi> a bird of great power of flight, chiefly used in <pb break="no"

                    food. It is a summer visitant to most parts of Europe, including these islands,
                    and is most wantonly and needlessly destroyed by gamekeepers. A second European
                    species of the group is the beautiful <hi rend="italic">F. eleonoroe,</hi> which
                    hardly comes further north than the countries bordering the Mediterranean, and,
                    though in some places abundant, is an extremely local bird. The largest species
                    of this section seems to be the Neotropical <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi
