                    such water generally comes from a considerable depth in the ground (as appears,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> from its equable temperature throughout the year);
                    and having traversed a variety of porous strata, it has undergone a straining
                    action, producing the beautiful transparency we observe. This does not, of
                    course, represent absolute purity, for the liquid retains in solution various
                    substances acquired by contact with the strata through which it has percolated.
                    The operation of filtration is extensively practised in purification of water,
                    on a large scale for supply of towns and cities (now an important branch of
                    civil engineering), and on a small scale for domestic purposes, and for the use
                    of ships on a long voyage, &amp;c. It is also a valued method in chemistry and
                    the arts.</p>
                <p>The mechanical action of straining, by which all particles larger than the
                    interstices of the porous material are arrested, is one important function of
                    filters, and it used to be commonly represented as their only function. They may
                    act, however, in other ways to purify water. Not to speak of the further
                    mechanical actions of subsidence on upper surfaces of particles of the filtering
                    medium, and lateral attraction and adhesion of suspended matter (which doubtless
                    occur in some measure), it is an important fact, now well ascertained, that a
                    filter may separate from water <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0176-0167"/> a portion of the matter held in solution. On the
                    other hand, it is often precisely such matter, when of organic origin and
                    putrescent (and minute invisible disease-germs may here be included with the
                    matter in solution), that it is specially desirable to remove from drinking
                    water, as being prolific of mischief when taken into the system. In numerous
                    instances an outbreak of virulent disease, such as typhoid fever, has been
                    clearly traced to water so contaminated. The danger is the greater that such
                    water may be bright and sparkling, and peculiarly palatable.</p>
                <p>That even sand has the power of removing dissolved matter from water was shown by
                    Mr Witt’s valuable experiments at Chelsea, described in 1856. In one of these,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> water containing 1 ’ 42 grains of chloride of
                    sodium per gallon (70,000 grains) was deprived of 22 per cent, of that substance
                    by filtration through a depth of 1 foot 9 inches of sand. The sand had no
                    appreciable action on dissolved organic matter, as charcoal had, but the
                    quantity of such matter originally present was small. It is probable that all
                    finely porous material has such action, more or less. The efficiency of charcoal
                    in this respect, and especially fresh animal charcoal, has been well
                    demonstrated and utilized. The mode of the disappearance of dissolved organic
                    impurities has been a disputed point. Some say they are retained and accumulated
                    in the pores of the charcoal; but the experimental evidence seems to leave
                    little doubt that they are mainly oxidized, so as hardly to impair the activity
                    of the filter. In fact, the value of a filtering material will be found to
                    depend chiefly on the power it has of bringing oxygen, stored in its fine pores
                    or otherwise provided, into chemical union with the dissolved organic matter and
                    destroying it. At the same time it is obvious that, chiefly by the mechanical
                    action of straining, organic matter may accumulate in a filtering medium, and in
                    course of time, through decomposition, render the water which passes through
                    more impure and less wholesome than in its unfiltered state.</p>
                <p>We may remark here that river water and shallow well water, while extensively
                    used for water supply, are in general the most largely polluted. Rivers commonly
                    receive large volumes of sewage, impure surface water from cultivated land, and
                    other contamination. The water of shallow wells, especially in large towns, or
                    when near churchyards, stables, cesspools, &lt;fcc., is often contaminated with
                    organic matter of the worst kind, in large quantity. While rain water, collected
                    from the roofs of houses in butts, no doubt contains organic matter, this hardly
                    bears comparison in amount to the organic impurity in rivers (thus Dr Hassall
                    found it a hundredfold less). Deep spring water, again, is freed from much of
                    its organic impurity through natural filtration. The advantages of a good
                    lake-supply for large towns has been amply demonstrated in these days, notably
                    in the case of Glasgow, which draws its water from Loch Katrine.</p>
                <p>Though the arrangements for water supply of most of our large towns include
                    filtering processes by means of which, as a rule, excellent drinking water is
                    abundantly provided, so that in the opinion of some chemists a domestic filter
                    may be superfluous, while it is sometimes a source of harm (owing to lack of
                    proper attention), it is generally thought a wise additional safeguard to employ
                    one of those instruments, in view, more especially, of some of the possible
                    consequences of epidemics and floods, and the necessity of housestorage of the
                    water received. In country places, and in various other circumstances, their use
                    is often quite imperative if the laws of health are to be respected.</p>
                <p>The Japanese and Egyptians seem to have used water filters at an early period.
                    These consisted of sandstone or unglazed earthenware, and were of bowl or egg
                    shape, with small Drojections at the top resting on a wooden frame. The water
                    poured into this vessel filtered through to a vessel below. About the middle of
                    last century, slabs of a lias found in Picardy were used as a filtering agent,
                    being fitted as a false bottom in water cisterns; the water was drawn off
                    through a tap from the space below. A porous filtering stone of Teneriffe was at
                    one time imported largely into England. The “alcarrhazas” are filter vessels of
                    porous biscuit stoneware made in Spain.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest filters in England was that patented by Mrs Johanna Hempel in
                    1790. It was a supported basin made of tobacco pipe (or similar) clay and coarse
                    sea, river, drift, or pit sand, and hardened in the furnace. In the following
                    year (1791) the ascending principle was first applied by Mr James Peacock. Water
                    from an upper reservoir was admitted through a pipe to the bottom of a box
                    containing strata of sand, gravel, and a mixture of charcoal and powdered
                    calcareous stone. Passing up through this, it was drawn off by a pipe at the
                    top. The filter was occasionally cleaned with an exhausting and condensing pump,
                    which sucked up water rapidly through the filtering material and then sent it
                    back with force, washing out the dirt.</p>
                <p>The construction of filters is a matter on which inventiveness has been largely
                    exercised. All sorts of porous substances have been called into requisition, as
                    may be seen by a glance at the patent records. Thus, to mention some of these,
                    we have various kinds of stone, sand, gravel, powdered glass, clay, porous
                    sulphur, preparations of iron, charcoal (vegetable and animal), cloth, felt,
                    horsehair, skins, paper, silicated carbon, sponge, wood, wool, cane, capillary
                    threads, and so on. Vegetable charcoal, we may note, was first employed in 1802,
                    animal charcoal in 1818, and solid carbon blocks in 1834.</p>
                <p>It is impossible here, and it would be tedious, to give anything like a detailed
                    account of the changes that have been rung on the filtering principle for
                    domestic filters. In the simplest and most familiar forms, of course, the water
                    passes down by its own gravitation through the filtering medium to a reservoir
                    below. The force of downward pressure has sometimes been augmented by a head of
                    water, sometimes by a force pump, and sometimes by means of air condensed above
                    the water to be passed through the filter. Or the air has been extracted from
                    the vessel containing the filtered liquid, thus adding force to the atmospheric
                    pressure above. The ascending principle has appeared in various applications;
                    and in some cases the water has been caused first to descend and then to ascend
                    through filtering material (a vertical partition, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    being fixed in a vessel so as to reach nearly to the bottom, and layers of sand
                    and vitrified limestone being placed on either side of the lower part; the water
                    is poured in on one side of the partition and drawn from the other side near the
                    top). Lateral filtration has also been tried. Filters have been arranged to act
                    in the cistern, or in connexion with the service pipe between the cistern and
                    the water tap, or independently, and, in the latter case, either having the
                    unfiltered water poured into them, or being placed in a vessel of it, and giving
                    filtered water through a tube. Sometimes a series of separate connected vessels
                    have been employed; and for very dirty water it is often advantageous to have
                    one system of filtration for the coarser, and another for the finer impurities.
                    Once more, filters have been rendered self-supply in g by means of a ball-cock.
                    These are some of the general forms which the filter has taken.</p>
                <p>The application of pressure to filters cannot as a rule be pursued very far, for
                    it tends to derange the apparatus and render the filtered liquid muddy.
                    Enlargement of surface is a better means of obtaining rapid filtration. Upward
                    filtration, while it offers some advantages over downward, has not hitherto come
                    very much into use. It is open to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n177/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0177-0168"/> objection in that the water sent upwards has a
                    tendency to force a passage through certain channels, without being uniformly
                    disseminated in the material; and the deposit of any filth is excluded from
                    view, and mostly also from smell, instead of being exposed and giving us
                    warning.</p>
                <p>In passing now to examine more closely some of the approved forms of domestic
                    filter at present in use, it should be borne in mind that while any of these
                    filters will doubtless purify water both mechanically and chemically, more or
                    less, it is only on condition of their being properly attended to, and the
                    filtering material renovated at intervals depending on its nature and the nature
                    and amount of impurity in the water. The term “self-cleansing,” applied to some
                    filters, may have a (limited) true sense, but if understood to imply that a
                    filter, let alone, will go on <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi> giving pure
                    water, it is quite inapplicable; solid impurities <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
                    accumulate and call for removal. The statement, occasionally made, that a filter
                    is “warranted to remove all impurities” from water is absurd and hardly deserves
                    notice. Absolutely pure water is a thing almost unknown; careful distillation
                    alone will give an approximation to it. Again, the claim that a filter will
                    remove <hi rend="italic">all</hi> lime from water is often false; filtration is
                    capable of removing only a small quantity of lime. It must be allowed that
                    sundry points in the process of filtration still remain in some obscurity, and
                    it is matter of regret that the action of some common filtering agents has not
                    been so fully cleared up by scientific experiment as others. Still enough has
                    been ascertained probably to guide to the construction of a filter on rational
                    principles.</p>
                <p>In a large proportion of filters, as already indicated, some form or other of
                    carbon is the chief filtering agent. The well-known filters of Lipscombe are
                    cylindrical-shaped covered vessels of glazed earthenware, in which the filtering
                    medium, a mixture of vegetable and animal charcoal, in granular form, is
                    enclosed between two slabs cemented in the case. The upper (glazed earthenware)
                    slab has a central aperture with raised border, and a small perforated basin
                    immediately below it; into this is inserted a sponge to arrest the grosser
                    impurities, which is taken out and cleaned at short intervals. The filtered
                    water passes through the lower (and porous) slab to the reservoir below, which
                    communicates above with the outer air by a narrow tube passing up within to the
                    top of the apparatus, and delivers its water through a tap.</p>
                <p>Charcoal in the form of solid finely porous blocks, which can be conveniently
                    brushed and cleaned externally, is now often moulded for filters. The convenient
                    decanter filter, in which the water passes through the block to a central tube,
                    forms an elegant addition to the sideboard. The annexed figure (1) represents
                    one of these as made by Atkins, who also furnishes earthenware filter vessels
                    having a division across the inside wherein a carbon block is fitted
                    water-tight, which can readily be taken out and cleaned and replaced, or a fresh
                    one substituted. Sometimes the block is fitted in a movable pan. Again, in the
                    filter shown in fig. 2 a double filtration is effected, the water passing first
                    through loose charcoal B, then through a charcoal block C, supported as shown.
                    The block in this case is said to last longer without cleaning. The movable and
                    perforated earthenware plate A, which is placed above the charcoal (see fig. 3),
                    allows of easy renewal of the latter. The charcoal used in these filters is
                    chiefly of vegetable origin. They are found to remove more or less of organic
                    and inorganic matter dissolved in water.</p>
                <p>It may be useful here to call attention to some of the conclusions arrived at
                    regarding charcoal in the sixth report of the Royal Commission on Rivers’
                    Pollution a short time ago. <hi rend="italic">Fresh</hi> animal charcoal has
                    been proved to act powerfully in the removal of organic impurity (considerably
                    more so than vegetable charcoal), as well as of mineral matter. But, according
                    to Dr Frankland, its reduction of the hardness ceases in about a fortnight, the
                    removal of organic matter continuing even after six months, though to a much
                    less extent, especially if the filter be much used. It was found necessary to
                    renew the charcoal every six months when used for filtering the comparatively
                    pure water of the London New River Company, whilst the water of the Thames
                    required renewal of the charcoal every three months. If this be not done,
                    myriads of minute worms, we are told, are developed in the material passing out
                    with the filtered water. Other statements, of scientific weight, regarding
                    animal charcoal are more favourable to it, and seem to show that under certain
                    conditions, perhaps imperfectly understood, it may give better results.</p>
                <p>In Major Crease’s system, which is adopted in the British army and navy, loose
                    animal charcoal is compressed between plates by means of a screw, the amount of
                    compression being determined by the degree of impurity in the water to be
                    filtered.</p>
                <p>The silicated carbon of Mr Dahlke’s filters is obtained by mixing animal or
                    vegetable charcoal with the residue of distillation of Boghead coal. By adding a
                    little clay to the latter product, and saturating the whole with oily matter, it
                    can be moulded, after which it is burnt. In one form of the filter, two carbon
                    blocks are sealed into the interior of earthenware vessel, granulated carbon
                    being placed between them; in another, a double action is obtained by placing a
                    carbon block over the entrance to a second carbon medium. These filters have
                    been highly commended for their chemical properties, attributed to magnetic
                    oxide of iron present in the medium. We give (fig. 4) a representation of the
                    silicated carbon siphon filter with its case. Water may be sucked through it
                    from a stream directly into the mouth, or passed siphon-wise from one vessel
                    into another. These and similar pocket filters of Atkins’s were supplied to the
                    Ashantee expedition.</p>
                <p>A very powerful filtering medium was discovered and introduced many years ago by
                    Mr Thomas Spencer. It is called <hi rend="italic">magnetic carbide,</hi> and
                    consists of protoxide of iron in chemical combination with carbon. It is
                    obtained by roasting hematite iron-ore with granulated charcoal for twelve to
                    sixteen hours at a dull red heat. Mr Spencer considers the purifying property of
                    the oxide to be due to its power of attracting oxygen to its surface, without
                    tho latter being acted upon, the oxygen attracted being then <pb break="no"

                    of the water is consumed. The magnetic carbide is used in granular form. This
                    filter gained prize medals at the last London and Paris exhibitions, and its
                    efficiency was demonstrated by the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi> Sanitary
                    Commissioners’ report on filters in 18G7.</p>
                <p>The only other system we shall hero notice is that in which spongy iron is used.
                    This substance is metallic iron which has been reduced from an oxide without
                    fusion. It is in a spongy or porous state of extremely fine division. Its
                    remarkable purifying action on water was discovered by Professor Gustav Bischof
                    of the Andersonian University, Glasgow; and experiments made with his filters by
                    the Royal Commissioners already referred to showed that their power both of
                    removing organic matter and reducing the hardness of water even increased during
                    upwards of eight months’ constant use. The general form of the filter is
                    represented in fig. 5. An inner vessel containing tho spongy iron is supported
                    in a case, which, below, contains some prepared sand, a regulator A, and a
                    receptacle C, for filtered water (with tap, not shown). The unfiltered water B
                    is in this form supplied from a bottle which is inverted into the upper part of
                    the inner vessel (a method familiar to chemists). After passing through the
                    spongy iron, the water ascends through an overflow pipe in the direction of the
                    arrows; the object of this is to keep the spongy iron, when once wet, constantly
                    under water, as otherwise it is too rapidly oxidized. The object of the prepared
                    sand (which is generally in three layers, viz., pyrolusite at the top, then
                    sand, then gravel) is to separate traces of iron retained in solution. The
                    regulator A consists of a tin tube, cemented in the position shown; it is open
                    at the inner end, which is below the perforated bottom supporting the sand, and
                    closed by a screw cap at its outer end. It has also a small lateral perforation,
                    through which alone the filtered water passes into the reservoir. Should the
                    perforations get choked, the screw cap is removed, and a brush inserted; on
                    starting at first, too, the · cap is unscrewed, that the materials may be well
                    washed out without soiling the lower reservoir. With a ball-cock and constant
                    supply of water, the inner vessel is dispensed with.</p>
                <p>The nature of the action of the metal on organic matter is rather obscure. Mr
                    Bischof considers there are both reducing and oxidizing agencies constantly at
                    work, and that the oxides of iron, being present in their nascent state, must be
                    very energetic in their action. Probably ferric hydrate, the last product of
                    oxidation, takes an active part in separation of the organic matter,
                    transferring oxygen to it. Again, spongy iron is known to be very energetic in
                    precipitating any lead or copper. Its reduction of the hardness of water
                    presents some difficulty.</p>
                <p>This filter, we may add, recently gained the prize medal for general excellence
                    given by the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, and has been otherwise
                    commended.</p>
                <p>The subject of cistern filters (of which there are many varieties) need not
                    detain us long here. The arrangement adopted by Lipscombe, shown in fig. 6, may
                    be taken as an example. The impure water passes through the inlet into the
                    chamber of the filter, thence upwards through a plate of porous stone, then
                    through powdered charcoal into the pure water reservoir, whence it may be drawn
                    off <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> cold by the pure water tap, or hot and pure
                    from the boiler.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n179/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0179-0170"/>
                <p>When the filter is in action, the grosser impurities are stopped by the porous
                    stone, while the finer pass into the charcoal and are chemically acted on. Each
                    time the unfiltered water tap is opened to obtain water, unfiltered water enters
                    the inlet and scours out the impurities in the chamber. To clean the filter,
                    once every six months or other period, a plug is drawn up by means of a
                    galvanized chain (attached as shown) from the top of the filter and dropped into
                    the inlet. The unfiltered water tap is then turned on several minutes, so that
                    the cistern water rushes down through the filter and out of the tap, carrying
                    out impurities from the filter.</p>
                <p>In the filtration of water for supply of towns, galleries of masonry are often
                    constructed in the sand and gravel forming the river bed or banks; the water
                    percolates through and enters these tunnels at the bottom and by side channels;
                    it is thence pumped to the town. Genoa, Toulouse, Lyons, and Perth present
                    examples of this system, which is apt to prove rather costly. The system of
                    artificial filter-beds of sand resting on gravel, &amp;c., is now more generally
                    adopted. It was first introduced into London by Mr Simpson, in 1839, after a
                    study of various works in the north, and especially of the costly experience of
                    Glasgow. For the Chelsea Water Company he had a series of tunnels built of brick
                    without mortar; these were covered with a layer of fine gravel 2 feet thick,
                    then a 2-feet stratum of fine gravel and coarse sand, and lastly 2 feet of fine
                    sand, or 6 feet in all. The sand was periodically removed to the depth of about
                    half an inch. To the filter bed, covering 1 acre, were attached two reservoirs,
                    slightly higher; into these river water was pumped, which, after time for
                    subsidence, was admitted to the filter beds through small pipes.</p>
                <p>The eight Water Companies of London all use similar beds, increasing in
                    coarseness downwards, of various depth and proportion of materials. A sharp
                    siliceous sand is preferred for the upper bed (the true filtering agent), and
                    the stratum is seldom made less than 2 or more than 3 feet thick. Sometimes this
                    bed is laid immediately on a bed of small shells.</p>
                <p>It is considered that filtration through sand, to be effective, should not
                    proceed more rapidly than 6 inches of descent per hour (in the London beds the
                    rate varies from 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 to 10 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 7 inches), and that there should be about 1^ square yards of filtering
                    area for each 1000 gallons per day. The depth of water maintained on filter-beds
                    varies between 1 foot and 7 or 8 feet. The inlet arrangements should be such as
                    to produce little disturbance of the sand in charging; thus the water may be
                    admitted into a long trough from which it gently overflows, or through an inlet
                    pipe carried to the centre of the bed and turned upwards (at Chelsea the water
                    enters through a wall of gravel between two horizontal concentric arches of
                    brickwork with vertical joints). The beds are drained variously, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by means of perforated stoneware pipes, or pipes with
                    open joints, sometimes leading into a brick culvert which traverses the bed. A
                    good method of draining is that of Mr Muir, adopted by the New River Company. It
                    consists of two courses of bricks laid flat and dry; in the lower, the bricks
                    are placed end to end in series alternating with half-brick spaces which serve
                    as drains leading to a central culvert; in the upper course, the bricks are laid
                    close together, forming a floor, on which a thin layer of fine gravel supports a
                    bed of sand.</p>
                <p>Filter beds require to be cleaned, at intervals varying from one week to six or
                    eight, by removal of about half an inch of sand. The clean sand remaining is
                    loosened with a rake and exposed to the air some time, then smoothed over. The
                    filter bed may be made with several compartments, some of which may remain in
                    action while others are being cleansed. There are various contrivances for
                    washing sand previous to its replacement. Filter beds are sometimes arranged to
                    be cleansed by a reverse current sent upwards with force,—an operation which may
                    be aided by stirring the surface sand after the water has come above it. Such a
                    system is practiced, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Greenock, Paisley, and
                    Dunkirk water works. At the last-named place, washed coke iβ among the filtering
                    agents used. (For an account of the works at Dunkirk see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Engineering,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 206.) In the system of M. Maurraz the water is
                    filtered both <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">ascensum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">descensum,</hi> the two portions of
                    water, which flow in opposite directions, uniting at the middle. The sand is
                    retained in closed and perforated boxes. This filter also permits of cleansing
                    by reversal of the current. Mr Spencer’s carbide system has been applied
                    successfully on a large scale at Wakefield and other places, the carbide layer
                    being combined with others of sand and gravel. With carbide, the total thickness
                    of bed may be considerably reduced.</p>
                <p>Filtering is frequently practised by the chemist. And whereas in the ordinary
                    filtration of water above described the purified liquid is the object of the
                    process, while the matter retained is merely to be got rid of and destroyed, the
                    reverse may be the case in the laboratory, the retained matter being sought,
                    while the “filtrate,” as it is called, is disregarded. For most laboratory
                    preparations the material used is unsized paper. Swedish filtering paper (which
                    is prepared with very pure spring water) possesses the advantage of filtering
                    very rapidly, and of being singularly free from inorganic matter. Cloth is
                    employed in the case of viscid liquids such as syrup or white of egg; while
                    corrosive liquids may be filtered through pounded glass. Asbestos is a valuable
                    filtering material, since, by making it red hot, all organic matter may be
                    destroyed, and acid and alkalies have scarcely any action in it. Being nearly
                    indestructible, it can be repeatedly used. Glass-wool has also of late years
                    been recommended.</p>
                <p>Paper filters, to be placed in a fuunel, are sold ready cut of circular shape.
                    The paper is folded twice to the form of a quadrant, and this, when half opened,
                    forms a cone, whose edges meet at an angle of 60°. To facilitate passage of the
                    filtered liquid, small folds are sometimes made in the filter all round. In a
                    filter devised by Bunsen, the neck of the filter is inserted in the caoutchouc
                    stopper of a lower vessel, and through this stopper also passes a tube connected
                    with an exhausting apparatus. The production of a partial vacuum below
                    accelerates the filtering process. Sometimes substances have to be filtered
                    under the influence of heat, as they solidify at ordinary temperature. In such
                    cases the funnel may be surrounded by a sleeve containing water, which is heated
                    with a lamp.</p>
                <p>In Robinson’s oil filter, oil is forced up from a cask into and through the
                    filtering apparatus (containing charcoal or other medium) by water entering
                    below from an upper reservoir. Sundry modes of filtration practised in the arts
                    (sugar-refining, &amp;c.) will be referred to elsewhere. In some of them
                    centrifugal force is employed.</p>
                <p>Circumstances are not uncommon in which it is very desirable to remove impurities
                    from air by a process of filtration. Cutlers and other grinders use respirators
                    to arrest the small particles which would otherwise find their way into the
                    lungs. For steel particles magnetic gauze is an efficient protective. Professor
                    Tyndall’s respirator for firemen consists of an iron cylinder, attached to a
                    mask, and containing charcoal, and three layers of cotton wool, one moistened
                    with glycerine; the ends of the case are of wire gauze. With this respirator it
                    is possible to enter an atmosphere of dense smoke and remain in it over a
                    quarter of an hour. The disinfecting properties of charcoal have been turned to
                    good account by Dr Stenhouse for purifying <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n180/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0180-0171"/> air, the substance being used in the construction
                    of respirators, or at the outlet of sewers, &amp;c. An interesting application
                    of the principle was made in the justice room of the Mansion House, London, in
                    1854, where offensive smells originating just under one of the windows were
                    effectually removed. There are various devices in existence for purifying the
                    air admitted to railway carriages and other inclosed spaces. Thus the air may be
                    passed through wire screens, or through a spray of water, &amp;c. In connexion
                    with biological research and the germ theory of disease, the removal, by
                    filtration, of minute foreign particles from air is a matter of great
                    moment.</p>
