                    literature of his country from the pedantries and affectations of the 17th and
                    18th centuries, was born at Zante on the 26th of January 1778. On the death of
                    his father, a physician at Spalatro, in Dalmatia, the family removed to Venice,
                    and in the university of Padua Foscolo prosecuted the studies begun in the
                    Dalmatian grammar school. The fact that amongst his Paduan masters was the Abbé
                    Cesarotti, whose version of Ossian had made that work highly popular in Italy,
                    was not without influence on Foscolo’s literary tastes, and his early knowſledge
                    of modern facilitated his studies in ancient Greek. His literary ambition
                    revealed itself by the appearance in 1797 of his tragedy <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tieste—</hi> a production which obtained a certain degree of success. Foscolo,
                    who from causes not clearly explained, had changed his Christian name Niccolo to
                    that of Ugo, now began to take an active part in the stormy political
                    discussions which the fall of the republic of Venice had provoked. He was a
                    prominent member of the national committees, and addressed an ode to Napoleon
                    the liberator, expecting from the military successes of the French general, not
                    merely the overthrow of the effete Venetian oligarchy, but the establishment of
                    a free republican government. The treaty of Campo Formio (17th Oct. 1797), by
                    which Napoleon handed Venice over to the Austrians, gave a rude shock to
                    Foscolo, but did not quite destroy his hopes. The state of mind produced by that
                    shock is reflected in the letters of Jacopo Ortis, a species of political
                    Werther,— for the hero of Foscolo embodies the mental sufferings and suicide of
                    an undeceived Italian patriot just as the hero of Goethe places before us the
                    too delicate sensitiveness embittering and at last cutting short the life of a
                    private German scholar. The story of Foscolo, like that of Goethe, had a
                    groundwork of melancholy fact. Jacopo Ortis had been a real personage; he was a
                    young student of Padua, and committed suicide there under circumstances akin to
                    those described by Foscolo. At this period Foscolo’s mind appears to have been
                    only too familiar with the thought of suicide. Cato and the many classical
                    examples of selfdestruction scattered through the pages of Plutarch appealed to
                    the imaginations of young Italian patriots as they had done in France to those
                    of the heroes and heroines of the Gironde. In the case of Foscolo as in that of
                    Goethe, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n503/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0503-0472"/> the effect produced on the writer’s mind by the
                    composition of the work seems to have been beneficial. He had seen the ideal of
                    a great national future rudely shattered; but he did not despair of his country,
                    and sought relief in now turning to gaze on the ideal of a great national poet.
                    At Milan, whither he repaired after the fall of Venice, he was engaged iu other
                    literary pursuits besides the composition of <hi rend="italic">Ortis.</hi> The
                    friendship formed there with the great poet Parini was ever afterwards
                    remembered with pride and gratitude. The friendship formed with another
                    celebrated Milanese poet soon gave place to a feeling of bitter enmity. Still
                    hoping that his country would be freed by Napoleon, he served as a volunteer in
                    the French army, took part in the battle of the Trebbia and the siege of Genoa,
                    was wounded and made prisoner. When released he returned to Milan, and there
                    gave the last touches to his <hi rend="italic">Ortis,</hi> published a
                    translation of and commentary upon <hi rend="italic">Calli~</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">machus,</hi> commenced a version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> and began his translation of Sterne’s <hi rend="italic">Sentimental
                    Journey.</hi> The result of a memorandum prepared for Lyons, where along with
                    other Italian delegates he was to have laid before Napoleon the state of Italy,
                    only proved that the views cherished by him for his country were too bold to be
                    even submitted to the dictator of France. The year 1807 witnessed the appearance
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Carme</hi><hi rend="italic">sui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sepolcri,</hi> of which the entire spirit and language may be described as a
                    sublime effort to seek refuge in the past from the misery of the present and the
                    darkness of the future. The mighty dead are summoned from their tombs, as ages
                    before they had been in the master-pieces of Greek oratory, to fight again the
                    battles of their country. The inaugural lecture on the origin and duty of
                    literature, delivered by Foscolo in January 1809 when appointed to the chair of
                    Italian eloquence at Pavia, was conceived in the same spirit. In this lecture
                    Foscolo urged his young countrymen to study letters, not in obedience to
                    academic traditions, but in their relation to individual and national life and
                    growth. The sensation produced by this lecture had no slight share in provoking
                    the decree of Napoleon by which the chair of national eloquence was abolished in
                    all the Italian universities. Soon afterwards Foscolo’s tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ajax</hi> was represented but with little success at Milan, and
                    its supposed allusions to Napoleon rendering the author an object of suspicion,
                    he was forced to remove from Milan to Tuscany. The chief fruits of his stay in
                    Florence are the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Ricciarda,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ode to the Graces,</hi> left unfinished, and the completion of his
                    version of the <hi rend="italic">Sentimental Journey.</hi> His version of Sterne
                    is an important feature in his personal history. When serving with the French,
                    he had been at the Boulogne camp, and had traversed much of the ground gone over
                    by Yorick; and in his memoir of Didimo Cherico, to whom the version is ascribed,
                    he throws much curious light on his own character. He returned to Milan in 1813,
                    until the entry of the Austrians; thence he passed into Switzerland, where he
                    wrote a fierce satire in Latin on his political and literary opponents; and
                    finally he sought the shores of England at the close of 1816.</p>
                <p>During the eleven years passed by Foscolo in London, until his death there, he
                    enjoyed all the social distinction which the most brilliant circles of the
                    English capital confer on foreigners of political and literary renown, and
                    experienced all the misery which follows on a disregard of the first conditions
                    of domestic economy. His contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi><hi rend="italic">Revieτvs,</hi> his
                    dissertations in Italian on the text of Dante and Boccaccio, and still more his
                    English essays on Petrarch, of which the value was enhanced by Lady Dacre’s
                    admirable translations of some of Petrarch’s finest sonnets, heightened his
                    previous fame as a man of letters. But his want of care and forethought in
                    pecuniary matters involved him in much embarrassment, and at last consigned him
                    to a prison; and when released, he felt bitterly the change in his social
                    position, and the coldness now shown to him by many whom he had been accustomed
                    to regard as friends. His general bearing in society—if we may accept on this
                    point the testimony of so keen an observer and so tolerant a man as Sir Walter
                    Scott—had unhappily not been such as to gain and retain lasting friendships. He
                    died at Turnham Green on the 10th of October 1827. Forty-four years after his
                    death, in 1871, his remains were brought to Florence, and with all the pride,
                    pomp, and circumstance of a great national mourning, found their final resting
                    place beside the monuments of Macchiavelli and Alfieri, of Michelangelo and
                    Galileo, in Italy’s Westminster Abbey, the church of Santa Croce. To that solemn
                    national tribute Foscolo was fully entitled. For the originality of his thoughts
                    and the splendour of his diction his country honours him as a great classic
                    author. He had assigned to the literature of his nation higher aims than any
                    which it previously recognized. With all his defects of character, and through
                    all his vicissitudes of fortune, he was an ill-judging but always a sincere and
                    courageous patriot. He was, if ever Italian deserved those titles, the precursor
                    and prophet of the unity and independence which his country now enjoys.</p>
                <p>Ample materials for the study of Foscolo’s character and career may be found in
                    the complete series of his works published in Florence by Le Monnier. The series
                    consists of <hi rend="italic">Prose lettcrarie,</hi> in 4 vols., 1850; <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistolario,</hi> in 3 vols., 1854; <hi rend="italic">Prose

                    Artusi,</hi> throws much doubt on the genuineness of the text in Foscolo’s
                    writings, as given in the complete Florence edition, whilst it furnishes some
                    curious and original illustrations of Foscolo’s familiarity with the English
                    language. (J. Μ. S.)</p>
