                    pamphleteer, was born in Dublin on the 22d of October 1740. He was the only son
                    of Dr Philip Francis, a man of some literary celebrity in his time, who is still
                    known by his translations of Horace, Aeschines, and Demosthenes. He received the

                    free school in Dublin, and afterwards.spent a year or two (1751-2) under his
                    father’s roof at Skeyton rectory, Norfolk, with Edward Gibbon as a fellow-pupil.
                    In March 1753 he entered St Paul’s school, London, where he remained for three
                    years and a half, and became head boy. Here Henry Sampson Woodfall and Philip
                    Rosenhagen were for some time his companions. In 1756, immediately on his
                    leaving school, he was appointed to a junior clerkship in the secretary of
                    state’s office by Mr Henry Fox (afterwards Lord Holland), with whose family Dr
                    Francis was at that time on intimate terms; and this post he retained under the
                    succeeding administration. In 1758 he was employed as secretary to General Bligh
                    in the expedition against Cherbourg; and in the same capacity he accompanied the
                    earl of Kinnoul on his special embassy to the court of Portugal in 1760. In 1761
                    he became personally known to Pitt, who, recognizing his ability and discretion,
                    once and again made use of his services as private amanuensis. In 1762 he was
                    appointed to a principal clerkship in the war office, and in the same year he
                    married Miss Macrabie, the daughter of a retired London merchant. The union was
                    not approved by his father, and led to some estrangement; but it does not appear
                    to have been on the whole unhappy. The ten yeirs which followed are very
                    obscure, and a long-continued and close scrutiny by numerous and skilful
                    investigators has led to few definite results, beyond the certain conclusion
                    that the events of this period in the life of Francis must have been such as to
                    have wielded a singularly commanding influence over all his subsequent conduct
                    and career. Comparatively humble in position, and somewhat straitened in means,
                    he had few opportunities of mingling familiarly in the society of the great; but
                    his official duties brought him into direct relations with many who were well
                    versed in the politics of the time, while he all along enjoyed a peculiar
                    intimacy with Calcraft, the rich army agent, who has been described as having
                    been Chatham’s “wire-puller and political agent as well as informant.” Public
                    events of great interest took place during these years. It was in 1763, for
                    example, that the great constitutional questions arising out of the arrest of
                    Wilkes began to be so sharply canvassed. It was natural that Francis, who from a
                    very early age had been in the habit of writing occasionally to the newspapers,
                    should be eager to take au active part in the discussion, though his position as
                    a Government official made it necessity that his intervention should be
                    carefully disguised. He is known to have written to the <hi rend="italic">Public
                    Ledger</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Public Advertiser,</hi> as an advocate of the
                    popular cause on many occasions about and after the year 1763;<note

                    public and the proprietors of Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres, is among
                    the earliest known productions of his pen. There is strong evidence that he was
                    the author of the “Candor” pamphlet (September 1764), in which the verdicts
                    obtained by the Government against the printers of the <hi rend="italic">North

                    “Anti-Sejanus” letters (January and February 1766), written in condemnation of
                    the American policy of the Rockingham ministry, Parkes affirms that “the most
                    sceptical cannot doubt that they emanated from his pen;” but Mcrivale brings
                    evidence to show that, if so, he must at least have had colleagues in writing
                    them. The communication in the <hi rend="italic">Public Advertiser</hi> (June
                    1768), signed “A Friend to Public Credit,” is undoubtedly attributable to him.
                    There is some likelihood also that sundry letters to the <hi rend="italic">North

                    Parliament, especially when American questions were being discussed; and between
                    1769 and 1771 he is also known to have been favourable to the scheme in which
                    Calcraft and others were engaged for the overturn of the Grafton Government and
                    afterwards of that of Lord North, and for persuading or forcing Lord Chatham
                    into power. In January 1769 the first of the <hi rend="italic">Letters of
                    Junius</hi> appeared, and the series was continued till January 21, 1772. They
                    had been preceded by others under various signatures, which, however, are all
                    attributed to one and the same hand. The authorship of these letters has been
                    assigned to Francis on a variety of grounds, but it must be said that the
                    evidence is still only of the circumstantial kind, and far from conclusive (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Junius).</hi> It ought to bo mentioned here that, so far as
                    can be ascertained, no one of his intimate friends suspected him at the time to
                    be Junius, and also that he himself in after life energetically denied the
                    charge. There was, however, it must be added, every motive for concealment on
                    his part, both at the time and afterwards, if he was indeed the writer of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters.</hi></p>
                <p>In January 1772 the office of deputy secretary in the war office became vacant,
                    and the post was offered by Lord Barrington to Francis, wſho declined it. By a
                    curious coincidence the last letter of Junius appeared on the very day in which
                    Anthony Charnier was gazetted deputy secretary (January 21st). Two months
                    afterwards Francis finally left the war office. “It is my own act,” he wrote to
                    an intimate friend. “Be not alarmed for me. Everything is secure and as it
                    should be !” In July of the same year he left England for a tour through France,
                    Germany, and Italy, which lasted until the following December. On his return he
                    was, according to an autobiographical fragment which has been preserved,
                    contemplating emigration to New England, when, in June 1773, Lord North, on the
                    recommendation of Lord Barrington, appointed him a member of the newly
                    constituted supreme council of Bengal, at a salary of £10,000 per annum. Along
                    with his colleagues Monson and Clavering he reached Calcutta in October 1774,
                    and a long struggle with Warren Hastings immediately began. That struggle passed
                    through three phases, during the first of which, until the death of Monson in
                    1776, Francis had the majority of votes in the council; afterwards, until the
                    arrival of Wheler in December 1777, he was continually overborne; while, during
                    the remaining three years, forces were more evenly balanced, Hastings having on
                    the whole the preponderance. A dispute, more than usually embittered, led in
                    August 1780 to a minute being delivered to the council board by Hastings, in
                    which he stated that “he judged of the public conduct of Mr Francis by his
                    experience of his private, which he had found to be void of truth and honour.” A
                    duel was the consequence, in which Francis received a dangerous wound. Though
                    his recovery was rapid and complete, he did not choose to prolong his stay
                    abroad. He arrived in England in October 1781, and was received with little
                    favour. Little is known of the nature of his occupations during the next two
                    years, except that he was untiring in his efforts to procure first the recall
                    and afterwards the impeachment of his hitherto triumphant adversary. It may be
                    mentioned, as a curious coincidence at least, if nothing more, that the
                    “bookseller’s edition <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ’ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Junius,</hi> described on the title page as more complete than any yet
                    published, appeared in 1783. In the same year Fox produced his India Bill, which
                    led to the overthrow of the coalition Government. In the general election of
                    April 1784 Francis was returned by the borough of Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, and
                    his first appearance in the house was made in the folloλving July, when the
                    financial affairs of the East India Company were under discussion. On this
                    occasion he took an opportunity to disclaim every feeling of personal animosity
                    towards Hastings. This did not prevent him, however,” on the return of the
                    latter, in 1785, from doing all in his power to bring forward and support the
                    charges which ultimately led to the impeachment resolutions of 1787. Although
                    excluded by a majority of the House from the list of the managers of that
                    impeachment, Francis was <pb break="no"

                    supplying his friends Burke and Sheridan with all the materials for their
                    eloquent orations and burning invectives. At the general election of 1790 he was
                    returned a member for Bletchingley. In common with all English politicians he
                    found his attention very strongly called to the events which were then occurring
                    in France; his sympathies were strongly with the revolutionary party, and he
                    opposed in parliament all the measures of the Government against reformers and
                    Jacobins at home. In 1793 he supported Mr (afterwards Lord) Grey’s motion for a
                    return to the old constitutional system of representation, and so earned the
                    title to be regarded as one of the earliest promoters of the cause of
                    parliamentary reform. He rendered further services to the same cause by repeated
                    vindications of the Society of the Friends of the People in the days of its
                    unpopularity. The acquittal of Hastings in April 1795 again disappointed Francis
                    of the governor-generalship, and in 1798 he had to submit to the additional
                    mortification of a defeat in the general election. He was once more successful,
                    however, in 1802, when he sat for Appleby, and it seemed as if the great
                    ambitions of his life were about to be realized when the Whig party came into
                    power in 1806. His disappointment was great when the governor-generalship was,
                    owing to party exigencies, conferred on Sir Gilbert Elliot (Lord Minto); he
                    declined, it is said, soon afterwards the government of the Cape, but accepted a
                    knight companionship of the order of the Bath. Though re-elected for Appleby in
                    1806, he failed to secure a seat in the following year; and the remainder of his
                    life was spent in comparative privacy. In 1814 he married his second wife, Miss
                    Emma Watkins, who long survived him, and who has left voluminous manuscripts
                    relating to his biography. He died on the 23d of December 1818.</p>
                <p>Among the later productions of his pen were, besides the <hi rend="italic">Plan
                    of a Reform in the Election of the House of Commons,</hi> a pamphlet entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Abundance of Paper in Circulation and the
                    Scarcity of Specie</hi> (1810), and a <hi rend="italic">Leiter to Earl Grey on
                    the Policy of Great Britain and the Allies towards Norway</hi> (1814). His <hi

                    late Joseph Parkes, and. completed and edited by Mr Herman Merivale, were
                    published in two volumes in 1867. They help the reader to form a tolerably vivid
                    conception of the man, and show that in his domestic relations he was exemplary,
                    and that he lived on terms of mutual affection with a wide circle of friends.
                    They indicate at the same time, however, that he was far from incapable of
                    vindictiveness, dissimulation, and treachery. His biographers are firmly
                    convinced of his identity with Junius, and bring a great body of circumstantial
                    proof in support of their belief.</p>
