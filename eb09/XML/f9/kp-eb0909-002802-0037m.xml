                    (1608-1666), poet and statesman, was the youngest son and tenth child of Sir
                    Henry Fanshawe, remembrancer of the exchequer under James I. He was born early
                    in June 1608, at Wareham Park, Hertfordshire. At the age of seven he lost his
                    father, and was soon placed by his mother under the care of the famous
                    schoolmaster, Thomas Farnabie. In November 1623 he wa3 admitted fellow commoner
                    of Jesus College, Cambridge, under Dr Beale. In January 1626 he entered the
                    Middle Temple, but his mother dying soon after, and the study of the law being
                    distasteful to him, he travelled in France and Spain, learning the languages of
                    those countries, and observing the customs of the people. On his return, in
                    1635, he was appointed secretary to the English embassy at Madrid under Lord
                    Aston, and was resident there until Sir Arthur Hopton’s appointment in 1638. As
                    soon as the civil war broke out he very prominently joined the Royalist party,
                    being at this time on terms of somewhat affectionate intimacy with Charles I. In
                    1644, being with the court at Oxford, he had the degree of D.C.L. conferred upon
                    him, and the same year he was appointed secretary at war to the prince of Wales,
                    with whom he set out for the western counties, Scilly, and then Jersey. It was
                    during this stormy period that Fanshawe first appeared as a poet: in 1647 he
                    published his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi> of Guarini,
                    the remaining copies of which he re-issued in 1648 with the addition of a number
                    of other poems, original and translated. In 1648 his attention wa3 again
                    directed to public affairs by his appointment as treasurer to the navy under
                    Prince Rupert, which he held till the latter was forced, in 1650, to escape to
                    the West Indies. Fanshawe then proceeded to Paris, where he was created baronet,
                    and sent to Madrid as envoy extraordinary. He was, however, immediately
                    afterwards sent for to Scotland, but was captured on the way at the battle of
                    Worcester in 1651. He was sent to London, and kept in such close confinement
                    that his health broke down; but Cromwell, finding that he was really dangerously
                    ill, allowed him to choose a place of residence, with the proviso that he wa3
                    not to stir from it more than 5 miles. It was during his captivity that he
                    published, in 1652, his <hi rend="italic">Selected Parts of Horace, Prince of
                    Lyτieks,</hi> a very graceful work, in which he keeps as close as possible to
                    the metrical form of the <hi rend="italic">Odes.</hi> He chose to retire to
                    Tankerley Park, in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0038-0029"/> Yorkshire, the seat of Lord Strafford, and gave
                    himself up entirely to literature. In 1654 he completed translations of two of
                    the comedies of the Spanish poet Antonio de Mendoza, which were published after
                    his death, in 1671, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Querer</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">per solo</hi><hi rend="italic">querer:</hi><hi rend="italic">to
                    Love only for Lords Sake, and Fiestas de Aranjuez.</hi> But the great labour of
                    his retirement was the translation of the national epic of the Portuguese poet
                    Camoeus. This version of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> was printed in folio
                    in 1655, with very fine engravings. It is in ottava rima, and there is prefixed
                    to it a translation of the long Latin poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Furor
                    Petroηiensis,</hi> which forms an episode in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satyricon.</hi> Moreover, in 1658 Fanshawe published a Latin version of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Faithful Shepherdess</hi> of Fletcher, and a letter dedicating the
                    unprinted translations of Mendoza’s plays to the queen of Sweden. In February
                    1659 he broke through his bail, and joined Charles II. at Breda; he was
                    enthusiastically received and loaded with promises. But when the Restoration was
                    complete he did not, to his great disappointment, find himself made secretary of
                    state. In 1661 he represented the university of Cambridge in parliament, and was
                    presently sent out to Portugal as envoy extraordinary; he was shortly after
                    appointed ambassador to the same court, and negotiated the marriage between
                    Charles II. and the Infanta. At the end of the year he returned to England, only
                    to be sent out as ambassador to Lisbon again in 1662. In 1663 he was recalled to
                    be sworn one of his majesty’s privy council. In the beginning of 1644 he was
                    sent as ambassador to Philip IV. of Spain, and arrived at Cadiz in February of
                    that year, to receive such an ovation as no English envoy had ever before
                    enjoyed. During the whole of 1665 he was engaged in very delicate diplomatic
                    relations between England, Portugal, and Spain; and in January 1666 he travelled
                    to Lisbon in the endeavour to bring about a peace between the last-mentioned
                    powers. But he had scarcely returned to Madrid when he was somewhat peremptorily
                    recalled to England. It is not known whether this affected his health, but at
                    all events he fell ill at Madrid, and died there, after a short illness, on the
                    26th of June 1666. His widow, Lady Fanshawe, drew up a charming memoir of her
                    husband, which was first printed in 1829. To this circumstance and to his public
                    position we owe the fact that of no poet of his age do we possess more copious
                    materials for biography thau of Fanshawe. He was a very tall courtly man, with
                    short curling brown hair, and fine eyes. As an original poet we have very little
                    means of judging his merit: a fine “Ode upon occasion of his Majesty’s
                    Proclamation in 1630,” and some rough, but richly-coloured sonnets, are the best
                    of his own verses which have come down to us. But as a translator he is one of
                    the illustrious figures in our literature, whether Italian, Latin, Portuguese,
                    or Spanish attracts his versatile muse. His <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi>
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> have never been surpassed by later
                    scholars. As a verse-writer his chief fault is ruggedness; his active life gave
                    him but scant opportunity for revision. His letters were edited in 1724 and
                    since, but no collected edition of his works has ever been issued.</p>
