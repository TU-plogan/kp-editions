                    of certain orders of fungi, and also the term <hi rend="italic">mycetology,</hi>
                    or more commonly <hi rend="italic">mycology,</hi> the science of fungi) is the
                    name applied to a distinct class of cellular cryptogams or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thcdlophyta.</hi> Though as plants the class is well marked by the invariable
                    absence of chlorophyll, and consequently of the physiological phenomena
                    attending its presence and action, it is not so at some points, where a dubious
                    border exists between it and the lower members of the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>The vegetative body or thallus of fungi consists of filiform, cellular elements
                    called <hi rend="italic">hyphae.</hi> In one group, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phycomycetes,</hi> the hypha usually consists of a single densely branching
                    cell; but in most cases it is composed of a series of cells placed end on end.
                    These hyphae ramify laterally much more frequently than dichotomously, and the
                    usual mode of growth is by an apical cell which divides transversely; but in the
                    bodies of the larger fungi intercalary growth also occurs (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhizomorpha</hi><hi rend="italic">subterranea).</hi> A single
                    hypha forms the complete thallus of the simpler fungi called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyphomycetes, llaplomycetes,</hi> &lt;fcc., but the bodies of the larger
                    (compound) fungi are composed of a colony of hyphae, usually densely interwoven,
                    more rarely running in parallel lines, but always more or less firmly adhering
                    together. In many fungi (as in the stalk of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalloideai,fifixρι</hi> pileus of <hi rend="italic">Russula,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lactarius,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">8clerotia,</hi> and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">peridia</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Lycoperdaceae)</hi> the
                    fully developed tissue consists of polyhedral cells, closely packed, and bearing
                    resemblance to <hi rend="italic">parenchyma.</hi> This texture, however,
                    consists of ordinary hyphae, which, through pressure from adjacent parts, have
                    been forced to assume this form. It bears the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >pseudo-parenchyma.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Myxomycètes</hi> are the only large group of organisms
                    usually classed with fungi which cannot be described as consisting of hyphae.
                    These differ in so many ways and so widely from any fungal or indeed vegetable
                    structures that a separate consideration of their position is necessary (see
                    Order V.). Other exceptions of a minor nature have been made of such organisms
                    as <hi rend="italic">IIormisdum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cryptococcus,</hi>
                    &amp;c., but it is now the general belief that these are merely reproductive
                    bodies of more perfect fungi. The cells of fungal hyphae are of many shapes, but
                    tho usual one is long and cylindrical, and the other shapes are more or less
                    modifications"of this. The structure and growth of the fungal cell agree in
                    general with those of the vegetable cell as it occurs elsewhere. At tho same
                    time no group in the vegetable kingdom exhibits so many minor divergent
                    histological characters—a condition which serves to mark its boundaries as a
                    class of vegetables with great distinctness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cell-Membrane.—</hi> In the numerous fungi which develop
                    rapidly and have a short existence in the adult state, tho cell-wall is thin,
                    tender, and structureless; but when a plant of this kind is accidentally checked
                    in its expansion, tho result is the production of thick, homogeneous,
                    unstratified membranes. On tho other hand, the cell-wall of tho more persistent
                    species early acquires considerable thickness, which, in the adult state, often
                    so increases that the cell has the appearance of a solid cylinder. These thick
                    membranes vary from a woody to a gelatinous consistency, and are composed
                    sometimes of more than one layer. In the <hi rend="italic">Polyporei,
                    Thelephora,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bovist</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Geäster,</hi><hi rend="italic">Tulostoma,</hi> &lt;fcc., the
                    cell-walls often exhibit (either after simplo immersion in water or on the
                    application of chemical reagents) at least two layers, the outer firmer and
                    often coloured, the inner softer and clearer. The cohesion of the filaments in
                    these larger plants is brought about by their θeing densely interwoven, and also
                    by the firm union and to a certain extent the amalgamation of the outer layers
                    of the membranes. Spiral and ring-shaped thickenings are to be found in the
                    capillitium cells of <hi rend="italic">Batarrea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Podaxon</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n863/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0863-0828"/><hi rend="italic">carcinomatis,</hi> and pits are
                    of constant occurrence in corresponding cells of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycoperdaceae,</hi> and in the filaments which bear the fructification of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dactylium.</hi></p>
                <p>Chemical analyses of the cell-membrane show that it possesses the elementary
                    constituents of cellulose; but since the uncoloured and unthickened membrane
                    does not commonly exhibit the characteristic reaction of cellulose towards
                    iodine (neither simply nor after treatment with potash or Schultz’s mixture),
                    nor towards many of the reagents commonly employed in testing typical cellulose,
                    it is necessary to apply to it the special term <hi rend="italic">fungal
                    cellulose.</hi> In several special cases, however, typical cellulose is known to
                    exist. The membranes of old cells frequently undergo a kind of lignification,
                    and in this condition offer extraordinary resistance to such treatment as that
                    with concentrated sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cell-Contents.—</hi> The protoplasm of fungal cells has no
                    special quality of importance to distinguish it from that of other vegetable
                    cells. Professor Sachs states <hi rend="italic">(Bot.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ztg.,</hi> 1855) that under his observation the apices of growing hyphae seemed
                    to consist of one mass, in which the membrane could not be distinguished from
                    the protoplasm; but Professor De Bary <hi rend="italic">(Morp. u.
                    Physiol,</hi><hi rend="italic">der Pilze,</hi> &lt;fcc.), on the other hand,
                    finds that the same conditions as exist in similar situations in other plants
                    obtain here, viz., a dense mass of protoplasm enclosed by a tender membrane—an
                    experience endorsed by most mycologists. The existence of a nucleus was long
                    denied, and. indeed its presence in the cells of the thallus has not yet been
                    proved; but in the reproductive organs, where it had long been overlooked, its
                    occurrence is not uncommon. Attempts to prove its existence in the cells of the
                    thallus have not been wanting, but as yet with apparently no success: Schacht’s
                    observations on this head are notably untrustworthy, since there is no doubt
                    that he confounded the true nucleus in other fungal cells with drops of oil and
                    such bodies. The formation of vacuoles takes place as in other vegetable cells.
                    Oleaginous matter is present, often abundantly, in nearly all fungi, in the form
                    of drops of various sizes. Water (cell-sap) is necessarily present, though the
                    quantity varies considerably without serious injury to the plant. A good proof
                    of this variation is to be found in the expansion or contraction of the
                    filaments of many <hi rend="italic">Hyphomycetes</hi> according to the supply of
                    water. In fungi with firmer cell-membranes, air-bubbles take the place of the
                    water which has evaporated, and the contraction of the hyphae is very
                    inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>The fungal cell is wholly destitute of chlorophyll, and, it may be safely stated,
                    of starch also. Schlossberger and Döpping record their detection of starch
                    granules in the extracted sap of <hi rend="italic">Cantharellus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cibarius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but from their method of
                    investigation it is highly probable that these were accidentally present.</p>
                <p>The pigments of various colours to be found in many fungi are perhaps in most
                    cases properties of the cellmembrane. Another class of them is peculiar to the
                    cellcontents, and a third seems to pervade bath membrane and contents. Those
                    peculiar to the contents are mostly of an oleaginous or resinous nature, and
                    their occurrence is in the form either of minute particles distributed
                    throughout the protoplasm, or of larger drops or granules scattered irregularly
                    among the contents. From the pigments peculiar to the fungal cell there are to
                    be distinguished those absorbed in an unaltered state from the substratum. An
                    instance of this is to be found in <hi rend="italic">Peziza aeruginosa,</hi>
                    which owes its colour to the abnormally greenish wood on which it grows. It was
                    long thought that the <hi rend="italic">Peziza</hi> was the cause of the green
                    colour, but a sufficient proof is contained in the facts that the wood is more
                    frequently found green without any trace of the fungus than with it, and that
                    the upper part of the fungus is sometimes uncoloured when the lower portion has
                    become green. Moulds, and other fungi usually colourless, are occasionally
                    stained with the colour of an unusual substratum. The subject of the pigments of
                    fungi is one of which our knowledge is very incomplete.</p>
                <p>Crystals of calcium oxalate are to be met with on the surfaces and in the
                    intercellular spaces of many of the larger fungi; but in only two cases have
                    they been found in the interior of the cell <hi rend="italic">(Phallus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caninus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Russula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >adusta).</hi> Cell-division takes place in the same way as in other plants.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mycelium</hi> is the part of the thallus devoted to the
                    functions of absorbing and storing nutriment. It consists of hyphae developed
                    directly from the germinating filaments, but often on further growth intricately
                    bound up (frequently anastomosing) with each other, usually in amorphous masses,
                    but sometimes in more or less definite bodies. In the larger fungi a number of
                    hyphae (in which case they run parallel to each other) are sometimes associated
                    into bundles, like rootlets. The mycelium not unfrequently persists for several
                    years. Mycelia in general bear so strong a resemblance to each other that it is
                    usually impossible to determine the species to which they belong on their own
                    characters.</p>
                <p>A number of parasitic fungi possess peculiar organs called <hi rend="italic"
                    >haustoria,</hi> which perform the function of extracting nourishment, and when
                    necessary retaining the plant in its position. These are lateral branches of the
                    mycelial hyphae of various shapes and sizes. In <hi rend="italic">Erysiphe,</hi>
                    the mycelium of which creeps over the surface of its host plant, the haustoria
                    are emitted abundantly from the side of the hyphae next the epidermis, into
                    which they penetrate and cause decay. They are in this case small and irregular
                    in shape. On the <hi rend="italic">Peronosporeae,</hi> the mycelium of which
                    inhabits usually the intercellular spaces of living plants, haustoria are
                    frequently present. In some cases, as in <hi rend="italic">Cystopus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">candidus,</hi> they have the form of minute stalked globules, but
                    in most other <hi rend="italic">Peronosporeae</hi> they are irregular filamental
                    protuberances, frequently branching to such an extent as almost to fill the
                    affected cell.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sclerotia</hi> are tuberous bodies composed of densely
                    interwoven mycelial hyphae enclosed by a layer of pseudo-parenchyma. They are
                    specific in occurrence, like the bulbs and tubers of phanerogams, and are
                    situated on or beneath the surface of the substrata—the ground or parts of
                    plants. They were long regarded as independent forms of fungi, but it has been
                    discovered that they are only resting states in which nourishment is stored up.
                    They vary much in size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Receptacle.—</hi> On the mycelium there arises a body
                    called the receptacle, the function of which is to bear the reproductive bodies,
                    the spores. It varies much in size in different fungi; in most cases it forms
                    the greater part of the whole thallus, and in others it consists of a simple or
                    branched hypha. The same species of fungus may possess more than one kind of
                    receptacle, either in different generations, or arising subsequently from the
                    same mycelium. According to their structure receptacles may be divided into two
                    groups, viz., those which consist of one hypha, and those which, composed of
                    aggregated hyphae, form a compound body. In certain cases the receptacle is
                    entirely suppressed (as in the interstitial oogonia of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peronosporeae).</hi> When the receptacle consists of a simple or branched
                    hypha, the spores are borne terminally. The sporophorous hyphae are branches of
                    the mycelium, rising usually vertically from it, and themselves frequently so
                    characteristically branched as to afford means of generic and specific
                    distinction. After bearing the first spore, the sporophore may again grow for a
                    short space before bearing another. In compound receptacles the fructiferous
                    hyphae form together expansions <pb break="no"

                    the individual fertile branches arise. If the hymenium is formed upon the
                    exterior surface of the receptacle it is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >gymnocarpous,</hi> and if within the receptacle <hi rend="italic"
                    >angiocarpous.</hi> The hymenium never produces any but asexual spores.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reproduction.—</hi> The reproduction of fungi is effected by
                    both sexual and asexual means—the latter being far the more frequent of the two.
                    No one species is known to possess more than one form of sexual reproduction,
                    though it is frequently the case that more than one kind of asexual reproduction
                    belongs to it. In many fungi no sexual reproduction is known to exist, but it is
                    generally believed that in such cases the plants are merely members of a cycle
                    of generations, the other stages in their life-history being unknown or
                    unrecognized. The term <hi rend="italic">spore</hi> is applied to all
                    reproductive bodies, whether asexual or the product of the union of sexual
                    cells. Discussion has frequently been engaged in as to the propriety of
                    employing the same term to denote both kinds of bodies; but though in isolated c
                    ιses the use of new terms has been advised, no satisfactory system of
                    nomenclature has been established. There is, however, no doubt that some
                    distinction ought to be made.</p>
                <p>Sexual reproduction is effected by the union of two cells of different nature,
                    which in themselves are incapable of further development. In the usual forms
                    these cells are apparently of different nature, but in the phenomenon of
                    conjugation the difference in the sexual elements is not determinable, though
                    doubtless existing within the molecular sphere. The product of the union of
                    sexual cells is developed into an organ of reproduction which, at the proper
                    tim?, fulfils its office by giving rise either to a new mycelium directly or to
                    a receptacle. These organs of reproduction bear names more or less expressive of
                    their nature, such as <hi rend="italic">zygospore, oospore,</hi> &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>In those fungi of which the life-cycle is known, several different kinds of
                    asexually produced spores have been observed. In only one group, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phycomycetes,</hi> are motile spores <hi rend="italic"
                    >(zoospores)</hi> known. In all other cases they arc produced either at the apex
                    of a <hi rend="italic">basidium (basidiospores)</hi> or similar sporophore <hi
                    rend="italic">(conidia,</hi> &amp;c.), by cell-division, or within an <hi
                    rend="italic">ascus</hi> by free cell-formation <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ascospores).</hi> In <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >septate</hi> spores, which are multicellular, each separate secondary cell is
                    termed a <hi rend="italic">merispore. Gemmae</hi> are produced by the breaking
                    up (by cell-division) of hyphae into series of cells capable of germinating. The
                    germination of spores is dependent chiefly on moisture, but to their farther
                    development specific conditions are necessary, a description of which is beyond
                    the scope of this article. The dissemination of spores is effected chiefly by
                    the agency of the atmosphere and of water, and it is probable that insects or
                    other animals have very little to do with it.</p>
                <p>In their <hi rend="italic">mode of life</hi> fungi are controlled by the absence
                    of chlorophyll. Without it they cannot assimilate, and are therefore driven to
                    obtain their nourishment by taking up the carbon compounds assimilated by other
                    organisms. Their modes of life are either parasitic or saprophytic. As parasites
                    they inhabit the bodies of living plants and animals, and even of other fungi.
                    In some cases they kill their hosts, and in others encourage growth, as in the
                    case of the <hi rend="italic">Lichenes</hi><hi rend="italic">',</hi> and between
                    those two extremes various degrees of parasitism occur. As saprophytes they
                    promote the decomposition of dead organic bodies, and thus aid in the production
                    of carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, the elements of which return to the course
                    of organic life. Jodin states that some fungi absorb as much as 6 per cent, of
                    their nitrogenous contents in the form of nitrogen gas from the atmosphere. In
                    the decomposition of fungi ammonia is formed from the nitrogenous compounds. As
                    parasites and saprophytes their influence as regulators iu the economy of nature
                    may be compared with that of the lower animals living the same mode of life.</p>
                <p>Though the ravages of parasitic fungi are mostly confined to the vegetable
                    kingdom, it is well known that many animals suffer from their attack. The
                    occurrence of parasitic fungi on insects and fish is common; more rarely do they
                    attack the higher animals or man. It has been strongly contended that the minute
                    fungi play very important parts in many diseases of man, but this has usually
                    been much exaggerated. The occurrence of <hi rend="italic">Bacteria</hi> on the
                    mucous surfaces of living bodies and on wounds has given rise to much
                    discussion; and there is no doubt that insufficient knowledge of these organisms
                    has often led to error, the observers not unfrequently mistaking the products of
                    the decomposition of organic bodies, crystalline precipitations, &amp;c., for
                    <hi rend="italic">Bacteria.</hi> It may safely be maintained that these are
                    offener the concomitants than the causes of disease in man. A considerable
                    number of fungi have also been described as playing active parts in various
                    skin-diseases, but very little trustworthy information about their life-history
                    has ever been gained.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">economic properties</hi> of fungi are of an unimportant
                    character. A great number are poisonous, and many are edible; a few are used for
                    medicinal purposes. Many of those described as edible, though they can be eaten
                    without any serious consequence, are certainly not likely to become articles of
                    food. At the same time it may be mentioned that much valuable food is annually
                    lost through ignorance of the excellent esculent qualities of a few common
                    fungi.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">phosphorescence or</hi> luminosity observed in several
                    fungi has given rise to many absurd conjectures. This phenomenon depends on the
                    respiration of oxygen, those fungi which exhibit luminosity ceasing to do so
                    when the oxygen is extracted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution.—</hi> From the extreme poverty of
                    our knowledge of the geographical distribution of fungi no general estimate can
                    be even outlined. Of the fungi of by far the greater portion of the world we
                    have no account, or at the best the meagre collections of passing explorers. Of
                    even the European mycologie flora our knowledge is far from complete, Russia,
                    Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and even Ireland, being only partially examined. Of
                    countries in which the surveys have been more complete, only England, Scotland,
                    Wales, Germany, France, and large districts of Austria, Italy, and Switzerland
                    can be pointed to. Of the whole American continent the Carolinas alone are
                    tolerably well known, and though collections have been made in Mexico, Texas,
                    the island of Cuba, and a few tracts of South America, the examination of these
                    countries has not been thorough. China, Japan, Siberia, and Further India are
                    totally unexplored; but, on the other hand, Ceylon and the northern part of
                    India are perhaps as well known as any other extra-European district save
                    Carolina. From the Himalayas and northern India there are the collection and
                    notes of Sir Joseph Hooker. In Africa, Algeria and the Cape have been examined,
                    but from the tropical parts of that continent we have only the collection and
                    notes of Dr Welwitsch, which are, however, of great value so far as the district
                    he explored extends.</p>
                <p>Any attempted scheme of geographical distribution would, therefore, be not only
                    incomplete but open to great error, from the very partial accounts from the most
                    of those districts which have been examined. As in other vegetables, heat and
                    moisture necessarily exert the greatest influence on growth, and therefore on
                    distribution. The character of the trees composing the forests of different
                    countries, and the amount of cultivated land, subordinately affect the nature,
                    if not the numbers, of the fungi inhabiting them. One broad principle, however,
                    seems apparent, viz., that the large <hi rend="italic">fleshy</hi> fungi, like
                    the <hi rend="italic">Agaricini,</hi> affect temperate countries <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n865/mode/1up"

                    texture, like the <hi rend="italic">Polyporei,</hi> inhabit tropical in
                    preference to temperate countries. In the Arctic regions fungi are represented
                    almost solely by the <hi rend="italic">Lichenes.</hi> Of the distribution of
                    microscopic fungi nothing of any value is known.</p>

                <p>The above classification is broadly the same as that proposed by Professor De
                    Bary. The principal characters of these orders and suborders are described
                    below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order I.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Phycomycetes.</hi> —The <hi
                    rend="italic">Phycomycetes</hi> possess both sexual and asexual organs of
                    reproduction. The sexually produced reproductive body gives rise to a generation
                    bearing first asexual and then sexual organs, and the asexually produced
                    reproductive body gives rise to a similar generation. The mycelium in this order
                    consists of long densely-ramifying tubes or hyphae, on which the reproductive
                    organs are borne.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Suborder I.—Saprolegnieae.—</hi> In this order the male organs
                    are called <hi rend="italic">antheridia</hi> and the female organs <hi
                    rend="italic">oogonia.</hi> In the monoecious forms these arise beside each
                    other on the same plant. The oogonia are usually to be found at the end of short
                    branches of the mycelium—very rarely sessile or intercalary. They are globular
                    cells with one enclosing membrane containing dense protoplasm. In some cases (as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Saprolegnia monoica)</hi> the cell-wall soon becomes
                    resorbed at various places, and the protoplasm divides into several globular
                    bodies, which float in a watery fluid, the whole enclosed by the wall of the
                    oogonium. In <hi rend="italic">Aphanomyces,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pythium,</hi>
                    and several species of <hi rend="italic">Saprolegnia,</hi> only one globe is
                    formed in the oogonium. The fluid in which these globes float is part of the
                    watery contents of the globes expelled when the contraction took place. While
                    these alterations are proceeding in the oogonia, the antheridia grow out from
                    the same or some adjoining branch of the mycelium. These are thin, crooked
                    hyphae, which frequently entwine the stalks of the oogonia in their growth; the
                    tips of the tubes, however, on reaching the wall of the oogonium adhere, and the
                    upper part becomes separated from the rest by a septum. This process is usually
                    contemporary with the contraction or separation into globules of the contents of
                    the oogonia. The antheridia then push through the walls one or more tubes, which
                    discharge from the points minute motile spermatozoids (about - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> g</hi>-¾ <hi rend="subscript"> 75</hi>- millim. in size), and
                    these fertilize the globules. The globules then assume a cellulose membrane and
                    are called <hi rend="italic">oospores.</hi></p>
                <p>The oogonia are formed in the dioecious as in the monoecious species, but the
                    antheridia in a totally different way. They arise within bladder-like
                    protuberances of the mycelium, which are divided by transverse septa into a
                    series of cells, each of which is an antheridium. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saprolegnia dioica,</hi> the antheridium breaks up into numerous spermatozoïde;
                    but in <hi rend="italic">Adilya dioica</hi> a preliminary division of the
                    antheridium into several portions precedes the formation of the spermatozoids.
                    When free these spermatozoids move actively by means of one long cilium.
                    Fertilization, and the consequent formation of oospores, are effected in a
                    similar way to that described as occurring in the monoecious forms. . Doubt has
                    been expressed as to the described monoecious fertilization, but on the whole it
                    may be regarded as generally true. The oospores of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saprolegnieae</hi> are double-coated. After a long period of rest they emit
                    germ-tubes, but it has been recorded that they sometimes produce zoospores, when
                    the resting state is shorter.</p>
                <p>The zoosporangia or asexually-produced organs of reproduction are terminal cells
                    (very rarely intercalary), sometimes irregularly cylindrical, sometimes ovoid,
                    of a constant form in some genera <hi rend="italic">{Saprolegnia, Addy a)</hi>
                    but variable in others <hi rend="italic">{Pythium,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monoblepharis).</hi></p>
                <p>The reproduction by means of the zoosporangia is much more extensive than that by
                    means of the oospores. Each zoosporangium contains a great number of zoospores.
                    The mycelium is composed of long ramifying tubes, of considerable diameter, and
                    nearly always aseptate.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Saprolegnieae</hi> grow for the most part in water, chiefly
                    on the dead bodies of insects. One species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saprolegnia</hi><hi rend="italic">ferax,</hi> is notable on account of its
                    extensive ravages on the bodies of fishes (especially salmon) and other water
                    animals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Suborder II.—Peronosporeae.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peronosporeae</hi> are very closely allied to the <hi rend="italic"

                    cells of this fungus are elongated, stout tubes. Where two meet, each pushes
                    against the other a protuberance, at first cylindrical and of equal thickness.
                    They remain closely adhering, and soon grow considerably, chiefly in thickness.
                    At the end of each a separate cell is formed by the growth of a partition. These
                    two cells are usually of unequal size, one as long as it is broad, the other
                    only half as long as its breadth. The membrane which originally separated them
                    is now perforated in the middle, and soon vanishes altogether; the two
                    conjugating cells thus unite and form the <hi rend="italic">zygospore,</hi>
                    which increases rapidly, usually attaining a diameter of over ¾ millim. It is,
                    as a rule, drum-shaped, the ends smooth, and the free surface clothed with
                    wart-like protuberances. The contents are coarsely granular protoplasm, in which
                    float drops of oil. On germination the zygospore produces a hypha (as observed

                    the emission of a filament, which, like that produced by the zygospore, forms by

                    transition in each case being effected (so far as is at present known) by
                    asexual spores. The cycle begins in spring with the germination of thick-walled
                    spores, called <hi rend="italic">teleutospores,</hi> borne usually in pairs at
                    the end of sterigmata. Germination takes the form of the emission of a hypha,
                    which rapidly (usually in two or three hours) forms a pro-mycelium, bearing
                    three or four sporidia. These sporidia become detached, and on finding a
                    suitable host-plant penetrate the epidermis cells by means of a germinating
                    filament, and form a new mycelium within the parenchyma. After a few days this
                    mycelium begins to form receptacles under the epidermis of the host, on which
                    are borne <hi rend="italic">cecidia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spermogonia.</hi>
                    The latter appear before the former. They are small, narrownecked sacs, in which
                    are found minute spore-like bodies, called <hi rend="italic">spermatia</hi> by
                    Tulasne, who believed them to be male organs, partly on comparative grounds and
                    partly because he found them incapable of germinating. No female organs have
                    been found; though it w as suggested that the spermatia stood in sexual
                    relations to the aecidia beside which they are constantly found. Professor De
                    Bary, however, found that the spores of aecidia, on a plant on which no trace of
                    spermogonia or spermatia could be found, germinated exactly as under other
                    circumstances. The aecidia are at first round or oval but on bursting
                    basin-shaped receptacles of pseudo-parenchyma, at the base of each of which a
                    circular, flat hymenium is formed. From this hymenium there rise erect basidia
                    bearing in vertical series a number of spores of a round polyhedral form, and
                    filled with protoplasm coloured red or yellow by oil. These spores on being
                    liberated produce germ-tubes which penetrate the stomata of the next host-plant
                    (one of the same species as that on which the teleutospores were found), and
                    soon form another mycelium in the intercellular spaces. Again, in a few days,
                    this mycelium forms a new kind of receptacle, the <hi rend="italic">uredo.</hi>
                    This receptacle is flat and circular, and is situated immediately under the
                    epidermis. On it basidia bearing round or oval uredospores arise and break
                    through the epidermis. The uredospores constantly reproduce the uredo, which is
                    the cause of the extensive ravages of this form of the disease; on the same
                    mycelium which produces the uredo, teleutospores are ultimately formed. These
                    hibernate, and when spring arrives again germinate, and start the same cycle of

                    rend="italic">Gasteromycetes</hi> are angiocarpous. They consist of an outer
                    peridium enclosing masses of tissue which bear the hymenia. The basidia often
                    bear as many as eight spores, which are ultimately liberated by the bursting of
                    the peridium, either simply or by the development of special masses of tissues.
                    The peridium of <hi rend="italic">Phallus</hi> resembles the <hi rend="italic"
                    >velum universale</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Agaricini</hi> in its mode of
                    enveloping the receptacle, and the appearance it presents after bursting. Within
                    this volva is a gelatinous stratum, then an inner peridium, then the hymenium.
                    The bursting of the peridium or volva is caused by the elongation of a stalk on
                    which the hymenium is elevated in a kind of pileus—as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agaricini.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Batarrea</hi> there also occurs a
                    universal volva, and the hymenium is similarly elevated, but the plant in this
                    case is of a woody consistence, and spiral vessels are found in the stalk. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Clathrus</hi> the receptacle is in the form of a globular

                    remote end of the carpogonium, which is at this stage sausage-shaped, and so
                    fertilizes it. After fertilization one of the cells of the carpogonium (usually
                    near the middle) increases and becomes globular. It is called the <hi

                    which are generally regarded as abortive asci, but may serve (as Boudier affirms
                    they do) to assist in some way the dehiscence of the asci. The hyphae of the
                    mycelium on which the sexual organs are borne produce a dense mass of
                    pseudo-parenchyma, which surrounds the carpogonium and forms the sterile part of
                    the fructification.</p>
                <p>Sexuality was first discovered in the <hi rend="italic">Discomycetes</hi> by
                    Professor De'Bary in the case of <hi rend="italic">Peziza</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    occurring in <hi rend="italic">Ascobolus,</hi> agrees in all essential details
                    with it.</p>
                <p>Certain species of <hi rend="italic">Pezizae,</hi> the mycelium of which is
                    extensively reproduced by conidia, undergo a resting state in the form of a <hi
                    rend="italic">sclerotium.</hi> This was first observed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peziza Fückeliana</hi> by Professor De Bary. In it conidia are produced by the
                    mycelium before the sclerotia. The sclerotia, which are formed without the
                    occurrence of any sexual process, so far as has been observed, consist of
                    densely packed hyphae enclosed by a pseudo-parenchymatous rind. Sometimes these
                    germinate shortly after their formation, and produce a mycelium which bears
                    conidia again; but if germination be delayed for a month or two, the
                    characteristic basin-shaped hymenium of <hi rend="italic">Peziza,</hi> with asci
                    and ascospores, is formed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spermatia</hi> are found in this as in other orders. They are
                    borne in <hi rend="italic">spermogonia,</hi> similar to those of the <hi

                    germination. Μ. Cornu, however, has recently stated that he caused them to
                    germinate under artificial conditions, and to produce a mycelium like the
                    conidia.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Peziza</hi> and the genera closely allied to it, the
                    ascogenous receptacle is basin-shaped, with the hymenium on the inner surface of
                    the basin; but in other genera it takes the form of clubs or stalks of
                    considerable size with the hymenium on the outer surface (as in <hi

                <p>The mycelium of <hi rend="italic">Erysiphe</hi> creeps over the surface of its
                    host plant, through the epidermis of which it sends down numerous haustoria.
                    Both the conidia and the sexually produced fruits are borne on the same
                    mycelium. The conidia occur in vertical order at the end of unbranched
                    conidiophores. These conidia reproduce the mycelium directly. The mode of sexual
                    reproduction resembles that of the <hi rend="italic">Discomycetes.</hi> The
                    carpogonium is more or less globular in shape, and is fertilized by a

                    wall divides it into two cells, the inferior one of which must be regarded as an
                    ascogenous hypha. The superior one becomes the ascus, which in most cases
                    contains 8 spores. In a few other forms several asci are formed by the

                    in the more striking details of their life-history with those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Erysiphae.</hi> The mycelium may be found as a fine flocculent
                    mass on the surfaces of most putrefying organic matter. The usual and most
                    extensive mode of reproduction is by the conidia, which are formed in great
                    abundance at the apex of the conidiophores. These germinate and grow under most
                    varied conditions, which fact, coupled with their plentiful production, explains
                    the general distribution of the fungus. Subsequently the sexual organs arise on
                    the same mycelium. The carpogonium is the end of a mycelial hypha wound up in
                    the form of a corkscrew, with a tranverse septum at each turn of the screw. From
                    the lowest turn two tubes sprout and grow up on the outside of the carpogonium;
                    one a!ways grows more rapidly than the other, and reaches the top of the
                    carpogonium, which it fertilizes. This is the pollinodium. Other cells then grow
                    out from the bases of both organs and envelop them. After fertilization the
                    carpogonium divides into several cells from which the ascogenous hyphae arise.
                    The asci contain ascospores which germinate as in the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erysipheae.</hi> The whole fructification is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perithecium.</hi><hi rend="italic">Suborder HI.—Tuberaceae.—</hi> The mycelium
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Tuberaceae</hi> is in most cases small in comparison
                    with the fructification. This fructification consists usually of a large
                    subterranean tuberous body, possessing a thick wall of pseudoparenchyma, and
                    enclosing a dense mass of hyphae, among which the ascogenous filaments produce
                    the asci embedded in sterile paraphyses. Conidia are known only in the case of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pénicillium</hi><hi rend="italic">glaucum,</hi> a fungus
                    which, from its common occurrence, and its being well-known in all its stages,
                    may be chosen as a type of the suborder. Its mycelium inhabits almost any
                    organic substance, and produces on erect conidiophores long chains of conidia in
                    very great abundance. It is only in darkness that (as in the other <hi
                    rend="italic">Tuberaceae)</hi> the sexually produced form of fructification
                    arises. The sexual organs resemble in a very high degree those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Eurotium</hi> (see preceding suborder), but the development of the
                    fructification after the ascogonium has been fertilized is totally different
                    from the corresponding process. After the ascogonium has begun to germinate, the
                    growth of the enveloping hyphae so hinders this process that it is forced to
                    rest in a sclerotioid state. If germination, however, be encouraged by
                    artificial means, the ascogenous hyphae force their way out and form asci, in
                    each of which there are 8 ascospores. These spores, on germinating, produce a
                    mycelium which bears conidia. If the germination of the sclerotia be delayed so
                    long that the ascogenous hyphae lose the power of producing asci, the enveloping
                    filaments give rise to the conidial form of fructification. The structure of
                    those sclerotia is so similar to that of the well-known tuberous fructifications
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Tuberaceae,</hi> that Brefeld, who discovered them,
                    classes <hi rend="italic">Pénicillium</hi> with this suborder, in spite of the
                    very strong resemblance of the sexual organs to those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eurotium.</hi> In no other species of <hi rend="italic">Tuberaceae</hi> has
                    this life-history been observed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Suborder IV.—-Pyrenomycetes.—</hi> Tlιe <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">perithecia,</hi> with walls of pseudo-parenchyma. The asci
                    contain, as a rule, 8 spores. In some cases the perithecium is open at first,
                    but in others the neck, closed during the earlier stage, forms subsequently a
                    canal through which the spores escape. In t∫ιe case of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sphaeriae</hi><hi rend="italic">simplices,</hi> the perithecia arise on a very
                    fine mycelium, and according to Woronin and others are the result of a sexual
                    act. In <hi rend="italic">Xylaria</hi> and allied genera, however, the
                    perithecia are formed on sometimes very large club or basin shaped bodies,
                    consisting of dense masses of tissue, which, according to some, are simply the
                    receptacles, and according to others, bearers of sexual organs, the union of
                    which gives rise to the perithecia. Analogy leads to regarding them as
                    receptacles. Conidia are formed not only on the mycelium but also on the stroma,
                    and even occasionally on the hyphae composing the wall of the perithecium. <hi
                    rend="italic">Spermogonia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pycnidia</hi> are other

                    >stylospores.</hi> It was urged with much show of probability that these were
                    parasitic bodies; but the recent researches of Dr Bauke on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pycnidia</hi> and Μ. Cornu on the <hi rend="italic">spermatia</hi> seem to
                    disprove this view. Μ. Cornu states that he caused spermatia to germinate and
                    reproduce the mycelium of the species to which they belonged. It will be seen,
                    however, that in the next suborder <hi rend="italic">(Lichenes)</hi> the
                    analogous spermatia act as male organs,—a function which not only precludes the
                    possibility of their parasitic nature, but does not agree well with Μ. Cornu’s
                    (so far as we know) unconfirmed views. In <hi rend="italic">Claυiceps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">purpurea</hi> (ergot), which attacks the young ovary of rye, the
                    mycelium first bears conidia embedded in a mucous secretion; this is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">sphacelia</hi> stage. The mycelium, however, soon permeates
                    the ovary and forms a hard sclerotium—the ergot stage. After undergoing a period
                    of rest, usually from summer to spring, but varying in length, the sclerotium on
                    falling on damp ground pushes out small stalks with a rounded head in which
                    numerous flask-shaped, wall-less perithecia arise. These perithecia bear as
                    usual asci containing ascospores. The ascospores, on germinating, and finding
                    their usual host—the rye, or some nearly related grass, give rise again to the
                    sphacelia, which closes the cycle.</p>
                <p>This suborder, like the <hi rend="italic">Dìscomycetes,</hi> contains a great
                    number of forms, many of which are known in only one, viz., the
                    perithecium-bearing stage,—the other phases probably being known by other names
                    as distinct genera and species. The <hi rend="italic">Pyrenomycetes</hi> grow

                    Schwendener, Stahl, De Bary, Bornet, and others have proved that these consist
                    of a fungal <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetous</hi> element parasitic on an algal
                    element. The algal element belongs to the lower orders of <hi rend="italic"

                    the algal element, which in a free state is capable of independently subsisting,

                <p>Though sexuality is not known to exist generally in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lichenes,</hi> it has been so satisfactorily proved in the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collemaceae</hi> by Dr Stahl that it may be concluded that
                    investigation only is necessary to bring fresh cases to light. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collemaceae</hi> the male organs of reproduction (the <hi
                    rend="italic">sp&gt;ermatia)</hi> are formed within receptacles called <hi
                    rend="italic">spermogonia</hi> (similar organs have been described [as occurring
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Uredineae,</hi> &amp;c.), and though not possessing the
                    power of spontaneous motion, reach the female organ <hi rend="italic"
                    >(trichogyne)</hi> by the agency of water or the atmosphere. The spermatia
                    consist of one simple minute cell; the <hi rend="italic">trichogynes</hi> are of
                    a more complicated structure, and may be described as consisting of a
                    unicellular organ of conception, a conductive canal, and an ascogonium,
                    consisting of a coiled hypha of several cells. The point of the trichogyne
                    emerges from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n870/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0870-0835"/> surface of the thallus, and the spermatia ou
                    coming in contact become united with it by a small tube through which the
                    contents of the male organs fertilize the trichogyne. After fertilization the
                    cells of the ascogonium increase in number and size, and the ascogenous hyphae
                    spring from the original coil and bear the characteristic asci in which the
                    ascospores are formed.</p>
                <p>The relations between the fungal and the algal elements may be illustrated by the
                    following instance from Dr Stahl’s <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur
                    Entwickelungsgeschichte der Flechten.</hi> The Algae were formerly considered
                    organs of the fungal portion, and received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >gonidia.</hi> A smaller form of <hi rend="italic">gonidia,</hi> called the <hi
                    rend="italic">hymenial-gonidia.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> j</hi> occurs
                    in interstitial spaces of the apothecia of many Lichens; these <hi rend="italic"
                    >hymenial-gonidia</hi> are the offspring of the ordinary gonidia (the <hi
                    rend="italic">thallus-gonidia),</hi> and have been carried up in the hymenium by
                    the growth of its hyphae. When the ascospores are emitted from the apothecia,
                    the <hi rend="italic">hymenial-gonidia</hi> are cast out also, and falling in
                    the neighbourhood of the ascospores are, many of them, enveloped by the
                    germinating filaments proceeding from the spores, when the conditions are
                    favourable for growth. Along with the growth of the hyphae, these <hi
                    rend="italic">hymenial-gonidia</hi> increase in size, and ultimately act as the
                    <hi rend="italic">thallus-gonidia</hi> of the new Lichen. This process has been
                    observed in <hi rend="italic">Dermatocarpon Schaereri</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyblastia rugulosa.</hi> When this discovery was made by Dr Stahl, he found
                    growing beside the <hi rend="italic">Dermatocarpon</hi> a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Thelidium,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">gonidia</hi> of which
                    appeared to belong to the same species of Alga as those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dermatocarpon.</hi> He isolated, under favourable conditions for growth, the
                    spores of <hi rend="italic">Thaelidium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hymenial-gonidia</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Dermatocarpon,</hi> and soon
                    obtained the thallus of <hi rend="italic">Thelidium</hi> complete as regards
                    gonidia and fructification. This experiment, by proving that the same species of
                    Alga (in this case a species of <hi rend="italic">Pleurococcuf)</hi> served as
                    the <hi rend="italic">gonidia of</hi> two totally different fungi, also strongly
                    supports the above views as to the dual nature of the elements composing the
                    Lichen. These views, though supported by the most eminent botanists and backed
                    by incontestable facts, are still occasionally the subject of attack by
                    lichenologists.</p>
                <p>The suborder <hi rend="italic">Lichenes</hi> contains a greater number of species
                    than any other suborder or order of fungi, but it is probable that excessive
                    subdivision has given rise to many. Lichens grow chiefly in exposed situations,
                    such as the bark of trees and rocks, and are very generally distributed
                    throughout the globe. They vary much in size and form, but are generally of a
                    foliaceous or encrusting habit. They form a large proportion of the vegetation
                    of alpine and polar regions. Their economic and medicinal properties are in many
                    cases of importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order V.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Myxomycètes.</hi> —In the
                    first stage of their life-history the <hi rend="italic">Myxomycètes</hi> are
                    mobile organisms, differing so strongly from any state of any other vegetable
                    that it was proposed by Professor De Bary to place them among amoeboid animal
                    organisms. In this stage, where one would expect a thallus of hyphae, a mobile
                    plasmodium is found, which in habit of life greatly resembles animal organisms.
                    In appearance it is slimy or creamy, and consists of numerous anastomosing
                    net-like channels, through which there is conducted with more or less rapidity a
                    current of protoplasmic matter containing many foreign bodies, such as particles
                    of colouring matter of different natures, starch granules, diatoms, spores of
                    fungi, &amp;c. These channels are not bounded by any definite membrane, and the
                    direction is frequently changed, probably for the purpose of gathering
                    nourishment. Where one or more individuals are situated near each other these
                    plasmodia occasionally unite (this has been observed between two different
                    species). These mobile masses ultimately, usually after undergoing division, are
                    transformed into motionless fruits, in some cases of regular form <hi
                    rend="italic">(sporangia),</hi> and in others of irregular <hi rend="italic"
                    >(plasmodiocarp).</hi> Compound fruits called <hi rend="italic">athalia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> of regular or irregular form, either naked or
                    enclosed by a membrane <hi rend="italic">(cortex),</hi> are produced externally
                    on definite sporophores by cell-division, or within the fruit by free-cell
                    formation. On germinating, the contents of the spores escape either in the form
                    of a zoospore with a nucleus, vacuole, and long cilia, or of an amoeboid, and
                    these zoospores or amaeboids soon aggregate and form mobile plasmodia.</p>
                <p>Taking the two generations in their life-history, it will be found that the
                    fructification has probably greater claims to a fungal nature than the
                    plasmodium has to an animal. They have, therefore, been retained in the
                    vegetable king-dont<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0871-0836"/> by the majority of botanists,— whether justly or
                    not remains to be determined by future research.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order VI.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Schizomycetes.</hi> —In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Schizomycetes,</hi> the usual and apparently most common form
                    of reproduction is by simple segmentation. In several forms, however,
                    reproduction of a higher type has been observed. Au instance of this is to be
                    found in <hi rend="italic">Bacillus</hi><hi rend="italic">anthracis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> the cause of splenic fever—the life-history of which,
                    according to Ewart, Koch, and others, is as follows. At first the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacilli</hi> consist of motionless hyaline rods capable of
                    segmentation, which after a short time pass through a motile phase lasting
                    usually several hours. After settling down these rods elongate considerably in a
                    short time; if the temperature be favourable a rod may increase in five hours to
                    from 80 or 100 times its original length. The filaments usually become
                    interwoven like mycelial hyphae, and are in most cases irregular in their
                    course. Within them spores are soon formed by free cell-formation, each spore
                    being separated from its neighbour by a transverse septum. At this stage the
                    filaments decay more or less rapidly and set free the oval spores, which are,
                    from Cohn’s measurement, not more than <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> √ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ⅞∙ <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> ∙ to ^∕ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> ⅞- <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ∙ inch in their
                    greatest diameter. According to Koch these spores directly elongate into
                    filaments, but Ewart has more recently observed that they divide into four
                    sporules, each of which germinates by the production of a filament. These
                    filaments become motionless rods such as those from which we started.</p>
                <p>In the classification of this order much confusion exists from the meagreness of
                    our knowledge of the life-history of its members. Organisms described as <hi
                    rend="italic">Micrococcus, Bacterium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bacillus</hi>
                    are apparently in many cases different phases of the same life-history. Much
                    attention has been paid to their influence on diseases of men and animals, from
                    their frequent occurrence on mucous surfaces, on wounds, and elsewhere. An
                    extensive literature has arisen on this subject, but its interest is far more
                    medical than botanical. Whether these organisms are the concomitants or the
                    causes of diseases in men and animals has not often been decided, and is still
                    much debated,—a source of frequent error being the confusion of debris of
                    various kinds with <hi rend="italic">Bacteria,</hi> &amp;c. “Spontaneous
                    generation” has also been attributed to them, but there has certainly not been
                    anything like proof to support this assertion.</p>
