                    21st April 1782. He completed his seventieth year, and died at Marienthal, near
                    Bad-Liebenstein, on the 21 st June 1852. Like Comenius, with whom he had much in
                    common, he was neglected in his youth, and the remembrance of his own early
                    sufferings made him in after life the more eager in promoting the happiness of
                    children. His mother he lost in his infancy, and his father, the pastor of
                    Oberweissbach and the surrounding district, attended to his parish but not to
                    his family. Friedrich soon had a stepmother, and neglect was succeeded by
                    stepmotherly attention; but a maternal uncle took pity on him, and gave him a
                    home for some years at Stadt-Ilm. Here he went to the village school, but like
                    many thoughtful boys he passed for a dunce. Throughout life he was always
                    seeking for hidden connexions and an underlying unity in all things. Nothing of
                    the kind was to be perceived in the piecemeal studies of the school, and
                    FroebeΓs mind, busy as it was for itself, would not work for the masters. His
                    half-brother was therefore thought more worthy of a university education, and
                    Friedrich was apprenticed for two years to a forester (1797-1799). Left to
                    himself in the Thuringian Forest, Froebel now began to study nature, and without
                    scientific instruction he obtained a profound insight into the uniformity and
                    essential unity of nature’s laws. Years afterwards the celebrated Jahn (the
                    “Father Jahn” of the German gymnasts) told a Berlin student of a queer fellow he
                    had met, who made out all sorts of wonderful things from stones and cobwebs.
                    This queer fellow was Froebel; and the habit of making out general truths from
                    the observation of nature, especially from plants and trees, dated from the
                    solitary rambles in the Forest. No training could have been better suited to
                    strengthen his inborn tendency to mysticism; and when he left the Forest at the
                    early age of seventeen, he seems to have been possessed by the main ideas which
                    influenced him all his life. The conception which in him dominated all others
                    was the unity of nature; and he longed to study natural sciences that he might
                    find in them various applications of nature’s universal laws. With great
                    difficulty he got leave to join his elder brother at the university of Jena, and
                    there for a year he went from lecture-room to lecture-room hoping to grasp that
                    connexion of the sciences which had for him far more attraction than any
                    particular science in itself. But Froebel’s allowance of money was very small,
                    and his skill in the management of money was never great, so his university
                    career ended in an imprisonment of nine weeks for a debt of thirty shillings. He
                    then returned home with very poor prospects, but much more intent on what he
                    calls the course of “self-completion” (<hi rend="italic">Vervollkommnung meines
                    selbst)</hi> than on “getting on” in a worldly point of view. He was soon sent
                    to learn farming, but was recalled in consequence of the failing health of his
                    father. In 1802 the father died, and Froebel, now twenty years old, had to shift
                    for himself. It was some time before he found his true vocation, and for the
                    next three and a half years we find him at work now in one part of Germany now
                    in another,—sometimes land-surveying, sometimes acting as accountant, sometimes
                    as private secretary; but in all this his “outer life was far removed from his
                    inner life,” and in spite of his outward circumstances he became more and more
                    conscious that a great task lay before him for the good of humanity. The nature
                    of the task, however, was not clear to him, and it seemed determined by
                    accident. While studying architecture in Frankfort-on-the-Main, he became
                    acquainted with the director of a model school who had caught some of the
                    enthusiasm of Pestalozzi. This friend saw that FroebeΓs true field was
                    education, and he persuaded him to give up architecture and take a post in the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0828-0793"/> model school. In this school Froebcl worked for
                    two years with remarkable success, but he then retired and undertook the
                    education of three lads of one family. In this he could not satisfy himself, and
                    he obtained the parents’ consent to his taking the boys to Yverdon, near
                    Neuchatel, and there forming with them a part of the celebrated institution of
                    Pestalozzi. Thus from 1807 till 1809 Froebel was drinking in Pestalozzianism at
                    the fountain head, and qualifying himself to carry on the work which Pestalozzi
                    had begun. For the science of education had to deduce from Pestalozzi’s
                    experience principles which Pestalozzi himself could not deduce. And “Froebel,
                    the pupil of Pestalozzi, and a genius like his master, completed the reformer’s
                    system; taking the results at which Pestalozzi had arrived through the
                    necessities of his position, Froebel developed the ideas involved in them, not
                    by further experience but by deduction from the nature of man, and thus he
                    attained to the conception of true human development and to the requirements of
                    true education” (Schmidt’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Pädagogik).</hi></p>
                <p>Holding that man and nature, inasmuch as they proceed from the same source, must
                    be governed by the same laws, Froebel longed for more knowledge of natural
                    science. Even Pestalozzi seemed to him not to “honour science in her divinity.”
                    He therefore determined to continue the university course which had been so
                    rudely interrupted eleven years before, and in 1811 he began studying at
                    Göttingen, whence he proceeded to Berlin. But again his studies were
                    interrupted, this time by the king of Prussia’s celebrated call “to my people.”
                    Though not a Prussian, Froebel was heart and soul a German. He therefore
                    responded to the call, enlisted in Lützow’s corps, and went through the campaign
                    of 1813. But his military ardour did not take his mind off education.
                    “Everywhere,” he writes, “as far as the fatigues I underwent allowed, I carried
                    in my thoughts my future calling as educator; yes, even in the few engagements
                    in which I had to take part. Even in these I could gather experience for the
                    task I proposed to myself.” Froebel’s soldiering showed him the value of
                    discipline and united action, how the individual belongs not to himself but to
                    the whole body, and how the whole body supports the individual.</p>
                <p>Froebel was rewarded for his patriotism by the friendship of two men whose names
                    will always be associated with his, Langethal and Middendorff. These young men,
                    ten years younger than Froebel, became attached to him in the field, and were
                    ever afterwards his devoted followers, sacrificing all their prospects in life
                    for the sake of carrying out his ideas.</p>
                <p>At the peace of Fontainebleau (signed in May 1814) Froebel returned to Berlin,
                    and became curator of the museum of mineralogy under Professor Weiss. In
                    accepting this appointment from the Government he seemed to turn aside from his
                    work as educator; but if not teaching he was learning. More and more the thought
                    possessed him that the one thing needful for man was unity of development,
                    perfect evolution in accordance with the laws of his being, such evolution as
                    science discovers in the other organisms of nature. He at first intended to
                    become a teacher of natural science, but before long wider views dawned upon
                    him. Langethal and Middendorf were in Berlin, engaged in tuition. Froebel gave
                    them regular instruction in his theory, and at length, counting on their
                    support, he resolved to set about realizing his own idea of “the new education.”
                    This was in 1816. Three years before one of his brothers, a clergyman, had died
                    of fever caught from the French prisoners. His widow was still 'iving in the
                    parsonage at Griesheim, a village on the Ilm. Froebel gave up his post, and set
                    out for Griesheim on foot, spending his very last groschen on the way for
                    bread.</p>
                <p>Here he undertook the education of his orphan niece and nephews, and also of two
                    more nephews sent him by another brother. With these he opened a school and
                    wrote to Middendorf and Langethal to come and help in the experiment. Middendorf
                    came at once, Langethal a year or two later, when the school had been moved to
                    Keilhau, another of the Thuringian villages, which became the Mecca of the new
                    faith. In Keilhau Froebel, Langethal, Middendorff, and Barop, a relation of
                    Middendorff’s, all married and formed an educational community. Sudi zeal could
                    not be fruitless, and the school gradually increased, though for many years its
                    teachers, with Froebel at their head, were in the greatest straits for money,
                    and at times even for food. After 14 years’ experience he determined to start
                    other institutions to work in connexion with the parent institution at Keilhau,
                    and being offered by a private friend the use of a castle on the Wartensee, in
                    the canton of Lucerne, he left Keilhau under the direction of Barop, and with
                    Langethal he opened the Swiss iustitution. The ground, however, was very ill
                    chosen. The Catholic clergy resisted what they considered as a Protestant
                    invasion, and the experiment on the Wartensee and at Willisau in the same
                    canton, to which the institution was moved in 1833, never had a fair chance. It
                    was in vain that Middendorff at Froebel’s call left his wife and family at
                    Keilhau, and laboured for four years in Switzerland without once seeing them.
                    The Swiss institution never flourished. But the Swiss Government wished to turn
                    to account the presence of the great educator; so young teachers were sent to
                    Froebel for instruction, and finally Froebel moved to Burgdorf (a Bernese town
                    of some importance, and famous from Pestalozzi’s labours there thirty years
                    earlier) to undertake the establishment of a public orphanage, and also to
                    superintend a course of teaching for sclioolmasters. The elementary teachers of
                    the canton were to spend three months every alternate year at Burgdorf, and
                    there compare experiences, and learn of distinguished men such as Froebel and
                    Bitzius. In his conferences with these teachers Froebel found that the schools
                    suffered from the state of the raw material brought into them. Till the school
                    age was reached the children were entirely neglected. Froebel’s conception of
                    harmonious development naturally led him to attach much importance to the
                    earliest years, and his great work on <hi rend="italic">The Education of
                    Man,</hi> published as early as 1826, deals chiefly with the child up to the age
                    of seven. At Burgdorf his thoughts were much occupied with the proper treatment
                    of young children, and in scheming for them a graduated course of exercises,
                    modelled on the games in which he observed them to be most interested. In his
                    eagerness to carry out his new plans he grew impatient of official restraints;
                    so he returned to Keilhau, and soon afterwards opened the first <hi
                    rend="italic">Kindergarten</hi> or “Garden of Children,” in the neighbouring
                    village of Blankenburg (1837). Firmly convinced of the importance of the
                    Kindergarten for the whole human race, Froebel described his system in a weekly
                    paper (his <hi rend="italic">Sonntagsblatt)</hi> which appeared from the middle
                    of 1837 till 1840. He also lectured in great towns; and he gave a regular course
                    of instruction to young teachers at Blankenburg. But although the principles of
                    the Kindergarten were gradually making their way, the first Kindergarten was
                    failing for want of funds. It had to be given up, and Froebel, now a widower (he
                    had lost his wife in 1839), carried on his course for teachers first at Keilhau,
                    and from 1848, for the last four years of his life, at or near Liebenstein, in
                    the Thuringian Forest, and in the duchy of Meiningen. It is in these last years
                    that the man Froebel will be best known to posterity, for in 1849 he attracted
                    within the circle of his influence a woman of great intellectual power, the
                    Baroness von Marenholtz∙ Bülow, who has given us in her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recollections of</hi><hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Froebel</hi> the only lifelike portrait we possess.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0829-0794"/>
                <p>These seemed likely to be Froebel’s most peaceful days. He married again, and
                    having now devoted himself to the training of women as educators, he spent his
                    time in instructing his class of young female teachers. But trouble came upon
                    him from a quarter whence he least expected it. In the great year of revolutions
                    1848 Froebel had hoped to turn to account the general eagerness for improvement,
                    and Middendorff had presented an address on Kindergartens to the German
                    Parliament. Besides this a nephew of Froebel’s published books which were
                    supposed to teach socialism. True, the uncle and nephew differed so widely that
                    the “new Froebeliaus” were the enemies of “the old.” The distinction was
                    overlooked, and Friedrich and Karl Froebel were regarded as the united advocates
                    of some new thing. In the reaction which soon set in Froebel found himself
                    suspected of socialism and irreligion, and in 1851 the “cultus-minister” Raumer
                    issued an edict forbidding the establishment of schools “after Friedrich and
                    Karl FroebeΓs principles” in Prussia. This was a heavy blow to the old man, who
                    looked to the Government of the <hi rend="italic superscript"> u</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">C</hi><hi rend="italic">tdtus-staaV</hi> Prussia for support, and
                    was met with denunciation. Of the justice of the charge the minister brought
                    against Froebel the reader may judge from the account of bis principles given
                    below.</p>
                <p>Whether from the worry of this new controversy, or from whatever cause, Froebel
                    did not long survive the decree. His seventieth birthday was celebrated with
                    great rejoicings in May 1852, but he died in the following month, and lies
                    buried at Schweina, a village near his last abode, Marienthal.</p>
                <p>“AU education not founded on religion is unproductive.” This conviction of
                    Froebel’s followed naturally from his conception of the unity of all things, a
                    unity due to the original Unity from whom all proceed and in whom all “live,
                    move, and have their being.” “In Allem wirkt und schafft <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ein</hi> Leben, Weil das Leben all’ ein ein’ger Gott gegeben.” “All his come
                    forth from the divine, from God, and is through God alone conditioned. To this
                    it is that all things owe their existence, to the divine working in them. The
                    divine element that works in each thing is the true idea <hi rend="italic">(das
                    Wesen)</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the thing.” “The destiny and calling of all
                    things is to develop their true idea, and in so doing to reveal God in outward
                    aud through passing forms.”</p>
                <p>As man and nature have one origin they must be subject to the same laws. Hence
                    Froebel did what Comenius had doue two centuries before him, he looked to the
                    course of nature for the principles of human education. This he declares to be
                    his fundamental belief: “In the creation, in nature and the order of the
                    material world, and in the progress of mankind, God has given us the true type
                    <hi rend="italic">(Urbild)</hi> of education.”</p>
                <p>As the cultivator creates nothing in the trees and plants, io the educator
                    creates nothing in the children,—he merely superintends the development of
                    inborn faculties. So far Froebel agrees with Pestalozzi; but in one respect he
                    went beyond him, and has thus become, according to Michelet, the greatest of
                    educational reformers. Pestalozzi said that the faculties were developed by
                    exercise. Froebel added that the function of education was to develop the
                    faculties by arousing <hi rend="italic">voluntary activity.</hi> Action
                    proceeding from inner impulse <hi rend="italic">(Selbstthätigkeit)</hi> was the
                    one thing needful. And here Froebel as usual refers to God. “God’s every thought
                    is a work, a deed.” As God is the Creator so must man be a creator also. “He who
                    will early learn to recognize the Creator must early exercise his own power of
                    action with the consciousness that he is bringing about what is good, for the
                    doing good is the link between the creature r.nd the Creator, and the conscious
                    doing of it is the conscious connexion, the true living union of the man with
                    God, of the individual man as of the human race, and is therefore at once the
                    starting point and the eternal aim of all education.” Again he says: “The
                    starting point of all that appears, of all that exists, and therefore of all
                    intellectual conception, is act, action. From the act, from action, must
                    therefore start true human education, the developing education of the man; in
                    action, in acting, it must be rooted and must spring up Living, acting,
                    conceiving,—these must form a triple chord within every child of man, though the
                    sound now of this string, now of that, may preponderate, and then again of two
                    together.”</p>
                <p>The prominence which Froebel gave to action, his doctrine that man is primarily a
                    doer and even a creator, and that he learns only through “self-activity,” may
                    produce great changes in educational methods generally, and not simply in the
                    treatment of children too young for schooling. But it was to the first stage of
                    life that Froebel paid the greatest attention, and it is over this stage that
                    his influence is gradually extending. Froebel held with Rousseau that each age
                    has a completeness of its own, and that the perfection of the later stage can be
                    attained only through the perfection of the earlier. If the infant is what he
                    should be as an infant, and the child as a child, he will become what he should
                    be as a boy, just as naturally as new shoots spring from the healthy plant.
                    Every stage, then, must be cared for and tended in such a way that it may attain
                    its own perfection. Impressed with the immense importance of the first stage,
                    Froebel like Pestalozzi devoted himself tu the instruction of mothers. But he
                    would not, like Pestalozzi, leave the children entirely in the mother’s hands.
                    Pestalozzi held that the child belonged to the family; Fichte, on the other
                    hand, claimed it for society and the state. Froebel, whose mind like that of
                    Frederick Maurice delighted in harmonizing apparent contradictions, and who
                    taught that “all progress lay through opposites to their reconciliation,”
                    maintained that the child belonged both to the family and to society, and he
                    would therefore have children spend some hours of the day in a common life and
                    in well-organized common employments. These assemblies of children he would not
                    call schools, for the children in them ought not to be old enough for schooling.
                    So he invented the name <hi rend="italic">Kindergarten,</hi> garden of children,
                    and called the superintendents “children’s gardeners.” He laid great stress on
                    every child cultivating its own plot of ground, but this was not his reason for
                    the choice of the name. It was rather that he thought ⅛&gt;f these institutions
                    as enclosures in which young human plants are nurtured. In the Kindergarten the
                    children’s employment should be <hi rend="italic">play.</hi> But any occupation
                    in which children delight is play to them; and Froebel invented a series of
                    employments, which, while they are in this sense play to the children, have
                    nevertheless, as seen from the adult point of view, a distinct educational
                    object. This object, as Froebel himself describes it, is “to give the children
                    employment in agreement with their whole nature, to strengthen their bodies, to
                    exercise their senses, to engage their awakening mind, and through their senses
                    to bring them acquainted with nature and their fellow creatures; it is
                    especially to guide aright the heart and the affections, and to lead them to the
                    original ground of all life, to unity with themselves.”</p>
                <p>At the end of the first quarter of a century since Froebel’s death, the spread of
                    his ideas, or at least of his methods, seems rapidly extending. Prophets are
                    slowly recognized in their own country, and although he is so thoroughly German
                    in bis mode of thought and exposition that, as Deinhardt says, no other nation
                    could have produced such a man, the Germans as yet are not so ready to learn
                    from Froebel as from the Swiss Pestalozzi. In Austria the Kindergarten has made
                    more way than in Prussia, and it seems to prosper in America. But Froebel’s
                    influence is not limited to the Kindergarten, His conception of education<pb
