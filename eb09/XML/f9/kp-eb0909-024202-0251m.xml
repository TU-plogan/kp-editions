                    eminent as a divine, attracted the notice of Margaret, countess of Richmond,
                    mother of Henry VII., who appointed him her chaplain and confessor. In 1501 he
                    took the degree of doctor in divinity, and the same year was elected chancellor
                    of the university. In the year following the first appointment of the
                    newly-established Margaret professorship in divinity was conferred upon him; and
                    in 1504 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester. Fisher has been erroneously
                    credited with the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Assertio Septem
                    Sacramentorum,</hi> in which Henry VIII. attacked the heretic Luther, and for
                    which the pope conferred upon his Majesty the title of “Defender of the Faith.”
                    Sir Thomas More and Fisher, however, published their respective rejoinders to
                    the Reformer’s reply to the king. Hitherto he had retained the friendship and
                    esteem of the king; but from 1527 till his death he was acknowledged as, next to
                    Sir Thomas More, the most influential man of the anti-royal or papal party in
                    England. He published a pamphlet against the divorce of Catherine of Aragon,
                    which was widely disseminated on the Continent, and also secretly circulated in
                    England. In 1533 the parliament found him guilty of misprision of treason, for
                    concealing certain prophetic speeches of Elizabeth Barton, a fanatical impostor
                    known as the Holy Maid of Kent, relative to the king’s death, and condemned him,
                    with five others, to suffer loss of goods and imprisonment during his majesty’s
                    pleasure. He was subsequently released upon payment of a fine of £300. Fisher
                    excused his silence on the ground that the nun had told him that she had
                    communicated her prophecies to Henry in person, but he nevertheless refused to
                    express regret for having been unwittingly connected with treasonable designs.
                    As to the great question of the day, Fisher offered to swear to the succession
                    in the line of Anne Boleyn’s issue, but he refused to acknowledge either the
                    validity of her marriage or the king’s supremacy. For this refusal he was
                    attainted by the parliament of 1534, and committed to the Tower. At this
                    juncture Pope Paul III. sent him a cardinal’s hat. This kindness, however, only
                    hastened the bishop’s ruin. He was beheaded at Tower Hill on the 22d of June
                    1535. It is impossible to withhold from Fisher, notwithstanding his inflexible
                    enmity to the Reformation, the character of a learned, pious, and honest man.
                    His works attest his learning; his inflexible zeal for his faith, and the
                    readiness with which he died for his creed, plainly prove his honesty as well as
                    his piety. His execution was a sad tragedy, defensible only on the plea of
                    political necessity. For the latest apology for Bishop Fisher, see the Rev. R.
                    W. Watson’s <hi rend="italic">History of the English Church,</hi> vol. i.,

                <p>Fisher was the author of a considerable number of controversial tracts, most of
                    which were collected and printed in one volume folio, Eublished at Wurtzburg in
                    1595. A Life of Fisher, by Rev. John ∣ewis, A.M., was published in 1855, in two
                    volumes.</p>
