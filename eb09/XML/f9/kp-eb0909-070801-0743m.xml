                    the Prussian province of Brandenburg, about 50 miles in an easterly direction
                    from Berlin. The town proper, which has far outgrown the limits of its ancient
                    walls, lies on the left of the river, but it is connected by a wooden bridge 900
                    feet long with the suburb of Damm. Among the more important buildings are the
                    Protestant church of St Mary’s (the Oberkirche), a handsome brick edifice of the
                    !3th century, the Roman Catholic church, the Jewish synagogue, the Rathhaus,
                    dating from 1607, and bearing on its southern gable the sign of the Hanseatic
                    League; the city infirmary, three hospitals, an orphan asylum, a workhouse, a
                    theatre, the Frederick gymnasium, and the provincial industrial school. The
                    university of Frankfort, which was founded in 1506 by the elector of
                    Brandenburg, Joachim I., was removed to Breslau in 1811, and the university
                    buildings are now occupied by the Realschule. As the chief town of a province,
                    Frankfort is the seat of a court of appeal, a general commission, and a number
                    of administrative boards. Its industry is mainly devoted to the manufacture of
                    iron-wares, pottery, paper, silk and woollen goods, bone-dust, chocolate, and
                    liqueurs. Being situated on the high road from Berlin to Silesia, commanding an
                    extensive system of water communication by means of the Oder and its canals to
                    the Vistula and the Elbe, and in modern times having become an important railway
                    junction, it maintains no small commercial activity, which is further fostered
                    and concentrated by its three annual fairs held respectively at <hi

                    day, and at Martinmas. The population, which in 1849 was 29,969, had at the
                    census of 1875 attained to 47,176. The municipal existence of Frankfort goes
                    back to 1253, when it was colonized by <pb break="no"

                    of Brandenburg, who had recently conquered the district from the Wends. The
                    principal facts in its external history are— the siege which it successfully
                    sustained against the emperor Charles IV. in the time of the pretender Waldemar;
                    the papal excommunication in 1426, on account of its quarrel with the bishop of
                    Lebus; the siege of the Hussites in 1432, of the Poles in 1450, and of the duke
                    of Sagan in 1477; and its capture by Gustavus Adolphus in 1631, and by the
                    Russians in 1759. The presence of the Russians on this occasion cost the town
                    300,000 thalers, and in the earlier part of the following century the continual
                    quartering of foreign troops created great destitution, compelling the
                    magistrates to procure a loan of 208,000 thalers. Ewald von Kleist died in the
                    town in August 1759, from the effects of a wound received in the battle at the
                    neighbouring village of Kunersdorf; a monument was erected over his grave in the
                    “park” in 1779. Henrich von Kleist was born in the town in 1776. and Franz von
                    Gaudy in 1800.</p>
