                    employed in teaching. In 1659 he became a professor of rhetoric at Narbonne, and
                    there pronounced the funeral oration of Μ. de Rebé, archbishop of that city. A
                    few months afterwards, the death of his uncle called him to Paris, where he laid
                    aside the habit of the doctrinaire, and at first followed the humble occupation
                    of a parochial catechist. He soon made himself known by his poetical
                    compositions in Latin and French. In 1660, he addressed to Cardinal Mazarin a
                    poem called <hi rend="italic">Carmen Eucharisticum,</hi> celebrating the Peace
                    of the Pyrenees; the following year he sang the birth of the dauphin in another
                    poem <hi rend="italic">(Genethliacon)</hi>; but what first made him famous was a
                    description in Latin verse of a brilliant tournament <hi rend="italic"
                    >(carrousel), Circus Regius,</hi> given by Louis XIV. in 1662. Chapelain, the
                    most influential critic of that time, brought his name under the notice of
                    Colbert, with the remark, “Fléchier est encore un très bon poète latin.” He was
                    now intrusted with the education of Louis Urbain Lefevre de Caumartin,
                    afterwards <hi rend="italic">intendant</hi> of finances and counsellor of state:
                    and as the house of his pupil’s father was then frequented by the most important
                    personages both of the court and the city, Fléchier was introduced into the best
                    society, and soon made many friends. He had to accompany Caumartin and his
                    family to Clermont, where the king had ordered the <hi rend="italic">Grands
                    Jours</hi> to be held (1665), and where Caumartin was sent as keeper of the
                    seals and representative of the sovereign. There he wrote his curious <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Grand Jours</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'Auvergne,</hi> first published in 1844 by Gonod, in which he
                    relates, in a half romantic, half historical form, the proceedings of this
                    extraordinary court of justice. The duke of Montausier, who had become his
                    patron, now procured for him the situation of <hi rend="italic">lecteur</hi> to
                    the dauphin. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n313/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0313-0302"/> sermons of Fléchier increased his reputation,
                    which was afterwards raised to the highest pitch by his funeral orations. Having
                    been chosen to pronounce that of Madame de Montausier (1672), he displayed so
                    great ability on the occasion that in the following year he was made a member of
                    the French Academy, along with Racine. The funeral oration of the Duchesse
                    d’Aiguillon (1675), and, above all, that of Turenne (1676), are, with that of
                    Madame de Montausier, his masterpieces in that branch of literature. The favours
                    of the court now poured in upon Fléchier. The king gave him successively the
                    abbacy of St Leverin, in the diocese of Poitiers, the office of almoner to the
                    dauphiness, and in 1685 the bishopric of Lavaur, from which he was in 1687
                    promoted to that of Nismes. Here Fléchier had occasion for the daily exercise of
                    his great qualities, gentleness and moderation. The edict of Nantes had been
                    repealed two years before; but the Calvinists were still very numerous at
                    Nismes, and the sincerity of the conversion of such as had made abjuration was
                    at best but doubtful. Fléchier, by his prudent conduct, in which zeal was
                    tempered with charity, succeeded in bringing over some of them to his views, and
                    made himself esteemed and beloved even by those who declined to change their
                    faith. During the troubles in the Cévennes, he softened to the utmost of his
                    power the rigour of the edicts, and showed himself so sensible of the evils of
                    persecution, and so indulgent even to what he regarded as error, that his memory
                    was long held in veneration amongst the Protestants of that district. In the
                    famine which succeeded the winter of 1709, he did much to alleviate the
                    prevalent distress, by assisting the poor in his diocese without regard to their
                    religious tenets, declaring that all alike were his children. He died at
                    Montpellier on the 16th February 1710, at the advanced age of seventy-eight.
                    Pulpit eloquence is the branch of belles lettres in which Fléchier excelled. He
                    is indeed far below Bossuet, whose robust and sublime genius had no rival in
                    that age; he does not equal Bourdaloue in earnestness of thought and vigour of
                    expression; nor can he rival the philosophical depth or the insinuating and
                    impressive eloquence of Massillon. But he is always ingenious, often witty, and
                    nobody has carried further than he the harmony of diction,—a quality which is
                    sometimes marred, it must be confessed, by an affectation of symmetry and a love
                    of antithesis at variance with the principles of good taste. His two historical
                    works, the histories of Theodosius and of Ximenes, are more remarkable for
                    elegance of style than for the accuracy and comprehensive insight which are the
                    chief requisites of a historian.</p>
