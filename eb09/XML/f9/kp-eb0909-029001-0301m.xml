                <p><label type="entry">FLANDERS</label> (German <hi rend="italic">Flandern,</hi>
                    Dutch <hi rend="italic">Vlaendern),</hi> an ancient countship of the Low
                    Countries, which has left its name to two provinces of the modern kingdom of
                    Belgium, distinguished as East and West. It took its rise about the time of
                    Charles the Great, but the early history of the line of counts is far from
                    certain, the older chronicles giving very different statements. Leaving out of
                    view those mythical personages through whom as a matter of course a connexion is
                    established with Priam of Troy, we find the founder of the family of the
                    Foresters, as they are called, in a certain Lideric le Buc, “only son of Saluart
                    prince of Dijon, and of Madame Eringarde daughter of Gerard lord of Roussillon,”
                    who, says Lambert, canon of St Omer, “videns Flandriam vacuam et incultam ac
                    memorosam, occupavit eam.” Even Lideric is of doubtful authenticity, though his
                    death in 836 is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Blandinienses,</hi> which were compiled before 1064 from earlier documents. His
                    son Ingelramn, say the chronicles, had a son Audacer; but according to several
                    modem investigators Audacer was merely a cognomen of Baldwin, the next person in
                    the genealogical series. With Baldwin, who is distinguished as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bras de Fer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Iron Arm,</hi> we at length reach the <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">firma</hi> of history. He was a
                    strong, daring, and unscrupulous man, and made noise enough in his own day, more
                    particularly by carrying off and marrying Judith daughter of Charles the Bald of
                    France, a lady of easy principles, who had already been the wife of Aethelwulf
                    of the West Saxons of England, and for a time of Aethelwulf’s son Aethelbald.
                    Baldwin II., the Bald, born of this marriage, is mainly remembered as a vigorous
                    opponent of the Normans, and as the builder of the walls of Bruges and Ypres. It
                    is said that he also laid the foundation of the political liberties of his
                    country by appointing twelve of his principal vassals as a council of state. He
                    took to wife Aelfthryth, daughter of King Alfred of England. On his death in
                    918, his possessions were divided between his two sons Arnulf the Elder and
                    Adolphus; but the latter survived only a short time, and Arnulf succeeded to the
                    whole inheritance. His reign was full of troubles with the Normans on the one
                    hand, and with the emperor Otho I. on the other; and he made one of his
                    conferences memorable by murdering William Longsword the Norman duke. In his old
                    age he placed the government in the hands of Baldwin, his son by Adela daughter
                    of the count of Vermandois, and the young man, though his reign was a very short
                    one, did a great deal for the commercial and industrial progress of the country,
                    establishing the first weavers and fullers of Ghent, and instituting yearly
                    fairs at Ypres, Bruges, Veurne, Cassel, Coudrai, Thorout, and Rousselare. On
                    Baldwin’s death in 961 the old count resumed the control, and spent the few
                    remaining years of his life in securing the succession of his grandson Arnulf or
                    Arnold the younger. The reign of Arnulf was terminated by his death in 989, and
                    he was followed by his son Baldwin IV., styled <hi rend="italic">Pulchra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Barba,</hi> Comely Beard, or simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbatus,</hi> Met den Baerd, With the beard. This Baldwin fought successfully
                    both against the king of Franco and the emperor Henry II., and obtained from the
                    latter Valenciennes, Walcheren, and the islands of Zealand. The counts of
                    Flanders thus became feudatories of the empire as well as of France. Baldwin’s
                    son Baldwin V., surnamed of Lille (in Latin Insularius, in Dutch Van Ryssel)
                    rebelled in 1028 against his father, at the instigation of his wife Adela,
                    daughter of Robert of France; but two years later peace was sworn at Oudenarde,
                    and the old man continued to reign till his death in 1036. Baldwin V. proved a
                    worthy successor, and acquired from the people the title of Débonnaire. He was
                    an active, ambitious, enterprising man, and greatly extended his power by wars
                    and alliances. Before his death he saw his eldest daughter Matilda sharing the
                    English throne with William the Conqueror, his son Baldwin of Mons (in Dutch
                    Bergen) in possession of Hainault in right of his wife Richilde the widow of the
                    late count, and his son Robert the Frisian ruling over the countship of Holland
                    and Friesland in right <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n302/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0302-0291"/> of the countess Gertrude. His younger daughter
                    Judith had married Tostig, brother of Harold II. of England. On his death in
                    1067, Baldwin of Mons succeeded to the countship of Flanders, apparently without
                    opposition on the part of Robert his elder brother; but α few years afterwards a
                    quarrel broke out, and Baldwin was slain. Robert now claimed the tutelage of
                    Baldwin’s children, and obtained the support of the emperor Henry IV.; while
                    Richilde, Baldwin’s widow, appealed to Philip of France. The contest was decided
                    at Ravenchoven, near Cassel, February 22, 1071, where Robert was victor, and
                    Arnulf III., Baldwin’s son, was slain. Arras, Douai, Tournai, and other towns of
                    French Flanders had taken part with the countess and the French, while Ghent,
                    Bruges, Ypres, Courtrai, and other towns of Flanders proper were on the side of
                    Robert. The successful competitor held the countship till his death in 1093,
                    when he was succeeded by his son Robert IL, who became famous for his exploits
                    in the first crusade, and acquired the title of Lance <hi rend="subscript">
                    x</hi> and Sword of Christendom. Baldwin VII., surnamed A la Hache, or With the
                    Axe, became count on Robert’s death in 1119, and in his turn transmitted the
                    dignity to his cousin Charles of Denmark, son of Canute and Adelais, daughter of
                    Robert the Frisian. This Charles of Denmark was a religious enthusiast, and
                    exercised his authority against all swearers, necromancers, Jews, and usurers.
                    At Bruges in 1127 he ordered all the granaries to be thrown open; and the
                    merchants who had expected to make gain by the dearth were so enraged that they
                    formed a conspiracy and procured his assassination in the church of St Donat. No
                    fewer than six pretenders to the countship now appeared, and among the rest
                    William Clito, son of Robert Courthose of Normandy, and Thierri or Theodoric of
                    Alsace. The latter was the successful competitor, and he married the widow of
                    Count Charles, Marguerite of Clermont. He distinguished himself at home by the
                    wise encouragement which he gave to the growth of popular liberty, and abroad by
                    the part which he took in several crusading expeditions. In the latter years of
                    his life he retired to Gravelines, leaving the cares of state to his son Philip,
                    who when he came to rule in his own name followed in his father’s footsteps, and
                    acquired the honourable reputation of “the greatest lawgiver of Flanders.” He
                    married Elizabeth of Vermandois, and on her death had a violent dispute with the
                    French monarch about the possession of Vermandois, which was ultimately granted
                    him during his life. As he had no children his inheritance went to Baldwin of
                    Hainault, who had married his sister Marguerite,—a change of the dynasty which
                    considerably affected the relations of Flanders with France. The French king
                    laid claim to the countship, and Baldwin was constrained to cede Artois, St
                    Omer, Lens, Hesdin, and a great part of southern Flanders to France, and to
                    allow Matilda of Portugal, the widow* of Philip, to hold Lille, Cassel, Veurne,
                    Rille, and Sluys. Marguerite died in 1194 and Baldwin in 1195, and the countship
                    devolved on their son Baldwin IX., who became the founder of the Latin empire at
                    Constantinople, and perished in Bulgaria in 1206. The emperor’s two daughters
                    were both under age, and accordingly the government of Flanders and Hainault was
                    entrusted to his brother Philip, assisted by Bosschaert of Avesnes and William
                    of Hainault. Johanna the elder daughter was married to Ferdinand or Ferrand of
                    Portugal, but left no heir; and so the inheritance of both Flanders and Hainault
                    passed on her death in 1279 to the children of the younger, Margaret—the latter
                    to John her eldest son by her first marriage with Bosschaert of Avesnes, and the
                    former to Guy of Dampierre, a son of her second marriage with William of
                    Dampierre, a French nobleman. The government of Guy proved an unfortunate
                    one:</p>
                <p>Flanders was involved in a severe struggle with France, and for a time almost
                    lost its independence. The old count died at Compiègne in prison about two
                    months after peace was concluded in 1305; and Robert of Bethune, his son, was
                    acknowledged his successor both by the Flemings and by the French. Robert was an
                    able and valiant prince, and has the honour of having established at Bruges the
                    first insurance company. The reign of his grandson and successor Louis of Nevers
                    and Rethel, who had been brought up at the French court and married to Margaret
                    the French king’s daughter, was rendered for ever memorable by the enterprise of
                    Jacob van Artevelde, the great hero of Flemish liberty. Louis perished in the
                    battle of Crecy, and left his county to his son Louis II. of Male, near Bruges,
                    under whom the struggle of the Flemish towns for their liberties was maintained.
                    By the marriage of Louis’s daughter Margaret with Philip of Burgundy, the
                    lordship of Flanders passed to the Burgundian family; and thus it ultimately
                    became part of, the possessions of the house of Austria. The title of count of
                    Flanders has been borne since 1840 by the second son of Leopold I. of Belgium,
                    Philip Eugene Ferdinand.</p>
