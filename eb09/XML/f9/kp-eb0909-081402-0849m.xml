                    uncles and godfathers. The boy’s training was influenced by the position of
                    these prelates and of other friends of his father, who was B.D., and had held
                    the position of lector primarius in Trinity College, Cambridge. The youth
                    studied under the care of the Rev. Arthur Smith, and of his cousin Dr Edward
                    Davenant, the mathematician. According to Aubrey, Fuller was “a boy of pregnant
                    wit.” At an early age he was admitted of Queen’s College, Cambridge, then
                    presided over by Dr John Davenant. He was apt and quick in study; and in Lent
                    1624-5 he became B.A., and in July 1628 Μ. A. Being overlooked in an election of
                    fellows of his college, he was removed by Bishop Davenant to Sidney Sussex
                    College, November 1628. In 1630 he received from Corpus Christi College, in the
                    same university, the curacy of St Benet’s, which he held for a short time, and
                    where he had for a parishioner the celebrated carrier Hobson. Fuller’s quaint
                    and humorous oratory, as displayed in his sermons on Ruth, soon attracted
                    attention. He also attained a certain fame in the university as a writer of
                    verses, and as the author of a poem, 1631, on the subject of David and
                    Bathsheba. In June of the same year his uncle gave him a prebend in Salisbury,
                    where his father, who died in the following year, held a canonry. The rectory of
                    Broadwindsor, Dorsetshire, then in the diocese of Bristol, was his next
                    preferment (1634); and 11th June 1635 he proceeded B.D, For about six years he
                    devoted himself to his rustic flock, and meanwhile compiled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Holy War,</hi> being a history of the crusades (published in 1640), and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Holy and</hi><hi rend="italic">Prophane</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >States,</hi> being a book of character biography (1642), both which deservedly
                    popular works went through several editions. At this time Fuller was well known
                    as a man of engaging manners, of good connexions, and of literary tastes. Being,
                    moreover, a cordial lover of the Church of England, and of its discipline as
                    fixed by the canons of 1603, he was in 1640 elected proctor for Bristol in the
                    memorable convocation of Canterbury, which assembled with the Short Parliament
                    On the sudden dissolution of the latter, he united himself to those who urged
                    that convocation should likewise dissolve as usual. ∣That opinion was overruled;
                    and the assembly continued to sit by virtue of a royal writ, and to frame,
                    amongst its canons, the much-ridiculed Etcetera Oath. Fuller has left a valuable
                    account of the proceedings of this synod, for sitting in which he was fined
                    £200, but was never pressed to pay it. Meanwhile he preached in some of the
                    “voiced, pulpits” of London, and was followed for his excellent gifts. His first
                    published volume of sermons appeared in 1640 under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Joseph's parti-coloured Coat,</hi> 4to, which contains many of his
                    quaint utterances and odd conceits. His grosser mannerisms of style, derived
                    from the divines of the former generation, disappeared for the most part in his
                    subsequent discourses. About 1640 he married Eleanor, daughter of Hugh Grove of
                    Chisenbury co., Wilts. Their eldest child, John, baptized at Broadwindsor by his
                    father, 6th June 1641, was afterwards of Sidney Sussex College, edited the <hi
                    rend="italic">Worthies of England,</hi> 1662, and became rector of Great
                    Wakering, Essex, where he died in 1687. At Broadwindsor, early in the year 1641,
                    Thomas Fuller, his curate Henry Sanders, the church wardens, and others, nine
                    persons altogether, certified that their parish, represented by 242 grown-up
                    male persons, had taken the Protestation ordered by the Speaker of the Long
                    Parliament. Again Fuller is met with in London, interested in the coming strife.
                    He is said to have foreseen whither the commotions were tending; and he directed
                    his efforts, as events developed, in advocacy of peace and in preservation of
                    the interests of his order. For a short time he preached with success at the
                    Inns of Court, and thence removed, at the invitation of the master of the Savoy
                    (Dr Balcanqual) and the brotherhood of that foundation, to be lecturer at their
                    chapel of St Mary Savoy. Certain of the parishioners would have elected one
                    Thomas Gibbs, whose claims were put forward in the House of Commons by Sir
                    Robert Harley; but the greater number earnestly desired Fuller, whose better
                    title was upheld in the House by Sir John Northcote, M.P. for Ashburton. Some of
                    the best discourses of the witty preacher were delivered at the Savoy to
                    audiences which extended into the chapel-yard. In one, he set forth with
                    searching and truthful minuteness the hindrances to peace, and urged the signing
                    of petitions to the king at Oxford, and to the parliament, to continue their
                    care in advancing an accommodation. In his intercourse with persons of influence
                    who attended upon his ministry, or who resided in the neighbourhood of his cure,
                    Fuller, with all the earnestness of Lord Falkland in that direction, laboured to
                    promote the same peaceful views. With these honourable efforts an historic
                    circumstance of some significance connects itself. With Sir Edward Wardour,
                    clerk of the pells, Dr Dukeson, and four or five others, Fuller was deputed to
                    take an influential peace-petition to the king, emanating from the city of
                    Westminster and the parishes contiguous to the Savoy. To carry it with fitting
                    circumstance, a pass was granted by the House of Lords, 2d January 1643, for an
                    equipage of two coaches, four or six horses, and eight or ten attendants. On the
                    arrival of the deputation at Uxbridge, 4th January, officers of the
                    Parliamentary army stopped the coaches and searched the gentlemen; and they
                    found upon the latter “two scandalous books arraigning the proceedings of the
                    House,” and letters with ciphers to Lord Viscount Falkland and the Lord Spencer.
                    A message was then sent to acquaint the House of Commons with the matter, and it
                    was complained that the Lords had given the pass. Ultimately a joint order of
                    both Houses remanded the party; and Fuller and his friends suffered a brief
                    imprisonment. The Westminster Petition, notwithstanding, reached the king’s
                    hands; and it was published with the royal reply. When it was expected, three
                    months later, that a favourable result would attend the negotiations at Oxford,
                    Fuller preached a remarkable sermon in the old abbey of Westminster, 27th March
                    1643, on the text 2 Sam. xix. 30, the occasion being the anniversary of Charles
                    I.’s accession, and the subject, his return to “our English Zion.” This loyal
                    discourse, in accord with the loyal text, brought the preacher into disfavour in
                    the city. Domestic trouble likewise overtook him in the death of his wife. On 19
                    th April the Lords gave him a pass to and from Salisbury to carry her remains
                    thither, to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n850/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0850-0815"/> buried, as it seems, amongst her own kin. He
                    returned to London, and on Wednesday, 26th July, he preached on church
                    reformation, satirizing the religious reformers, and maintaining that only the
                    Supreme Power could initiate reforms. The storm which this sermon aroused in the
                    metropolis, then well-nigh abandoned by the active royalists, brought about
                    Fuller’s secret flight to Oxford, and the loss of all his preferments and
                    property. He lived in a hired chamber at Lincoln College for 17 weeks. Thence he
                    put forth a witty and effective reply to John Saltmarsh, who had attacked his
                    views on ecclesiastical reform. Fuller subsequently published by royal request a
                    fast sermon preached 10th May 1644, at St Mary’s, Oxford, before the king and
                    Prince Charles, called <hi rend="italic">Jacob's Vow.</hi> In this discourse
                    which, it is supposed, had relation to the king’s proposed restoration of the
                    church lands, the preacher referred to some religious exercise then being
                    observed every Tuesday by Charles I., all record of which has been omitted in
                    the pages of history. The spirit of Fuller’s preaching, always characterized by
                    calmness and moderation, gave offence to the high royalists, who charged him
                    with lukewarmness in their cause. To silence unjust censures, he became chaplain
                    to the regiment of the excellent Lord Hopton. For the first five years of the
                    war, as he said, when excusing the non-appearance of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Church-History,</hi> “I had little list or leisure to write, fearing to be made
                    a history, and shifting daily for my safety. All that time I could not live to
                    study, who did only study to live.” After the defeat of Hopton at Cheriton Down,
                    Fuller retreated to Basing House. He took an active part in its defence, and was
                    once incited by the noise of the enemy’s artillery, which disturbed him at his
                    books, to head a sally upon the trenches. His life with the troops caused him to
                    be afterwards regarded as one of “the great cavalier parsons.” In his marches
                    with his regiment round about Oxford and in the west, he devoted much time to
                    the collection of details, from churches, old buildings, and the conversation of
                    ancient gossips, for his <hi rend="italic">Church-History</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Worthies of England.</hi> His patriotism in the national crisis
                    was evidenced in many ways. For the soldiers and the more religious of the
                    royalist party he compiled, 1645, a small volume of prayers and meditations,—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Good Thoughts in Bad Times,—</hi> which, set up and printed in
                    the besieged city of Exeter, whither he had retired, was called by himself “the
                    first fruits of Exeter press.” It was inscribed to Lady Dalkeith, governess to
                    the infant princess, Henrietta Anne, who was born at Exeter, 16th June 1644.
                    Fuller was by the king placed in the household of the princess through the
                    influence of Lady Dalkeith. In this city, as elsewhere, he attracted to himself
                    a circle of friends. The corporation gave him the Bodleian lectureship, 21st
                    March 1645-6, and he held it until 17 th June following, soon after the
                    surrender of the city to the Parliament. <hi rend="italic">The Fear of losing
                    the Old Light,</hi> 4to, 1646, was his farewell discourse to his Exeter friends.
                    Under the Articles of Surrender Fuller made his composition with the Government
                    at London, his “delinquency” being that he had been present in the king’s
                    garrisons. In a characteristic petition to compound, dated 1st June 1646, he
                    acquainted the committee that he was then lodging at “the Crown” in St Paul’s
                    Church-yard (the sign of his bookseller, Williams); and the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Crown</hi> is written in large letters and designedly falls in the
                    centre of the document, in which, moreover, there are traces of the disagreeable
                    position in which he was placed. In a life of Andronicus, 1646, partly authentic
                    and partly fictitious, he satirized the leaders of the Revolution; and more than
                    one edition of this little book was called for. For the comfort of sufferers by
                    the war he issued, 1647, a second devotional manual, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Good Thoughts in Worse Times,</hi> abounding, like its predecessor and its
                    successor, in fervent aspirations, and drawing moral lessons in beautiful
                    language out of the events of his life, or the circumstances of the time. In
                    grief over his losses which included his library and manuscripts (his “upper and
                    nether millstone ”), and over the calamities of the country, he wrote his work
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Wounded Conscience,</hi> 1647. It was prepared at
                    Boughton House in his native county, where, in a penniless, feeble, and exiled
                    position, he and his little son were entertained by Edward Lord Mountagu, his
                    patron, and where, as he says, he was restored to his former self. For the next
                    few years of his life, Fuller was mainly dependent upon his dealings with
                    booksellers, of whom he asserted that none had ever lost by him. Amongst other
                    minor productions of his pen at this time he seems to have made considerable
                    progress in an English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> of his
                    friend Archbishop Ussher from the MS. of that great work. Amongst his
                    benefactors it is curious to find Sir John Danvers of Chelsea, afterwards the
                    regicide. Under the countenance of citizens whose names are perpetuated in the
                    dedications in his books, Fuller in 1647 began to preach at St Clement’s, East
                    Cheap, and elsewhere, in the capacity of lecturer. While at St Clement’s he was
                    suspended; but speedily recovering his freedom, he preached wherever he was
                    invited. His connexion with the church named has recently been recognized by the
                    erection of a fine memorial window in which, clad in a doctor’s gown, he stands
                    holding in his hand his best gift to the universal church. At Chelsea, where
                    also he occasionally officiated, he covertly preached a sermon on the death of
                    Charles I.,—an event which he deeply deplored. Amongst Fuller’s noble patrons
                    was the earl of Carlisle, who made him his chaplain, and presented him to the
                    curacy of Waltham Abbey. To this kind patron he dedicated his history of that
                    foundation; and on the title-page placed the words—</p>
                <p>“Patria est ubicunque est bene;</p>
                <p>Bene vixit qui bene latuit.”</p>
                <p>His possession of the living was in jeopardy on the appointment of Cromwell’s
                    “Tryers”; but he evaded the inquisitorial questions of that dreaded body by his
                    ready wit. He had, however, the good sense to fortify himself under this ordeal
                    with the counsel of the catholic-minded John Howe, to whom he went, saying,
                    “Sir, you may observe that I am a pretty corpulent man, and I am to go through a
                    passage that is very straight; I beg you would be so good as to give me a shove
                    and help me through.” Nor was Fuller disturbed at Waltham in the “dangerous
                    year” 1655, when the Protector’s edict prohibited the adherents of the late king
                    from preaching. Moreover, Lionel, third earl of Middlesex, who lived in the
                    parish, gave him what remained of the books of the lord treasurer his father;
                    and through the good offices of the marchioness of Hertford, part of his own
                    pillaged library was restored to him. Under such circumstances Fuller actively
                    prosecuted his literary labours, producing successively, at great cost, his
                    survey of the Holy Land, called <hi rend="italic">A Pisgah-Sight of
                    Palestine,</hi> 1650; and his <hi rend="italic">Church-History of Britain,</hi>
                    1655, from the birth of Jesus Christ until the year 1648. These works were
                    furthered in no slight degree by his connexion with Sion College, London, where
                    he had a chamber, as well for the convenience of the press as of his city
                    lectureships. The <hi rend="italic">Chur ch-History</hi> was angrily attacked by
                    Dr P. Heylin, who, in the spirit of High-Churchmanship, wished, as he said, to
                    vindicate the truth, the church, and the injured clergy. About 1652 Fuller
                    married into the noble and loyal family of Roper. By his wife (Mary, youngest
                    sister of Thomas, Viscount Baltinglass) he had several children. At the Oxford
                    Act of 1657, the celebrated Robert South, who was <hi rend="italic">Terree
                    filius,</hi> lampooned Fuller for his frequent puns and other peculiarities. He
                    described him in this <hi rend="italic">Qratio</hi> as living in London, ever
                    scribbling, and each year bringing forth new <hi rend="italic">folia</hi> like a
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n851/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0851-0816"/> tree. At length, continues South, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Church-History</hi> came forth with its 1G6 dedications to wealthy
                    and noble friends; aud with this huge volume under one arm, and his wife (said
                    to be little of stature) on the other, he ran up and down the streets of London,
                    seeking at the houses of his patrons invitations to dinner, to be repaid by his
                    dull jests at table. This speech, although exaggerated, throws light upon the
                    social qualities of Fuller, who had many kind friends amongst the nobility. His
                    last and best patron was the Hon. George Berkeley of Cranford House, Middlesex,
                    whose chaplain he was, and who gave him Cranford rectory, 1658. To this nobleman
                    Fuller’s reply to Heylin, called <hi rend="italic">The Appeal of Injured
                    Innocence,</hi> 1659, was inscribed. This remarkable and instructive book
                    embraces, as its editor, Mr James Nichols, has remarked, “almost every topic
                    within the range of human disquisition, from the most sublime mysteries of the
                    Christian religion, and the great antiquity of the Hebrew and Welsh languages,
                    down to <hi rend="italic">The Tale of a Tub,</hi> and criticisms on
                    Shakespeare’s perversion of the character of Sir John Falstaff.” At the end of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Appeal</hi> is an elegant epistle “to my loving friend Dr
                    Peter Heylin,” conceived in the admirable Christian spirit which characterized
                    all Fuller’s dealings with controversialists^ “Why should <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peterſ</hi> he asked, “fall out with <hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> both being
                    disciples to the same Lord and Master? I assure you, sir, whatever you conceive
                    to the contrary, I am cordial to the cause of the English Church, and my hoary
                    hairs will go down to the grave in sorrow for her sufferings.” The only other
                    important works issued by Fuller in his lifetime were connected with the
                    Restoration. The revived Long Parliament, December 1659, proposed an oath of
                    fealty to the Commonwealth, and the abjuration of Charles II. and his family.
                    The matter was much debated; and in an able letter published in February 1660,
                    which went into a third edition, called <hi rend="italic">An Alarum to the
                    Counties of England and Wales,</hi> Fuller discussed the proposal. His arguments
                    tended to swell the cry for a free and full parliament,—free from force, as he
                    expressed it, as well as from abjurations or previous engagements. In
                    anticipation of the meeting of the new parliament, 25th April, and as if
                    foreseeing the unwise attitude of those in power in relation to the reaction,
                    Fuller put forth his <hi rend="italic">Mixt</hi><hi rend="italic">Contemplations
                    in Better Times,</hi> 1660, dedicated to Lady Monk. It tendered advice in the
                    spirit of its motto, “Let your moderation be known to all men: the Lord is at
                    hand.” There is good reason to suppose that Fuller was at the Hague immediately
                    before the Restoration, in the retinue of Lord Berkeley, one of the
                    commissioners of the House of Lords, whose last service to his friend was to
                    interest himself in obtaining him a bishopric. A <hi rend="italic">Panegyrick to
                    His Majesty on his Happy Return</hi> was the last of Fuller’s verse-efforts. On
                    2d August, by royal letters, he was admitted DAE. at C unbridge, as a scholar of
                    integrity and good learning, who had been hindered in the due way of proceeding
                    to his degree. His former preferments were restored to him. At the Savoy Pepys
                    heard him preach; but he preferred his conversation or his books to his sermons.
                    Fuller’s last promotion was that of chaplain in extraordinary to Charles II. In
                    the summer of 1661 he visited the west in connexion with the business of his
                    prebend, and upon his return he was seized with a kind of typhus-fever called
                    the “new disease.” On Sunday, 12th August, while preaching a marriage sermon at
                    the Savoy, he was disabled from proceeding; and at the close of the service he
                    was carried home in a sedan to his new lodgings in Covent-Garden, where he
                    expired, Thursday, 16th August, aged 54. On the following day 200 of his
                    brethren attended his corpse to its resting place in the chancel of Cranford
                    Church, where Dr Hardy preached a funeral sermon. A mural tablet was afterwards
                    set up on the north side of the chancel with an epitaph, which, though perhaps
                    longer than Fuller’s essay on tombs might allow him to approve, contains a
                    conceit worthy of his own pen, to the effect that while he was endeavouring
                    (viz., in <hi rend="italic">The Worthies)</hi> to give immortality to others, he
                    himself attained it. It is said that the thought of that unfinished work
                    troubled him upon his deathbed, and that he often incoherently called out to his
                    attendants for pen and ink, as if to complete it</p>
                <p>Dr Fuller was in stature somewhat tall, “with a proportionable bigness to become
                    it,” and his gait was graceful. He was of a sanguine temperament, and had a
                    ruddy countenance and light curled hair. Some of these features are pleasingly
                    depicted in his portrait at Cranford House. His personal character was
                    admirable. The charm of his manners was felt by all, his deportment being
                    “according to the old English guise.” His disposition was genial, leading him to
                    embrace goodness wherever he found it. To these fine qualities of mind he added
                    prudence. “By his particular temper and management,” said the historian Echard,
                    “he weathered the late great storm with more success than many other great men.”
                    He had many of the peculiarities of scholars. He was known as “a perfect walking
                    library.” The strength of his memory was proverbial, and some amusing anecdotes
                    are connected with it.</p>
                <p>∏is writings were the product of a highly original mind, and their moral tone was
                    excellent. He had a fertile imagination and a happy faculty of illustration. His
                    diction in the main was elegant, and more idiomatic than that of Taylor or
                    Browne. Antithetic and axiomatic sentences abound in his pages, embodying
                    literally the wisdom of the many in the wit of one. He was “quaint,” and
                    something more. “Wit,” said Coleridge, in a well-known eulogy, “wit was the
                    stuff aud substance of Fuller’s intellect. It was the element, the earthen base,
                    the material which he worked in; and this very circumstance has defrauded him of
                    his due praise for the practical wisdom of the thoughts, for the beauty and
                    variety of the truths, into which he shaped the stuff. Fuller was incomparably
                    the most sensible, the least prejudiced, great man of an age that boasted a
                    galaxy of great men.” This opinion was formed after the perusal of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Church-History.</hi> That work and <hi rend="italic">The Worthies
                    of England</hi> are unquestionably Fuller’s greatest efforts. They embody the
                    collections of an entire life; and since his day they have been the delight and
                    the solace of their readers, and the incentive which has directed or allured
                    many English scholars into historical and topographical studies. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Holy State</hi> has taken rank amongst the best books of
                    characters. Fuller’s works, according to Charles Lamb, were, in the early
                    portion of this century, scarcely perused except by antiquaries; but since that
                    time, mainly through the appreciative criticisms of Coleridge, Southey,
                    Crossley, and others, they have received more general attention; and nearly the
                    whole of his extant writings have been reprinted of late years. (j. <hi
