                    now extant which, can safely be assigned to Melozzo. (1) He painted in 1472 the
                    vault of the chief chapel' in the church of the Apostoli in Rome, his subject
                    being the Ascension of Christ; the figure of Christ is so boldly and effectively
                    foreshortened that it seemed to “burst through the vaulting”; this fresco was
                    taken down in 1711, and the figure of Christ is now in the Quirinal Palace, not
                    worthy of special admiration save in its perspective quality; while some of the
                    other portions, almost Raphaelesque in merit, are in the sacristy of St Peter’s.
                    (2) Between 1475 and 1480 he executed a fresco, now transferred to canvas, and
                    placed in the Vatican picture-gallery, representing the appointment of Platina
                    by Pope Sixtus IV. as librarian of the restored Vatican library,—an excellent
                    work of dignified portraiture. (3) In the Collegio at Forli is a fresco by
                    Melozzo, termed the “Pestapepe,” or Pepper-grinder, originally painted as a
                    grocer’s sign; it is an energetic specimen of rather coarse realism, now so
                    damaged that one can hardly assess its merits. Melozzo also painted the cupola
                    of the Capuchin church at Forlì, destroyed in 1651; and it has been said that he
                    executed at Urbino some of the portraits of great men (Plato, Dante, Sixtus IV.,
                    &lt;fcc.) which are now divided between the Barberini Palace and the Campana
                    collection in Paris; this, however, appears to be more than doubtful, and it is
                    even questionable whether Melozzo was ever at Urbino. In Rome he was one of the
                    original members of the academy of St Luke, founded by Sixtus IV. He returned to
                    Forlì, probably towards 1480, and died in November 1494. He contributed sensibly
                    to the progress of pictorial art; and, without being remarkable as a colourist,
                    gave well graded lights, with general care and finish, and fine dignified
                    figures. His works bear a certain degree of resemblance to those of his
                    contemporary Mantegna. Marco Palmezzano was his pupil; and the signature “Marcus
                    de Melotius” on some of Palmezzano’s works has, along with the general affinity
                    of style, led to their being ascribed to Melozzo, who has himself been hence
                    incorrectly called “Marco Melozzo.”</p>
