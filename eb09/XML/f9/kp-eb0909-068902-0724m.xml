                <p><label type="entry">FRANCIS I</label>. (1494-1547), king of France, son of
                    Charles of Orleans, count of Angoulême, and Louisa of Savoy, was born at Cognac
                    12th September 1494. As heir-presumptive of the throne of France, he received
                    special favours from Louis XII., who created him duke of Valois and in 1512 gave
                    him the command of the army of Navarre. In this position, though achieving no
                    important results, he conducted himself with such prudence and courage that in
                    1513 he was appointed to the command of the army in Picardy, where he
                    successfully carried out the plan of defensive operations that was entrusted to
                    him. He married Claude daughter of Louis XII. in 1514, and succeeded him on the
                    throne 1st January 1515. After his accession the first and great object that
                    occupied his ambition was the recovery of Milan, the inheritance of which he
                    claimed through his great-grandmother Valentina Visconti. Accordingly, while, in
                    order to render himself secure against external attacks, he negotiated an
                    alliance with Charles of Austria, afterwards the emperor Charles V., and the
                    renewal of a treaty concluded by Louis XII. with Henry VIII. of England, he also
                    began to collect his forces for an Italian expedition. The politic negotiations
                    which won him Genoa, the acquisition of which was all-important as commanding
                    the connexion between Milan and the sea, placed the purpose of his preparations
                    beyond all doubt, and caused Leo X. to unite in an alliauce against him with the
                    Spaniards and the Swiss. The Swiss at once occupied all the mountain passes; but
                    Francis, guided by a Piedmontese peasant, succeeded after great labour and
                    difficulty in leading his army over the Alps by a pass deemed impracticable,
                    and, descending into the friendly territories of the marquis of Saluzzo,
                    surprised and routed at Villa Franca Colonna the general of the papal cavalry,
                    and thus outflanking the Swiss caused them to fall back upon Milan. Completely
                    disconcerted by the sudden movement, they at first actually entered into
                    negotiations for a truce; but receiving shortly afterwards a reinforcement of
                    troops and their arrears of pay, they endeavoured to surprise the French at
                    Marignane. This battle, begun on the 13th September 1515, prolonged into the
                    night, and renewed on the following morning, was fought on both sides with
                    furious and stubborn courage; but on the arrival of Λlviano the Venetian
                    commander to the succour of Francis, the Swiss <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0725-0690"/> retreated unpursued to Milan. Shortly afterwards
                    Milan surrendered, and in November a treaty was concluded between Francis and
                    the Swiss, which subsequently took the form of a perpetual alliance. Such rapid
                    and brilliant success at once gave Francis a position of commanding influence,
                    and enabled him still further to strengthen himself by additional advantageous
                    treaties. In 1516, he compromised the long dispute with the popes by superseding
                    the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges by a “Concordat,” an act which, while it
                    recognized the superiority of the pope over the councils, and gave him the
                    command of the <hi rend="italic">annates</hi> and other rich sources of revenue,
                    entrusted the French monarch with the power of nominating to vacant benefices.
                    In 1517 he entered into an alliance with the emperor Maximilian and Charles I.
                    of Spain against the Turks; and in 1518he made an arrangement with Henry VIII.
                    of England, by which France bought back Tournay.</p>
                <p>On the death of Maximilian in 1519, Francis became a .candidate for the imperial
                    crown; but chiefly through the recommendation of Frederick the Wise of Saxony
                    the choice fell on Charles I. of Spain, from that time known as Charles V. The
                    success of Charles was prophetic of the relative positions which the two rivals
                    were thenceforth to occupy, for the resolute and persevering ambition of the
                    emperor, and his hitherto wholly unsuspected abilities both in war and in
                    diplomacy, were to prove themselves more than a match for the headstrong valour
                    and showy accomplishments of the French monarch. War between them could scarcely
                    have been avoided, even if the materials for kindling it had not been already
                    prepared; but inherited disputes in regard to Navarre, Milan, Burgundy, and
                    Arles would in any case have sooner or later rendered an appeal to the decision
                    of the sword almost inevitable. With a view to such possibilities, the great aim
                    of both was to secure the alliance of Henry of England and the pope, and here
                    fortune again ultimately smiled on Charles. Francis, elated by his previous
                    achievements on the battlefield, and chagrined at the overthrow of his hopes of
                    obtaining the imperial crown, was naturally eager to strike the first blow; and
                    the request of Henry IT. of Navarre to aid him in regaining his kingdom came
                    opportunely to second his wishes. Accordingly, in April 1521 he sent an army to
                    the aid of Henry. Charles at once retaliated by an invasion of France, and in
                    May concluded a treaty with Pope Leo X. for the expulsion of the French from
                    Italy. Navarre after beingalmost won was again lost by Henry; and in Italy the
                    French, chiefly through the blunders of Lautrec, the brother of the king’s
                    mistress, lost Milan, Genoa, and all their conquests with the exception of the
                    stronghold of Cremona; but the attempt of the imperialists to enter France was
                    pushed back, and Francis, following in pursuit, only by unaccountable negligence
                    missed the opportunity of inflicting a crushing defeat on Charles between
                    Cambray and Valenciennes. After this, difficulties continued to thicken round
                    the French king; on the 9th January 1522 the papal throne was mounted by Adrian
                    VI., who had formerly been tutor to Charles V., and in May Henry VIII. declared
                    war against France; in August 1523 a coalition was formed against her which
                    included the pope, the emperor, the king of England, the archduke of Austria,
                    the duke of Milan, and the principal Italian republics; and about the same time
                    Charles Constable Bourbon, having been unjustly used by Louise of Savoy,
                    withdrew from France, and offered his sword to Charles V. The Spanish troops
                    crossed the French frontiers at Bayonne; the English entered Picardy, and
                    advanced to within 11 leagues of Paris; and after the repulse of the French army
                    despatched against Milan, the imperialists passed over into Provence and laid
                    siege to Marseilles. Through cautious but stubbornly defensive tactics, however,
                    both the Spanish and English incursions were foiled, and Francis was thus able
                    to advance to the relief of Marseilles with a large army. The imperialists did
                    not wait his approach; but, determined on retaliation, he crossed the Alps and
                    laid siege to Pavia, where a strong Italian force had taken refuge. Here he was
                    attacked, 24th February 1525, by a relieving army under Bourbon and Pescara. The
                    attack was unsuccessful; but, flushed with the victory which he believed already
                    in his grasp, he rashly left his impregnable position, and so blundered in his
                    manoeuvres as to render his overwhelming defeat inevitable. His army was
                    speedily either cut down or dispersed in flight, and he himself, after a
                    desperate attempt to rally, was made prisoner and conveyed by Charles to Madrid.
                    He only regained his liberty, 21st February 1526, by signing a treaty whereby he
                    ceded to Charles both Burgundy and Milan. Its stipulations were guaranteed by
                    the retention of his two sons in the emperor’s hands; but he nevertheless
                    resolved to disregard it, and in this he was supported by Pope Clement VII. and
                    also by Henry of England, whom jealousy and alarm at the emperor’s success had
                    induced to change sides. Though formal war was not declared, a French army was
                    despatched to Italy, but the supineness with which the campaign was prosecuted
                    enabled the imperialists to have it all their own way; and an army of
                    mercenaries under Bourbon, who perished in the assault, marching unopposed to
                    Rome, captured and sacked the city, and took the pope prisoner. On this Francis
                    and Henry at once declared war against the emperor; but the army sent into Italy
                    under Lautrec almost melted away before the walls of Naples; and Genoa, by
                    suddenly declaring for the emperor, completed the ruin of the French cause in
                    Italy. The pope soon thereafter saw it to be his interest to be reconciled with
                    Charles; and in August 1529, Charles andFrancis agreed to the treaty of
                    Cambray,by which Francis retained Burgundy and obtained by a ransom the release
                    of the French princes, but renounced his claims in Italy and ceded Artois and
                    Flanders to his rival. He also agreed to fulfil the promise entered into at
                    Madrid to marry Eleanor of Portugal, sister of Charles, ħis first wife having
                    died in 1524. During the years of peace that followed this treaty, Francis,
                    though he had encouraged the Smalkald League in Germany, persecuted with great
                    vigour the adherents of Protestantism in his own kingdom; but when war was again
                    declared, he issued an edict of toleration. The pretext for the renewal of the
                    war was the murder of the French ambassador by Duke Sforza of Milan in 1533, but
                    hostilities were delayed till 1535, when, emboldened by the weakened condition
                    of the emperor after his war against the Turks, Francis overran Savoy and took
                    possession of Turin. His advantages were, however, followed up with so little
                    energy that Charles, after driving the French out of Italy, began an invasion of
                    Provence; and his progress was only checked by the barbarous destruction of the
                    country before him by Anne of Montmorency.- Meantime Francis attacked Flanders,
                    and entered into an alliance with Sultan Soliman II., whose invasion of Hungary
                    induced Charles in 1538 to consent to the ten years’ truce of Nice. In 1540
                    Charles, while the guest of the French monarch, held out to him the hope of a
                    complete satisfaction of his wishes through the investiture of the duke of
                    Orleans with the duchy of Milan; but the promise, if definitely made, was never
                    fulfilled, and Francis, finding a favourable opportunity after the disastrous
                    issue of the emperor’s expedition against Algiers, renewed on a flimsy pretext
                    the war in 1542. An offensive alliance was formed with the Turks, the duke of
                    Cleves, and Denmark and Sweden; separate armies attacked at various points the
                    Spanish, Flemish, and Italian frontiers; and the united French and Turkish
                    forces captured and burned Nice. The monotony of the indecisive conflict was
                    relieved in April 1544 by a brilliant French victory at Ceresole, but the
                    success came <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0726-0691"/> too late to permit of its being followed up by an
                    advance into Italy; for in the July following, the emperor from Champagne and
                    the king of England from Picardy were marching to join their forces before the w
                    alls of Paris. The siege of Boulogne by the English gave Francis, however,
                    sufficient time to make a show of defence such as convinced Charles of the
                    doubtful nature of the enterprise; and without consulting the king of England he
                    sent to Francis from Crespy terms of peace, which were signed 17th September. By
                    this treaty France retained Burgundy and resigned its claims on Flanders,
                    Artois, and Naples, while the duchy of Milan was promised to the duke of Orleans
                    on his marrying one of the imperial princesses—an arrangement, however, which
                    his death in 1545 rendered nugatory. For some time afterwards the English king
                    continued the war in Picardy, but a treaty of peace was signed in June 1546. As
                    soon as peace was concluded with the emperor, the prosecution of the Protestants
                    in France was renewed, and in 1545 an edict was passed for the expulsion of the
                    Waldenses from Provence. The health of Francis had for several years been
                    completely undermined, and he succumbed to an acute attack of disease, 31st May
                    1547.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Francis were combined most of the faults and excellences which
                    have been specially prominent in the subsequent history of his country. He was
                    in a sense the creator of a new political and intellectual era. As regards
                    government, he was virtually the founder of the “ancient régime,” whose final
                    result and overthrow was the great Revolution; he gave its death blow to
                    feudalism; he deprived the <hi rend="italic">parlements</hi> of all independent
                    power; under the auspices of the minister Du Prat he confirmed and extended the
                    system of corruption in civil and ecclesiastical appointments; and he turned the
                    efforts of statesmanship away from the paths of constitutional progress, and
                    into those of military renown. His reign in its social and intellectual results
                    was more beneficial, for if he sanctioned by his example licentiousness of
                    manners, he at the same time gave a great impulse to refinement in taste and to
                    intellectual progress by fostering in his country the offshoots of the Italian
                    Renaissance. He founded in 1530 the college of France for the study of the three
                    languages; he was himself a writer of verses, and a special friend and
                    benefactor of artists and men of letters; and by the purchase of the great
                    masterpieces of Italian painting and sculptur'^., and in the magnificent
                    structures of Chamford, Azai-le-Redeau, Amboise, and Fontainebleau he left
                    behind him a permanent influence on French art. Compared with his great rival
                    Charles V., he was open, impulsive, and generous, but he was less actuated by
                    consistent principles; he was hopelessly inferior in diplomacy, and in sagacity
                    and comprehensiveness of purpose; he had perhaps equal abilities as a general,
                    but his occasional victories were more than counterbalanced by the results of
                    his own indolence and by the blunders of his subordinates; and while able to
                    defend France against all external attacks, he was compelled to content himself
                    with a place second to that of the emperor in the sphere of European
                    politics.</p>
