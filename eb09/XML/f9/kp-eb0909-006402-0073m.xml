                    (1753-1824), a Dutch poet, was of aristocratic extraction, and was born at
                    Zwolle, the capital of the province Overijssel, on the 7th of February 1753. It
                    has been said with truth that his whole life was a model of social, personal,
                    and literary good fortune; there has never lived a poet who enjoyed more
                    unbroken prosperity. This is the more noticeable, because of all the important
                    writers of Holland he is the one whose works are most full of melancholy and
                    despair. He was educated at the universities of Harderwijk and Leyden, and took
                    his degree at the latter in 1770. In 1772 he settled at his birthplace, and
                    married. In 1780, in his twenty-seventh year, he became burgomaster of Zwolle, a
                    post which he held for the remainder· of his life. He built a luxurious villa,
                    which he named Boschwijk, in the outskirts of the town, and here he lived in the
                    greatest comfort. His first important production was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Julia,</hi> in 1783, a novel written in emulation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther,</hi> and positively steeped in <hi rend="italic">Weltschmerz</hi> and
                    despair. This was followed in 1784 by the tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thirsa,</hi> the first of his dramatic poems. The next year was one of great
                    mark in Feith’s career: he published <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand and
                    Constantia,</hi> another Werther novel, and <hi rend="italic">The Patriots,</hi>
                    a tragedy. Both were very successful, and his poems were publicly crowned at
                    Leyden. He was now the most popular poet in Holland, and this fact, combined
                    with his burning patriotism, drew upon him the hatred of Bilderdijk. Other
                    writers attacked his morbid melancholy, and in 1786 the critic Baron van
                    Perponcher made a trenchant assault on him in a work on sentimentality. He was
                    accordingly silent for some time, but in 1791 lie printed a tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lady Johanna Cray;</hi> and in 1792 there appeared a portentous
                    didactic poem, <hi rend="italic">The Grave,</hi> in four cantos, which belongs
                    to the most tearful school of churchyard poetry. In 1793 and in 1795 he produced
                    his tragedies of <hi rend="italic">Ines de Castro</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mucius Cordus,</hi> the first taken from an episode in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >L·usiad,</hi> the second composed in honour of the Batavian republic. From 1796
                    to 1814 appeared five volumes of <hi rend="italic">Odes and Miscellaneous
                    Poems.</hi> In 1802 he published another didactic poem, <hi rend="italic">Old
                    Age,</hi> in six cantos, and in 1804 <hi rend="italic">Poems for Public
                    Worship.</hi> He died on the 6th of February 1824. The next year a statue of the
                    poet, the work of Gabriel, was erected in Zwolle, and an edition of his poetical
                    works issued in thirteen volumes. As one of the most prominent members of the
                    revival of Dutch letters, and as a fluent and careful verse-writer, Feith will
                    always be honourably remembered. His own age accounted him one of the greatest
                    of poets, but posterity has refused to endorse this judgment. His romantic
                    inspiration was borrowed from Germany, and he did not hesitate to imitate
                    Goethe, Wieland, and Novalis. It must be recollected, however, that these men
                    were his immediate contemporaries, and that he showed great alacrity and acumen
                    in perceiving the modern direction of their genius.</p>
