                    Wild-Fowl, and the like,—practically almost confined <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> at present to designate the otherwise nameless species which struts on
                    our dunghills, gathers round our barn-doors, or stocks our poultry yards—the
                    type of the genus <hi rend="italic">Gallus</hi> of ornithologists, of which four
                    well-marked species are known. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of these is the
                    Red Jungle-Fowl of the greater part of India, <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ferrugineus,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> called by many writers
                    <hi rend="italic">G. bankiva,—</hi> which is undoubtedly the parent stock of all
                    the domestic races (c∕. Darwin, <hi rend="italic">Animals and Plants under
                    Domestication,</hi> i. pp. 233-246). It inhabits Northern India from Sindh to
                    Burmah and Cochin China, as well as the Malay Peninsula and many of the islands
                    as far as Timor, besides the Philippines. It occurs on the Himalayas up to the
                    height of 4000 feet, and its southern limits in the west of India proper are,
                    according to Jerdon, found on the Raj-peepla hills to the south of the Nerbudda,
                    and in the east near the left bank of the Godavery, or perhaps even further, as
                    he had heard of its being killed at Cummum. This species greatly resembles in
                    plumage what is commonly known among poultry-fanciers as the “Black-breasted
                    Game” breed, and this is said to be especially the case with examples from the
                    Malay countries, between which and examples from India some differences are
                    observable—the latter having the plumage less red, the ear-lappets almost
                    invariably white, and slatecoloured legs, while in the former the ear-lappets
                    are crimson, like the comb and wattles, and the legs yellowish.</p>

                <p>If the Malayan birds be considered distinct, it is to them that the name <hi
                    rend="italic">G. bankiva</hi> properly applies. This species is said to be found
                    in lofty forests and in dense thickets, as well as in ordinary bamboo-jungles,
                    and when cultivated land is near its haunts, it may be seen in the fields after
                    the crops are cut in straggling parties of from 10 to 20. The crow to which the
                    cock gives utterance morning and evening is described as being just like that of
                    a Bantam, but never prolonged as in some domestic birds. The hen breeds from
                    January to July, according to the locality; and lays from 8 to 12 creamy-white
                    eggs, occasionally scraping together a few leaves or a little dry grass by way
                    of a nest. The so-called <hi rend="italic">G. giganteus,</hi> formerly taken by
                    some ornithologists for a distinct species, is now regarded as a tame breed of
                    <hi rend="italic">G. ferrugineus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bankiva.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> good species is the Grey Jungle-Fowl, <hi
                    rend="italic">G. sonnerati,</hi> whose range begins a little to the northward of
                    the limits of the preceding, and it occupies the southern part of the Indian
                    peninsula, without being found elsewhere. Tiιe cock has the shaft of the
                    neck-hackles dilated, forming a horny plate, the terminal portion of which is
                    like a drop of yellow sealing-wax. His call is said to be very peculiar, being a
                    broken and imperfect kind of crow, quite unlike that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >G.</hi><hi rend="italic">ferrugineus,</hi> and impossible, says Jerdon, to
                    describe. The two species, where their respective ranges overlap, occasionally
                    interbreed in a wild state, and the present readily crosses in confinement with
                    domestic poultry, but the hybrids are nearly always sterile. The <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> species is the Cingalese Jungle-Fowl, <hi rend="italic"
                    >G. stanleyi</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">G. lafayettiioî</hi> some authors),
                    peculiar to Ceylon. This also greatly resembles in plumage some domestic birds,
                    but the cock is red beneath, and has a yellow comb with a red edge, and
                    purplish-red cheeks and wattles. He has also a singularly different voice, his
                    crow being dissyllabic. This bird crosses readily with tame hens, but the
                    hybrids are believed to be infertile. The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> species,
                    <hi rend="italic">G. varius</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">G.farcatus</hi> of some
                    authors), inhabits Java and the islands eastwards as far as Flores. This differs
                    remarkably from the others in not possessing hackles, and in having a large
                    unserrated comb of red and blue, and only a single chin wattle. The predominance
                    of green in its plumage is another easy mark of distinction. Hybrids between
                    this species and domestic birds are often produced, but they are most commonly
                    sterile. Some of them have been mistaken for distinct species, as those which
                    have received the names of <hi rend="italic">G. aeneus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">G. temmincki.</hi></p>
                <p>Several circumstances seem to render it likely that Fowls were first domesticated
                    in Burmah or the countries adjacent thereto, and it is the tradition of the
                    Chinese that they received their poultry from the West about the year 1400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> By the Institutes of Manu, the date of which is
                    variously assigned from 1200 to 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the tame
                    Fowl is forbidden, though the wild is allowed to be eaten—showing that its
                    domestication was accomplished when they were written. The bird is not mentioned
                    in the Old Testament nor by Homer, though he has Αλeκτωp (Cock) as the name of a
                    man, nor is it figured on ancient Egyptian monuments. Pindar mentions it, and
                    Aristophanes calls it the Persian bird, thus indicating it to have been
                    introduced to Greece through Persia, and it is figured on Babylonian cylinders
                    between the 6th and 7th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is
                    sculptured on the Lycian marbles in the British Museum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(circa</hi> 600 B.C.), and Blyth remarks <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1867, p.
                    157) that it is there represented with the appearance of a true Jungle-Fowl, for
                    none of the wild <hi rend="italic">Galli</hi> have the upright bearing of the
                    tame breed, but carry their tail in a drooping position. For further particulars
                    of these breeds see <hi rend="smallcaps">Poultry, (a. n.)</hi></p>
