                    born on the 18th May 1756 at the village of Zurâny in the county of Moson. His
                    mother, who was a pious Roman Catholic, made every effort to secure for him a
                    strict religious education. On the 9th July 1773 he joined the order of
                    Capuchins as a novice, and in the following year he took the monastic vows,
                    assuming the name of Innocentius. After living in disagreement with his
                    superiors in different monasteries he was transferred to the Capuchin house at
                    Vienna; and while there, by means of a private letter, he drew the attention of
                    the emperor Joseph II. to the irregularities of the monasteries. The searching
                    investigation which followed raised up against him many implacable enemies.
                    Released from the monastery by an imperial decree, he was in 1784 appointed
                    professor of Oriental languages and hermeneutics in the university of Lemberg.
                    In 1787 he brought out his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Sidney,</hi> which his
                    enemies attacked so violently as profane and revolutionary that they compelled
                    him to resign his office and seek refuge in Silesia. In Breslau he met with a
                    cordial reception from Korn the publisher, and was, moreover, subsequently
                    employed by the prince of Carolath as tutor to his sons. In 1791 Fessler was
                    converted to Protestantism, and in 1796 he went to Berlin, where he founded a
                    humanitarian society, and was commissioned by the freemasons of that city to
                    assist Fichte in reforming the statutes and ritual of their lodge. He soon after
                    this obtained a Government appointment in connexion with the newly-acquired
                    Polish provinces, but in consequence of the battle of Jena (1806) he lost this
                    office, and remained in very needy circumstances until 1809, when he was
                    summoned to St Petersburg by Alexander I., to fill the post of court councillor,
                    and the professorship of Oriental languages and philosophy at the
                    Alexander-Newski Academy. This office, however, he was soon obliged to resign,
                    owing to his alleged atheistic tendencies, but he was subsequently nominated a
                    member of the legislative commission In 1815 lie was deprived of his salary, but
                    it was restored to him in 1817. In November 1819 he was appointed consistorial
                    president of the Protestant communities at Saratov, and subsequently became
                    chief superintendent of the Lutheran communities in St Petersburg. Fessler’s
                    numerous works are all written in German. In recognition of his important
                    services to Hungary as a historian, he was in 1831 elected a corresponding
                    member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He died at St Petersburg, December
                    15, 1839, in the 84th year of his age. His most important works are <hi
