                <p><label type="entry">FOUNDING</label>, the art of reproducing solid objects in
                    metal or other fusible substances by pouring the melted substance into moulds.
                    It is also known as <hi rend="italic">casting,</hi> and objects so produced are
                    said to be of cast metal. Works where founding or casting is carried on are
                    termed foundries, and their proprietors founders. The verb to found is not,
                    however, in current use, being almost entirely replaced by cast. The root of the
                    word is the Latin <hi rend="italic">fundus.</hi></p>
                <p>Three principal operations are involved in founding :— (1) moulding, or the
                    production of a hollow mould to receive the melted metal; (2) melting, or
                    running down the metal; and (3) pouring, or filling the mould with the liquid
                    metal. The preparation of the original object or pattern from which the mould is
                    made is not strictly part of foundry work proper, the founder receiving the
                    pattern prepared in wood from the original drawings from the engineer’s
                    patternmaker, except in those cases where no pattern is required, and the model
                    is built up on the foundry floor by the moulder by the use of revolving
                    templates, dividing engines, or other contrivances.</p>
                <p>The metals best suited for foundry work are those that possess the property of
                    increasing in volume at the moment of passage from the liquid to the solid state
                    so that its particles may be pressed into and fill up the finest cavities of the
                    mould in setting. This property is best developed in bismuth, the alloys of
                    copper with tin and zinc (bronze and brass), and cast iron. Lead does not take a
                    sharp impression unless alloyed with tin or antimony, as in type metal. Copper
                    also does not give sound castings.</p>
                <p>Patterns for moulding require to be made somewhat larger than the cast required,
                    the difference being determined by the linear dilatation of the metal between
                    the ordinary temperature and that at the moment of solidification. This varies
                    for different metals; for cast iron it is about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛j
                    for hard bronze, <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> j
                    soft bronze, <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ¾j; brass, <hi rend="subscript">

                    rend="subscript"> s</hi>-. Patterns for iron founders are therefore made larger
                    than the finished size required in the proportion of one-eighth of an inch to
                    the foot in their linear measurement, an allowance known as “shrinkage”—the
                    patternmaker’s rule being longer by that quantity than the ordinary engineer’s
                    rule. Patterns are usually made of wood, except when the object is intended to
                    be reproduced in great numbers, when brass or iron ones are often used. The more
                    easily fusible alloys, such as pewter, type metal, Britannia metal, &amp;e., are
                    cast in metallic (iron or brass) moulds, which are used indefinitely; but with
                    metals having a higher melting point, a separate mould is required for each
                    cast, metal moulds <pb break="no"

                    ingots or masses that are brought to shape by other means, or when a special
                    quality of surface is required, as in chill casting.</p>
                <p>In most cases castings are hollow, the thickness being determined by the empty
                    space included between the mould proper which represents the external surface of
                    the object, and a false mould or core, which may also reproduce a finished
                    surface, as in cylinders, pipes, &amp;c., or be rough and uneven, as in statuary
                    castings, where only the external surface is exposed. The material generally
                    used in moulding from patterns is fine sand, either “green,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> slightly damp, or dry, that is, dried by artificial heat—the first
                    method being adopted for all castings of moderate size and weight, while dry
                    sand mouldings are chiefly used for heavy castings where great solidity and
                    strength are required.</p>
                <p>The principal requisites of a good foundry sand are fine and uniform grain, a
                    certain amount of cohesiveness without being sticky, infusibility at the
                    temperature of the metal poured, and freedom from combustible or other
                    substances giving off gases when heated. These are best fulfilled by a nearly
                    pure quality’of siliceous sand, with at most 3 or 4 per cent, of clay and a
                    slight proportion of hydrated peroxide of iron; the particles when moulded
                    should allow free passage for gases to escape, while perfectly impermeable to
                    the melted metal. Good foundry sands are easily procured in most parts of the
                    United Kingdom, the best being those obtained from reconstructed sandstones in
                    the alluvia of the Thames and other large rivers, and the drift of the New Red
                    Sandstone districts of central England. In other countries not so well provided,
                    foundry sands are often imported or brought from considerable distances
                    inland.</p>
                <p>The same sand is used continuously,—the moulds after use being emptied into a pit
                    in the foundry floor, whence the supply for new moulds is taken as required.
                    Fresh sand is added from time to time to make up the waste and to maintain the
                    required plasticity, which diminishes by constant heating. A proportion of
                    ground coal or charcoal is mixed with the sand, so that, although the latter is
                    actually red or brown when fresh, it is reduced to a dark grey or black in the
                    foundry.</p>
                <p>The sand forming the mould is held together by an outer frame or box called a
                    flask, as many flasks being used as there are separate parts in the mould. These
                    are united by lugs and cotters, the top one being sometimes loaded when the
                    object is large to prevent it moving under the pressure of the fluid metal. A
                    proper division of the mould is one of the chief points to be attended to in
                    foundry work; where the object is divisible by a central plane into two equal
                    and similar halves, two flasks are usually sufficient; but in complex and
                    irregular forms three, four, or even a larger number are required, its divisions
                    being so arranged that no portion of the pattern overhangs within any section,
                    so that it may be withdrawn by a straight pull without shaking the sand.</p>
                <p>The ordinary operation of moulding is as follows. A flask laid with its lugs
                    uppermost is rammed up with old sand to a smooth surface. In this the lower half
                    of the pattern is imbedded, and the surface is covered with dry or facing sand
                    to prevent adhesion. Upon this a second flask is placed, and sand is carefully
                    rammed upon the pattern until the box is completely filled, when the whole is
                    turned over, and the first or false part is emptied, the surface of the upper
                    half smoothed down or faced with sand or finely ground coal or charcoal, and a
                    runner stick, which forms the passage or ingate for the metal, inserted. The
                    second half is then similarly moulded in a second flask, and when finished the
                    upper box is lifted by a crane, leaving the pattern in the lower one or <hi
                    rend="italic">drag,</hi> from which it is lifted by spikes or rods screwed on
                    temporarily, a slight vibrating motion being set up by striking it rapidly with
                    a piece of wood or iron in order to start it more easily. This is an operation
                    of some nicety, as the blows must be moderate so as not to risk injury to the
                    sand. Provision is made for the exit of gases by piercing vent holes through the
                    sand by a fine wire during ramming. The surface of the mould is finished by
                    dusting it over with charcoal or graphite.</p>
                <p>In moulding railway chairs and similar objects of an irregular form required in
                    great numbers, metal patterns are used with loose pieces united by spikes and
                    dove-tails for the overhanging parts, such as the inner faces of the jaws,—the
                    joints being so arranged that the straight parts of the pattern may be
                    withdrawn, leaving the loose parts behind in the mould, whence they are
                    afterwards removed by hand. Fig. 1 represents in section an arrangement of this
                    kind, as applied to moulding railway chairs. The right hand figure shows the
                    pattern in place with the sand rammed, and the left the mould with the pattern D
                    withdrawn, the loose jaws or “core prints” <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi>
                    remaining in the sand, but in such a position as to be easily removed when the
                    flask is turned over. The pattern is withdrawn by a straight pull on the handle
                    H. The stop P gives support to the cores, &amp;c., which represent the trenail
                    holes in the finished casting (fig. 2), and prevent them being dragged away with
                    the pattern, as they might be if left unsupported. The regular descent of the
                    pattern is ensured by the deep sides A and the guides they move in.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0512-0481"/>
                <p>Usually four patterns are fixed upon one table, so that four chairs are moulded
                    at one operation, the withdrawal of the pattern being effected by lowering the
                    table by a hydraulic press or other mechanical arrangement. The lower mould
                    forming the base of the chair is a nearly flat plate moulded in another
                    machine.</p>
                <p>In loam moulding, as used for large pipes or cylinders, a hollow core of iron or
                    brick is placed in the centre of the foundry, and around it a layer of loam,
                    that is, a mixture of sand and clay rendered plastic by mixture with water, is
                    laid on 'by trowels and finished up by a revolving template working round a
                    central vertical spindle to the dimension of the interior, forming the “nowel”
                    or core, which when dried is washed with finely ground charcoal and water. Upon
                    this a loam pattern is made up by another template representing the outer
                    surface of the cylinder to the thickness of the finished work. This in like
                    manner is dried and black-washed, and finally a shell of brickwork is built
                    outside, leaving a few inches space between it and the second moulded surface,
                    which is carefully filled up with loam, and forms the “cope” or mould proper.
                    This when dried is lifted by a crane, and either separates from the pattern or
                    “thickness” or drags it away with it, but in either case the latter is broken
                    away, and when the cope is replaced the mould is ready for use as soon as the
                    necessary air-vents, ingates, runner passages, &lt;fcc., have been provided. In
                    many large foundries, however, gas and water pipes of large size are now
                    produced from permanent moulds of cast iron faced with a thin layer of sand or
                    loam; the outer moulds, being divided into two parts, are brought up to the work
                    and removed by trucks running upon railways.</p>
                <p>The method of moulding for bell-founding and statuary is generally similar in
                    principle to that of a loam moulding, with this difference, that the thickness
                    representing the finished object is made up not of loam but of wax, and in the
                    case of statuary, where the object is to use as little metal as possible, it is
                    usually very thin. A plaster cast divided into sections, taken from the original
                    work, forms the matrix within which the wax is moulded of the proper thickness,
                    the inside core being formed of clay with some metal bars to give support, when
                    the work is large. When the plaster mould is removed, the waxen surface is
                    finished up by the sculptor, and the outer mantle or mould proper is formed by
                    coating it with a porous clay mixture. This when dried is carefully baked or
                    burned in a furnace, and the wax melting at the same time leaves the hollow to
                    receive the metal. It is sometimes necessary to leave holes in the casting to
                    allow of the withdrawal of the surface; these are afterwards stopped with plugs
                    of the same metal. Great care is required in the placing of the ingates and
                    runners so as to allow the mould to be regularly and rapidly filled, and prevent
                    any part of the metal setting or chilling before the proper moment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Melting.—</hi> This may be effected either with or without
                    contact with the fuel. In the former case the metal is charged alternately with
                    coke, and occasionally a little flux, into a cylindrical or slightly conical
                    blast furnace known as a cupola, and accumulates in a hollow or sump at the
                    bottom below the tuyeres or blast pipes, whence it is tapped out from time to
                    time, either directly into the mould or more generally into a ladle, for
                    couveyance to the moulds arranged upon the foundry floor. In the second case the
                    fusion takes place either upon the bed of a reverberatory furnace or in
                    crucibles in air furnaces heated by coke or by gaseous fuel. Of these methods
                    the first or cupola is only fitted for iron foundiug, the reverberatory furnace
                    is used for bronze and iron, and in special forms for steel; while crucible
                    melting is most general for brass and bronze small castings, as well as for the
                    finer kinds of steel, or generally for any metal that is likely to be altered by
                    direct contact with the fuel. The description of these appliances belongs more
                    properly to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Furnace.</hi> The founder’s ladle
                    or “shank” is a bucket or cup-shaped vessel of wrought iron lined with a shell
                    of fire-clay, with a lip for pouring, having two projecting handles. One of
                    these is straight and serves as a pivot; the other with a cross bar called a
                    crutch is used as a tipping handle when pouring. When of small size the filled
                    ladle can be carried from the cupola to the work and poured by two men, but when
                    of large size containing several tons of metal they are slung from a crane and
                    tipped by a tangent screw and worm wheel, manipulated by a man standing at a
                    distance. The perfection of ladle arrangement is to be seen in Bessemer’s
                    process of steel making, where several tons of melted steel are distributed into
                    a ring of ingot moulds in a circular pit by two or three men in a very few
                    minutes. In Krupp’s arrangements for making large steel castings from crucibles
                    an intermediate or equalizing ladle is used. The crucibles, which contain about
                    70 δ) each, are drawn from the furnaces in regular order, and poured in such a
                    manner that an uninterrupted stream of metal is kept up from the ladle to the
                    mould.</p>
                <p>Large castings when filled from above are liable to be spongy or unsound in the
                    upper part of the mould, or that last filled. In such cases an extra length is
                    given at the top of the mould, as the unsound portion or dead-head is afterwards
                    removed. This plan is usually followed in casting bronze guns. Sound and dense
                    castings can be obtained by filling with a vertical side runner, so that the
                    metal enters the mould from below and solidifies under the hydrostatic head
                    represented by the vertical height of the runner. A method employed by Sir
                    Joseph Whitworth, of applying hydraulic pressure to the metal in the mould until
                    it solidifies, has been adopted with great success by the inventor in the
                    prevention of blow holes and similar imperfections in steel ingots.</p>
                <p>In “chill casting” a portion of the surface of the whole or a part of the mould
                    is made of cast iron, so that the metal brought in contact with it is rapidly
                    cooled. It is adopted in the production of Palliser’s cast irou projectiles for
                    penetrating armour plates, rolls for boiler and other iron plates, and paper
                    glazing, and in America for hardening the treads of railway wheels. The iron
                    where in contact with the chill surface becomes white, of a platy crystalline
                    structure, and intensely hard, while such portions as are cooled in contact with
                    the sand remain finely granular, dark grey, and comparatively soft. <hi
