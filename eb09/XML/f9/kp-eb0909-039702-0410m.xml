                <p><label type="entry">FORESTS, FOREST ADMINISTRATION</label>. A forest is a tract
                    of country covered with trees, of one or several species, or with trees and
                    underwood. Forests are of the greatest importance in the general economy of the
                    globe, influencing the humidity of the air and the soil, mitigating the extremes
                    of heat and cold, affording shelter to man and beast, and enriching the soil on
                    which they grow. Trees supply timber and fuel to man, and furnish him w ith a
                    vast variety of economical products, such as gums, drugs, dyes, and articles of
                    food. The management of large areas of natural or planted wood-lands is
                    called</p>
                <p>Forestry or Sylviculture. For the culture and uses of individual trees, see the
                    separate articles, such as <hi rend="smallcaps">Birch, Elm, Fir, Oak,</hi>
                    &lt;tc.; and for ornamental belts, avenues, &amp;c., the reader is referred to
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Arboriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>Historical records give us reason to believe that the habitable earth was
                    generally covered with forest growth before it became the abode of man, and
                    additional proof of this is found in the extensive remains of ancient trees. The
                    geological record may also be referred to, as evidencing by its coal-fields the
                    extensive breadths once covered by the richest vegetation.</p>
                <p>The arboreous vegetation of the earth is remarkable for its great variety: many
                    countries are rich in pines, others in oaks; Australia in Eucalyptus or gum
                    trees, India in teak, California in Wellingtonia or Sequoia, and Brazil in
                    palms. Trees, like other plants, require different degrees of heat, light,
                    moisture, and elevation above the sea for their vigorous development, and hence
                    various countries have their characteristic forests. The birches and pines of
                    the North make way in the temperate zone for oaks and beeches, and in the
                    tropics for palms and other heat-loving trees. The same trees seem to require
                    similar climates, but the same climates do not always produce the same plants.
                    The mountains of South India and Ceylon closely resemble the regions where the
                    cinchona forests occur, but the genus is wanting in Asia. Again the teak is
                    unknown in America, although parts of Brazil resemble its home in Malabar. These
                    anomalies are explained perhaps mainly by the primitive distribution of the
                    plants (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Distribution).</hi> It is also remarkable that
                    some forests consist solely of one particular tree (on the Continent technically
                    called “pure forest,” in contradistinction to mixed forests), such as the birch
                    in Lapland, the deodar in the Himalaya, the <hi rend="italic">Abies
                    canadensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Strobus</hi>
                    in North America. The European forests, on the contrary, are generally composed
                    of coniferous trees mingled with oak, elm, ash, beech, poplar, willow, alder,
                    birch, and lime, interspersed with hornbeam, and various species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prunus,</hi> the underwood being
                    hazel, elder, buckthorn, viburnum, roses, &amp;c. The American forests contain a
                    still greater variety of species, a fact strikingly illustrated by Sir J. D.
                    Hooker, in speaking of a patch of native forest a few miles from St Louis on the
                    Missouri :—“In little more than half an hour, and less than a mile’s walk, I saw
                    forty kinds of timber trees, including eleven of oak, two of maple, two of elm,
                    three of ash, two of walnut, six of hickory, three of willow, and one each of
                    plane, lime, hornbeam, hop-hornbeam, laurus, diospyros, poplar, birch, mulberry,
                    and horse-chestnut, together with about half that number of shrubs.”</p>
                <p>Natural forests may be divided into several classes, and in Kurz’s forest flora
                    of British Burmah the classification adopted is as follows :—</p>

                <p>The discrepancies observable in these tables are in some cases apparent; thus the
                    latest returns from Russia, Sweden, Norway, &lt;fcc., are exclusive of sheets of
                    water, whereas in the same returns the area of France, Italy, and Switzerland
                    includes the lakes and rivers. Great Britain also now includes the Isle of Man
                    and Channel Islands. In other cases the discrepancies are real, arising from the
                    greater accuracy of information which has been collected through Government
                    organizations, which did not exist when the estimate of Rentzsch was made. An
                    entire comparison is unattainable, but it will be observed that the largest
                    proportion of woodland is in Russia, Sweden, Germany, and Austria. The lowest
                    occurs in Britain, Denmark, Holland, Spain, and Portugal</p>
                <p>The physical history of every country proves incontestably that a moderate extent
                    of forest promotes in a high degree both its agricultural and its manufacturing
                    interests, as well as the productive resources of the country at large; and the
                    beneficial influence of forests in a physical, economical, and hygienic aspect
                    is now receiving more of the attention its importance deserves. The countries
                    bordering the Mediterranean—Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey—have all suffered
                    in a marked degree from the reckless and wholesale destruction of tho woods
                    which covered the mountain slopes, and many springs which formerly existed under
                    the shelter of the forest have now wholly disappeared. Though the insular
                    position and moist climate of the British Isles save them from suffering from
                    the want of forest in an equal degree with Continental nations, the Anglo-Saxon
                    race has been slow to apprehend the value of the forests with which nature has
                    so liberally clothed the earth, and the history of North America, South Africa,
                    Australia, and New Zealand bears testimony to the same improvidence and need of
                    consideration. There can be no doubt that one of the causes of the terrible
                    famines in India and China is the unwise denudation of mountain slopes, where
                    the forests formerly absorbed a large portion of the rainfall which now quickly
                    runs off to the sea (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Climate). No</hi> point has been
                    more clearly established than the salubrious and fertilizing effect of forest
                    clothing in the climate of India. It has been the subject of much inquiry, and
                    has been affirmed and demonstrated in reports from many districts.</p>
                <p>We propose in this article to indicate briefly the principal wooded tracts of the
                    earth, so far as known, and to describe the systems of conservancy adopted or
                    the preliminary measures taken for the better management of state forests.
                    Timber trees and forest produce will be briefly enumerated, but for the
                    distinctive flora the reader is referred to the separate article on each
                    country.</p>
                <p>Forest science constitutes a separate branch of education in various countries of
                    Europe. The first technical instruction was given in the Hartz forest, and
                    Germany has taken the lead in developing a wise forest administration. France,
                    Italy, Sweden, and Russia have successively established forest academies, and
                    now the conservation of woodland occupies the legislature of almost all
                    civilized lands.</p>
                <p>The general systems of forest management in Britain and on the Continent are
                    essentially different. Beautiful enclosures and plantations are seen in almost
                    every part of England and Scotland. With the exception, however, of coppice wood
                    and a limited extent of natural forest in the Highlands of Scotland, the system
                    generally followed is to cut down the mature crop and to plant again. But on the
                    Continent natural reproduction is the rule, not of wood coppice only, but also
                    of high forest. In France the term of maturity for cutting a forest is
                    determined with great care by a committee of skilled officers, and is usually
                    divided into periods of so many years each; the term for an oak forest, for
                    example, say 1Õ0 years, is divided into five periods of thirty years. Each
                    series of years represents so many blocks or portions of forest, and the yearly
                    cuttings are arranged so as to cover a certain extent of ground, and when one
                    block has been felled another reaches maturity. France has a state department
                    for the administration of the forests, and a very detailed code of forest laws
                    <hi rend="italic">(Code Forestier).</hi> The relation of woods to the regular
                    drainage of the soil, and especially to the permanence of the configuration of
                    the terrestrial surface has been thoroughly investigated. The methods of
                    resisting the encroachment of sands or dunes have also received special
                    attention. In Germany forestry is eagerly followed as a profession, and forest
                    academies are numerous and well organized. The examination of candidates is very
                    strict, and the result of the system has been most beneficial. In forest science
                    Germany is far advanced, and the literature is specially rich. Every tract is
                    carefully surveyed and treated on a working plan made with great exactness as to
                    actual details and expected growth; care is always taken that in high forest
                    there is a good stock of self-sown trees before the old crop is entirely
                    removed. Systematic observation and experiments are made as to the rate of
                    growth, and the best soil for each description of tree.</p>
                <p>In Italy, where the French and German systems have been tested, the principles of
                    sylviculture adopted by Hartig, Cotta, &amp;c., are not always applicable in the
                    drier climate of the south. On the arid slopes of the Apennines pasture is more
                    profitable, and there is as yet little sympathy with skilled conservation of
                    woods <hi rend="smallcaps">Europe.</hi><hi rend="italic">Great Britain and
                    Ireland.—</hi> The British Isles were formerly much more extensively wooded than
                    at present. The rapid increase of population has led to the disafforesting of
                    woodland; the climate requires the maintenance of household fires during a great
                    part of the year, and there has been an increasing demand for arable land; these
                    along with the extension of manufacturing industries have been the chief causes
                    of the diminution of wood. The proportion of forest is now very small, and
                    yields but a fraction of the required annual supply of timber which is imported

                    the numerous British colonies.</p>
                <p>Owing to the nature of the climate of the British Islands, with its abundance of
                    atmospheric moisture and freedom from such extremes of heat and cold as are
                    prevalent in continental Europe, a great variety of trees are successfully
                    cultivated. In England and Ireland oak and beech are on the whole the most
                    plentiful trees in the low and fertile parts; in the south of Scotland the beech
                    and ash are perhaps most common, while the Scotch fir and birch are
                    characteristic of the arboreous vegetation in the Highlands. Although few
                    extensive forests now exist, woods of small area, belts of planting, clumps of
                    trees, coppice, and hedgerows are generally distributed over the country,
                    constituting a mass of wood of considerable importance, giving a clothed
                    appearance in many parts, and affording illustrations of skilled arboriculture
                    not to be found in any other country.</p>
                <p>The principal state forests in England are Windsor Park, 14,000 acres, the New
                    Forest, &amp;c., in Hampshire, 76,000 acres, and the Dean Forest in
                    Gloucestershire, 22,500 acres. The total extent of crown forests is about
                    125,000 acres, and the timber growing upon them is valued at between two and
                    three millions of pounds. A large proportion of the crown forests, having been
                    formed with the object of supplying timber for the navy, consists of fine oak,
                    These wooded tracts are under careful management. The total receipts from the
                    royal forests exclusive of Windsor amounted in 1876-77 to £33,129. The largest
                    forests in Scotland are in Perthshire, Inverness-shire, and Aberdeenshire. Of
                    these the most notable are the earl of Mansfield’s near Scone (8000 acres), the
                    duke of AtholΓs larch plantations near Dunkeld (10,000 acres), and in Strathspey
                    a large extent of Scotch fir, partly native, partly planted, belonging to the
                    earl of Seafield. The last-named forest has been regularly planted in such a
                    gradation as to cut 1000 acres annually on a rotation of sixty years. In the
                    forests of Mar and Invercauld, the native pine attains a very great size, and
                    there are also large tracts of indigenous birch in various districts. The total
                    area under wood in Scotland is less than it was in 1812 by 200,000 acres.
                    Ireland was at one time richly clothed with wood; this is proved by the abundant
                    remains of fallen trees in the bogs which still occupy a large surface of the
                    island. In addition to the causes above alluded to as tending to disafforest
                    England, the long unsettled state of the country also conduced to the
                    diminishing of the woodlands. At present indigenous timber is exceedingly
                    scarce, the proportion of woodland being only 1’62. The abundance of peat
                    compensates in some measure for the want of wood as fuel.</p>

                <p>in England, the woods, except the crown forests, being generally on a small scale
                    and private property, there has been no legislative interference with their
                    management. No uniform system of education has been adopted, and a school of
                    forestry is much required. Meanwhile the Highland and Agricultural Society of
                    Scotland grants certificates for proficiency in the theory and practice of
                    forestry tested by examination. Excellent instruction in surveying, botany,
                    chemistry, geology, and collateral subjects is given in Edinburgh, at the Royal
                    Agricultural College, Cirencester, at Glasnevin, Dublin, and in other
                    places.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Norway and Sweden.—</hi> The peninsula formed by the kingdoms
                    of Norway and Sweden is abundantly wooded. The principal trees are Scotch fir
                    <hi rend="italic">(Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvestris),</hi> spruce fir <hi
                    rend="italic">(Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa),</hi> and birch <hi
                    rend="italic">(Betula</hi><hi rend="italic">alba).</hi> These grow to a large
                    size, and the birch extends almost as far as the North Cape, only giving place
                    at high altitudes to low, bushy willows. In the southern districts only is there
                    any variety of hardwood. The forests are principally situated in the east of
                    Norway. The western parts have been denuded, and the wants of the sea-coast are
                    supplied from the inland districts.</p>
                <p>Of the vast area of waste land returned as forest in Norway, about one-ninth
                    belongs to the state or to various state institutions. In the greater part of
                    the forests the population have a long established right for grazing, timber,
                    and firewood; and even in tracts in which landowners or the state have a part
                    ownership, the rights of the population, if they have any, take precedence of
                    all other claims. Communal forests are managed by men chosen from among those
                    who jointly own them. From the 16th century various laws attempted to regulate
                    the private forests, but these were found vexatious, and were repealed in 1836.
                    The forest department for the control of state forests consists of 27 officers,
                    with a very large staff of men employed in felling and timber transport. The
                    export of timber from Norway is chiefly from the Skeen Fiord, and the various
                    ports between Cape Lindesnaes and the Swedish border. The annual export amounts
                    to about 80,000,000 cubic feet, more than half being sent to Great Britain and
                    Ireland, while the average annual value is estimated at £2,400,000. Some idea of
                    the great timber resources of Norway may also be gathered from the fact that in
                    the census of 1865 there were 4937 men entered as working in the forests, and
                    17,549 described themselves as employed in woodwork, saw-mills, tar-preparing,
                    &amp;c. In a Norwegian administration report it is stated that “the present
                    destruction of forests has reached the limit of the permissible, probably even
                    exceeded it.”</p>
                <p>Of the 100,500,000 acres in the kingdom of Sweden, 88,800,000 were officially
                    reported in 1875 as forest waste land, 12 millions being public, and 76 millions
                    private property. Only about half of this, however, is really covered with wood,
                    including plantations formed in recent years. Of the public foιests only 4
                    million acres are under direct state management; about an equal aiea remains to
                    be demarcated, while the rest belongs to other public insti tutions, is attached
                    to state residences, or is temporarily alienated. The trees in Sweden are the
                    same as those of Norway, but oak, elm, lime, alder, and beech grow more
                    extensively in the south. Birch-wood is chiefly used as fuel, and the wood of
                    the aspen is largely employed in the manufacture of matches.</p>
                <p>Forest management in Sweden is in course of progressive development, and the
                    administration is conducted with energy. The department consists of a director
                    and 700 men of different administrative and executive grades. Much labour is
                    required to bring the timber to market from remote forests in the western part
                    of the kingdom; in winter sledges on ice and snow are used for transport, and in
                    floating down the rivers logs often take four and five years to reach the timber
                    depot. Besides the control of the state and other public forests, the department
                    is entrusted with the surveillance of private forests.</p>
                <p>In 1875 the total revenue of the state forests was £56,807. The actual
                    expenditure was £35,787. The profits were therefore £21,020. The shipments of
                    timber are annually increasing, and were in 1874 325,061 loads, and 704,741
                    standards. A Government forest school at Stockholm, which in 1875 had 13
                    students, supplies recruits for the higher grades of forest service, while there
                    are six provincial schools for training men for the subordinate posts. Besides
                    these, there is a private forest school receiving a grant in aid from
                    Government.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Denmark</hi> is one of the most poorly wooded countries in
                    Europe, the percentage of woodland being now only 4'25 of the whole area. This
                    small proportion is caused chiefly by the nakedness of the western part of
                    Jutland, where the west winds have seconded the action of man in destroying the
                    forests. Much of the wood which at one time covered nearly the whole of Denmark
                    having been cut down, to make way for agriculture, and to supply fuel and
                    timber, a vast area thus bared has become a sandy heathy desert. The chief
                    indigenous trees of Denmark are the spruce and Scotch fir, birch, and aspen. The
                    oak also forms valuable forests on the islands of Falster and Lolland. Beech,
                    which was later introduced, has flourished so well as almost to monopolize the
                    forest ground, and special protection is afforded to the oak, while a variety of
                    conifers are being introduced as rivals to the beech; in a few places only, such
                    as Normandy and the Carpathian mountains, are beech forests so luxuriant as in
                    Denmark. Although laws to check the destruction of forests were enacted in the
                    15th, lβth, and 17th centuries, they were treated as a dead letter; it is only
                    since 1805 that effective measures have been taken to preserve the remains of
                    Danish woodland and to create new plantations. A state forest department permits
                    only small portions of old forests to be cleared at a time, and insists on the
                    simultaneous planting of an equal area. The department also exercises a
                    controlling supervision on private forests, forming plantations where necessary
                    on private Restates at the expense of the owner. About one-fifth of the entire
                    area of Denmark may be described as lying waste; some of this is unfit for the
                    growth of trees, hut already extensive plantations have been formed, on the
                    heaths and dunes of West Jutland, of hardy trees such as <hi rend="italic">Pinus
                    montana,</hi><hi rend="italic">Abies alba,</hi><hi rend="italic">A.
                    excelsa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. pectinata.</hi> In some instances, the
                    state purchases tracts of heath on which to form plantations, and in others
                    grants aid to private enterprise.</p>
                <p>The Danish forest school is at Copenhagen, and forms a branch of an agricultural
                    college. Admittance is obtained after passing an examination similar to that
                    required for matriculation at the university. The forest education requires four
                    examinations, and the subjects comprised are—(1) mathematics, geology, natural
                    philosophy, chemistry, zoology, botany, and drawing; (2) practical work, to
                    acquire a knowledge of which the student generally arranges to serve for a year
                    or two under a forest officer; (3) an oral examination in the principles of
                    forestry, surveying, geology, hydrology, forest zoology, and botany; and (4)
                    these principles applied practically, a tract of forest above 200 acres to be
                    surveyed, and levels found for a line of 3000 or 4000 feet. The course of study
                    extends from four to six years; the student then becomes a “forest candidate,”
                    and may look for Government employment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Holland,</hi> on account of its formation and climate,
                    possesses no indigenous forests. The country is so intersected by water that it
                    is extremely subject to fogs, and being little above the sea level it is greatly
                    exposed to winds, those from the north-west especially being prejudicial to tree
                    growth, while the marshy ground prevents the roots from penetrating far into the
                    soil. There is, however, along the roads and embankments, a considerable amount
                    of timber, consisting of beech, poplar, willow, and ash, which attain a large
                    size, and in the management of such avenues the Dutch excel. Elms also thrive on
                    the embankments. The extensive dunes, amounting to 140,000 acres, are planted
                    chiefly with hardy conifers (Marsh).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Belgium.—</hi> The physical features of Belgium are, except in
                    the northern part, very different from those of Holland. The chief forests are
                    in the districts of Brabant and Flanders, and the old forest of Ardennes still
                    extends along the south-eastern frontier. According to Siemoni, in 1872 Belgium
                    had 18 per cent, of her soil covered with wood. Recent returns give the area of
                    state forest in Belgium as nearly 75,000 acres, and of communal forests 300,000
                    acres, all being under Government control.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Germany</hi> is in general well wooded, the forests of Prussia
                    being estimated to cover 23'35 per cent, of the whole surface; while Würtemberg
                    has 31'22, and Baden 35'90. This wealth is partly due to the abundant natural
                    supply, and partly to the methodical way of treating forests adopted by all the
                    states of the empire. The winters being long and severe, an abundant supply of
                    fuel is almost as essential as a sufficient supply of food. This necessity has
                    led, in the absence of coal, and along with a passion for the chase, to the
                    preservation of forests, and to the establishment of an admirable system of
                    forest cultivation, almost as carefully conducted as field tillage. We need only
                    enumerate a few of the principal wooded tracts bordering on the Rhine and the
                    Elbe. The Black Forest stretches the whole length of the grand-duchy of Baden
                    and part of the kingdom of Würtemberg, from the Neckar to Basel and the lake of
                    Constance. The vegetation resembles that of the Vosges; forests of spruce,
                    Scotch, and silver firs, mingled with birches, beech, and oak, are the chief
                    woods met with. The forest of Rippoldsau, on the head waters of the Kinzig, is
                    one of the best forests, and is managed with great care. In the grand-duchy of
                    Hesse, the Odenwald range of mountains, stretching between the Maine and the
                    Neckar, contains the chief supply of timber. These two large tracts of forest
                    are favourably situated with respect to water carriage, and from them the supply
                    of timber for exportation is mainly drawn; it is now, however, so much
                    diminished in passing down the Rhine through populous districts, that it no
                    longer suffices for the demands of the Dutch shipbuilders. The largest spars are
                    called “Hollander.” The floating operations down the several tributaries of the
                    Rhine in the Black Forest are very instructive, and the timber trade may there
                    be studied with advantage. In the duchy of Nassau there are the large wooded
                    tracts of the Westerwald and the Taunus mountain ranges, and the forests cover a
                    large area extending between Neuwied and Bieberich. In Rhenish Prussia the
                    valuable forests nearly equal the arable land in extent. These lie partly in the
                    Ardennes, on the borders of Belgium, and on the mountains overhanging the Upper
                    Moselle, but they do not furnish such stately trees as the Schwarzwald or Black
                    Forest and the Odenwald. The Vosges forests were ceded to Germany in 1872, after
                    the Franco-Prussian war. The Spessartwald, near Asch-affeuburg-on-the-Maine in
                    Bavaria, is one of the most extensive forests of middle Germany, containing
                    large masses of fine oak with extensive plantations of coniferous trees, spruce,
                    Scotch fir, and larch. Bavaria possesses other fine forest tracts, such as the
                    Baierischewald on the Bohemian frontier, the Kranzberg near Munich, and the
                    Frankewald in the north of the kingdom. North Germany has extensive forests on
                    the Hartz and Thuringian mountains, while in East Prussia large tracts of flat
                    ground are covered with <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sylvestris,</hi><hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa,</hi> and
                    juniper.</p>
                <p>Prussia, including Hanover, contains about 20 million acres of forest land. About
                    half of this is private property, and of the other half, managed by the state,
                    part is communal or ecclesiastical forest. Of the state forests, equalling
                    6,200,000 acres, a small proportion is moorland yet to be planted. The yield of
                    the state woodland in 1871, a large portion of which bears Scotch fir, was
                    204,796,260 cubic feet, or 34'5 cubic feet per acre of the area devoted to the
                    produce of timber. The total income for the year for timber and other forest
                    products amounted to .£2,100,000, or about six shillings an acre, little more
                    than half of which went to working expenses, the cost of the forest academies,
                    commutation of servitudes, and road taxes.</p>

                    been most accurately studied, and the economical management of woodland most
                    successfully carried out in that country. The following eight academies existed
                    prior to the unification of the empire. Each large state had one school. They
                    are now being remodelled with a central office at Berlin.</p>

                <p>The academies at Neustadt Eberswald and Aschaffenburg are for the study of
                    forestry alone, while in the others the pursuit of agricultural or engineering
                    knowledge is combined with it. In Germany the forest service is a state
                    department, filled by youths of good position, who are specially trained for the
                    purpose. The period of training extends over five years, and its course is thus
                    described by Campbell Walker.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>“Nothing struck me as more remarkable than the extent and varied nature of the
                    studies required from forest candidates or probationers in Prussia, and the
                    number of years they are content to spend, first in studying and then in waiting
                    for an appointment. The would-be <hi rend="italic">Oberförster</hi> must, after
                    passing certain terms at a Government school of the first class, spend a year
                    with an Oberförster in a ‘ revier, ’ and then pass an examination as forest
                    pupil, after which there is a two years’ course at a forest academy, and an
                    examination in scientific forestry, land surveying, &amp;c., on passing which
                    the pupil becomes a <hi rend="italic">forst-kandidat</hi>; then other two years’
                    practical study, during at least nine months of which he must actually perform
                    the duties of a forester, after which comes the final Government examination, on
                    passing which he enters the grade of <hi rend="italic"
                    >oberfôrster-kandidat.</hi> The difference betwixt the two examinations is that
                    the first tests the candidate’s knowledge of theoretical forestry and cognate
                    sciences, whilst the latter tests his ability to apply what he has learnt and
                    capability for employment as Oberförster and in the higher grades. After passing
                    the final examination the <hi rend="italic">ober-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >förster-kandidat</hi> is employed as an assistant in the academies and control
                    offices, in making forest surveys and working plans, and sometimes acting in
                    charge of a revier, receiving certain daily or weekly allowances whilst so
                    employed. After five or six years of this probation he may look forward to being
                    permanently appointed. Thus we have at least five years spent in study and other
                    five in probation, —the former without any pay, and the latter only with meagre
                    allowances, whilst actually employed, before the would-be forest officer is
                    installed; and the time is generally much longer. Yet so great is the desire for
                    Government service, and particularly forest service, in Prussia, and indeed in
                    Germany generally, that there is no lack of competitors.</p>

                    the best advantage. Next in order come the <hi rend="italic">forstmeisters,</hi>
                    numbering 108, in charge of divisions with an average area of 25,000 hectares,
                    and then the executive officers, 706 <hi rend="italic">Oberförsters,</hi> with
                    charges averaging about 3000 hectares, to each of which is attached a <hi

                    rend="italic">Försters</hi> (or overseers), with ranges of from 500 to 1000
                    hectares. The forests have all been surveyed, valued, and divided into blocks,
                    and there are accurate maps representing the extent and situation of each forest
                    district, and the description and age of the timber growing in each block.
                    Whatever be the size of the woods every tree is recorded, and a working plan is
                    drawn out and followed,—certain species being destined to longer or shorter
                    growth, according to their promise of vitality or liability to decay. It may be
                    remarked that such maps form the starting point of every true system of
                    forestry.”</p>
                <p>At Aschaffenburg, which may be taken as an example of German forest schools,
                    candidates for Government for est service must first pass the standard of the
                    higher school or gymnasium, which includes classics, mathematics, natural
                    history, and chemistry. They are usually seventeen to nineteen years of age, and
                    they first become apprentices for one year, assisting in the practical work of a
                    forest district. The forest curriculum extends over two and a half years.
                    Besides the director, there are four professors, who teach the following

                    forests. The students who pass the final examination, after five years’
                    training, are qualified for appointments in the forest service. Careful
                    observations are made at Aschaffenburg regarding the influence of forests on the
                    air and soil, their hygienic importance and effect on climate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Austria.—</hi> Austria, including Hungary and Bohemia,
                    possesses a vast amount of timber, about one-third of the productive area being
                    returned as woodland, and covering 66,000 square miles, situated more in the
                    east than in the west. There are 2,330,000 acres of forest belonging to the
                    state, chiefly in Croatia, Slavonia, Transylvania, and the Alpine regions
                    throughout the empire. Dalmatia and Istria alone have a deficient supply of
                    timber, owing to previous devastations; but the Government is here making great
                    efforts to restore the forests. The prevailing trees in the higher altitudes are
                    <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pectinata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pinus montana</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Larido.</hi> The larch mingles largely with the pines. In the low-lying tracts
                    of the Alps ami Carpathian mountains the beech is the principal tree; in the
                    north-west several species of oak; in the south the elm, poplar, chestnut, and
                    walnut. In Dalmatia and southern Tyrol the olive, mulberry, and fig trees
                    abound. Austria produces annually about 67 million cubic feet of timber; and of
                    other forest products the following are principal items :—∙</p>

                <p>The total income in 1872 from the Austrian state forests was 4,148,000 gulden,
                    the expenditure 3,049,000 gulden, leaving a net profit of about £90,000. The
                    Austrian Government are wisely desirous to conserve and utilize their valuable
                    forest property, and there is a state forest department with a staff of 1170
                    persons, 22 of whom are skilled officers of high position. In parts of Bohemia
                    and Hungary entire forests have been destroyed, rendering useless much soil that
                    is unfit for agriculture. Encouragement is given by the state to persons who
                    make successful efforts to plant denuded ground.</p>
                <p>Scientific forestry is not so advanced as in Germany, but increasing attention is
                    being given to the subject. The principal forest academies are at Marien-brunn
                    near Vienna, with a large staff of professors, a laboratory and museum, and at
                    Schemnitz in Hungary. The courses last three years after passing the gymnasium
                    examination, as at Aschaffenburg. Other academies for training more exclusively
                    in the practice of forestry have a shorter course.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia.—</hi> The inequality of the distribution of wood in the
                    Russian empire is very remarkable. The north of Great Russia, the government of
                    Perm, and Finland have a large proportion of forest land, and the export of
                    timber from Archangel, St Petersburg, and Riga is very great. In central Russia
                    there are also large and valuable forests, but in the south they become scanty.
                    It was recently reported at the annual meeting of the geographical society of
                    Vienna by Councillor Wex, that the Volga is decreasing <pb break="no"

                    valley, so as to affect materially the level of the Caspian Sea and Sea of Aral.
                    With the exception of Bessarabia and the Caucasus, including the region
                    south-west of the Caspian, the southern districts of Russia bordering the Black
                    and Caspian Seas are extremely bare of wood, and for household fuel the people
                    use a compost of straw, leaves, &amp;c. The Government has attempted the
                    planting of portions of the vast steppes, and near Odessa there are fine
                    plantations of <hi rend="italic">Ailanthus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >glandulosa,</hi> which give promise of success to further plantings (Marsh).
                    The following statistics of the proportion of woodland in Russia are given in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Forestry,</hi> 1877 :—</p>
                <p>“There are in European Russia alone 172,418,000 dessiatins (about 400,500,000
                    acres) of forests, or 43 ’ 3 per cent, of the entire territory. Such an extent
                    of forests is not to be found in any other country of Europe. Two-thirds, or 66
                    per cent., of the mass of forests extend over the north-eastern districts; then
                    follow the northwestern governments, where the relative proportion to the
                    general area is 30 to 50 per cent. In the middle Volga, the Baltic, and western
                    and central provinces the proportion is 27'2 per cent., in the southwestern it
                    is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per cent., in the Little Russia and Steppe
                    governments, including the Crimea, it is only 0 ’ 7 per cent. Finland and the
                    Caucasus are not included, which contain splendid timber in great variety, nor
                    the Polish governments, where the forests occupy a very extensive area.”</p>
                <p>In the Paris Exhibition Report, 1867, the area of forest in Finland is given at
                    2,500,000 acres, but in the most accessible parts wasteful and serious
                    denudation has taken place.</p>
                <p>The Scotch fir, the spruce, and the Siberian larch are the most common coniferous
                    trees in Russia. The spruce penetrates furthest north, the Scotch fir grows well
                    in the Crimea and the Caucasus, while the larch is chiefly found in the district
                    drained by the Petchora river, and throughout Siberia. These three form the
                    staple of the Russian timber export trade. Birch is also a tree of the northern
                    latitudes, and extends eastwards as far as Kamchatka. In the central and over a
                    large part of the southern portions of European Russia there are good forests of
                    oak, and the beech, boxwood, ash, lime, maple, and walnut all grow in more or
                    less profusion. The oak does not cross the Urals. The ridges of the Crimea are
                    clothed with Corsican pine <hi rend="italic">(Pinus Larido),</hi> while the
                    Scotch fir and beech form fine forests in the Caucasus.</p>
                <p>Tlιe annual consumption of wood within the Russian empire is enormous, the
                    estimated value being 260 millions of roubles, the railways requiring for fuel
                    alone 7 million roubles worth. In the absence of stone nearly all the buildings
                    are made of wood. Every year upwards of 100,000 vessels of different
                    descriptions descend the Russian rivers, most of which on reaching their
                    destination are broken up for building or fuel. Scotch fir and spruce are
                    usually employed for this purpose. The collection of resin and tar in the
                    northern provinces is very great, about 7000 tons of tar being annually
                    exported. A new industry has sprung up of late years, viz., making pulp for
                    paper from the wood of the aspen, a tree which readily reproduces itself. The
                    lime furnishes material for rope, cordage, and matting.</p>
                <p>In 1858, Baron von Berg, a distinguished forest officer of Saxony, was requested
                    to report on the forests and forest management of Firilan&lt;l, and subsequently
                    also of Poland. The establishment of twp schools of forestry resulted from his
                    visit. At the school of Nova Alexandria in Poland, established in 1858, the
                    teaching of agriculture is combined with that of forestry. The passing of a
                    gymnasium examination is necessary before admission. The course of study covers
                    three years, when, after the final examination, the students receive a diploma
                    entitling them to employment in the service of Government. At Evois in Finland,
                    where the school was founded in 1859, the instruction is in forestry only.
                    Though at the commencement the education and quarters were given free, the
                    school had to be closed for lack of pupils; but in 1874 it was reorganized, and
                    now it seems to be in a flourishing condition. The course extends to two years,
                    and the instruction includes forest law and economy, surveying, book-keeping,
                    engineering, mathematics, and kindred subjects. A forest school also exists at
                    Peter-offsky near Moscow, and another at Berdiansk on the sea of Azoff, and many
                    young Russians have been sent to the French and German schools to acquire a
                    knowledge of forest science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roumania.—</hi> It is computed that there are in Roumania 2
                    million acres of forest land, though not wholly covered with wood. In the plains
                    species of oak predominate, and according to elevation, walnut, beech, yew,
                    silver fir, and spruce. But the coniferous trees have mostly disappeared, and
                    the forests have been greatly damaged, while, owing to grazing rights, no young
                    trees have been allowed to spring up. A small forest staff has now been
                    appointed, and plans are being formed for the establishment of a school for
                    training forest assistants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> The principal timber tree of France is the oak,
                    and various species are much cultivated. The cork oak is grown extensively in
                    the south and in Corsica. The beech, ash, elm, maple, birch, walnut, and poplar
                    are all important trees, while the silver fir and spruce form magnificent
                    forests in the Vosges and Jura Mountains, and the Aleppo and maritime pines are
                    cultivated in the south and south-west. About one-seventh of the entire
                    territory is still covered with wood.</p>
                <p>Forest legislation took its rise in France about the middle of the 16th century,
                    and the great minister Sully urged the enforcement of restrictive forest laws.
                    In 1669 a fixed treatment of state forests was enacted, and in 1750 Mirabeau
                    estimated the woodlands in France at 70 millions hectares. Duhamel in 1755
                    published his famous work on forest trees. Reckless destruction of the forests,
                    however, was in progress, and the Revolution of 1789 gave a fresh stimulus to
                    the work of devastation. The usual results have followed in the frequency and
                    destructiveness of floods, which have washed away the soil from the hill sides
                    and valleys of many districts, especially in the south, and the frequent
                    inundations of the last fifty years are no doubt caused by the deforesting of
                    the sources of the Rhone and Saone. Laws were passed in 1860 and 1864, providing
                    for the reforesting, “reboisement,” of the slopes of mountains, and these laws
                    take effect on private as well as state property. Beneficial results have
                    already ensued. Thousands of acres are annually planted in the departments of
                    Hautes and Basses Alps; and during the summer of 1875, when much injury was done
                    by floods in the south of France, the Durance, formerly the most dangerous in
                    this respect of French rivers, gave little cause for anxiety, and it is round
                    the head waters of this river that the chief plantations have been formed. While
                    tracts formerly covered with wood have been replanted, plantations have been
                    formed on the white shifting sands or dunes along the coast of Gascony. A forest
                    of <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Pinaster,</hi> 150 miles in
                    length and from 2 to 6 broad, now stretches from Bayonne to the mouth of the
                    Gironde, raised by means of sowing steadily continued since 1789; and the
                    cultivation of the same pine in the department of Landes has, along with
                    draining, transformed low marshy grounds into productive soil. With the
                    provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, a large extent of forest was ceded to Germany
                    in 1871.</p>

                <p>In 1877 the French state forests contained 985,086 hectares, and the communal
                    1,919,622 hectares. The revenue in 1827 amounted to 27,000,000 francs,
                    three-fourths of which was from the sale of timber, and one-fourth from other
                    forest produce. The estimated revenue for 1877 was 38,500,000 francs, 29,500,000
                    of which was to come from the regular fellings, and the remainder from
                    extraordinary cuttings and minor forest produce. The annual expenses of the
                    forest department average 13,000,000 francs. For 1877 the actual figures were
                    13,325,732 francs, of which about 5,000,000 is for the pay of the establishment,
                    two and a half millions for roads, two for plantations, and the balance for

                    board of administration, who meet twice a week, and are charged with the working
                    of the forests, questions of rights and law, finance, and plantation works. The
                    establishment consists of 36 conservators, 174 inspectors, 310 sub-inspectors,
                    and about 420 <hi rend="italic">gardes généraux,</hi> the number being regulated
                    by the exigencies of the service.</p>
                <p>The department is supplied with officers from the forest school at Nancy. This
                    institution was founded in 1824, when Μ. Lorentz, who bad studied forestry in
                    Germany, was appointed its first director. Any French youth from eighteen to
                    twenty years of age may compete for admission to the school on producing certain
                    certificates and filing a bond guaranteeing the payment of 1500 francs a year,
                    and 600 francs from the dateof his joining the establishment till he is promoted
                    <hi rend="italic">garde</hi><hi rend="italic">général</hi> on full pay. The
                    entrance examination comprises arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry,
                    physical sciences, chemistry, plan-drawing, mechanics, German, history,
                    geography, and free-hand drawing. The pupils pass two years in the school, and
                    during a third attend lectures, while taking practical charge of portions of
                    forest near Nancy. The school is under a director, a sub-director, and eight
                    professors, besides two officers for militaιy instruction. In the winter session
                    eight hours daily are spent in the school, and the summer teπn is chiefly passed
                    in forest tours, the pupils accompanying the professors, who apply the teaching
                    of the school to objects found in the forest. There are usually 45 to 50 French
                    pupils. The French Government has kindly extended the benefits of this
                    well-equipped institution to candidates for employment in the state forests of
                    British India.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Switzerland.—</hi> Forests.in Switzerland cover about 18 per
                    cent., or one-sixth of the whole area, but in some of the cantons excessive
                    deforesting has taken place. On the precipitous mountain sides the forest is
                    found to have a powerful influence in preventing the formation and descent of
                    avalanches, and in the Alps the woods are preserved, though insufficiently, by
                    law. A distinguishing feature of Swiss forests is the prevalence of the silver
                    fir, <hi rend="italic">Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">pectinata,</hi> which covers
                    large tracts on the mountains up to 4000 feet; the larch is sometimes mixed with
                    beech to 3000 feet, more rarely with oak and walnut to 1800 feet, and chestnut
                    to 750 feet. Each canton regulates the management of forests within its own
                    limits; but efforts repeatedly made in the Federal Council for the introduction
                    of a uniform system of forest legislation throughout the republic have not yet
                    been successful.</p>
                <p>Vigorous attempts to preserve and restore wooded land are made in some of the
                    cantons, and difficulties in the transport of timber from inaccessible points
                    have been skilfully overcome by the ingenious adaptation of wooden tramways and
                    iron rope slips.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italy.—</hi> The kingdom of Italy comprises such different
                    climates that within its limits we find the birch and pines of northern Europe,
                    and the olive, fig, manna-ash, and palm of more southern latitudes. The
                    ascertained extent of wood in 1872, including the wooded island of Sardinia,
                    was, according to Siemoni, 5,025,893 hectares, or about 17'63 per cent, of the
                    entire kingdom, a proportion which might with advantage be greatly increased,
                    but in the latest return it has fallen to 12'34. By the republic of Venice and
                    the duchy of Genoa forestal legislation was attempted at various periods from
                    the 15th century downwards. These efforts were not successful, as the
                    Governments were lax in enforcing the laws. In 1789 Pius VL issued regulations
                    prohibiting felling without licence, and later orders were published by his
                    successors in the Pontifical States. In Lombardy the woods, which fifty years
                    ago reached nearly down to Milan, have almost disappeared. The province of Como
                    contains only a remnant of the primitive forests, and the same may also be said
                    of the southern slopes of Tyrol. At Ravenna there is still a large forest of
                    stone pine, <hi rend="italic">Pinus Pinea,</hi> though it has^ been reduced to a
                    third of its former extent. The plains of Tuscany are adorned with planted
                    trees, the olive, mulberry, fig, and almond. Sardinia is rich in woods, which
                    cover one fifth of the area, and contain a large amount of oak, <hi
                    rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Suber,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Sicily the forests have been long felled save the zone at the base of Mount
                    Etna.</p>
                <p>The destruction of woods has been gradual but persistent; in the end of the 17th
                    century the effects of denudation were first felt in the destructive force given
                    t® mountain torrents by the deforesting of the Apennines, and up to the present
                    time the work of demolition continues. According to the statistics published by
                    the Italian Government in 1870, there were 215,801 hectares of state forest,
                    including woods attached to royal residences; but by the sale, alienation, or
                    destruction of the greater part, the area has since been very greatly reduced.
                    Of communal and private forests the extent is, according to Government
                    statistics,</p>

                <p>In 1867 the monastic property of Vallombrosa, Tuscany, 30 miles from Florence,
                    was purchased by Government for the purposes of a forest academy, which was
                    opened in 1869, and energetic measures were initiated throughout the kingdom for
                    the preservation of the remaining woods. It is to be regretted that, by a change
                    of policy, the area of forest has now greatly decreased. The administrative
                    staff consists of 3 inspectors general, 35 forest inspectors, and about 300
                    subordinate officials. The royal forest school at Vallombrosa is surrounded by a
                    splendid forest of silver fir, and a large extent of broad-leaved chestnut,
                    beech, and other trees is also attached to it. <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">halepensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pinea</hi> and larch are the
                    other prevailing conifers. The number of pupils is about 60, and the course of
                    study resembles that at Nancy. A forest periodical is regularly published at
                    Florence. Director di Berenger, who has superintended the school from its
                    foundation, is a man of great learning, and author of several important works on
                    forestry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spain and Portugal</hi> are very deficient in woodland. The
                    Peninsula is not unsuited to the growth of timber, as evinced by the noble
                    forests which existed in the times of the Moors, especially in the southern
                    provinces. There was a code of forest laws in Spain in the reign of Philip II.,
                    but it seems never to have been carried out, and the fine forests have long
                    since disappeared. The evils of denudation are perhaps nowhere more signally
                    exemplified than in Spain, and “Rentzsch even goes so far as to ascribe the
                    political decadence of Spain wholly to the destruction of the forests” (Marsh,
                    p. 306). Although her physical conditions render a large extent of forest almost
                    indispensable to industrial progress, Spain may be said to be the only European
                    country, with perhaps the exception of Great Britain, in which there has been no
                    provision for the protection of woods.</p>

                    of coniferous trees, formerly covering all these chains. In the fluviatile
                    valleys of the Sierra Nevada isolated groups of trees present themselves, the
                    wrecks of larger woods” (Henfrey, p. 295). In central Spain and on the slopes of
                    the Pyrenees there are still considerable tracts covered with <hi rend="italic"

                    important article of food.</p>

                    India are of great extent and value. Under the rule of Hindu and Mahometan
                    princes, as well as in the earlier years of British domination, the forests were
                    recklessly injured by felling, or by the recurrence of destructive fires,
                    thereby deteriorating the climate and impoverishing the people. But conservancy
                    has been introduced, in time to preserve many of the advantages they are
                    calculated to afford, to make them a considerable source of revenue to the
                    state, and to provide for the needs of future generations. The change from
                    uncontrolled waste to careful state supervision is necessarily slow: immemorial
                    usages have to be overcome, and many obstructions to be removed, before the
                    department is in good working order; great progress has, however, been made. The
                    forest department is now a branch of the public service, for which candidates
                    are annually selected by the Secretary of State for India.</p>
                <p>Attention was first directed to conservation in India by the appointment of a
                    committee by the British Association in Edinburgh in 1850, to consider the
                    “probable effects, in an economical and physical point of view, of the
                    destruction of tropical forests;” and a report was printed in 1851, showing the
                    importance of preserving every influence which tends to maintain an equilibrium
                    of temperature and humidity, of preventing the waste of valuable material, and
                    the special application to their various uses of the indigenous timbers of the
                    country. Indian botanists, to their credit, had long urged on the Government the
                    necessity of stopping the waste of valuable timber. Advancing civilization, the
                    progress of agriculture, and the rapid extension of railways soon rendered it
                    imperative that means should be taken to organize a general system of forest
                    administration, to control the clearing of indigenous forests, and to economize
                    public property for the public good. About 1855 the first attempts at
                    organization were made, the executive arrangements being left to the local
                    administrations. In Bombay, Burmah, and Madras, conservators were appointed who
                    started as it were single-handed and without skilled assistance, depending on
                    such help as could be found in the local services. After the mutiny of 1857 a
                    staff of five or six assistants was sanctioned in each of these provinces, the
                    more valuable forests were mapped out, and exact information was obtained
                    regarding their resources. In 1862 the Government of India organized a
                    departmental system of conservancy for the whole empire, and the office of
                    inspector general of forests was created. A Forest Act, No. 4 of 1864, gave
                    power to local administrations to demarcate the limits of state forests, and to
                    reserve certain trees for state purposes, and notified the mode of procedure in
                    cases of damage, conflagration, &amp;c.; and in October 1877 the report of a
                    select committee on a bill to amend the law relating to the preservation of
                    state forests was under the consideration of the Indian Government. Many of the
                    forest officers first appointed were chosen because of local knowledge and love
                    for natural history rather than their knowledge of practical forestry, but with
                    these extended operations the want of trained assistants soon became apparent.
                    It was therefore determined to train young men specially for the work, and as
                    forestry is in France a branch of Government service, advantage is taken of the
                    forest school at Nancy in France, and five or six youths, after having passed
                    through the usual course of study there, both theoretical and practical, are
                    annually sent to India. In 1876 the officers of the higher grades had increased
                    to 147,—1 inspector general, 10 conservators of provinces, 136 deputies and
                    assistants. The post of inspector general is held by Dr Dietrich Brandis, to
                    whose energy and experience is in great measure due the success which has
                    attended the progress of the department.</p>
                <p>Many large and valuable tracts of forest are in the territories of native chiefs;
                    and to prevent these being wholly destroyed, the British Government leases them
                    for a long term of years, paying an annual rent, or a seignorage on each tree
                    felled. Throughout the empire the forest lands are burdened with grazing and
                    other village rights, and it has required much tact to effect the formation of
                    forest reserves to their present extent. As opportunity offers, unreserved
                    forests are added to the reserves. The following figures embrace all the
                    provinces under the Government of India (excluding Madras and Bombay). In 1875-6
                    the area of reserved and leased forests was 15,089 square miles, being an
                    increase of 3000 square miles during the year. The aggregate area of plantations
                    is about 26,000 acres, and the trees cultivated in the different provinces are

                <p>The export of teak commenced about 1829, after the annexation of Tenasserim, and
                    at first it was only from British territory. In 1835 teak began to come from
                    beyond the frontier in largely increasing quantities. After the annexation of
                    Pegu forest operations in British territory were regulated, and the average
                    export to Indian and foreign ports from 1856 to 1862 was 20,000 tons, four times
                    that amount coming from beyond the frontier. Nearly two-thirds of the teak goes
                    to Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and the rest to Britain. The finest teak
                    plantation is the Conolly plantation in Malabar on the Beypur River (Madras
                    Presidency), where the rainfall is 150 inches annually. It now covers about 4000
                    acres, and 100 acres are added every year. The result has been most
                    satisfactory, in the provision of an immense stock of valuable material, and the
                    outlay incurred is being gradually recouped.</p>

                    conies chiefly from Burmah, partly from Mysore and Malabar. It is used for
                    tanning and dyeing. Lac is chiefly produced in Central India; the collection is
                    expensive, but the quantity may be still further increased. <hi rend="italic"

                    exported from Bombay. In Mysore more than half of the forest revenue is derived

                <p>Much expenditure is needful for improving the roads through the forests, and for
                    the blasting of rocks in rivers, which, both in the plains and in the Himalaya,
                    are much used for floating logs. Fuel plantations on a large scale, especially
                    in Madras and the Punjab, have been formed for the supply of railways and
                    steamboats; the demarcation of forests is steadily carried on, the reserves are
                    mapped, and laws are in force for the exclusion of cattle from the reserves and
                    for the prevention of fires; waste has been prohibited, and in many ways a
                    gradual improvement is taking place. New species of trees of rapid growth are
                    being acclimatized. “From Australia several kinds of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucalyptus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> were introduced about
                    twenty-five years ago, and they have made such progress that the station of
                    Ootacamund is now almost surrounded by a forest of these trees. Their rate of
                    growth is wonderfully fast, much faster than that of the indigenous trees. Young
                    forests of the quinine-yielding <hi rend="italic">Cinchonas</hi> are coming up
                    in many places. The management of these cinchona woods will probably be similar
                    to the treatment of oak coppice in England; for though oak bark has not
                    one-twentieth the value of Jesuit’s bark, it is the bark in both cases for which
                    these woods are mainly cultivated. There will, however, be the difference that
                    while oak coppice in Europe, after having been cut over, requires from fourteen
                    to twenty years to yield another crop of bark, cinchonas grow so rapidly that
                    they may probably be cut <pb break="no"

                    called the king of Indian timber trees; it is prized for shipbuilding beyond any
                    other wood, and is specially valuable for works in contact with iron. It is
                    indigenous in Hindustan as well as in Burmah and the neighbouring states,
                    generally growing in company with bamboos and other trees in dry deciduous
                    woods. It grows to perfection in Malabar and West Buπnah, where the rainfall is
                    heaviest. The northern limit is about 25° N. lat. The sal, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shorea robusta,</hi> another most important tree, forms extensivepure
                    forestsalong the base of the Himalaya, from Assam to the Sutlej, and in the

                    for building, gun carriages, and railway sleepers. The deodar, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cedrus</hi><hi rend="italic">Deodara,</hi> is to North India what teak is to

                    and forms extensive forests in the basins of the Indus, Tonse, Jumna, and

                    information. The advance of forest management in India has led to the

                    working of the forests has also been facilitated by the publication of a code
                    for the transaction of forest business. There is an annual conference of forest
                    officers, when questions of principle and practice are discussed; and a
                    quarterly magazine of forestry— <hi rend="italic">The Indian Forester—</hi>

                    marshy plains. The northern limit of the pine is about 70°. Willows, alders, and
                    poplars are used for fuel on the plains. Elms and wild apricots are mentioned by
                    travellers, but the oak is not indigenous. It is estimated that Siberia contains
                    2,000,000 acres of forest in the districts above named. The vast plateau of
                    Tartary and Tibet is of great sterility, dry, and almost treeless, and the
                    climate is very unpropitious. In Manchuria there are extensive coniferous
                    forests, and on the east coast there is said to be oak on the mountains, while
                    on the low land the maple, willow, apricot, and mulberry are found.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">America.</hi></p>
                <p>America is of all quarters of the world the most thickly wooded with primeval
                    forest. The territory on the north-west coast and islands is well stocked with
                    pine timber.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Canada.—</hi> The forests of British North America are of the
                    first importance for the comfort and welfare of its people, as no coal is found
                    in the centre of the Canadian dominion. Canada contained immense forests, which
                    are still extensive, chiefly of black and white spruce, the Weymouth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Strobus)</hi> and other pines, which
                    grow to a great height and do not admit of undergrowth. The dark and sombre
                    forests are also rich in other commercial woods, such as oaks, ash, maple,
                    hickory, and walnut. The export of timber is very great, and Great Britain draws
                    more from Canada than from any other country. <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Strobus</hi> yields the largest amount, and is the most valuable
                    of Canadian woods. It is now chiefly obtained from the head waters of
                    tributaries of the St Lawτence. The extensive lumber trade is causing rapid
                    denudation. Tracts of land are let to “Lumber Companies,” whose object is to get
                    as large a return as possible, and annually thousands of acres are destroyed by
                    fire. An Act has recently been passed regarding the public lands of the
                    Dominion, which provides for the care of young trees, whereby in Quebec it is no
                    longer permitted to cut pine trees less than 1 foot diameter at the stump. It
                    has also been proposed to establish a school of forestry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The primitive forests of America were of
                    immense extent, and contained a remarkable diversity of species, covering in the
                    17th century, with insignificant exceptions, all that portion of the North
                    American continent which has been occupied by British colonists, and apparently
                    adequate to the exigencies of advancing settlements to an indefinite future; but
                    now, it is “doubtful if any American State, except perhaps Oregon, has more
                    woodland than it ought permanently to preserve” (Marsh, p. 326). About 40
                    species of oak are indigenous in America, 16 conifers, several maples, birch,
                    ash, beech, elm,hornbeam, hickory, poplar, magnolia, walnut, butternut, &amp;c.
                    The eastern and midland States were at one time dense forests; now, Pennsylvania
                    alone excepted, these are denuded of the pines and other commercial woods, and
                    are compelled to draw much of their supply from Canada and the West. Even the
                    forests in Pennsylvania, which once yielded the finest pines in America, are now
                    greatly reduced in extent and value. The earliest restrictive measureof
                    Government was adopted inl817, when oak and red cedar were reserved; and a law
                    was passed in 1831 to arrest spoliation. The enormous supplies of timber still
                    brought to market may be judged of from the fact that the number of saw-mills in
                    1870 was 2δ,817—an increase of over 6000 in ten years. Fortunately public
                    opinion has been aroused, and a Forestry Association has been formed, to show
                    the vast annual decrease of forests, and the urgent necessity of planting to a
                    large extent. In Massachusetts valuable prizes are offered for planting white
                    ash and white pine, spruce and ſarch, with a view to the raising of useful
                    timber, and affording the needed shelter to the crops. In 1858 a premium of 1000
                    dois, was offered for the best plantation of forest trees planted in 1860,
                    payable in 1870. The States of Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa have also encouraged
                    tree-planting by State laws. Further west, in the prairie regions, energetic
                    measures are being adopted to create woodlands on hitherto treeless plains. In
                    Nebraska ash, walnut, and elm are largely planted, and along the Central Pacific
                    Railway belts of Australian gum and other trees are being formed to protect the
                    line from snow drifts, and for a future supply of timber. In the State of
                    California a forester has been appointed, and legal provision made to render the
                    discharge of his duties effectual. By a law of California, dated 30th March
                    1868, the board of supervisors in each county are empowered to authorize owners
                    of lands to plant and cultivate, along the public highways, shade and fruit
                    trees, specifying the species to be planted, at what age, at what distance from
                    each other and from the road bed, and making the necessary rules for their
                    protection, &amp;c. Four years after the planting, upon receiving a duly
                    certified statement of the number then in a good condition, the board are
                    directed to pay to the cultivator one dollar for each such tree. California
                    still possesses her magnificent Sequoias, <hi rend="italic">S. gigantea,</hi>
                    which attain when full grown an average height of 275 feet, and a girth of 70
                    feet at 6 feet from the ground. Sir J. D. Hooker tells of a forest forty miles
                    long, and 3 to 10 broad, in the Sierra Nevada, where alone the tree is
                    indigenous. Wood-cutters and saw-mills are, however, busy at work, converting
                    the valuable Sequoias into marketable timber, and sheep grazing and fires
                    kindled by the lumbermen are effectually destroying the saplings. Hooker writes
                    in 1878—“The devastation of the Californian forest is proceeding at a rate which
                    is utterly incredible, except to an eye-witness. It is true that a few <pb

                    at the northern extreme of its range are protected by the State legislature, and
                    a law has been enacted forbidding the felling of trees over 15 feet in diameter;
                    but there is no law to prevent the cutting or burning of the saplings, on which
                    the perpetuation of the grove depends, or to prevent the burning of the old
                    trees, which, if they do escape the fire, will succumb to the drought which the
                    sweeping away of the environing forest will occasion.’ <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> In Texas, where there is a very inadequate supply of timber, the growth
                    of trees on the prairies is being attempted, but the frequency and
                    destructiveness of prairie fires are great obstacles to success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Central America.—</hi> Mexico and the various states of the
                    isthmus uniting North and South America, as well as the West Indian Islands,
                    possess abundant forests, which are as yet, however, imperfectly known. But they
                    contain many fine timbers in large quantities, the chief of which, mahogany, <hi
                    rend="italic">Swietenia</hi><hi rend="italic">Mahagoni,</hi> deserves special
                    notice. The mahogany tree is found on the mainland and in the West Indian
                    Islands between 11° and 20° N. lat. It grows to a large size, with a perfectly
                    straight stem, and is exported from the different states and islands*where it
                    grows. That which comes from British Honduras is esteemed the best, but the
                    supply from there has declined of late years. Mahogany was first imported into
                    England about 1640. It has been introduced into Bengal and Malabar. In the
                    neighbourhood of Panama 2000 persons are employed in drawing off the juice of
                    <hi rend="italic">Castilloa</hi><hi rend="italic">elastica,</hi> the Central
                    American caoutchouc tree, and in Nicaragua 600 to 800 persons find similar
                    employment. (See <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> 1875.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cuba.—</hi> For variety and value the woods of Cuba rival those
                    of the mainland, but the Government forests have been neglected and left to
                    chance and plunder. There has been no attempt to control the misuse, waste, and
                    wanton destruction of forest. Valuable timber is felled for making enclosures,
                    and much is burnt. Almost all the remaining woods belong to private persons.
                    Mahogany, cedar, and fustic wood, with many others, are produced freely. During
                    last century forty-two ships of war were built in the Royal Arsenal of Havannah,
                    and with proper management much timber for naval purposes might be obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">South America.—</hi> The richness and luxuriance of the
                    tropical vegetation in South America are proverbial, and the whole chain of the
                    Andes is clothed with wood, varying according to elevation, latitude, and
                    aspect. Owing to the scarcity and high price of labour, with the few facilities
                    of transport to the sea-coast, the timber trade of South America has not as yet
                    reached great dimensions; but with the increase of population and the opening up
                    of the country this commerce will be vastly developed. No data as to the extent
                    of forest area are available, but with great variety of climate in the vast
                    continent there is great diversity also in the vegetation. Each State has its
                    own special forest-products to export, of which, however, we can only name a few
                    of the more valuable.</p>

                    greenheart. It is to be hoped that the British colonies in the western
                    hemisphere will follow the example of the East Indian empire, and introduce, ere
                    it be too late, measures of conservancy and reproduction. Sir J. Hooker has
                    urged this in strong terms. <hi rend="italic">(Kew Report,</hi> 1877.)</p>

                    the great water highway of Venezuela, is fringed in its lower course with
                    magnificent evergreen forests. The most important trees of this republic are

                    an area half the size of Europe. For 2000 miles the river Amazon flows through
                    Brazilian territory, and forms with its tributaries the only interruption in a
                    rich level tract measuring 1200 miles from E. to W. and 800 from N. to S.
                    covered with virgin forest. R. Spruce graphically describes the wonderful
                    luxuriance of a forest on the Amazon.</p>
                <p>“As we ran along shore and gradually lessened our distance, I endeavoured to
                    trace out the species composing the forest, but, with the exception of the
                    palms, of the trees with bipinnate foliage, and of a few with remarkable
                    dome-shaped crowns, there was such an intermingling of forms that I in vain
                    attempted to separate them; nor was there, among exogenous trees, any contour so
                    striking as the twisted pyramid of our northern pines. When I entered the forest
                    the confusion was still greater; for so much were the branches of adjacent trees
                    interwoven, and so densely veiled in many cases with twiners and epiphytes, that
                    only an indistinct view could be obtained of any individual tree, and it was
                    only when sailing along the banks of the rivers that I saw so much of the trees
                    in the inundated forest as to give me a clear idea of the outlines and general
                    aspect of many of them.”— <hi rend="italic">Jour. Linn.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The productiveness of the Brazilian forests may be inferred from the fact that in
                    the Paris Exhibition of 1873 were 300 different kinds of timber, many of them of
                    great value both for naval and civil construction and for ornamental work. No
                    plantations have yet been formed of these valuable woods, and fustic and Brazil
                    wood are to be met with only at a distance from the coast. The most important
                    woods of construction are—jacaranda <hi rend="italic">(Dalbergia nigra.),</hi>

                    are richer still in gums, resins, drags, dyes, and produce valuable for trade
                    and manufacturing purposes. The great development of commerce in forest produce
                    is illustrated by the export returns for 1871-72, viz. :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Peru.—</hi> In the Montana region of Peru (that is, the
                    extensive area stretching eastward from the Andes to the confines of Brazil) are
                    vast forests, yielding in spontaneous abundance Peruvian bark, india-rubber,

                    but the collection of produce and its transport through the sierra and coast
                    regions to the ports is attended with much difficulty and expense. The region of
                    cinchona trees lies between 19° S. and 10° N. lat., and between 2500 and 9000
                    feet elevation above the sea. In South America the miserable Governments of the
                    cinchona districts have almost destroyed the inestimable boon with which a
                    bountiful providence has endowed them. Happily, in this case, the energy of such
                    men as Markham, Spruce, and others has in great measure prevented a loss which
                    would have been incalculable; for the cinchona plantations established in India,
                    in Java, and in various other colonies give promise, that Europeans will not in
                    the future suffer from the thoughtless greed of the semi-civilized Governments
                    of the Andine States.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Uruguay.—</hi> The “montes” of South and Central Uruguay form
                    narrow fringes to the larger streams, and rarely exceed a few hundred yards in
                    width. Seen from distant higher ground they resemble rivers of verdure
                    meandering through the bare campos, from which they are sharply defined—the
                    reason being that the wood only grows where it is liable to inundation. N. and
                    E. Uruguay aie little known, but the same description is applicable to them. In
                    the montes of the Rio Negro, Dr David Christison reports having seen twenty
                    species of trees and shrubs, including a palm which extends southwards to the
                    Santa Lucia. The montes of Uruguay are of no commercial value, and their extent
                    must be trifling, but they suffice for the wants of the present scanty
                    population. The beautiful ombu <hi rend="italic">(Piτcunia</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Phytolacca dioica)</hi> is the only tree which is possibly native
                    on the campos. The softness of its spongy tissue renders it useless for burning
                    and for timber. On the eastern side of South America, continued in the whole
                    stretch of 1500 miles south of the Rio de la Plata to the straits of Magellan,
                    wood seems to be extremely rare, except a few thorny acacias in the plains oi
                    Patagonia, some willows on the banks of one or two of the rivers, and the
                    antarctic beech and the Winter’s bark tree—a great contrast to some of the
                    islands of Tierra del Fuego, which, from the descriptions of Darwin, we know to
                    be completely covered with forest.</p>

                <p>The large continent of Australia, so far as it has been colonized, is

                    tracts in the interior covered with <hi rend="italic">scrub,</hi> but the total
                    area of forest producing timber seems to be comparatively small. The growth of
                    trees is more vigorous in the east than on the north and north-west coasts. The
                    foliage is usually evergreen, and the leaves of many trees hang vertically. The
                    chief forests occupy the flat margins of the rivers, and are composed of species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi> mingled
                    with <hi rend="italic">Callitris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Casuarina, Banksia,
                    Melaleuca, Xanthorrhaea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Exocarpus.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> are said to
                    compose four-fifths of the forests of Australia and Tasmania. These trees,
                    formerly despised and thought of little value, are now introduced into many
                    countries where artificial planting has been found necessary, and are
                    extensively grown in India, Mauritius, Algeria, and Italy. The Eucalypti in
                    particular possess many excellent qualities: their timber is of great
                    durability, strength, and toughness; they are rapid in growth; and <hi
                    rend="italic">E. Globulus,</hi> or blue gum, is reputed to purify the
                    surrounding air from malaria, and is frequently found 300-350 feet high, while

                    larger dimensions. These, along with <hi rend="italic">E. resinifera,</hi> iron
                    bark tree, and <hi rend="italic">E. marginata,</hi> Australian mahogany,
                    “jarrah,” are reported to be abundant in many parts of Australia. Other
                    principal trees, chiefly in the east, are <hi rend="italic">Cedrela Toona,</hi>
                    or red cedar, <hi rend="italic">Gmelina Leichardti, Araucaria Cunninghamii,</hi>
                    or the Moreton Bay pine, and <hi rend="italic">Castanospermum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">australe,</hi> or Moreton Bay chestnut. In Western Australia,
                    amongst other forest trees of note, are the raspberry-scented acacia <hi
                    rend="italic">(A. acuminata)</hi> and sandalwood <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Fusanus</hi><hi rend="italic">spicatus).</hi> A simpler system of forest
                    management than the elaborate organizations of France, Germany, or Scandinavia
                    is applicable to thinly peopled colonies. In the province of Victoria a State
                    Forest Board was appointed in 1867, and maps have been prepared showing the
                    distribution of the principal trees within its bounds, the proposed reserves,
                    and the forest ranges. A Planting Encouragement Act was passed in 1872. By the
                    formation of the board, with an inspector of forests to aid by advice, provision
                    has been made for the preservation of existing woods and young plantations. The
                    first annual report appeared in 1875, from which we find that the total area of
                    reserves is 1,805 square miles, estimated to contain 400,000 trees, yielding an
                    average of 700 superficial feet. There is a large state nursery, and there has
                    been great success in planting exotic trees, <hi rend="italic">Abies
                    Douglasii,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cedrus</hi><hi rend="italic">Deodara,

                    >torulosa,</hi> &amp;c. These measures have been introduced mainly by the energy
                    of Baron von Müller, the Government botanist in Victoria. Attention is directed
                    to the subject in other Australian colonies, where there is an equal call for
                    action, and a beginning towards conservation has already been made in
                    Queensland. Even firewood in some places is now scarce; and the demands for
                    mining and various industrial pursuits render it needful to import timber from
                    other countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">South Australia.—</hi> Dr R. Schomburgk reports in 1878 that
                    three valuable forest trees have been successfully introduced, and are
                    recommended to the forest board :—(1) the American ash, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraxinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Americana,</hi> which has been largely grown in
                    the forest reserves; (2) English elm, <hi rend="italic">Ulmus campestris·,</hi>
                    and (3) the plane tree, <hi rend="italic">Platanus orientalis.</hi> With regard
                    to replanting the country with roadside trees and clumps, the individual
                    enterprise of farmers, agriculturists, and landowners must be looked to.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Tasmania</hi> the arboreous forms are similar to those of
                    Australia. Eucalypti are even more abundant, and the acaciae begin to disappear.
                    It is remarkable that these two genera should be wholly absent in New Zealand.
                    The vast forests of Western Tasmania are extensively utilized for timber. (See
                    Bentham and Müller’s <hi rend="italic">Flora of A ustralia</hi> and Hooker’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Flora of Tasmania.</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >New Zealand.—</hi> One of the richest portions of the globe as regards
                    arboreous vegetation is the colony of New Zealand. It enjoys a climate similar
                    to that of the south of Europe; the vegetation is most luxuriant, and many
                    tropical plants flourish, while conifers, characteristic of colder regions, also
                    abound. In Britain the number of indigenous timber trees is only 35 out of a
                    flora of 1400 species, while New Zealand has 113 timber trees in a flora of only
                    about 1000 species. The most valuable tree of New Zealand is the kauri <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dammara australis),</hi> which grows only in the northern island.
                    It attains the height of 120-160 feet and is 5-12 feet in diameter, is
                    unrivalled for masts, and has long been exported to British dockyards for that
                    purpose. The value for 7 years ending December 1873 from Auckland of kauri alone
                    amounted to £144,000, against £19,739 of all other timber. Besides timber, kauri
                    resin, obtained in great masses, is exported. In ten years the value amounted to
                    £1,171,949; the price varies from £33 to £39 per ton. Other valuable trees are
                    totara <hi rend="italic">(Podocarpus totara)</hi> and matai <hi rend="italic"
                    >(P.</hi><hi rend="italic">spicata),</hi> both found throughout the colony, and,
                    like the kauri, yielding timber of great durability and strength, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Vitex litteralis,</hi> or New Zealand teak, esteemed more lasting
                    than any other native wood. There are several species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fagus,</hi> forming beech forest, and many other trees yield valuable wood, as
                    <hi rend="italic">Leptospermum ericoides,</hi> the tea-tree, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Santalum Cunninghamii,</hi> sandalwood. The forest area in New
                    Zealand was calculated to have been 20,370 000 acres in 1830, and 12,130,000
                    acres in 1873, by Dr Hector. The public were permitted to fell in the forests on
                    payment of a small licence fee, and reckless unchecked felling has been the
                    consequence. Such rapid deforesting of these densely wooded islands has
                    naturally created an alarm in the legislature, and the Government in 1872 passed
                    a Forest Planting Encouragement Act, offering a bonus for land cropped with
                    trees. Several large plantations have been formed, and the Government has shown
                    itself awake to the importance of the subject. In 1876 Captain Campbell Walker,
                    an experienced officer of the 1 ndian forest service, was requested to examine
                    the resources of the New Zealand forests, and to propose a scheme of working
                    them. His report was presented to both Houses of Assembly in 1877, and deserves
                    the earnest attention of the New Zealand Government. In this richly wooded
                    country clearings have been made with rapidity, and the great work now must be
                    to preserve and propagate the valuable indigenous trees. An idea of the vastness
                    of forest operations in New Zealand is derived from the fact that there are 125
                    steam or water-power saw-mills at work, turning out 103,039,037 superficial feet
                    in 1876, and from each of these mills a tramway is laid down penetrating into
                    the forests; the rails are generally of wood, and the haulage is by horses. It
                    is understood that large forest tracts are to be demarcated and placed under the
                    control of Government officers. In this way only can a regular system of forest
                    management be carried out, and the temptation to obtain quick returns by sale of
                    valuable forest avoided.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Africa.</hi></p>
                <p>A large extent of the continent of Africa is arid and treeless; the drought in
                    the desert is so great that no tree can resist it. But many parts are now
                    ascertained to be rich in wood, and recent discoveries by Baker, Livingstone,
                    Cameron, and Stanley have opened up vast regions where much beautiful timber
                    abounds. The Atlas Mountains are covered with magnificent forests, containing
                    eight species of oak, <hi rend="italic">Pistacia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Acacia
                    arabica,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cedrus atlantica,</hi> closely allied to if not
                    the same species as <hi rend="italic">C. Libani</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deodara,</hi> and many other trees. To the south of the Atlas, on the borders
                    of the great Sahara, are large tracts covered with date palms. The Sudan region
                    has few trees; among these are the baobab <hi rend="italic">(Adansonia),</hi>
                    tamarind, sycamore, fig, the doom and oil palms, with a few thorny acacias.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Algeria.—</hi> The forests consist mainly of the Aleppo pine
                    <hi rend="italic">(Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">halepensis),</hi> the cork oak
                    <hi rend="italic">(Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Suber), Q. Ilex,</hi> the Atlas
                    cedar <hi rend="italic">(Cedrus atlantica),</hi> and the Atlas cypress <hi
                    rend="italic">(Callitris quadrivalvis);</hi> associated with these are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">castaneaefolia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Q.</hi><hi rend="italic">ballota,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Pinaster,</hi> and other species. The forest area
                    is thus distributed :— state forests, 4,657,567 acres; communal forests,
                    191,487; total, 4,849,054 acres. About two-thirds of this area is under the
                    management of the forest service, the rest having been granted on long leases
                    for cork production or olive culture. Cork is one of the most valuable of
                    Algerian products, each tree yielding six to eight francs worth at a stripping.
                    A large amount of bark for tanning and 50,000 tons of alpha grass are exported
                    from the province. Conservancy has not yet proved remunerative, but with the
                    extension of railroads an increase of revenue is expected (Major Seaton). The
                    consul-general for Algeria alludes in the following terms to the evils which
                    have attended the deforesting of Tunis :—</p>
                <p>“Nothing is more certain than that forests and tracts of brushwood not only
                    prevent the evaporation of moisture by protecting the surface of the earth from
                    the sun’s rays, hut they serve to retain the light clouds which otherwise would
                    be dissipated, until they attain sufficient consistence to descend in rain or
                    refreshing mists. A hill side deprived of the forest ∙whose foliage acted as a
                    huge parasol to the ground, and whose roots served to retain the vegetable soil
                    which was formed by its decay, very soon loses the power of generating vegetable
                    life at all. The rich mould gets washed by winter rains into the valleys; in the

                    disappear, leaving a residuum which is only capable of supporting vegetation
                    when it becomes fertilized by an exceptional amount of moisture, which, as time
                    progresses, must become rarer and rarer, like the efforts of the spendthrift to
                    live off income, and spending every year a portion of his capital."—Colonel R.

                    110 years ago alluded to the forests through which he passed, where not a tree
                    is now to be seen. Dr Shaw and Desfontaines the botanist mention the Aleppo pine
                    and the making of pitch, but the wide plain over which they journeyed is now
                    treeless, and the forest described by the latter in 1784 has quite
                    disappeared.</p>

                    the bark. From the compact green appearance of the foliage of a mass of baobab
                    Cape de Verd is said to have received its name. The Guinea palm <hi

                    oil. Valuable gums, as copal, &amp;c., are also obtained from both the east and
                    west coasts; and with the prospective opening up of Central Africa many valuable
                    forest products will certainly come into commerce.</p>

                    is formed almost impenetrable to the sun. Here and there are chinks and
                    skylights through which the sun shoots in and falls upon the tree trunks and
                    ground in gleams and splashes of crystal light. There is not much undergrowth,
                    for that kind of vegetation cannot exist without sunshine, and in the virgin

                    occasional droughts of extreme severity. But South Africa possesses a great
                    variety of forest trees, yielding timber of great strength and beauty; they are,

                    building and fuel has necessitated an annual outlay of £20,000 for imported
                    timber. To supply the wants of the people, to provide shelter, and to improve
                    the sanitary condition of the island, the local Government adopted measures some
                    years ago for forming plantations on the higher elevations. The Australian

                <p>From this sketch of the principal forest lands of the world it appears that,
                    although the progress of civilization and the increase of population have
                    greatly diminished the area of forests in many countries, they still cover a
                    large portion of the earth’s surface, and the necessity of maintaining them is
                    now generally recognized. It is beyond doubt that these vast wooded tracts
                    affect most powerfully the economy of the globe. The direct influences may be
                    summarized from the results arrived at by Humboldt and others:—(1) By screening
                    the soil from the heat of the sun’s rays; (2) by the immense surface these
                    leaves offer to the cooling process of radiation; and (3) by the copious
                    evaporation of moisture from the leaves. Some of the indirect benefits which
                    thus accrue from the presence of forests may be mentioned, such as the
                    maintenance of equable temperature and humidity, the affording of protection and
                    shelter, the control of the regular flow of rivers, and the supply of perennial
                    springs which fertilize and beautify the country. It is the climatic and
                    physical importance of a due proportion of wooded land, independent of the
                    utility of forest products in innumerable arts which now contribute to our
                    comfort and progress, that has at length awakened most of the civilized
                    Governments to the necessity of protecting forests from ruthless spoliation. The
                    following general conclusions adopted in 1851 by the British Association
                    committee already referred to contain principles which, although limited in the
                    first instance to British India, have been found more or less applicable to all
                    countries :—</p>
                <p>1. That over large portions of the globe there is still an almost uncontrolled
                    destruction of the indigenous forests in progress, from the wasteful habits of
                    the population.</p>
                <p>2. That where conservancy has been introduced, considerable improvement has
                    already taken place.</p>
                <p>3. That these improvements may be extended by a rigid enforcement of the present
                    regulations, and the enactment of additional provisions of the following
                    character, viz.,—careful maintenance of the forest by valuation surveys and
                    working plans, and by the preservation or plantation of seedlings in place of
                    mature trees removed, —nurseries being established; prohibition of cutting until
                    trees are well grown, with rare and special exceptions for peculiar purposes;
                    and provision, in the case of trees yielding gums, resins, or other valuable
                    products, that greater care be taken in tapping or notching the trees, most
                    serious damage in some countries resulting from neglect in this operation.</p>
                <p>4. That especial attention should be given to the preservation and maintenance of
                    the forests occupying tracts unsuited for other culture, whether by reason of
                    altitude or peculiarities of physical structure.</p>
                <p>5. That in a country to which the maintenance of its water supplies is of extreme
                    importance, the indiscriminate clearing of forests around the localities whence
                    those supplies are derived is greatly to be deprecated.</p>
                <p>6. That it is a duty to prevent the excessive waste of wood, the timbers useful
                    for building and manufactures being reserved and husbanded.</p>
                <p>7. That as much local ignorance prevails as to the number and nature of valuable
                    forest products, measures should be taken to supply through the officers in
                    charge information calculated to diminish such ignorance.</p>
                <p>Necessity has caused the adoption of these principles in many lands of both the
                    New and the Old World, and forestry will henceforth be studied as a science as
                    well as practised as an art. It is manifestly of the greatest importance that,
                    in the progressive development of great countries, just and enlightened
                    principles should influence the views and actions of those who are charged with
                    the duty of advising Government in regard to the material resources committed to
                    their care for behoof of present and future generations.</p>

                <p>One of the most cherished prerogatives of the king of England, at the time when
                    his power was at the highest, was that of converting any portion of the country
                    into a forest in which he might enjoy the pleasures of the chase. The earliest
                    struggles between the king and the people testify to the extent to which this
                    prerogative became a public grievance, and the charter by which its exercise was
                    bounded (Charta de Foresta) was in substance part of the great constitutional
                    code imposed by his barons upon King John. At common law it appears to have been
                    the right of the king to make a forest where he pleased, provided that certain
                    legal formalities were observed. The king having a continual care for the
                    preservation of the realm, and for the peace and quiet of his subjects, he had
                    therefore amongst many privileges this prerogative, viz., to have his place of
                    recreation wheresoever he would appoint.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    once afforested became subject to a peculiar system of laws, which, as well as
                    the formalities required to constitute a valid afforestment, have been carefully
                    ascertained by the Anglo-Norman lawyers. “A forest,” says Man wood, “is a
                    certain territory of woody grounds and fruitful pastures, privileged for wild
                    beasts and fowls of forest, chase, and warren to rest, and abide there in the
                    safe protection of the king, for his delight and pleasure; which territory of
                    ground so privileged is mered and bounded with unremovable marks, meres, and
                    boundaries, either known by matter of record or by prescription; and also
                    replenished with wild beasts of venery or chase, and with great coverts of vert,
                    for the succour of the said beasts there to abide: for the preservation and
                    continuance of which said place, together with the vert and venison there are
                    particular officers, laws, and privileges belonging to the same, requisite for
                    that purpose, and proper only to a forest and to no other place.”<note

                    author distinguishes a forest, as “the highest franchise of princely pleasure,”
                    from the inferior franchises of chase, park, and warren—named iu the order of
                    their importance. The forest embraces all these, and it is distinguished by
                    having laws and courts of its own, according to which offenders are justiceable.
                    Au offender in a chase is to be punished by the common law; an offender in a
                    forest by the forest law. A chase is much the same as a park, only the latter is
                    enclosed, and all of them are distinguished according to the class of wild
                    beasts to which the privilege extended. Thus beasts of forest (the “five wild
                    beasts of venery”) were the hart, the hind, the hare, the boar, and the wolf.
                    The beasts of chase were also five, viz., the buck, the doe, the fox, the
                    marten, and the roe. The beasts and fowls of warren were the hare, the coney,
                    the pheasant, and the partridge. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Game Laws.)</hi></p>
                <p>The courts of the forest were three in number, viz., the court of attachments,
                    swanimote, and justice-seat. The court of attachments (called also the
                    wood-mote) is held for the foresters to bring in their attachments concerning
                    any hurt done to vert or venison <hi rend="italic">(in,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >viridi et venatione)</hi> in the forest, and for the verderers to receive and
                    mark the same, but no conviction takes place. The swanimote is the court to
                    which all the freeholders within the forest owe suit and service, and of which
                    the verderers are the judges. In this court all offences against the forest laws
                    may be tried, but no judgment or punishment follows. This is reserved for the
                    justice-seat, to which the rolls of offences presented at the court of
                    attachment, and tried at the swanimote, are presented by verderers. The
                    justice-seat is the court of the chief justice in eyre, who, says Coke, “is
                    commonly a man of greater dignity than knowledge of the laws of the forests; and
                    therefore where justice-seats are to be held some other persons whom the king
                    shah, appoint are associated with him, who together are to determine <hi
                    rend="italic">omnia</hi><hi rend="italic">placita</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >foreslae.”</hi> There were two chief justices for the forests <hi rend="italic"
                    >intra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ultra Trentam</hi> respectively. The necessary
                    officers of a forest are a steward, verderers, foresters, regardera, agisters,
                    and woodwards. The verderer was a judicial officer chosen in full county by the
                    freeholders in the same manner as the coroner. His office was to view and
                    receive the attachments of the foresters, and to mark them on his rolls A
                    forester was “an officer sworn to preserve the vert and venison in the forest,
                    and to attend upon the wild beasts within his bailwick.” The regardera were of
                    the nature of visitors: their duty was to make a regard <hi rend="italic"
                    >(visitatio nemorum)</hi> every third year, to inquire of all offences, and of
                    the concealment of such offences by any officer of the forest. The business of
                    the agister was to look after the pasturage of the forest, and to receive the
                    payments for the same by persons entitled to pasture their cattle in the
                    forests. Both the pasturage and the payment were called “agistment.”</p>
                <p>The legal conception of a forest was thus that of a definite territory within
                    which the code of the forest law prevailed to the exclusion of the common law.
                    The ownership of the soil might be in any one, but the rights of the proprietor
                    were limited by the laws made for the protection of the king’s wild beasts.
                    These laws, enforced by fines often arbitrary and excessive, were a great
                    grievance to the unfortunate owners of land within or in the neighourhood of the
                    forest. The offence of “purpresture” may be cited as an example. This was an
                    encroachment on the forest rights, by building a house within the forest, and it
                    made no difference whether the land belonged to the builder or not. In either
                    case it was an offence punishable by fines at discretion. And if a man converted
                    woodlands within the forest into arable land, he was guilty of the offence known
                    as “assarting,” whether the covert belonged to himself or not.</p>
                <p>The hardships of the forest laws under the Norman kings, and their extension to
                    private estates by the process of afforestment, were among the grievances which
                    united the barons and people against the king in the reign of John. The Great
                    Charter of King John contains clauses relating to the forest laws, but no
                    separate charter of the forest. The first charter of the forest is that of Henry
                    III., issued in 1217. “As an important piece of legislation,” says Professor
                    Stubbs,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Documents Illustrative of English History,</hi> ρ. 338.</p></note>
                    “it must be compared with the forest assize of 1184, and with 44th, 47th, and
                    48th clauses of the charter of John. It is observable that most of the abuses,
                    which are remedied by it are regarded as having sprung up since the accession of
                    Henry IL; but the most offensive afforestations have been made under Richard and
                    John. These latter are at once disafforested; but those of Henry II. only so far
                    as they had been carried out to the injury of the landowners and outside of the
                    royal demesne.” Land which bad thus been once forest land and was afterwards
                    disafforested was known as <hi rend="italic">purlieu—</hi> derived by Manwood,
                    from the French <hi rend="italic">pur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lieιι,</hi>
                    i.e., “a place exempt from the forest.” The forest laws still applied in a
                    modified manner to the purlieu. The benefit of the disafforestment existed only
                    for the owner of the lands; as to all other persons the land was forest still,
                    and the king’s wild beasts-were to “have free recourse therein and safe return
                    to the forest, without any hurt or destruction other than by the owners of the
                    lands in the purlieu where they shall be found, and that only to hunt and chase
                    them back again towards the forest without any forestalling” (Manwood, <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Forest Laws—</hi> article “Purlieu”).</p>
                <p>The revival of the forest laws was one of the means.</p>

                    the royal forests in Essex were so enlarged that they were hyperbolically said
                    to include the whole county. The earl of Southampton was nearly ruined by a
                    decision that stripped him of his estate near the New Forest. The boundaries of
                    Rockingham Forest were increased from six miles to sixty, and enormous fines
                    imposed on the trespassers,—Lord Salisbury being assessed in £20,000, Lord
                    Westmoreland in £19,000, Sir Christopher Hatton in £12,000 (Hallam’s <hi

                    their boundaries in the twentieth year of James, all subsequent enlargements
                    being annulled. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
