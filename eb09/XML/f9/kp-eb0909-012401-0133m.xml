                    familiarized himself with the Greek and Roman classics, especially with the
                    poets; and when the common need compelled him to work for bread as well as for
                    knowledge, his choice fell, under the influence of Reinhold’s teaching, on
                    divine philosophy. Limiting his worldly wants to the utmost, he devoted himself
                    heart and soul to the research of truth in its higher fields, and at twenty he
                    had already made his mark as a powerful thinker by various philosophical essays.
                    The influence of these early studies is apparent in the great works on which his
                    special reputation rests. But his attention was soon concentrated on the subject
                    to which his life was to be devoted, the science of legislation. He now sat at
                    the feet of Schaubert and Hufeland, and the study of natural law and of
                    jurisprudence excited in him a genuine enthusiasm. The early essays of his
                    student years bore the impress of one of those mighty minds by which beneficent
                    revolutions are wrought, and which open new paths to the race. In</p>
                <p>1795 he obtained his degree of doctor in philosophy; and published one of his
                    firstlings, as he calls it, an essay on the only possible arguments against the
                    existence and the value of natural law. The same year he married. In</p>
                <p>1796 he published a <hi rend="italic">Critique of Natural Law</hi> as preparation
                    <hi rend="italic">(Propädeutik')</hi> for a <hi rend="italic">Science of Natural
                    Law.</hi> This was followed in 1798, by his <hi rend="italic">Anti-Hobbes,</hi>
                    a dissertation on the limits of the civil power, and the right of resistance on
                    the part of subjects against their rulers, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Untersuchungen</hi><hi rend="italic">über das Verbrechen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Hochverraths.</hi> In 1799 he obtained his degree of doctor of laws, and
                    received permission to deliver a course of academical lectures. These attracted
                    many hearers, and soon won for him the rank of a master in his science. At the
                    same time appeared an important work, which established his reputation, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Revision der</hi><hi rend="italic">Grundsätze und Grundbegriffe
                    des peinlichen Rechts.</hi> In this treatise he first set forth his new theory
                    of punishment, the intimidation theory, which was further developed and applied
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek</hi><hi rend="italic">fur die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">peinliche Rechtswissenschaft,</hi> a work produced by Feuerbach in
                    conjunction with Grolman and Von Almendingen, and published in 1800- 1801, and
                    was systematically and thoroughly expounded in his famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lehrbuch des gemeinen</hi><hi rend="italic">in Deutschland</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">geltenden peinlichen Rechts</hi> (1801), of which the fourteenth
                    edition appeared in 1847. In these works Feuerbach shows himself not only a
                    great thinker and discoverer of truth, but also a gifted teacher and luminous
                    expositor, capable of giving to principles a scientific form, and investing them
                    with the grace and elegance of the highest literary art. His works were a
                    powerful protest against vindictive punishments, and contributed largely to the
                    subsequent humane reformation of criminal laws. Nor was the example of his style
                    without influence on later writers on law. In 1801 Feuerbach was appointed
                    professor at the university of Jena; but many offers were made to him, and in
                    the following year he accepted a chair at Kiel. This he held for two years,
                    lecturing on the law of nature, criminal law, the institutes, the pandects, and
                    hermeneutics. But, disappointed at not finding so numerous, sympathizing, or
                    promising an audience as he had expected, he removed in 1804 to the university
                    of Landshut. He was also named aulic councillor, and was commanded by the king,
                    Maximilian Joseph, to draw up a project of penal law for Bavaria. His position,
                    however, was rendered painful and annoying by the jealousies and dislike of some
                    of his fellow professors, who instigated the students to burlesque and ridicule
                    him, and he resigned his chair. He was then called to Munich with the rank of
                    privy referendary in the department of justice, and in 1808 was created privy
                    councillor. Meanwhile appeared his <hi rend="italic">Critique on
                    Klein-schrod</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s project of criminal law</hi> (1804); and
                    the practical reform of penal legislation in Bavaria was begun under his
                    influence in 1806 by the abolition of torture. In 1808 appeared the first volume
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Merkwürdige</hi><hi rend="italic">Criminal-falle,</hi>
                    completed in 1811—a work of deep interest for its application of psychological
                    considerations to cases of crime, and intended to illustrate the inevitable
                    imperfection of human laws in their application to individuals. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Betrachtungen über das Geschworenengericht</hi> (1812) Feuerbach
                    declared against trial by jury, maintaining that the verdict of a jury was not
                    adequate legal proof of a crime. Much controversy was aroused on the subject,
                    and the author’s view was subsequently to some extent modified. His labours on
                    the penal law being completed, the project was submitted to rigorous
                    examination, and, receiving ultimately the royal sanction, was promulgated in
                    1813 as the Bavarian penal code. The influence of this code, the embodiment in
                    logical form of Feuerbach’s enlightened and humane views, was immense. It was at
                    once adopted as the model and basis for new codes for Würtemberg and
                    Saxe-Weimar; it was adopted in its entirety in the grand-duchy of Oldenburg; and
                    it was translated into Swedish by order of the king. Several of the Swiss
                    cantons reformed their codes in conformity with it. Feuerbach had also
                    undertaken to prepare a civil code for Bavaria, to be founded on the Code
                    Napoléon. This was afterwards set aside, and the Codex Maximilianus adopted as a
                    basis. But the project did not become law. During the war of liberation
                    (1813-1814) Feuerbach showed himself an ardent patriot, and published several
                    political brochures, which, from the writer’s position, had almost the weight of
                    state manifestoes. One of these is entitled <hi rend="italic">Ueber Deutsche
                    Freiheit</hi><hi rend="italic">und Vertretung Deutscher</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Volker</hi><hi rend="italic">durch Landstande</hi> (1814). In 1814 Feuerbach
                    was appointed second president of the court of appeal at Bamberg, and three
                    years later he became first president of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0134-0125"/> the court of appeal at Anspach. In 1821 he was
                    deputed by the Government to visit France, Belgium, aud the Rhine provinces for
                    the purpose of investigating their juridical institutions; and in 1825 he
                    published, as the fruit of this visit, his treatise <hi rend="italic">Ueber
                    die</hi><hi rend="italic">Gerichtsverfassung</hi><hi rend="italic">und
                    das</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">mJ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >etliche Verfahren Frankreichs.</hi> In his later years he took a deep interest
                    in the fate of Kaspar Hauser, which had excited so much attention in Europe; and
                    he was the first to publish a critical summary of the ascertained facts, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Kaspar</hi><hi rend="italic">Hauser: ein Beispiel
                    eines Verbrechens</hi><hi rend="italic">am</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Seelenleben</hi> (1832). Shortly before his death appeared a collection of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Kleine</hi><hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi> (1833). Feuerbach,
                    still in the full enjoyment of his intellectual powers, died suddenly at
                    Frankfort, while on his way to the baths of Schwalbach, May 29, 1833. In 1852
                    was published the <hi rend="italic">Leben</hi><hi rend="italic">und Wirken Ans.
                    von Feuerbachs,</hi> 2 vols., consisting of a selection of his letters and
                    journals, with occasional notes by his fourth son Ludwig, the distinguished
