                <p><label type="entry">FRIENDLY SOCIETIES</label>, according to the comprehensive
                    definition of the Friendly Societies Act 1875, which now regulates such
                    societies in Great Britain and Ireland, are “societies established to provide by
                    voluntary subscriptions of the members thereof, with or without the aid of
                    donations, for the relief or maintenance of the members, their husbands, wives,
                    children, fathers, mothers, brothers or sisters, nephews or nieces, or wards
                    being orphans, during sickness or other infirmity, whether bodily or mental, in
                    old age, or in widowhood, or for the relief or maintenance of the orphan
                    children of members during minority; for insuring money to be paid on the birth
                    of a member’s child, or on the death of a member, or for the funeral expenses of
                    the husband, wife, or child of a member, or of the widow of a deceased member,
                    or, as respects persons of the Jewish persuasion, for the payment of a sum of
                    money during the period of confined mourning; for the relief or maintenance of
                    the members when on travel in search of employment, or when in distressed
                    circumstances, or in case of shipwreck, or loss or damage of or to boats or
                    nets; for the endowment of members or nominees of members at any age; for the
                    insurance against fire to any amount not exceeding £15 of the tools or
                    implements of the trade or calling of the members”—and are limited in their
                    contracts for assurance of annuities to £50, and for assurance of a gross sum to
                    £200. They may be described in a more popular and condensed form of words as the
                    mutual assurance societies of the poorer classes, by which they seek to aid each
                    other in the emergencies arising from sickness and death and other causes of
                    distress. A phrase in the first Act for the encouragement and relief of friendly
                    societies, passed in 1793, designating them “societies of good fellowship,”
                    indicates another useful phase of their operations.</p>
                <p>The origin of the friendly society is, probably in all countries, the burial
                    club. It has been the policy of every religion, if indeed it is not a common
                    instinct of humanity, to surround the disposal of a dead body with circumstances
                    of pomp and expenditure, often beyond the means of the surviving relatives. The
                    appeal for help to friends and neighbours which necessarily follows is soon
                    organized into a system of mutual aid, that falls in naturally with the
                    religious ceremonies by which honour is done to tho dead. Thus Archdeacon Gray
                    tells us that in China there are burial societies, termed “long-life loan
                    companies,” in almost all the towns and villages. Among the Greeks the <hi
                    rend="italic">tpavoι</hi> combined the religious with the provident element.
                    From the Greeks the Romans derived their fraternities of a similar kind. The
                    Teutons in like manner had their guilds. Whether the English friendly society
                    owes its origin in the higher degree to the Roman or the Teutonic influence can
                    hardly be determined. The utility of providing by combination for the ritual
                    expenditure upon burial having been ascertained, the next step—to render mutual
                    assistance in circumstances of distress generally—was an easy one, and we find
                    it taken by the Greek <hi rend="italic">epavoι</hi> and by our own guilds.
                    Another modification—that the societies should consist not so much of neighbours
                    as of persons having the same occupation— soon arises; and this is the germ of
                    our trade unions and our city companies in their original constitution. The
                    interest, however, that these enquiries possess is mainly antiquarian. The legal
                    definition of a friendly society quoted above points to an organization more
                    complex than those of the ancient fraternities and guilds, and proceeding upon
                    different principles. It may be that the one has grown out of the other. The
                    common element of a provision for a contingent event by a joint contribution is
                    in both; but the friendly society alone has attempted to define with precision
                    what is the risk against which it intends to provide, and what should be the
                    contributions of the members to meet that risk.</p>
                <p>It would be curious to endeavour to trace how, after the suppression of the
                    religious guilds in the 16th century, and the substitution of an organized
                    system of relief by the poor law of Elizabeth for the more voluntary and casual
                    means of relief that previously existed, the present system of friendly
                    societies grew up. The modern friendly society, particularly in rural districts,
                    clings with fondness to its annual feast and procession to church, its
                    procession of all the brethren on the occasion of the funeral of one of them,
                    and other incidents which are almost obviously survivals of the customs of
                    mediaeval guilds. The last recorded guild was in existence in 1628, and there
                    are records of friendly societies as early as 1634 and 1639. The connecting
                    links, however, cannot be traced. With the exception of a society in the port of
                    Borrowstounness on the Firth of Forth, no existing friendly society is known to
                    be able to trace back its history beyond a date late in tho 17th century, and no
                    records remain of any that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0816-0781"/> might have existed in the latter half of the 16th
                    century or the greater part of the 17th One founded in 1666 was extant in 1850,
                    but it has since ceased to exist. This is not so surprising as it might appear.
                    Documents which exist in manuscript only are much less likely to have been
                    preserved since the invention of printing than they were before; and such would
                    be the simple rules and r words of any society that might have existed during
                    this interval—if, indeed, many of them kept records at all. How usual is it for
                    a voluntary society of any kind to die away with the generation of men among
                    whom it was founded! On the whole, it seems probable therefore that the friendly
                    society is a lineal descendant of the ancient guild—the idea never having wholly
                    died out, but having been kept up from generation to generation in a succession
                    of small and scattered societies.</p>
                <p>At the same time, it seems probable that the friendly society of the present day
                    owes its revival to a great extent to the Protestant refugees of Spitalfields,
                    one of whose societies was founded in 1703, and has continued for 176 years
                    among descendants of the same families, whose names proclaim their Norman
                    origin. This society has distinguished itself by the intelligence with which it
                    has adapted its machinery to the successive modifications of the law, and has
                    very recently completely reconstructed its rules under the provisions of the
                    Friendly Societies Acts, 1875 and 1876.</p>
                <p>Another is the society of Lintot, founded in London in 1708, in which the office
                    of secretary has for more than hilf a century been filled by persons of the name
                    of Levesque, one of whom has published a translation of its original rules. No
                    one was to be received into the society who was not a member, or the descendant
                    of a member, of the church of Lintot, of recognized probity, a good Protestant,
                    and well-intentioned towards the queen [AnneJ and faithful to the Government of
                    the country. No one was to be admitted below the age of eighteen, or who had not
                    been received at holy communion, and become member of a church. A member should
                    not have a claim to relief during his first year’s membership, but if he fell
                    sick within the year, a collection should be made for him among the members.
                    This society has only 50 members, but its funds exceed £2000. The foreign names
                    still borne by a large proportion of the members show that the connexion with
                    descendants of the refugees is maintained.</p>
                <p>The example of providence given by these societies was so largely followed that
                    Sir George Rose’s Act in 1793 recognized the existence of numerous societies,
                    and provided encouragement for them in various ways, as well as relief from
                    taxation to an extent which in those days must have been of great pecuniary
                    value, and exemption from removal under the poor law. The benefits offered by
                    this statute were readily accepted by the societies, and the vast number of
                    societies which speedily became enrolled shows that Sir George Rose’s Act met a
                    real public want. In the county of Middlesex alone nearly a thousand societies
                    were enrolled within a very few years after the passing of the Act, and the
                    number in some other counties was almost as great. The societies then formed
                    were nearly all of a like kind,— small clubs, in which the feature of good
                    fellowship was in the ascendant, and that of provident assurance for sickness
                    and death merely accessory. This is indicated by one provision which occurs in
                    many of the early enrolled rules, viz., that the number of members shall be
                    limited to 61, 81, or 101, as the case may be. The odd 1 which occurs in these
                    numbers probably stands for the president or secretary, or is a contrivance to
                    ensure a clear majority. Several of these old societies are still in existence,
                    and can point to a prosperous career extending over (in some cases) more than
                    100 years—a prosperity based rather upon good luck than upon scientific
                    calculation. Founded among small tradesmen or persons in the way to thrive, the
                    claims for sickness were only made in cases where the sickness was accompanied
                    by distress, and even the funeral allowance was not always demanded.</p>
                <p>The societies generally not being established upon any scientific principle,
                    those which met with this prosperity were the exception to the rule; and
                    accordingly the cry that friendly societies were failing in all quarters was as
                    great in 1819 as in 1869. A writer of that time speaks of the instability of
                    friendly societies as “universal”; and the general conviction that this was so
                    resulted in the passing of the Act of 1819, 59 Geo. III. c. 128. It recites that
                    “the habitual reliance of poor persons upon parochial relief, rather than upou
                    their own industry, tends to the moral deterioration of the people and to the
                    accumulation of heavy burthens upon parishes; and it is desirable, with a view
                    as well to the reduction of the assessment made for the relief of the poor as to
                    the improvement of the habits of the people, that encouragement should be
                    afforded to persons desirous of making provision for themselves or their
                    families out of the fruits of their own industry. By the contributions of the
                    savings of many persons to one common fund the most effectual provision may be
                    made for the casualties affecting all the contributors; and it is therefore
                    desirable to afford further facilities and additional security to persons who
                    may be willing to unite in appropriating small sums from time to time to a
                    common fund for the purposes aforesaid, and it is desirable to protect such
                    persons from the effects of fraud or miscalculation.” This preamble went on to
                    recite that the provisions of preceding Acts had been found insufficient for
                    these purposes, and great abuses had prevailed in many societies established
                    under their authority. By this statute a friendly society was defined as “an
                    institution, whereby it is intended to provide, by contribution, on the
                    principle of mutual insurance, for the maintenance or assistance of the
                    contributors thereto, their wives or children, in sickness, infancy, advanced
                    age, widowhood, or any other natural state or contingency, whereof the
                    occurrence is susceptible of calculation by way of average.” It will be seen
                    that this Act dealt exclusively with the scientific aspect of the societies, and
                    had nothing to say to the element of good fellowship. Rules and tables were to
                    be submitted by the persons intending to form a society to the justices, who,
                    before confirming them, were to satisfy themselves that the contingencies which
                    the society was to provide against were within the meaning of the Act, and that
                    the formation of the society would be useful and beneficial, regard being had to
                    the existence of other societies in the same district. No tables or rules
                    connected with calculation were to be confirmed by the justices until they had
                    been approved by two persons at least, known to be professional actuaries or
                    persons skilled in calculation, as fit and proper, according to the most correct
                    calculation of which the nature of the case would admit. The justices in quarter
                    sessions were also by this Act authorized to publish general rules for the
                    formation and government of friendly societies within their county. The
                    practical effect of this statute in requiring that the societies formed under it
                    should be established on sound principles does not appear to have been as great
                    as might have been expected. The justices frequently accepted as “persons
                    skilled in calculation” local schoolmasters and others who had no real knowledge
                    of the technical difficulties of the subject, while the restrictions upon
                    registry served only to increase the number of societies established without
                    becoming registered. In 1829 the law relating to friendly societies was entirely
                    reconstructed by the 10 Geo. IV. c. 56, and a barrister was appointed under that
                    Act to examine the rules of societies, and ascertain that they were in
                    conformity to law and to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n817/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0817-0782"/> provisions of the Act. The barrister so appointed
                    was Mr John Tidd Pratt; and no account of friendly societies would be complete
                    that did not do justice to the remarkable public service rendered by this
                    gentleman. For forty years, though he had by statute really very slight
                    authority over the societies, his name exercised the widest influence, and the
                    numerous reports and publications by which he endeavoured to impress upon the
                    public mind sound principles of management of friendly societies, and to expose
                    those which were managed upon unsound principles, made him a terror to evil
                    doers. On the other hand, he lent with readiness the aid of his legal knowledge
                    and great mental activity to assisting well-intentioned societies in coming
                    within the provisions of the Acts, and thus gave many excellent schemes a legal
                    organization.</p>
                <p>By the Act of 1829, in lieu of the discretion as to whether the formation of the
                    proposed society would be useful and beneficial, and the requirement of the
                    actuarial certificate to the tables, it was enacted that the justices were to
                    satisfy themselves that the tables proposed to be used might be adopted with
                    safety to all parties concerned. This provision, of course, became a dead
                    letter, and was repealed in 1834 by 4 and 5 Wm. IV. c. 40. Thenceforth,
                    societies were free to establish themselves upon what conditions and with what
                    rates they chose, provided only they satisfied the barrister that the rules were
                    “calculated to carry into effect the intention of the parties framing them,” and
                    were “in conformity to law.” In 1846, by 9 and 10 Vic. c. 27, the barrister
                    certifying the rules was constituted “Registrar of Friendly Societies,” and the
                    rules of all societies were brought together under his custody. An actuarial
                    certificate was to be obtained before any society could be registered “for the
                    purpose of securing any benefit dependent on the laws of sickness and
                    mortality.” In 1850 the Acts were again repealed and consolidated with
                    amendments (13 and 14 Vic. c. 115). Societies were divided into two classes,
                    “certified” and “registered.” The certified societies were such as obtained a
                    certificate to their tables by an actuary possessing a given qualification, who
                    was required to set forth the data of sickness and mortality upon which he
                    proceeded, and the rate of interest assumed in the calculations. All other
                    societies were to be simply registered. Very few societies were constituted of
                    the “certified” class. The distinction of classes was repealed and the Acts were
                    again consolidated in 1855 by 18 and 19 Vic. c. 63. Under this Act, which
                    admitted of all possible latitude to the framers of rules of societies, 21,875
                    societies were registered, a large number of them being lodges or courts of
                    affiliated orders, and the Act continued in force till the end of 1875.</p>
                <p>The law which now regulates friendly societies in Great Britain was passed in
                    1875 (38 and 39 Vic. c. 60) and amended in 1876 (39 and .40 Vic. c. 32). It
                    still bears the permissive and elastic character which marked the more
                    successful of the previous Acts, but it provides ampler means to members of
                    ascertaining and remedying defects of management and of restraining fraud. The
                    business of registry is under the control of a chief registrar, who has an
                    assistant registrar in each of the three countries, with an actuary. It is his
                    duty, among other things to require from every society a return in proper form
                    each year of its receipts and expenditure, funds, and effects; a return once
                    every five years of the sickness and mortality it has experienced; and also once
                    every five years a valuation of its assets and liabilities. Upon the application
                    of a certain proportion of the members, varying according to the magnitude of
                    the society, the chief registrar may appoint an inspector to examine into its
                    affairs, or may call a general meeting of the members to consider and determine
                    any matter affecting its interests.</p>
                <p>These are powers which have been used with excellent effect. Cases have occurred
                    in which fraud has been detected and punished by this means that could not
                    probably have been otherwise brought to light. In others a system of
                    mismanagement has been exposed and effectually checked. The power of calling
                    special meetings has enabled societies to remedy defects in their rules, to
                    remove officers guilty of misconduct, &lt;kc,, where the procedure prescribed by
                    the rules was for some reason or other inapplicable. Upon an application of a
                    like proportion of members the chief registrar may, if he finds that the funds
                    of a society are insufficient to meet the existing claims thereon, or that the
                    rates of contribution are insufficient to cover the benefits assured (upon which
                    he consults his actuary), order the society to be dissolved, and direct how its
                    funds are to be applied.</p>
                <p>This legislation was the result of the labours of a Royal Commission of high
                    authority, presided over by Sir Stafford Northcote, which sat from 1870 to 1874,
                    and prosecuted an exhaustive inquiry into the organization and condition of the
                    various classes of friendly societies. Their reports occupy more than a dozen
                    large bluebooks. They divide registered friendly societies into 13 classes.</p>
                <p>The first class includes the affiliated societies or “orders,” such as the
                    Manchester Unity of Odd Fellows, the Ancient Order of Foresters, the Rechabites,
                    Druids, &amp;c. These societies have a central body, either situated in some
                    large town, as in the case of the Manchester Unity, or moving from place to
                    place, as in that of the Foresters. Under this central body, the country is (in
                    most cases) parcelled out into districts, and these districts again consist each
                    of a number of independent branches, called “lodges,” “courts,” “tents,” or
                    “divisions,” having a separate fund administered by themselves, but contributing
                    also to a fund under the control of the central body. The Manchester Unity has
                    (1878) 456 districts, 4121 lodges, 526,802 members, and £4,325,000 funds; the
                    Order of Foresters 287 districts, 4414 courts, 521,416 members, £2,497,000
                    funds. It may give an idea of the great utility of these societies to mention
                    that the various courts of Foresters paid their members 3,197,366 days’ sick pay
                    in a single year, and paid burial money on 4666 deaths. Besides these two great
                    orders, there are about forty smaller affiliated bodies, each having more than
                    1000 members; and the affiliated form of society appears to have great
                    attraction. Indeed, in the colony of Victoria, Australia, all the existing
                    friendly societies are of this class. The orders have their “secrets,” but
                    these, it may safely be said, are of a very innocent character, and merely serve
                    the purpose of identifying a member of a distant branch by his knowledge of the
                    “grip,” and of the current password, &amp;c. Indeed they are now so far from
                    being “secret societies” that their meetings are attended by reporters and the
                    debates published in the newspapers, and the Order of Foresters has recently
                    passed a wise resolution expunging from its publications all affectation of
                    mystery.</p>
                <p>The second class is made up of “general societies,” principally existing in
                    London, of which the Commissioners enumerated 8 with nearly 60,000 members, and
                    funds amounting to a quarter of a million; these societies are managed at a
                    cost, on the average, of about 10 per cent, of their income.</p>
                <p>The third class includes the “county societies,” of which there were 11, 10 of
                    which had £221,955 funds and 29,036 members, and 30 others approaching that
                    type. These societies have been but feebly supported by those for whose benefit
                    they are instituted, having all exacted high rates of contribution, in order to
                    secure financial soundness.</p>
                <p>Class 4, “local town societies,” is a very numerous one. Among some of the larger
                    societies may be mentioned the “Chelmsford Provident,” with £26,403 funds, and
                    2352 members; the “Brighton and Sussex Mutual,” with £35,752 funds, and 824
                    members; the “Cannon Street, Birmingham,” with £66,780 funds, and 8347 members;
                    the “Birmingham General Provident,” £37,997 funds, and 3379 members. In this
                    group might also be included the interesting societies which are established
                    among the Jewish community. They differ from ordinary friendly societies partly
                    in the nature of the benefits granted upon death, which are intended to
                    compensate for loss of employment during the time of ceremonial seclusion
                    enjoined by the Jewish law, which is called “sitting shiva.” They also provide a
                    cab for the mourners and rabbi, and a tombstone for the departed, and the same
                    benefits as an ordinary friendly society during sickness. Some also provide a
                    place of worship. Of these the “Pursuers of Peace” (enrolled in December 1797),
                    the “Bikhur Cholim, or Visitors of the Sick” (April 1798), the “Hozier Holim”
                    (1804), and nearly 50 others, of which 4 are courts of the Order of Foresters,
                    are on the register for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n818/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0818-0783"/> Middlesex. Mr Adler calculates that some 30 or 40
                    such societies are in existence in London. Two or three societies have been
                    certified (under the earlier Acts) for accumulating by weekly subscriptions a
                    fund for the purchase of flour and the baking of passover cakes.</p>
                <p>Class 5 is “local village and country societies,” including the small public
                    house clubs which abound in the villages and rural districts, a large proportion
                    of which are unregistered.</p>
                <p>Class 6 is formed of “particular trade societies.”</p>
                <p>Class 7 is “dividing societies.” These were before 1875 unauthorized by law,
                    though they were very attractive to the members. Their practice is usually to
                    start afresh every January, paying a subscription somewhat in excess of that
                    usually charged by an ordinary friendly society, out of which a sick allowance
                    is granted to any member who may fall sick during the year, and at Christmas the
                    balance not so applied is divided among the members equally, with the exception
                    of a small sum left to begin the new year with. The mischief of the system is
                    that, as there is no accumulation of funds, the society cannot provide for
                    prolonged sickness or old age, and must either break up altogether or exclude
                    its sick and aged members at the very time when they most need its help. This,
                    however, has not impaired the popularity of the societies, and the Act of 1875,
                    framed on the sound principle that the protection of the law should not be
                    withheld from any form of association, enables a society to be registered with a
                    rule for dividing its funds, provided only that all existing claims upon the
                    society are to be met before a division takes place.</p>
                <p>Class 8, “deposit friendly societies,” combine the characteristics of a savings
                    bank with those of a friendly society. They were devised by the late Hon. and
                    Rev. S. Best, on the principle that a certain proportion of the sick allowance
                    is to be raised out of a member s separate deposit account, which, if not so
                    used, is retained for his benefit. Their advantages are in the encouragement
                    they offer to saving, and in meeting the selfish objection sometimes raised to
                    friendly societies, that the man who is not sick gets nothing for his money;
                    their disadvantage is in their failing to meet cases of sickness so prolonged as
                    to exhaust the whole of the member’s own deposit.</p>
                <p>Class 9, “collecting societies,” are so called because their contributions are
                    received through a machinery of house-to-house collection. These were the
                    subject of much laborious investigation and close attention on the part of the
                    Commissioners. They deal with a lower class of the community, both with respect
                    to means and to intelligence, than that from which the members of ordinary
                    friendly societies are drawn. The large emoluments gained by the officers and
                    collectors, the high percentage of expenditure (often exceeding half the
                    contributions), and the excessive frequency of lapsing of insurances point to
                    mischiefs in their management. “The radical evil of the whole system (the
                    Commissioners remark) appears to us to lie in the employment of collectors,
                    otherwise than under the direct supervision and control of the members, a
                    supervision and control which we fear to be absolutely unattainable in burial
                    societies that are not purely local.” On the other hand, it must be conceded
                    that these societies extend the benefits of life insurance tò a class which the
                    other societies cannot reach, namely, the class that will not take the trouble
                    to attend at an office, but must be induced to effect an insurance by a
                    house-to-house canvasser, and be regularly visited by the collector to ensure
                    their paying the contributions. To many such persons these societies, despite
                    all their errors of constitution and management, have been of great benefit. The
                    great source of these errors lies in a tendency on the part of the managers of
                    the societies to,forget that they are simply trustees, and to look upon the
                    concern as their own personal property to be managed for their own benefit.
                    These societies are of two kinds, local and general. The Commissioners
                    enumerated 239 local societies, with over 680,000 members, and £203,777 funds;
                    and 20 of the more important general societies, with members estimated at
                    1,426,023, and funds at £461,605. For the general societies the Act of 1875
                    makes certain stringent provisions. Each member is to be furnished with a copy
                    of the rules for one penny, and a signed policy for the same charge. Forfeiture
                    of benefit for non-payment is not to be enforced without fourteen days’ written
                    notice. The transfer of a member from one society to another is not to be made
                    without his written consent and notice to the society affected. No collector is
                    to be a manager, or vote or take part at any meeting. At least one general
                    meeting shall be held every year, of which notice is to be given either by
                    advertisement or by letter or post card to each member. The balance sheet is to
                    be open for inspection seven days before the meeting, and is to be certified by
                    a public accountant, not an officer of the society. Disputes may be settled by
                    justices, or county courts, notwithstanding anything in the rules of the society
                    to the contrary. These provisions have certainly been found already very
                    beneficial; but much more would be done for the benefit of the classes
                    interested if the regulation which prevents the post office assuring less than
                    £20 were abrogated, and if a general system of collection through the post
                    office were established.</p>
                <p>’ Closely associated with the question of the management of these societies is
                    that of the risk incurred by infant life, through the facilities offered by
                    these societies for making insurances on the death of children. That this is a
                    real risk is certain from the records of the assizes, and from many
                    circumstances of suspicion; but the extent of it cannot be measured, and has
                    probably been exaggerated. It has never been lawful to assure more than £6 on
                    the death of a child under five years of age, or more than £10 on the death of
                    one under ten. Previous to the Act of 1875, however, there was no machinery for
                    ascertaining that the law was complied with, or for enforcing it This is
                    supplied by that Act, though still somewhat imperfectly. When the bill went up
                    to the House of Lords, an amendment was made, reducing the limit of assurance on
                    a child under three years of age to £3, but this amendment was unfortunately
                    disagreed with by the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>Class 10, annuity societies, prevail in the west of England. Six of these
                    societies had, at the date of the last published returns, 719 members, and
                    £79,136 funds. These societies are few, and their business is diminishing. Most
                    of them originated at the time when Government subsidized friendly societies by
                    allowing them £4, Ils. 3d. per cent, per annum interest. Now annuities may be
                    purchased direct from the National Debt Commissioners. These societies are more
                    numerous, however, in Ireland.</p>
                <p>Class 11, female societies, are numerous. Many of them resemble affiliated orders
                    at least in name, calling themselves Female Foresters, Odd Sisters, Loyal
                    Orangewomen, Comforting Sisters, and so forth. In their rules may be found such
                    a provision as that a member shall be fined who does not “behave as becometh an
                    Orangewoman.” Many are unregistered. In the northern counties of England they
                    are sometimes termed “life boxes,” doubtless from the old custom of placing the
                    contributions in a box. The trustees, treasurer, and committee are usually
                    females, but very frequently the secretary is a man, paid a small salary.</p>
                <p>Under Class 12 the Commissioners included the societies for various purposes
                    which were authorized by the secretary of state to be registered under the
                    Friendly Societies Act of 1855, comprising working (men’s clubs, and certain
                    specially authorized societies, as well as others that are now defined to be
                    friendly societies. Among these purposes are assisting members in search of
                    employment; assisting members during slack seasons of trade; granting temporary
                    relief to members in distressed circumstances; purchase of coals and other
                    necessaries to be supplied to members; relief or maintenance in case of
                    lameness, blindness, insanity, paralysis, or bodily hurt through accidents;
                    also, the assurance against loss by disease or death of cattle employed in trade
                    or agriculture; relief in case of shipwreck or loss or damage to boats or nets;
                    and societies for social intercourse, mutual helpfulness, mental and moral
                    improvement, rational recreation, &amp;c.. called working men’s clubs.</p>
                <p>Class 13 is cattle insurance societies.</p>
                <p>These are the thirteen classes into which the Commissioners divided registered
                    friendly societies. There were 26,034 societies enrolled or certified under the
                    various Acts for friendly societies in force between 1793 and 1855; and, as we
                    have seen, 21,875 societies registered under the Act of 1855 before the 1st
                    January 1876, when the Act of 1875 came into operation, The total therefore of
                    societies to which a legal constitution had been given was 47,909. Of these
                    26,087 were presumed to be in existence when the registrar called for his annual
                    return, but only 11,282 furnished the return required. These had3,404,187
                    members, and £9,336,946 funds. Twenty-two societies returned over 10,000 members
                    each; nine over 30,000. One society (the Royal Liver Friendly Society,
                    Liverpool, the largest of the collecting societies) returned 682,371 members.
                    The next in order was one of the same class, the United Assurance Society,
                    Liverpool, with 159,957 members; but in all societies of this class, the
                    membership consists very largely of infants. The average of members in the
                    11,260 societies with less than 10,000 members each is only 171, showing how
                    small in reality the bulk of Friendly Societies are. There are 58 societies with
                    more than £10,000 funds; 18 with more than £30,000. In these again the Royal
                    Liver heads the list with its £453,418; the next in succession being the Hearts
                    of Oak, a society belonging to the Commissioners’ second class, which has
                    £179,995.</p>
                <p>Such are the registered societies; but there remains behind a large body of
                    unregistered societies, estimated by the Commissioners to be in England nearly
                    co-extensive with, in Scotland far to surpass in magnitude, the registered
                    bodies. It is to be hoped that, as knowledge is spread of the advantages of

                    established become better understood, the number of unregistered societies, in
                    comparison with those registered, will become much less. It must be admitted,
                    however, that at present progress is not being made in that direction. The
                    classes among whom friendly societies are formed are greatly averse to any
                    undertaking involving mental labour, and the idea of periodical returns and of
                    the other requirements of the statute is more alarming to them than it need be.
                    It will be the province of those charged with the administration of the statute
                    to endeavour, as far as possible, to combat this tendency, and by wise use of
                    the materials in their hands to seek to show the societies that the registry
                    office is a ready and useful auxiliary to them, and that the trouble it gives
                    them is more than met by compensating advantages.</p>
                <p>The description we have given of the various classes of friendly societies, the
                    number of their members, and the amount of their funds leads to the most hopeful
                    conclusions as to their future. Though great loss has been occasioned by the
                    failure of societies and by errors in their constitution and management, the
                    provident habits of the people have survived all discouragement, and a fund has
                    been accumulated which may be loosely estimated at nearly 15 millions sterling,
                    contributed out of the savings of the flower of the working class. On every side
                    there is displayed a desire by the societies to increase the soundness of their
                    position, and to reform anything that may be wrong in their constitution.</p>
                <p>The colonies, also, are following the same course. In that of Victoria,
                    Australia, the report of the Government statist, Mr H. H. Hayter, shows that on
                    the 31st December 1876 there were 761 branches, belonging to 34 societies,
                    having 45,957 members, and assuring also sums at the death of 27,919 wives of
                    members. The amount of contribution made by each member is, under ordinary
                    circumstances, Is. weekly. The benefits consist of sick pay, medical attendance,
                    and funeral allowances. The sickness experienced during the year was 52,817
                    weeks, or nearly 7 working days per member, the number of members sick having
                    been 8,873. The usual sick pay is £1 per week for the first six months, reduced
                    to 10s. or sometimes 13s. 4d. for the next six months, and to 5s. or sometimes
                    10s. for the remainder of sickness. The deaths were 452, or very nearly 10 in
                    1000. The amount paid on death of a member is usually £20, and of a member’s
                    wife £10. It will be seen that the benefits are greater in amount than is usual
                    in societies in the mother country. The total income of the societies was
                    £163,593, and their funds amounted to £351,284. The number of societies,
                    members, and amount of income have about doubled during 10 years, the amount of
                    funds having accumulated even more rapidly. It may be added that the report in
                    question gives a more complete body of statistics relating to friendly societies
                    than has ever been attempted to be collected elsewhere.</p>
                <p>In foreign countries the development of friendly societies has been slow. Belgium
                    has a commission royale permanente des sociétés de secours mutuel, originally
                    presided over by Μ. Visschers, and since by Μ. T’Kint de Rooden-beke. In France,
                    under the second empire, a scheme was prepared for assisting friendly societies
                    by granting them collective assurances under Government security. The societies
                    have the privilege of investing their funds in the Caisse des Depots et
                    Consignations, corresponding to the</p>
                <p>English National Debt Commission. In Germany a law was passed on the 7th April
                    1876 on registered friendly societies. It prescribes for societies many things
                    which in England are left to the discretion of their founders; and it provides
                    for an amount of official interference in their management that is wholly
                    unknown here. The superintending authority has a right to inspect the books of
                    every society, whether registered or not, and to give formal notice to a society
                    to call in arrears, exclude defaulters, pay benefits, or revoke illegal
                    resolutions. A higher authority may, in certain cases, order societies to be
                    dissolved. These provisions relate to voluntary societies; but it is competent
                    for communal authorities also to order the formation of a friendly society, and
                    to make a regulation compelling all workmen not already members of a society to
                    join it.</p>
                <p>On the actuarial view of the management of friendly societies the following
                    remarks have been supplied by Mr William Sutton, actuary of the Friendly
                    Societies’ Registry. It is in the highest degree essential to the interests of
                    their members that friendly societies should be financially sound,—in other
                    words, that they should throughout their existence be able to meet the
                    engagements into which they have entered with their members. For this purpose it
                    is necessary that the members’ contributions should be so fixed as to prove
                    adequate, with proper management, to provide the benefits promised to the
                    members. These benefits almost entirely depend upon the contingencies of health
                    and life; that is, they take the form of payments to members when sick, of
                    payments to members upon attaining given ages, or of payments upon members’
                    deaths, and frequently a member is assured for all these benefits, viz., a
                    weekly payment if at any time sick before attaining a certain age, a weekly
                    payment for the remainder of life after attaining that age, and a sum to be paid
                    upon his death. Of course the object of the allowance in sickness is to provide
                    a substitute for the weekly wage lost in consequence of being unable to work,
                    and the object of the weekly payment after attaining a certain age, when the
                    member will probably be too infirm to be able to earn a living by the exercise
                    of his calling or occupation, is to provide him with the necessaries of life,
                    aud so enable him to be independent of poor relief. There is every reason to
                    believe that, when a large group of persons of the same age and calling are
                    observed, there will be found to prevail among them, taken one with another, an
                    average number of days’ sickness, as well as an average rate of mortality, in
                    passing through each year of life, which can be very nearly predicted from the
                    results furnished by statistics based upon observations previously made upon
                    similarly circumstanced groups. Assuming, therefore, the necessary statistics to
                    be attainable, the computation of suitable rates of contribution to be paid by
                    the members of a society in return for certain allowances during sickness, or
                    upon attaining a certain age, or upon death, can be readily made by an actuarial
                    expert. To furnish these statistics the Friendly Societies Acts have since 1829
                    required registered societies to make, every five years, a return in prescribed
                    form of their sickness and mortality experience for the previous five years; and
                    other materials of the same nature have from time to time been collected and
                    published</p>
                <p>An important provision in the Friendly Societies Act, 1875, is that which
                    requires every registered society to make a return of its receipts and
                    expenditure, funds and effects, in a prescribed form, to the registrar of
                    friendly societies every year. Particulars of the returns received will be found
                    in the chief registrar’s reports.</p>
                <p>A still more important provision in the same Act is one which requires societies
                    to have a valuation made once at least every five years of their assets and
                    liabilities, including the estimated risks and contributions, and to furnish
                    particulars<pb break="no"

                    The object of such valuation is to ascertain as far as can be estimated the
                    financial position of a society,—in other words, whether the future
                    contributions receivable, plus the money or funds in hand, will, according to
                    the best estimate that can be formed, prove sufficient to enable the society to
                    meet its engagements hereafter; and the valuation balance sheet, therefore,
                    takes the following form:</p>
