                    soldier who had fought at Fontenoy, and had become post-master of the town in
                    which he lived. His father died in 1780, and his early instruction was given by
                    his mother, a woman of English origin and of superior ability. He continued his
                    education at the college of Soissons, and thence passed at the age of fourteen
                    to the artillery school of La Fère. After eighteen months’ successful study he
                    entered the army, served his first campaign in Flanders (1791), and was present
                    at the battle of Jemmapes. He soon attained the rank of captain, and served
                    successively under Dampierre, Jourdan, Pichegru, and Houssard. In 1794, in
                    consequence of having spoken freely against the violence of the extreme party at
                    Paris, he was imprisoned by order of the commissioner of the Convention, Joseph
                    Lebon, at Cambray, but regained his liberty soon after the fall of Robespierre.
                    He served under Moreau in the campaigns of 1796 and 1797, distinguishing himself
                    in many engagements. The leisure which the treaty of Campo Formio gave him he
                    devoted to the study of public law and modern history, attending the lectures of
                    Professor Koch at Strasburg. Recommended by Desaix to the notice of General
                    Bonaparte, he joined the army assembled for the invasion of England, and
                    afterwards fought, with much regret, against the Swiss. He gained the confidence
                    of Masséna, and was promoted <hi rend="italic">chef de brigade.</hi> After the
                    peace of Amiens he returned to France with the rank of colonel. He was at Paris
                    at the time of Moreau’s trial, and having earnestly censured the proceedings
                    escaped arrest only by joining the army in Holland. Foy voted against the
                    establishment of the empire, but the only penalty for his independence was a
                    long delay before attaining the rank of general. In 1806 he married a daughter
                    of General Paraguay d’Hilliers. In the following year he was sent to
                    Constantinople, and there took part in the defence of the Dardanelles against
                    the English fleet. He was next sent to Portugal, and served in the Peninsular
                    War from the battle of Vimeira to the battle of Orthez, at which he was severely
                    wounded. At the first restoration of the Bourbons ho was made one of the
                    inspectors-general of infantry, and was stationed at Nantes. He joined Napoleon
                    I. on his <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0535-0504"/> escape from Elba, and fought with distinction at
                    QuatreBras and at Waterloo, where he was again badly wounded. After the second
                    restoration he returned to civil life, and in 1819 was elected to the chamber of
                    deputies. For this position his experience and his studies had especially fitted
                    him, and by his first speech he gained a commanding place in the chamber, which
                    he never lost, his clear, manly eloquence being always employed on the side of
                    freedom and justice. In 1823 he made a powerful protest against French
                    intervention in Spain, and after the dissolution of 1824 he was re-elected for
                    three constituencies. He died at Paris, November 28,1825, and his funeral was
                    celebrated amidst the mourning of the city and the nation. His family were
                    provided for by a national subscription.</p>
