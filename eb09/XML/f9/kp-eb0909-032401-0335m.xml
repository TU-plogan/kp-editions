                    married Rembrandt in 1634. Other members of the same family lived at Amsterdam,
                    cultivating the arts either professionally or as amateurs. The pupils of Lambert
                    probably gained some knowledge of Rembrandt by intercourse with the Ulenburgs.
                    Certainly Sandrart, who visited Holland in 1637, found Flinck acknowledged as
                    one of Rembrandt’s best pupils, and living habitually in the house of the dealer
                    Hendrik Ulenburg at Amsterdam. For many years Flinck laboured on the lines of
                    Rembrandt, following that master’s style in all the works which he executed
                    between 1636 and 1648; then he fell into peculiar mannerisms by imitating the
                    swelling forms and grand action of Rubens’s creations. Finally he sailed with
                    unfortunate complacency into the Dead Sea of official and diplomatic painting.
                    Flinck’s relations with Cleves became in time very important. He was introduced
                    to the court of the Great Elector, Frederick William of Brandenburg, who married
                    in 1646 Louisa of Orange. He obtained the patronage of Johann Moritz of Orange,
                    who was made stadtholder of Cleves in 1649. In 1652 a citizen of Amsterdam,
                    Flinck married in 1656 an heiress, daughter of Ver Hoeven, a director of the
                    Dutch East India Company. He was already well known even then in the patrician
                    circles over which the burgomasters De Graef and the Echevin ⅛ix presided; he
                    was on terms of intimacy with the poet Vondel and the treasurer Uitenbogaard. In
                    his house, adorned with antique casts, costumes, and a noble collection of
                    prints, he often received the stadtholder Johann Moritz, whose portrait is still
                    preserved in the work of the learned Barleius.</p>
                <p>The earliest of Flinck’s authentic pieces is a likeness of a lady, dated 1636, in
                    the gallery of Brunswick. His first subject picture is the Blessing of Jacob, in
                    the Amsterdam museum (1638). Both are thoroughly Rembrandtesque in effect as
                    well as in vigour of touch and warmth of flesh tints. The four “civic guards” of
                    1642, and “the twelve musketeers” with their president in an arm-chair (1648),
                    in the town-hall at Amsterdam, are fine specimens of composed portrait groups.
                    But the best of Flinck’s productions in this style is the Peace of Munster in
                    the museum of Amsterdam, a canvas with 19 life-size figures full of animation in
                    the faces, “radiant with Rembrandtesque colour,” and admirably distributed.
                    Flinck here painted his own likeness to the left in a doorway. The mannered
                    period of Flinck is amply illustrated in the Marcus Curius eating Turnips before
                    the Samnite Envoys, and Solomon receiving Wisdom, in the palace on the Dam at
                    Amsterdam. Here it is that Flinck shows most defects, being faulty in
                    arrangement, gaudy in tint, flat and shallow in execution, and partial to
                    whitened flesh that looks as if it had been smeared with violet powder and
                    rouge. The chronology of Flinck’s works, so far as they are seen in public
                    galleries, comprises, in addition to the foregoing, the Grey Beard of 1639 at
                    Dresden, the Girl of 1641 at the Louvre, a portrait group of a male and female
                    (1646) at Rotterdam, a lady (1651) at Berlin. In November 1659 the burgomaster
                    of Amsterdam contracted with Flinck for 12 canvases to represent four heroic
                    figures of David and Samson and Marcus Curius and Horatius Codes, and scenes
                    from the wars of the Batavians and Romans. Flinck was unable to finish more than
                    the sketches. In the same year he received a flattering acknowledgment from the
                    town council of Cleves on the completion of a picture of Solomon which was a
                    counterpart of the composition at Amsterdam. This and other pictures and
                    portraits, such as the likenesses of Frederick William of Brandenburg and Johann
                    Moritz of Nassau, and the allegory of Louisa of Orange attended by Victory and
                    Fame and other figures at the cradle of the first-born son of the elector, have
                    disappeared. Of-several pictures which were painted for the Great Kurfürst, none
                    are preserved except the Expulsion of Hagar in the Berlin museum. Flinck’s death
                    at Amsterdam on the 22d of February 1660 was sudden and unexpected.</p>
