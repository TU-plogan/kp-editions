                        rend="smallcaps">Philipp Emanuel von</hi> (1771-1844), educationist, was
                    born 27th June 1771 at Bern, in Switzerland. His father was of patrician family,
                    and a man of importance in his canton, and his mother was a granddaughter of the
                    Dutch admiral Van Tromp. From his mother and from Pfeffel, the blind poet of
                    Colmar, he received a better education than falls to the lot of most boys, while
                    the intimacy of his father with Pestalozzi gave to his mind that bent which it
                    afterwards followed. In 1790 he entered the university of Tübingen, where he
                    distinguished himself by his rapid progress in legal studies. On account of his
                    health he afterwards undertook a walking tour in Switzerland and the adjoining
                    portions of France, Swabia, and Tyrol, visiting the hamlets and farm houses,
                    mingling in the labours and occupations of the peasants and mechanics, and
                    partaking of their rude fare and lodging. After the downfall of Robespierre, he
                    went to Paris and remained there long enough to be assured of the storm
                    impending over his native country. This he did his best to avert, but his
                    warnings were disregarded, and Switzerland was lost before any efficient means
                    could be taken for its safety. Fellenberg, who had hastily raised a levy <hi
                        rend="italic">en masse,</hi> was proscribed; a price was set upon his head,
                    and he was compelled to fly into Germany. Shortly afterwards, however, he was
                    recalled by his countrymen, and sent on a mission to Paris to remonstrate
                    against the rapacity and cruelty of the agents of the French republic. But in
                    this and other diplomatic offices which he held for a short time, he was witness
                    to so much corruption and intrigue that his mind revolted from the idea of a
                    political life, and he returned home with the intention of devoting himself
                    wholly to the education of the young. With this resolution he purchased in 1799
                    the estate of Hofwyl,near Bern, intending to make agriculture the basis of a new
                    system which he had projected, for elevating the lower and rightly training the
                    higher orders of the state, and welding them together in a closer union than had
                    hitherto been deemed attainable. For some time he carried on his labours in
                    conjunction with Pestalozzi, but incompatibility of disposition soon induced
                    them to separate. The scheme of Fellenberg at first excited a large amount of
                    ridicule, but gradually it began to attract the notice of foreign countries; and
                    pupils, some of them of the highest rank, began to flock to him from every
                    country in Europe, both for the purpose of studying agriculture and to profit by
                    the high moral training which he associated with his educational system. For
                    forty-five years Fellenberg, assisted by his wife, continued his educational
                    labours, and latterly raised his institution to the highest point of prosperity
                    and usefulness. He died 21st November 1844.</p>
