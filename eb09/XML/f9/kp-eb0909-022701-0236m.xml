                <p><label type="entry">FIRE</label>. So general is the knowledge of fire and its
                    uses that it is a question whether we have any authentic instance on record of a
                    tribe altogether ignorant of them. A few notices indeed are to be found in the
                    voluminous literature of travel which would decide the question in the
                    affirmative; but when they are carefully investigated, their evidence is found
                    to be far from conclusive. The missionary Krapf was told by a slave of a tribe
                    in the southern part of Shoa who lived like monkeys in the bamboo jungles, and
                    were totally ignorant of fire; but no better authority has been found for the
                    statement, and the story, which seems to be current in Eastern Africa, may be
                    nothing else than the propagation of fables about the Pygmies whom the ancients
                    located around the sources of the Nile. Commodore Wilkes, commander of the
                    United States exploring expedition, says that in Fakaafo or Bowditch Island
                    “there was no sign of places for cooking nor any appearance of fire,” and that
                    the natives felt evident alarm at the sparks produced by flint and steel and the
                    smoke emitted by those with cigars in their mouths. The presence of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">aft,</hi> fire, in the Fakaafo vocabulary supplied by Hales the
                    ethnographer of the expedition, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0237-0228"/> though it might perhaps be explained as
                    equivalent only to solar light and heat, undoubtedly invalidates the commodore’s
                    supposition; and the Rev. George Turner, in an account of a missionary voyage in
                    1859, not only repeats the word <hi rend="italic">aſſi</hi> in his list for
                    Fakaafo, but relates the native legend about the origin of fire, and describes
                    some peculiar customs connected with its use. Alvaro de Saavedra, an old Spanish
                    traveller, informs us that the inhabitants of Los Jardines, an island of the
                    Pacific, showed great fear when they saw fire,—which they did not know before.
                    But that island has not been identified with certainty by modern explorers. It
                    belongs, perhaps, to the Ladrones or Marianas Archipelago, where fire was
                    unknown, says Padre Gobien, “till Magellan, wroth at the pilferings of the
                    inhabitants, burnt one of their villages. When they saw their wooden huts
                    ablaze, their first thought was that fire was a beast which eats up wood. Some
                    of them having approached the fire too near were burnt, and the others kept
                    aloof, fearing to be torn or poisoned by the powerful breath of that terrible
                    animal.” To this Freycinet objects that these Ladrone islanders made pottery
                    before the arrival of Europeans, that they had words expressing the ideas of
                    flame, fire, oven, coals, roasting, and cooking. Let us add that in their
                    country numerous graves and ruins have been found, which seem to be remnants of
                    a former culture. Thus the question remains in uncertainty: though there is
                    nothing impossible in the supposition of the existence of a fireless tribe, it
                    cannot be said that such a tribe has been discovered.</p>
                <p>It is useless to inquire in what way man first discovered that fire was subject
                    to his control, and could even be called into being by appropriate means. With
                    the natural phenomenon and its various aspects he must soon have become
                    familiar. The volcano lit up the darkness of night and sent its ashes or its
                    lava down into the plains; the lightning or the meteor struck the tree, and the
                    forest was ablaze; or some less obvious cause produced some less extensive
                    ignition. For a time it is possible that the grand manifestations of nature
                    aroused no feelings save awe and terror; but man is quite as much endowed with
                    curiosity as with reverence or caution, and familiarity must ere long have bred
                    confidence if not contempt. It is by no means necessary to suppose that the
                    practical discovery of fire was made only at one given spot and in one given
                    way; it is much more probable indeed that different tribes and races obtained
                    the knowledge in a variety of ways. We still find in different parts of the
                    world the natives taking advantage of hot springs, naphtha or petroleum wells,
                    and accessible craters. In the island of Tanna, for instance, there is a
                    mountain to the west of Port Resolution which abounds in evidence of its
                    volcanic character—in fissures, steam-jets, hot-springs, &amp;c. The
                    inhabitants, says the Rev. George Turner, have not the slightest apprehension of
                    danger; their settlements are arranged so that their <hi rend="italic"
                    >murum</hi> or public square occupies one of the “hot places of the mountain;
                    and there they lounge and enjoy the subterranean heat. Some of the springs reach
                    the boiling point. Every day women may be seen cooking vegetables in artificial
                    pits which form a series of never failing boiling pots. In some places the men
                    or boys have only to stand on the rocks, spear their fish, and pitch them behind
                    into the hot springs.” Similar accounts are given of the Maories in New Zealand,
                    and the Negritos in the New Hebrides.</p>
                <p>It has been asserted of many tribes that they would be unable to rekindle their
                    fires if they were all allowed to die out. Travellers in Australia and Tasmania
                    depict the typical native woman bearing always about with her a burning brand,
                    which it is one of her principal duties to protect and foster; and it has been
                    supposed that it was only ignorance which imposed on her the endless task. This,
                    however <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> is not so certain; for Mr Miklucho Maclav
                    remarks of the Papuans, whom he has closely studied, that though they know how
                    to produce fire, they prefer to carry it about. It was one of the distinguishing
                    marks of the Samoan noble that his fire was never permitted to go out; and his
                    attendants had a special name from their business of watching it while he slept.
                    In Corea the preservation of the ancestral fire is still regarded as of the
                    first importance for the happiness of a family, and the same belief has had a
                    very extensive sway in other parts of the world.</p>
                <p>The methods employed for producing fire vary considerably in detail, but are for
                    the most part merely modified applications of concussion or friction. Sir John
                    Lubbock has remarked that the working up of stone into implements must have been
                    followed sooner or later by the discovery of fire; for in the process of
                    chipping sparks were elicited, and in the process of polishing heat was
                    generated. The first or concussion method is still familiar in the flint and
                    steel, which has hardly passed out of use even in the most civilized countries.
                    Its modifications are comparatively few and unimportant. The Alaskans and
                    Aleutians take two pieces of quartz, rub them well with native sulphur, strike
                    them together till the sulphur catches fire, and then transfer the flame to a
                    heap of dry grass over which a fevz feathers have been scattered. Instead of two
                    pieces of quartz the Eskimos use a piece of quartz and a piece of iron pyrites.
                    Mr Frederick Boyle saw fire produced by striking broken china violently against
                    a bamboo, and Bastian observed the same process in Burmah, and Wallace in
                    Ternate. In Cochin China two pieces of bamboo are considered sufficient, the
                    silicious character of the outside layer rendering it as good as native flint
                    The friction methods are more various. One of the simplest is what Mr Tylor
                    calls the stick and groove—“a blunt pointed stick being run along a groove of
                    its own making in a piece of wood lying on the ground.” Much, of course, depends
                    on the quality of the woods and the expertness of the manipulator. In Tahiti Mr
                    Darwin saw a native produce fire in a few seconds, but only succeeded himself
                    after much labour. The same device was employed in New Zealand, the Sandwich
                    islands, Tonga, Samoa, and the Radack. ' islands. Instead of rubbing the movable
                    stick backwards and forwards other tribes make it rotate rapidly in a round hole
                    in the stationary piece of wood—thus making what Mr Tylor has happily designated
                    a fire-drill. This device has been observed in Australia, Kamchatka, Sumatra,
                    and the Carolines, among the Veddahs of Ceylon, throughout a great part of
                    Southern Africa, among the Eskimo and Indian tribes of North America, in the
                    West Indies, in Central America, and as far south as the Straits of Magellan. It
                    was also employed by the ancient Mexicans, and Mr Tylor gives a quaint picture
                    of the operation from a Mexican MS.,—aman half kneeling on the ground is causing
                    the stick to rotate between the palms of his hands. This simple method of
                    rotation seems to be very generally in use; but various devices have been
                    resorted to for the purpose of diminishing the labour and hastening the result.
                    The Gaucho of the Pampas takes “an elastic stick about 18 inches long, presses
                    one end to his breast and the other in a hole in a piece of wood, and then
                    rapidly turns the curved part like a carpenter’s centre-bit” In other cases the
                    rotation is effected by means of a cord or thong wound round the drill and
                    pulled alternately by this end and that. In order to steady the drill the Eskimo
                    and others put the upper end in a socket of ivory or bone which they hold firmly
                    in their mouth. A further advance was made by some of the North American
                    Indians, who appear to have applied the principle of the bow-drill; and the
                    still more ingenious pump-drill was used by the Iroquois Indians. For full
                    descriptions of these instruments and a rich variety of details connected with
                    fire-making we must refer the reader to Mr Tylor’s valuable chapter in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rc∙</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0238-0229"/><hi rend="italic">searches.</hi> These methods of
                    producing fire are but rarely used in Europe, and only in connexion with
                    superstitious observances. We read in Wuttke that some time ago the authorities
                    of a Mecklenburg village ordered a “wild fire " to be lit against a murrain
                    amongst the cattle. For two hours the men strove vainly to obtain a spark, but
                    the fault was not to be ascribed to the quality of the wood, or to the dampness
                    of the atmosphere, but to the stubbornness of an old lady, who, objecting to the
                    superstition, would not put out her night lamp; such a fire, to be efficient,
                    must burn alone. At last the strong-minded female was compelled to give in; fire
                    was obtained,—but of bad quality, for it did not stop the murrain.</p>
                <p>It has long been known that the rays of the sun might be concentrated by a lens
                    or concave mirror. Aristophanes mentions the burning-lens in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Clouds,</hi> and the story of Archimedes using a mirror to fire the ships
                    at Syracuse is familiar to every schoolboy. If Garcilasso de la Vega can be
                    trusted as an authority, the Virgins of the Sun in Peru kindled the sacred fire
                    with a concave cup set in a great bracelet. In China the burning-glass is in
                    common use.</p>
                <p>To the inquiry how mankind became possessed of fire, the cosmogonies, those
                    records of pristine speculative thought, do not give any reply which would not
                    be found in the relations of travellers and historians.</p>
                <p>They say in the Tonga Islands that the god of the earthquakes is likewise the god
                    of fire. At Mangala it is told that the great Maui went down to hell, where he
                    surprised the secret of making fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together. The
                    Maoris tell the tale differently. Maui had the fire given to him by his old
                    blind grandmother, Mahuika, who drew it from the nails of her hands. Wishing to
                    have a stronger one, he pretended that it had gone out, and so he obtained fire
                    from her great toe. It was so fierce that every thing melted before the glow;
                    even Maui and the grandmother herself were already burning when a deluge, sent
                    from heaven, saved the hero and the perishing world; but before the waters
                    extinguished all the blaze, Mahuika shut a few sparks into some trees, and
                    thence men draw it now. The Maories have also the legend that thunder is the
                    noise of Tawhaki’s footsteps, and that lightnings flash from his armpits. At
                    Western Point, Victoria, the Australians say the good old man Pundyil opened the
                    door of the sun, whose light poured then on earth, and that Karakorok, the good
                    man’s good daughter, seeing the earth to be full of serpents, went everywhere
                    destroying serpents; but before she had killed them all, her staff snapped in
                    two, and while it broke, a flame burst out of it. Here the serpent-killer is a
                    fire-bringer. In the Persian <hi rend="italic">Shahnainah</hi> also fire was
                    discovered by a dragon-fighter. Hushenk, the powerful hero, hurled at the
                    monster a prodigous stone, which, evaded by the snake, stfuck a rock and was
                    splintered by it. ‘ ‘ Light shone from the dark pebble, the heart of the rock
                    flashed out in glory, and fire was seen for the first time in the world.” The
                    snake escaped, but the mystery of fire had been revealed.</p>
                <p>North American legends narrate how the great buffalo, careering through the
                    plains, makes sparks flit in the night, and sets the prairie ablaze by his hoofs
                    hitting the rocks. We meet the same idea in the Hindu mythology, which conceives
                    thunder to have been, among many other things, the clatter of the solar horses
                    on the Akmon or hard pavement of the sky. The Dakotas claim that their ancestor
                    obtained fire from the sparks which a friendly panther struck with its claws, as
                    it scampered upon a stony hill.</p>
                <p>Tohil, who gave the Quiches fire by shaking his sandals, was, like the Mexican
                    Quetzelcoatl, represented by a flint stone. Gua-mansuri, the father of the
                    Peruvians, produced the thunder and the lightning by hurling stones with his
                    sling. The thunderbolts are his children. Kudai, the great god of the Altaian
                    Tartars, disclosed “the secret of the stone’s edge and the iron’s hardness.” The
                    Slavonian god of thunder was depicted with a silex in his hand, or even
                    protruding from his head. The Lapp Tiennes struck with his hammer upon his own
                    head; the Scandinavian Thor held a mallet in one hand, a flint in the other.
                    Taranis, the Gaul, had upon his head a huge mace sun ’ ounded by six little
                    ones. Finnish poems describe how “fire, the child of the sun, came down from
                    heaven, where it was rocked in a tub of yellow copper, in a large pail of gold.”
                    Ukko, the Esthonian god, sends forth lightnings, as he strikes his stone with
                    his steel. According to the Kalewala, the same mighty Ukko struck his sword
                    against his nail, and from the nail issued the “fiery babe.” He gave it to the
                    Wind’s daughter to rock it, but the unwary maiden let it fall in the sea, where
                    it was swallowed by the great pike, and fire would have been lost for ever, if
                    the child of the sun had not come to the rescue. He dragged the great pike from
                    the water, drew out his entrails, and found there the heavenly spark still
                    alive. Hephaestus also, the Greek fire god, fell from heaven into the sea of
                    Lemnos. Prometheus brought to earth the torch he had lighted at the sun’s
                    chariot.</p>
                <p>Human culture may be said to have begun with fire, of which the uses increased in
                    the same ratio as culture itself. To save the labour expended on the initial
                    process of procuring light, or on carrying it about constantly, primitive men
                    hit on the expedient of a fire which should burn night and day in a public
                    building. The Egyptians had one in every temple, the Greeks, Latins, and
                    Persians in all towns and villages. The Natchez, the Mexicans, the Mayas, the
                    Peruvians, had their “national fires” burning upon large pyramids. Of these
                    fires the “eternal lamps” in the synagogues, in the Byzantine and Catholic
                    churches, may be a survival. The “Regia,” Rome’s sacred centre, supposed to be
                    the abode of Vesta, stood close to a fountain; it was convenient to draw from
                    the same spot the two great requisites, fire and water. All civil and political
                    interests grouped themselves around the Prytaneion which was at once a temple, a
                    tribunal, a town-hall, and a gossiping resort; all public business and most
                    private affairs were transacted by the light and in the warmth of the common
                    fire. No wonder that its flagstones should become sacred. Primitive communities
                    consider as holy everything that ensures their existence and promotes their
                    welfare, material things such as fire and water not less than others. Thus the
                    Prytaneion grew into a religious institution. And if we hear a little more of
                    fire worship than of water worship, it is because fire, being on the whole more
                    difficult to obtain, was esteemed more precious.</p>
                <p>We have curious and concordant testimonies that the principal functions of the
                    state itself grew out of the care which was bestowed on the tribal fire. The men
                    who attended it in Hellas were called the Prytanes. They had to eat together,
                    and it would have been considered as a bad omen if they had neglected that duty.
                    They were fed at the public expense; and well they might be, for having been,
                    probably, general cooks at the outset, they became, when the city was
                    established, <hi rend="italic">Archontes</hi> or magistrates, and even <hi
                    rend="italic">Basileis,</hi> or a combination of the captain, the priest, and
                    the king. Thus the first guardians of the tribal fire were the earliest public
                    servants, who by degrees appropriated all important offices, as the state itself
                    developed into a vast aggregation of interests. And when Augustus usurped the
                    Roman empire, he assumed all the powers which a pristine board of flamens, or of
                    Prytanes, may have possessed. He made himself <hi rend="italic">Pontifex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maximus,</hi> and assumed the charge of the public fire; and on
                    transporting it to his own palace, he had to convert it into public property.
                    The Hellenic nations, as well as the Aztecs, received ambassadors in their
                    temples of fire, where, as at the national hearth, they feasted the foreign
                    guests. The Prytaneion and the state were convertible terms. If by chance the
                    fire in the Roman temple of Vesta was extinguished, all tribunals, all
                    authority, all public or private business, had to stop immediately. The
                    connexion between heaven and earth had been broken, and it had to be restored in
                    some way or other,—either by Jove sending down divine lightning on his altars,
                    or by the priests making a new fire by the old sacred method of rubbing two
                    pieces of wood together, or by catching the rays of the sun in a concave mirror.
                    No Greek or Roman army crossed the frontier without carrying an altar where the
                    fire taken from the Prytaneion burned night and day. When the Greeks sent out
                    colonies the emigrants took with them living coals from the altar of Hestia, and
                    had in their new country a fire lit as a representative of that burning in the
                    mother country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    The use of a common Prytaneion, of circular form, like the Roman temple of
                    Vesta, testified to the common origin of the North American Assinais and
                    Maichas. The Mobiles, the Chippeways, the Natchez, had each a corporation of
                    Vestals. If the Natchez let their fire die out, they were bound to renew it from
                    the Mobiles. The Moquis, Pueblos, and Comanches had also their perpetual fires.

                    each its brand to the altar of Athene Polias. All Greece confederated, making
                    Delphi its central hearth; and the islands congregated around Delos, whence the
                    new fire was fetched every year.</p>
                <p>According to a not impossible theory, all architecture, public and private,
                    sacred and profane, began with the erection of sacred sheds to protect the
                    sacred fire, which abodes men dared to inhabit only after a length of time. For
                    it must be borne in mind that fire was looked upon as a divinity. We are
                    expressly told that Vesta had no image or statue even in her own temple, the
                    Vestal fire being considered as the very goddess herself. The husbandmen who ate
                    their repast before the hearth believed, as Ovid relates, that they sat in the
                    presence of the gods themselves. The hearth fire was kept holy, its flame was to
                    remain bright and pure. The minute and irksome prescriptions of the Zend-Avesta
                    carried this feeling to the extreme: it was and it is still a widely spread
                    belief that nothing unclean is to be thrown in the fire, that no indecent
                    actions are to be committed before it. To spit in one’s fire would be now
                    considered in many places, in Albania, for example, as an unpardonable offence.
                    The Galtchas of Ferghana, according to Μ. de Ujfalvy, are so reverential that
                    they would not blow out a light lest they should render the flame impure with
                    their breath; and a similar peculiarity was observed by Wood in Badakshan and by
                    Khanikoff among the Tadjiks of Bokhara.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the course of time, the same reasons which made the tribe provide itself with
                    a permanent fire made every family have its hearth. It would even be more
                    accurate to say that the family, as it is called now-a-days, developed itself
                    after the human couple and their children had their own fire-place, and not
                    before. It is likely that at the outset only the higher aristocracy of

                    of their own, which was then equivalent to a private or family god. They kept it
                    burning night and clay all the year round. As recently as the last generation,
                    fires of such a character were rather numerous in the northern countries.<note

                    in a niche opposite the pothanger. The block smouldered slowly, and was intended
                    to last the whole year, from Christinas to Christmas, when its remains were
                    ground to powder and strewn on the fields to insure their
                    fertility.</p></note></p>
                <p>These lingering customs take us back to the time when every hearth was an altar.
                    From the national Prytaneion a brand was given to each gens. When gentes grew
                    out of the tribe, and subsequently when families grew out of the gentes, coals
                    from the gentile sacrificial stone were given to every family. These three
                    social organisms, the nation, the gens, the family, one merging into the other,
                    had fire for their common symbol, and esteemed it as even the cause of their
                    existence. The hearth was the very centre of the house, as the regia was the
                    sacred centre of Rome and the Roman commonwealth; around the regia the civic and
                    politic institutions developed themselves, and around the hearth the family grew
                    slowly into shape and power.</p>
                <p>As already observed, the Prytaneion was an altar to the genius of the
                    commonwealth, the abode of the nation’s heroic ancestors. Its exact counterpart
                    was the gentile hearth, owned by the gens at large and its dependent families.
                    When the gentes broke asunder, every family became possessed likewise of an
                    altar to its particular “Penates” and “Lares,” or sacred fathers. These fathers
                    were not mere ancestors, or grandparents, as we hold then now to be, but the
                    constant progenitors; not only were they believed to have begotten children in a
                    former age, but also to go on begetting them constantly through succeeding
                    generations. Procreators and protectors as well, they were the source of
                    blessing at the same time as the source of existence. Called gods, <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi rend="italic">theoi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >patrooi,</hi><hi rend="italic">genethlioi</hi><hi rend="italic

                    the gods of the household, but gods of the same kin and blood as their
                    descendants. No oath was held more sacred than the one which a man swore by his
                    own hearth,—no prayer more readily granted than that which was coupled with a
                    wish for the welfare of the hearth. The hearth had a recognized right of asylum,
                    which is yet in full vigour in many countries. But it was above all the throne
                    of the “paterfamilias,” the stronghold of his dominion. The proud saying of the
                    Englishman that his home is his castle is but an attenuated remnant of the
                    feeling which animated the chiefs of the Vedic, the Greek, and the Italian
                    gentes. Such a man was the king absolute over his household; he wielded the
                    power of life and death over all his subordinates, cattle, slaves, children,
                    wife or wives; he was the priest of his altar, the manager and expounder of all
                    divine things, elevated above the standard of common mortals. He alone in his
                    kingdom could, if need were, make a new fire, not with a vulgar flint and iron,
                    but by the solemn mode of rubbing together two sacred twigs. In this way all
                    Greek hearths were provided with new fires when the ancient ones had been
                    sullied by the look of the hated Persian invaders. Beside the hearth, the second
                    place, at least, was due to the wife and mother; and as time went on her
                    influence continued to increase.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    fire-place. In the λ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> edas we see that the new
                    wife underwent some sort of consecration by walking thrice around the new
                    hearth-place, and stretching her hand into the flames while she was being
                    sprinkled over with lustral water. In Germany and Slav countries, the bride, as
                    she comes from church and enters her new house, bows to the fire burning on the
                    hearth, walks thrice round it, burns three of her hairs, and binds a red string
                    round her body. What is no more done by the mistress is still done to her

                    natural to suppose that the hearth, “the sun in the house,” as the younger Edda
                    calls it, radiated life likewise. Therefore it was made the seat of the Lares
                    and Penates, or ancestors, a dwelling place for the deceased, where a stock of
                    souls ready to enter existence by new births was maintained. The famous Roman
                    legend of Servius Tullius, whom Plutarch and other writers report to have been
                    procreated in the ashes of the hearth by the Lares themselves, is a curious
                    illustration of this belief. A sepulchral picture at Orvieto represents a double
                    phallus protruding from the flame of a hearth, on which a libation is being
                    poured. The Vedas taught that the hearth-fire was cosubstantial with the cause

                    taken from another house. On this matter the ancient Persians were particularly
                    punctilious, feeding their fires, and especially their sacred fires, only with
                    certain kinds of wood, reputed to be cleaner than all others, well dried, and
                    well stript of the bark. Everywhere and in all countries, it was considered a
                    most fatal omen if the fire died out in the hearth. The family whose fire went
                    out had incurred the ire of the Lares, who, if not quickly appeased, would
                    strike tho sons with impotence and imbecility. A new fire was to be lit by the
                    friction of two twigs, as to fetch some from a neighbour’s would have been

                <p>—For a long time, throughout all the world, the ancient naturalists who meditated
                    on the greatest wonder of physiology, supposed that the generation of fire by
                    the friction of two woods, one of harder the other of softer substance, was the
                    exact counterpart of human generation. The heat thus evolved in the human
                    organism was held to be of most subtile nature, a flash of tho astral light, an
                    intelligent substance. Primary fire impregnated primary water, and the soul was
                    born. Life was compared to a flame, to a torch; and no comparison is more true.
                    Modern chemistry having proved that animal life is a constant burning of oxygen,
                    the ancient myth was not far from the truth when it said that Prometheus
                    animated the figure of clay by putting into it a spark of fire. “Know ye,” said
                    an Ojibway prophet, “that the fire in your huts and the life in your bodies are
                    one and the same thing.” A torch which was put out by throwing it violently on
                    the ground symbolized in ecclesiastical rites excommunication, or the
                    condemnation of a soul to eternal death. In classical mythology, Meleager’s life
                    was bound to a log of wood; when the one was turned to a heap of ashes, the
                    other was to fall dead. <hi rend="italic">“Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    poetry and language; and now, as in the days of yore, the soul and the “genius”
                    are always spoken of as if they possessed the nature of flame, and the angels
                    and the peris as if their substances were pure light. According to the pristine
                    physiology, man was likewise a fire, but a fire hidden in clay, diluted in
                    water. If it had not been for water, the flame would have been destroyed by its
                    own force,—it would have blazed up, coruscating violently in dazzling
                    effulgence, and then dying out. In fact, all primitive theories attributed to
                    gaseous water the action which our present science attributes to nitrogen,
                    without which oxidation would go on too rapidly to allow of the formation of
                    oxidizable matter. Hence water was thought to be as necessary as fire itself;
                    hence ancient law forbade the individuals guilty of offences against the
                    commonwealth to have fire and water given them—a sentence equivalent to death.
                    The mixture of organic fire and organic water in our bodies was compared to that
                    in vegetable matter, which emits much smoke if burned when in green or wet
                    condition. Nay, by pursuing the analysis of combustion in which the classical
                    world had centred all its philosophy, the ashes or mineral detritus which fell
                    on the hearth found their analogue in the flesh, in the bones, in tho solid
                    parts of our organism. Thus man was thought to be an alloy of fire, earth, and
                    water in slightly different proportions. Fire, a constituent part of the divine
                    intelli gence, became a soul when it was immersed in organic water; it became
                    the body when it was put into organic clay. Tho traditions of tho Egyptian
                    priesthood, which were current under the name of Hermes Trimegistus, teach that
                    at the moment of death, “our intelligence, one of God’s subtile thoughts,
                    escapes the body’s dross, puts on its fiery tunic again, and floats henceforth
                    in space,” leaving the soul to await judgment. Men were divided into noble and
                    ignoble, according as the material or thø spiritual side of their nature
                    predominated. Thus a frequent distinction in the burials, which may have arisen
                    even in prehistoric times, can be explained. Chiefs and kings, priests and
                    noblemen, possessed all of a divine soul, were burned, flame going forth to
                    flame; but people of the common sort were sunk among the sods, clay going back
                    to clay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So among
                    Algonquins and Ottaways those only of the “Great Hare totem,” among the
                    Nicaraguans none but the “caciques,” among the Caribs no others than the
                    priestly caste, were entitled to the honour of cremation. The tribes of Upper
                    California were even persuaded that such as were not burned were liable to be
                    transformed into brutes. Among certain populations (as, for instance, the
                    Colchians of old, and the Babeens or Chimpseyans of our times) the males had the
                    privilege of the pyre, which was denied to women. The examples illustrating the
                    belief of the soul being a fire are so numerous that it is difficult to choose
                    among them. In Voigtland the souls of unchristened babes are believed to be
                    turned into Wills-of-the-Wisp. The souls of dying men or beasts are said to burn
                    sometimes with a heat so intense that their eyes inflame piles of wood. It is a
                    frequent feat of divine horses in Tartar legends to make the rocks glow and melt
                    as pitch by merely looking at them.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Cosmic
                    Fire.—</hi> The opinions and beliefs which most primitive populations have
                    entertained on the nature of fire in the hearth were applied by them to the
                    great cosmic fire: both were life-givers, one to the family and the other to the
                    universe; both were parts of the same substance or element. It was taught by
                    Aristotle that Zeus was a name given to the fire of heaven, and by Plato and
                    Euripides that the same Hestia burned in the humblest hut and the highest sky.
                    Ovid went so far as to identify that goddess with the earth itself. According to
                    that doctrine, fire was held to be the very soul of nature, the essence of every
                    thing that had a shape, and even to be the giver of that shape, for philosophers
                    explained that of all elements none but fire having any form by itself could
                    impart it to other things. From Jupiter to the fly, from the wandering star to
                    the tiniest blade of grass, all beings owed existence to the fiery element. This
                    theory, more or less distinctly expressed, obtained among the Aztecs, who
                    invoked in their prayers “fire the most ancient divinity, the father and mother
                    of all gods.” Tohil the Quiche, Quetzacoatl the Mexican, Tiennes the Finn,
                    Perkun the Slav, Thor the Scandinavian, Taranis the Gaul, and many other gods,
                    as stated above, were represented as having firestones for heads or for bodies;
                    one of them was said to have flashed up in lightnings as he was dragged along
                    the rocky heavens by some powerful antagonist. Such a god, encased in a shell of
                    flint, fell down from heaven upon earth, according to an Indian legend; the
                    shell broke into sixteen hundred fragments, and each of them arose and stood up
                    as a particular god. From such a thunderbolt or meteorite the Dacotas boasted to
                    have originated.</p>
                <p>In the Gnostic theory the middle part of the cosmos was taken up by the starry
                    world, emitting the astral light, inferior in sanctity to the mild effulgence of
                    ether above it, but superior in vivifying properties to our common fires. These
                    three conditions of the cosmic fire corresponded to the three component parts of
                    man—mind, soul, and body. Prophets and other great and pious men had minds still
                    refulgent with ethereal rays, which were the thoughts of divinity; while the
                    wicked had souls which had been soaked in a smoky fire, and in stupid people
                    there glimmered but the weakest possible ray of celestial light.</p>

                <p>It was not the hottest fire which was supposed to be the most divine. Fierce heat
                    being inimical to organic life, hot fires are said to be hellish ones. Their
                    masters, the demons of drought and sterility, dry up the fountains, scorch the
                    grass, excite pestilence, are the worst fiends to the human race. Pure light was
                    thought to be without any heat at all, and legends tell of “theophanias,” of
                    aureoles, of fiery tongues flickering above the cradles of infants predestined
                    to glorious careers. Phallic fire, giving out heat but no light, was often
                    considered as of an inferior nature, and therefore represented by secondary or
                    even by tertiary deities, fauns, satyrs, aegipans, and the like.</p>
                <p>At the outset the gods and demons alike had some command of fire, but they were
                    distinguishable by the nature of their fire. Among the Scandinavians, Woden was
                    the fire that shines, Thor the lightning, and Loki the fire that burns and shall
                    one day destroy the whole world; Brahma, Indra, Siwa, and Osiris, Horus, Typhon,
                    had similar meanings. Zeus, Apollo, and Athene presided over the celestial
                    flame; Hercules and Dionysus marked the progressive purifications of the
                    terrestrial fire. Besides his influence over generation, Hephaestus had the
                    command of the subterranean fire and of its vast smithies, where earths and
                    stones were fused into metals. It was with a feeling of the most intense awe
                    that the Vedic Aryans contemplated the thunderstorm and the lightning, the
                    fierce struggle in the heavens, the fight between the winds and the clouds,
                    between fire and water, between the fire-god Indra and Vritra the fire-dragon.
                    So, likewise, the Iranians conceived of our world as the field of the great
                    battle between Ormuzd the Increaser, and his twin brother Ahriman the
                    Destroyer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Healing and Purification by Fire.—</hi> The principle of life
                    being a fiery one, it was supposed that all maladies were only so many
                    defilements of the pure principle which had been darkened by the demons of
                    night, and that all sick people were demoniacs. The traditions of the Finns
                    assert that lightning, the fiery sword of Ukko, slays the demons of illness. But
                    it was discovered that the exhibition of lightning, as a healing method, was
                    attended with grave drawbacks: it was impossible to insure being able to use it,
                    and when it could be obtained, the cure was worse than the disease, as the
                    patient was killed before the imp who had bedeviled him. It became necessary to
                    have recourse to a substitute; and therefore the healing virtues of the
                    thunderbolt were embodied in the <hi rend="italic">Keraunia</hi> or
                    thunderstones. The “holy stones” of the Anglo-Saxons, or “holed stones,” arrow
                    heads, flint celts, and flint knives worked by prehistoric men, were popularly
                    believed to be stones which falling down from heaven possessed heavenly virtues,
                    and were of use in all sorts of disease.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In mild cases the Australian sorcerer applies fire to the
                    injured parts of his patients. The Persians kindle fire on the terraces of their
                    house where the sick man lies. The Patagonians fire off guns and revolvers, and
                    throw burning brands into the air. In Turkestan, sick children are made to leap
                    over burning fires, and are struck seven times on the back. At every stroke
                    remonstrances are addressed to the demon, such as “Begone to the sea! Begone to
                    the desert!” Similar practices are still resorted to in mountainous regions of
                    France when illness smites the flocks. In backward districts of Germany, when
                    the swine sicken and die, the “wild fire,” or <hi rend="italic superscript">

                    if it were kindled by bachelors instead of by married men, or with matches and
                    not by the orthodox process of rubbing wood against wood.</p></note></p>
                <p>Sickness having become identified with sin, purification became the first and
                    most esteemed of curative agents and of prophylactics. It needed to be undergone
                    when a dead body had been touched or when women had been delivered. The mother
                    walked with her babe through fires lit on her right hand and on her left; the
                    infants, especially the males, were fumigated with great care. Among some
                    populations none could approach mother and child without stepping over a
                    brazier. Fiery ordeals heralded the attainment of the age of puberty by both
                    sexes. Ambassadors were refused admittance to the presence of the sovereign
                    until they had traversed a flame which should singe away the foreign devilries
                    which they might carry about them.</p>
                <p>Purification by fire led to the institution of baptism by fire, which in many
                    places was thought vastly superior to baptism by water; and the idea obtained
                    its furthest development in the notion of purgatorial fires, which is not
                    peculiar to one church. Often people had misgivings about the penance which
                    awaited them in a future state, and reckoned that it would be better for them to
                    undergo it on this side of the grave.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the hill ranges of Southern India penitents are made to
                    pass through a row of burning huts and are absolved after having passed the
                    seventh. Before seed is sown it is still passed through the fire in Bavaria; and
                    in Basuto land children, underwent recently a similar process, being held over
                    the flame of a lighted altar. The earth was freed from the demons of sterilty by
                    lighting huge fires, and the fields became fertile as far as the blaze could be
                    seen distinctly,—a practice which still prevails in many places from Norway to
                    Central America.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Periodic Fires.—</hi> Because the
                    sun loses its force after noon, and after midsummer daily shortens the length of
                    its circuit, the ancients inferred, and primitive populations still believe,
                    that, as time goes on, the energies of fire must necessarily decline. Therefore
                    men set about renewing the fires in the temples and on the hearth on the longest
                    day of summer or at the beginning of the agricultural year. The ceremony was
                    attended with much rejoicing, banqueting, and many religious rites. Houses were
                    thoroughly cleansed; people bathed, and underwent lustrations and purifications;
                    new clothes were put on; quarrels were made up; debts were paid by the debtor or
                    remitted by the creditor; criminals were released by the civil authorities in
                    imitation of the heavenly judges, who were believed to grant on the same day a
                    general remission of sins. All things were made new; each man turned over a new
                    page in the book of his existence. Some nations, like the Etruscans in the Old
                    World, and the Peruvians and Mexicans in the New, carried these ideas to a high
                    degree of development, and celebrated with magnificent ceremonies the renewal of
                    the <hi rend="italic">scεcula,</hi> or astronomic periods, which might be
                    shorter or longer than a century. Some details of the festival among the Aztecs
                    have been preserved. On the last night of every period (52 years) every fire was
                    extinguished, and men proceeded in solemn procession to some sacred spot, where,
                    with awe and trembling, the priests strove to kindle a new fire by friction. It
                    was as if they had a vague idea that the cosmos, with its sun, moon, and stars,
                    had been wound up like a clock for a definite period of time. And had they
                    failed to raise the vital spark, they would have believed that it was because
                    the great fire was being extinguished at the central hearth of the world. The
                    Stoics and many other ancient philosophers thought that the world was doomed to
                    final extinction by fire. The Scandinavian bards sung the end of the world, how
                    at last the wolf Fenrir would get loose, how the cruel fire of Loki would
                    destroy itself by destroying everything. The Essenes enlarged upon this
                    doctrine, which is also found in the Sibylline books and appears in the
                    Apocrypha (2 Esdras xvi. 15).</p>
