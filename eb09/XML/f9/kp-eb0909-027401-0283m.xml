                <p><label type="entry">FIXTURES</label>, in law, may be defined as things which have
                    been fixed or attached to land, or, as it is expressed in English law, things
                    annexed to the freehold. All systems of law make u marked distinction between
                    immovables and movables, between real and personal property, between land and
                    all other things. In the case of fixtures the question arises under which set of
                    rights they are to fall—under those of real or of personal property The general
                    rule of English law is that everything attached to the land goes with the land—
                    <hi rend="italic">quidquid plantatur</hi><hi rend="italic">solo, solo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cedit.</hi> This, like many other rules of English law, is all in
                    favour of the freeholder; and its injustice has been modified by a large number
                    of exceptions formulated from time to time by the courts as occasion arose.</p>
                <p>As to the kind of “fixing” necessary to change the legal character of the thing
                    fixed, it would not be easy to lay down any precise rule. Things merely resting
                    on the ground by the force of their own weight, removable easily and without
                    damage to the soil, and intended not for the improvement of the inheritance but
                    for temporary use, would not be regarded as fixtures. On the other hand, there
                    is what is called constructive annexation, when the articles in question are not
                    in any sense fixed at all, but pass with the freehold as if they were, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the keys of a house, heirlooms, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Questions as to the property in fixtures may arise— (1) between landlord and
                    tenant, (2) between heir and executor, (3) between executor and remainder-man or
                    reversioner. These are the principal cases.</p>
                <p>(1.) As a general rule, if the tenant has affixed anything to the freehold during
                    his occupation, he cannot remove it without the permission of his landlord. But
                    an exception was established in favour of <hi rend="italic">trade fixtures.</hi>
                    In a case before Lord Holt it was held that a soap-boiler might, <hi
                    rend="italic">during his term,</hi> remove the vats he had set up for trade
                    purpose, and that not by virtue of any special custom, but “by the common law in
                    favour of trade, and to encourage industry.” Agriculture is not a trade within
                    the meaning of this exception, and fixtures erected by a farmer for the purposes
                    of agriculture may not be removed without the landlord’s consent. On the other
                    hand, nurserymen and gardeners, whose industry closely resembles agriculture,
                    are allowed to remove trees, shrubs, &amp;c., planted by them with a vie∖v to
                    sale. It seems probable that the introduction of more elaborate mechanical
                    processes in agriculture— particularly the use of steam-power—may have the
                    effect of modifying the law as to agricultural fixtures. The statute 14 and 15
                    Vict. c. 25 enacts that, when a tenant-farmer has, with the written consent of
                    his landlord, erected buildings, machinery, &lt;fcc,, for agricultural or trade
                    purposes, the same shall be his property, and removable by him, after giving
                    notice to the landlord, who may, however, elect to purchase them.</p>
                <p>Again, <hi rend="italic">ornamental</hi> fixtures, such as hangings and
                    looking-glasses, tapestry, iron-backs to chimneys, wainscot fixed by screws,
                    marble chimney-pieces, are held to belong to the tenant, and to be removable
                    without the landlord’s consent. Here again the extent of the privilege is a
                    matter of some uncertainty. In one case it was held that the privilege did not
                    extend to a conservatory erected on a brick foundation 15 inches deep, and
                    connected with other buildings. Mr Amos, in his book on fixtures, mentions four
                    points which would be important in settling whether an ornamental fixture is
                    removable or not :—(1 ) the mode in which it is united with the freehold <hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> its nature and construction,
                    whether meant to be a temporary or permanent improvement; (3) whether it can be
                    easily removed without injury to the freehold; (4) whether there is any local
                    usage.</p>
                <p>In all these cases the fixtures must be removed during the term. If the tenant
                    gives up possession of the premises without removing the fixtures, it will be
                    presumed, it appears, that he has made a gift of them to the landlord, and that
                    presumption probably could not be rebutted by positive evidence of a contrary
                    intention. His right to the fixtures is not, however, destroyed by the mere
                    expiry of the term, if he still remains in possession; but if he has once left
                    the premises, he cannot come back and claim his fixtures. In one case where the
                    fixtures had actually been severed from the freehold after the end of the term,
                    it was held that the tenant had no right to recover them.</p>
                <p>(2.) As between heir and executor or administrator. The question of fixtures
                    arises between these parties on the death of a person owning land. His real
                    property goes to his heir; his personal property goes to his executor. In this
                    case exceptions introduced in favour of the tenant are not allowed in favour of
                    the executor, for, as it is said, tho “heir is a favourite of the law.” There is
                    some conflict of authorities on this point, and cases might be cited on both
                    sides of the question, whether the executor as against the heir has a right to
                    ornamental or even to trade fixtures. Thus in one case a cider-mill let into the
                    ground was held to belong to the executor; in another (a Scotch case before the
                    House of Lords) colliery machinery was awarded to the heir, although portions of
                    it might have been detached without any injury to tho land Blackstone lays down
                    the rule that whatever is strongly affixed to the freehold <hi rend="italic"
                    >{quod ex aedibus non facile</hi><hi rend="italic">revellitur)</hi> passes to
                    the heir.</p>
                <p>(3.) When a tenant for life of land dies the question of fixtures arises between
                    his representatives and the persons next entitled to the estate (the
                    remainder-man or reversioner) The remainder-man is not so great a favourite of
                    the law as the heir, and the right to fixtures is construed more favourably for
                    executors than in the preceding cases between heir and executor. Whatever is
                    executor’s fixtures against the heir would therefore be executor’s fixtures
                    against the remainder-man. And the result of the cases seems to be that, as
                    against the remainder, the executor of the tenant for life would be certainly
                    entitled to trade fixtures.</p>
                <p>Similar questions may arise in other cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as
                    between mortgagor and mortgagee. When land is conveyed the fixtures pass with
                    it, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the conveyance. Again, in
                    reference to bills of sale the question arises. Bills of sale are dispositions
                    of personal property similar to mortgages, the possession remaining with the
                    person selling them. To make them valid they must be registered, and so the
                    question has arisen whether deeds conveying fixtures ought not to have been
                    registered as bills of sale. Unless it was the intention of the parties to make
                    the fixtures a distinct security, it seems a deed of mortgage embracing them
                    does not require to be registered as a bill of sale.</p>
