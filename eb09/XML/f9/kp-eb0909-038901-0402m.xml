                    writing of verses and drawing of caricatures—ever favourite recreations with
                    him—he occupied himself with the collecting and arranging of insects, shells,
                    minerals, fossils, specimens of plants, and other natural history objects. From
                    his fifth to his eleventh year, delicacy of health precluded his attendance at
                    any school, but in 1828 he became a day scholar at Athole House Academy in
                    Douglas, where he was universally beloved by his companions, and was recognized
                    by his master as an apt if not a good scholar. In June 1831 he left the Isle of
                    Man for London, where during four months he studied drawing under Mr Sass, a
                    well-known artist. In October, however, having given up all idea of making
                    painting his profession, he returned home; and in the following month he
                    matriculated as a student of medicine in the university of Edinburgh. During his
                    first winter session there he attended lectures on anatomy, theoretical
                    chemistry, and materia medica; and in the ensuing summer session botany, natural
                    history, and practical chemistry claimed his attention. His vacation in 1832 he
                    spent in diligent work on the natural history of the Isle of Man. In 1833 he
                    made a tour in Norway, the botanical results of which were published in Loudon’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Natural History</hi> for 1835-36. In the summer of
                    1834 he visited the Isle of Man and Wales, and devoted much time to dredging in
                    the Irish Sea; and in the succeeding year he travelled in France, Switzerland,
                    and Germany. Born a naturalist, and having no relish for the practical duties of
                    the surgeon or physician, Forbes was no zealous student of medicine, and he
                    finally in the spring of 1836 abandoned the idea of taking a medical degree,
                    resolving to devote himself to science and literature. The winter of 1836-37
                    found him at Paris, where he attended the lectures at the Jardin des Plantes on
                    natural history, comparative anatomy, geology, and mineralogy. Leaving Paris in
                    April 1837, he repaired to the south of France, whence he*· went to Algiers, and
                    during a month there spent he obtained materials for a paper on land and
                    freshwater Mollusca, published in the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Natural
                    History,</hi> vol. ii. p. 250. In the autumn of the same year he registered at
                    Edinburgh as a student of literature; and in 1838 appeared his first volume, <hi
                    rend="italic">Malacologia Monensis,</hi> a synopsis of the species of Manx
                    Mollusca. During the summer of 1838 he visited Styria and Carniola, and made
                    extensive botanical collections. In the following autumn he read before the
                    British Association at Newcastle a paper on the distribution of terrestrial
                    Pulmonifera in Europe, and was commissioned to prepare a similar report with
                    reference to the British Isles. On returning to Edinburgh he delivered a course
                    of 15 lectures on the natural history of the animals in the British seas. In
                    1841 was completed the publication of Forbes’s great work, <hi rend="italic">A
                    History of British Star-fishes,</hi> embodying the results of researches carried
                    on for a long series of years, and containing 120 illustrations, inclusive of
                    humorous tailpieces, all designed by the author. On April 17th of the same year
                    Forbes, accompanied by his friend William Thompson, joined at MaltaH.M.
                    surveying ship “Beacon,” to which he had been appointed naturalist by her
                    commander Captain Graves. From that date until October 1842 he was busily
                    employed in investigating the botany, zoology, and geology of the Mediterranean
                    region. The results of his researches were made known in his “Report on the
                    Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea, presented to the British Association in
                    1843,” and in <hi rend="italic">Travels in</hi><hi rend="italic">Lycia,</hi>
                    published in conjunction with Lieut. Spratt in 1846. In the former treatise he
                    discussed the influence of climate and of the nature and depth of the sea bottom
                    upon marine life, and divided the AEgean into eight biological zones; his
                    conclusions with respect to bathymetrical distribution, however, have been shown
                    by later investigators to require certain considerable modifications. Towards
                    the end of the year 1842 Forbes, whom family misfortunes had now thrown upon his
                    own resources for a means of livelihood, sought and obtained the curatorship of
                    the collections of the Geological Society of London. To the duties of that post
                    he, in May of the following year, added those of the professorship of botany at
                    King’s College, where he lectured with success to the second largest botanical
                    class in London. On November 1, 1844, having resigned the curatorship of the
                    Geological Society, he became palaeontologist to the Geological Survey, with a
                    yearly salary of £300. In 1846 Forbes published in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs
                    of the Geological Survey,</hi> i. 336, his important treatise “On the Connexion
                    between the existing Fauna and Flora of the British Isles, and the Geographical
                    Changes which have affected their Area.” It is therein pointed out that, in
                    accordance with the theory of their origin from various specific centres, the
                    plants of Great Britain may be divided into five well-marked groups :—the W. and
                    S.W. Irish, represented in the N. of Spain; the S.E. Irish and S.W. English,
                    related to the flora of the Channel Isles and the neighbouring part of France;
                    the S.E. English, characterized by species occurring on the opposite French
                    coast; a group peculiar to mountain summits, Scandinavian in type; and, lastly,
                    a general or Germanic flora. From a variety of arguments the conclusion is drawn
                    that the greater part of the terrestrial animals and flowering plants of the
                    British Islands migrated thitherward, over continuous land, at three distinct
                    periods, before, during, and after the glacial epoch. In the autumn of 1848
                    Forbes married the daughter of General Sir C. Ashworth. The year 1851 witnessed
                    the removal of the collections of the Geological Survey from Craig’s Court to
                    the new museum in Jermyn Street, and the appointment of Forbes as professor of
                    natural history to the Royal School of Mines just established in conjunction
                    therewith. In 1852 was published the fourth and concluding volume of Forbes and
                    Hanley’s <hi rend="italic">History of British</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mollusca.</hi> In 1853 Forbes held the presidency of the Geological Society of
                    London, and in the following year he obtained the fulfilment of a long-cherished
                    wish in his appointment to the professorship of natural history in the
                    university of Edinburgh, vacant by the death of Jameson, his former teacher.
                    Since his return from the East in 1842, the determination and arrangement of
                    fossils, the investigation of strata, frequent lectures, and incessant and
                    wearing literary work, including the preparation of his admirable
                    palaeontological memoirs, and of a variety of scientific articles and reviews,
                    had precluded Forbes from giving that attention to the natural history pursuits
                    of his earlier life which he had for years earnestly desired. It seemed that at
                    length he was to find leisure to reduce to order and commit to the keeping of
                    the press those vast <pb break="no"

                    protracted and original research had made him the possessor. At Edinburgh, in
                    the summer session of 1854, he lectured to a large and appreciative audience;
                    and in September of that year he occupied the post of president of the
                    geological section at the meeting of the British Association. He had already
                    commenced his winter’s course of lectures in Edinburgh when he was seized with
                    feverishness, culminating in an attack of nephritic disease, from which he had
                    on several previous occasions been a sufferer. His symptoms soon became
                    alarming, and after not many days’ illness he expired at Wardie, near Edinburgh,
                    Nov. 18, 1854, in the fortieth year of his age.</p>
