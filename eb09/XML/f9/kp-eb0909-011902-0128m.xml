                <p><label type="entry">FEU</label>, in the law of Scotland, signifies, in its widest
                    sense, any tenure of land by which the relation of superior (or overlord) and
                    vassal is constituted. Of these tenures the feudal system in Scotland has
                    recognized five,—ward (the original military tenure, abolished in 1747), feu,
                    blench, mortification, and burgage. The term feu, however, is now in practice
                    restricted to one of these, feu-holding or feu-farm, which is a grant of land,
                    or property connected with land, in perpetuity, on condition of the grantee
                    making to the granter a fixed annual payment of a substantial nature, with a
                    liability for certain contingent payments termed casualties—the radical right to
                    the whole remaining with the granter. It is opposed to blench-holding—the only
                    other feudal tenure now made use of in Scotland—in which the payment to the
                    superior is merely nominal in amount, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a penny
                    Scots. The feudal system embraces the whole of Scotland except Orkney and
                    Shetland, where remains of the udal right are still to be found. It is a
                    fundamental principle of the system as developed in Scotland to permit
                    subinfeudation to an unlimited extent,— that is, every vassal, unless restrained
                    by special agreement, may feu the whole or part of his land to another person,
                    who thereby becomes his sub-vassal; and by the Act of 1874 conditions by
                    superiors prohibiting subinfeudation cannot thereafter be lawfully made. The
                    feu-duty is usually a payment either in money or in kind. Services, however, are
                    still legal if they are not of a military nature; but they must be paid within
                    the year, as is also the case with blench duties of whatever sort. The
                    casualties now recognized are—relief, the fine payable by an heir on succeeding
                    , composition, that payable by a stranger; and liferent escheat, the forfeiture
                    to the superior of the annual profits of the land while the vassal is civilly
                    dead for failing to answer for a crime. The vassal, also, if he is two years in
                    arrears in payment of the feu-duty and allows decree of irritancy, as it is
                    called, to pass against him, loses his right absolutely. Casualties were at one
                    time more numerous and more irksome in their incidence than at present, for the
                    law now regards with disfavour all feudal payments not of a fixed periodical
                    nature. Indeed it may be said that casualties no longer exist, for the
                    Conveyancing (Scotland) Act of 1874 has abolished all payments of a contingent
                    nature in new feus, and provides for the commutation of those already existing.
                    This Act, while it has preserved the name, has really destroyed the relation of
                    superior and vassal, as that has been long understood in Scotland. A feu is the
                    usual title upon which land is granted for building purposes in Scotland. Long
                    building leases are not much known; and this has greatly contributed to the
                    durable nature and value of Scotch house property.</p>
