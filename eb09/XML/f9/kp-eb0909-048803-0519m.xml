                    de</hi></label> (1755- 1809), a celebrated chemist, son of an apothecary in the
                    household of the duke of Orleans, was born at Paris, June 15, 1755. Some of his
                    ancestors had been distinguished at the bar, but the branch of the family to
                    which he belonged had become greatly reduced in circumstances. At the age of
                    fourteen Fourcroy left the college at Harcourt, where he had profited but little
                    by the instruction of a harsh teacher. Deterred by the ill-success of a friend
                    from going upon the stage, he for two years maintained himself as a copyist and
                    writing-master; he then, in consequence of unjust treatment there received, left
                    the office of his employer. At this juncture, Vicq d’Azyr, who having boarded at
                    his home had become acquainted with the young man’s talents, encouraged him to
                    enter upon a medical career. ,We accordingly now behold Fourcroy a poor and
                    hard-working student of medicine, his lodging a garret, in the middle only of
                    which was it possible to stand upright, and his near neighbour a water-carrier,
                    to whose family of twelve he acted as physician, receiving for his services a
                    good supply of water. To support himself he gave lessons to other students, and
                    made translations for a bookseller, who, 30 years later, when Fourcroy had
                    become director-general of public instruction, conscientiously offered to make
                    up for the meagreness of his former remuneration. In 1777, under the auspices of
                    the Société Royale de Médecine, appeared Fourcroy’s first publication, <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Maladies des Artisans,</hi>
                    the translation of a Latin work by Ramazzini, with notes and additions. At
                    length Fourcroy, who was recognized as the most successful alumnus of the
                    Parisian medical school, became an applicant for a gratuitous degree and
                    licence, provision for the granting of which to the best deserving poor student
                    had been made by the bequest of a Dr Diest. It so happened that the faculty of
                    physic at Paris entertained feelings of the most jealous enmity against the
                    newly-founded Société Royale de Médecine, of which Vicq d’Azyr was perpetual
                    secretary, and to humiliate him, and in him the whole society, it rejected his
                    protégé Fourcroy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n520/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0520-0489"/>
                <p>Upon this the society itself subscribed the fees requisite for a diploma (£250),
                    which was obtained by Fourcroy in 1780; but as the degree of “docteur regent”
                    was unanimously refused, it was impossible for him to procure any professorship
                    under the faculty. However, in 1784 his reputation as a chemist gained for him,
                    although Berthollet was his fellow candidate, the lectureship of chemistry at
                    the college of the Jardin du Roi, which had become vacant by the death of
                    Macquer, one of the last of the phlogistic school. This post he continued to
                    hold for the next 25 years; and so great were the crowds which his eloquence
                    attracted that it was twice necessary to enlarge his lecture-theatre. Fourcroy
                    was one of the first converts to the theories of Lavoisier, which he designated
                    “La Chimie Française,” a name which, as Thomson remarks <hi rend="italic"
                    >(History of Chemistry,</hi> ii. ρ. 130), “certainly contributed more than
                    anything else to give the new notions currency, at least in France.” Together
                    with Berthollet, Fourcroy was associated with Lavoisier and Guyton de Morveau in
                    1786 and 1787 in the preparation of a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Methode de
                    Nomenclature</hi><hi rend="italic">Chimique,</hi> published in the latter year.
                    In 1785 a memoir on the tendons, subsequently completed in six parts, gained for
                    him admission into the French Academy of Sciences. He became in 1792 one of the
                    deputies of the National Convention, and in 1793 a member of the Assembly, and
                    soon proved himself one of the most active of the committee for the public
                    instruction. To him was due the enlargement of the Jardin des Plantes, and the
                    formation of a commission for the preservation of works of art. He further was
                    the means of releasing from imprisonment Desault, surgeon of the Hôtel-Dieu, and
                    of preventing the execution of Darcet, though, unfortunately for science, he
                    found no opportunity of rescuing Lavoisier. On the 9th of Thermidor he was
                    appointed a member of the committee for the public safety, and in this capacity
                    he instituted three schools of medicine, assisted in the organization of the
                    École Polytechnique (at that time the École des Travaux Publiques), and was
                    concerned also in the establishment of the École Normale, the Institut, and the
                    Musée d’Histoire Naturelle. After the revolution of the 9th November 1799 he was
                    made a councillor of state; and, being appointed director-general of
                    instruction, he in the course of 5 years superintended the formation of 12
                    schools of law, over 30 lyceums, afterwards called royal colleges, and 300
                    elementary schools. His incessant labours at length told on his health, and he
                    suffered greatly from palpitation of the heart. On the 16th December 1809, the
                    very day on which by letters patent he had been created a count of the French
                    empire, with a yearly pension of 20,000 francs, he was signing some despatches
                    when he suddenly exclaimed “Je suis mort,” and with those words expired.</p>
