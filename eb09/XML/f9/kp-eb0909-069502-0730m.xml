                    Boisy being derived from one of her hereditary possessions. Francis was their
                    eldest son, born six years after marriage, and the child of many prayers. He
                    received his education first at Annecy, then at the Jesuit College de Clermont
                    in Paris, and for some time it seemed uncertain whether he should devote himself
                    to law or the church. He studied jurisprudence, after leaving Paris, at Padua,
                    became an advocate of the senate of Savoy, and seemed likely to gratify his
                    father’s cherished ambition for his future career. But all the while Francis’s
                    own inclinations were strongly towards the church. He had received the tonsure
                    as early as 1578, while still a boy at Annecy, very much against his father’s
                    wishes, and the spirit shown in this early manifestation of pious self-devotion
                    never forsook him. Notwithstanding all his father’s remonstrances, he resolved
                    to enter an ecclesiastical life; and, the office of provost or dean of Geneva
                    becoming vacant, the dignity of this office, which was offered to him, was used
                    as a temptation to secure the father’s consent. At length Μ. de Boisy gave way.
                    Francis received holy orders (1593), and entered upon his duties as dean and
                    preacher. He possessed great gifts as a preacher, and his fame soon spread
                    through Savoy. His sermons were marked by great simplicity and persuasiveness.
                    “The only real point of preaching, he said, “is the overthrow of sin and the
                    increase of righteousness;” and the principle of this saying guided him in all
                    his sermons. He <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0731-0696"/> preached constantly, and in the simplest and most
                    touching and popular words he could find. His father failed to appreciate his
                    style of preaching, as he had failed to understand his self-denial. “I never
                    refused to preach,” Francis tells us, “on the principle of ‘ give to them that
                    ask you.’ My dear father used to hear the bells ringing, and asked who preached.
                    ‘Who but your son,’ was often the answer. One day he took me aside and said, ‘
                    Provost, you preach too often; even on week days the bells go, and it is always
                    the same story, the provost, the provost! It used not to be so in my day.
                    Sermons were much rarer. But then, to be sure, God knows those were something
                    like sermons— full of learning, well got up, more Latin and Greek in one than
                    you stick into a dozen.’” Francis, however, knew his own mind, and was not
                    moved. “My test of the worth of a preacher,” he said, “is when his congregation
                    go away saying not ‘ what a beautiful sermon,’ but ‘ I will do something.’” A
                    man may set forth his own learning and eloquence in a fine sermon, but the true
                    sign of success is when his words, induce people to leave off bad habits. And as
                    he preached often, he preached briefly. “The more you say, the less people
                    remember; the fewer your words, the greater their profit,” was his motto. “When
                    a sermon is too long, the end makes one forget the middle, and the middle the
                    beginning.”</p>
                <p>Francis was plainly a man of some originality both of mind and character, and
                    destined to become a power in the church to which he had so passionately devoted
                    himself. Accordingly he soon became marked out for arduous work. Savoy was at
                    this time greatly invaded by Calvinistic “heresies.” The neighbourhood of
                    Geneva—a focus for the dissemination of Protestantism—and the political and
                    military complications arising out of the hostile relations of the duke of Savoy
                    and the king of France, all tended to the progress of Calvinism. Chablais had
                    been invaded, and Protestant ministers long established at Thonon and other
                    towns. For nearly sixty years in fact this region had been Protestant, and the
                    people by express stipulation enjoyed the exercise of the Reformed religion. A
                    missionary of apostolic fervour and courage was required to recover the lapsed
                    district to the Catholic faith, and all eyes were turned to the young provost of
                    Geneva as the only man fitted to grapple with the exigencies of the position.
                    His father as usual was the obstacle. He entreated his son not to expose himself
                    to the dangers of such a mission, but Francis felt the call within him, and
                    calmly replied, “I cannot refuse to obey, ‘Wist ye not that I must be about my
                    father’s business? ’” The result was that he gave himself for four years
                    (1594-1598) to laborious and self-denying work in the district, often, it is
                    said by his flattering biographers, preaching and administering the offices of
                    his church at the peril of his life. His persuasive eloquence and the apostolic
                    simplicity of his life were at first unsuccessful. The inhabitants of Chablais
                    remained hardened in Protestanism. But more violent measures, some of them
                    reflecting little honour on Francis, at length succeeded in reclaiming the
                    district to the Catholic faith. His success in this work led the pope to believe
                    that he might gain over Calvin’s celebrated successor, Theodore Beza; and
                    lengthened conferences were held between the Protestant teacher and the Roman
                    Catholic missionary, but without result. In 1598 Francis was appointed coadjutor
                    bishop of Geneva, and became the official companion, as he had long been the
                    warm friend of Claude de Garnier, the aged bishop who had fostered his talents
                    and largely shaped his career. Some years after this, in 1602, he spent some
                    time in France and especially in Paris, where his preaching attracted great
                    crowds, and his influence was felt from the court of Henry IV. to the poor
                    sisters at Port Royal. Before St Cyran became the spiritual leader of Angelique
                    Arnaud and others of the devoted band which gathered around him, Francis had
                    given a definite direction to her thoughts and aspirations. It is not the name
                    of Angelique Arnaud, however, but that of another celebrated pietist, who was
                    destined to be associated with Francis de Sales. Shortly after his succession to
                    the bishopric by the death of his aged friend, he met at Dijon Madame de
                    Chantal, a character of rare enthusiasm and devotion, whose spirit had been
                    greatly chastened by the loss of her husband and child. She put herself under
                    his direction, cut off her beautiful hair, and clothed herself as a religieuse.
                    Her good works were incessant, and she became known as the “Sainte de
                    Monthélon.” At length Francis prepared a mission for her. Submitting her saintly
                    obedience to various tests, he intimated his decision that she was destined to
                    establish an order for the relief of the sick and the poor, the only rules for
                    which were to be “charity and the love of Jesus Christ.” The order was not fully
                    established till 1610, but gradually acquired great influence. The relation of
                    the saint to Madame de Chantal and other devout ladies has been much canvassed.
                    There was a good deal of spiritual coquetry in it, and some of his letters to
                    them contain doubtful sentiments; but there is no reason to doubt the purity of
                    his character, and that his main object was to promote what he considered to be
                    the interests of religion. He liked to be “surrounded by women,” but chiefly
                    that he might influence them for the good of the church. In 1608 Francis
                    published his best known and most valuable work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la Vie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dévote,</hi> the circulation of which was immense. He became
                    famous through all the Catholic world. Henry IV. sought to tempt him by a French
                    bishopric; but he remained true to the country of his birth, and the
                    comparatively quiet and unambitious life he was able to continue there. Loving,
                    as all men of his temperament and religious attractiveness more or less do, to
                    impress the force of his mind and character upon others, he yet seems to have
                    been honestly free from vulgar ambition. He was a true priest, and found ample
                    gratification in the diffusion of the spiritual charm and potency which radiated
                    from his character and writings. His apparent simplicity was one of the most
                    powerful elements of the wide influence which he exerted. Both as a preacher and
                    as a writer a certain overweening “sweetness” may be said to be his marked
                    characteristic,—a sweetness at times not without duplicity and a taint of
                    cold-blooded fanaticism. Possessing singular graces of character, he was yet
                    above all things an ecclesiastic, and had few scruples in serving the interests
                    of his order and church. Superior to the coarser aspirations and the more
                    commonplace ambitions of his time, he was yet often a subtle politician in the
                    guise of a saint; and if his animating aim was to rule hearts rather than
                    possess for himself a great position, the means by which he sought to do so were
                    in many cases more adroit than magnanimous. He died in the end of 1622, and was
                    canonized in 1665.</p>
