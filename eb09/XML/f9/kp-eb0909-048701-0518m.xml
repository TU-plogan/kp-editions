                    courtiers and officials; and it is stated that Fouquet for a time provided the
                    means of meeting the expenses of the state out of his own fortune or by loans
                    obtained on his own credit. He had long been in the confidence of the first
                    minister, Cardinal Mazarin, and was his zealous instrument. But soon after the
                    marriage of Louis XIV. a quarrel broke out between them, and thenceforth each
                    was bent on injuring the other. The increasing deficit in the treasury alarmed
                    the king; inquiries were addressed to Colbert, who was secretly ambitious of
                    succeeding Fouquet as minister of finance, and he consequently made the worst of
                    the case against Fouquet. The extravagant expenditure and personal display of
                    the superintendent served to intensify the ill-will of the king. Fouquet had
                    bought the port of Belle-Isle, and strengthened its fortifications, with a view
                    to taking refuge there in case of disgrace. He had spent enormous sums in
                    building a palace on his estate of Vaux, which in its extent, magnificence, and
                    splendour of decoration, was almost a forecast of Versailles. He had cherished
                    the hope of succeeding Mazarin as first minister, and had even made advances to
                    Mademoiselle de la Vallière. In August 1661 he entertained the king at his
                    palace of Vaux, giving him a fête unrivalled for magnificence, at which <hi

                    the king could not be appeased. By crafty devices Fouquet had been induced to
                    sell his office of <hi rend="italic">procureur-général,</hi> thus losing the
                    protection of its privileges, and he had paid the price of it into the treasury.
                    The king, however, was only prevented from arresting him at the fête by the
                    pleading of the queen mother. He dissembled for a short time, and the arrest was
                    made about three weeks later at Nantes. Fouquet, after several removals from
                    prison to prison, was sent to the Bastille. His trial extended over several
                    years, and excited the deepest interest. In 1664 he was condemned and sentenced
                    to perpetual exile and confiscation of his property. The sentence, however, was
                    commuted into one of imprisonment for life in the fortress of Pignerol. He bore
                    his fate with manly fortitude, and composed in prison several devotional works.
                    He died at Pignerol, March 23, 1680. The report of his trial was published in
                    Holland, in 15 vols., in 1665-1667, in spite of the remonstrances which Colbert
                    addressed to the states-general. A second edition, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi><hi rend="italic">de Μ. Fouquet,</hi> appeared in
                    1696.</p>
