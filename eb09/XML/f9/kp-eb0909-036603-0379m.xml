                    and countries. Not only have there always been individuals naturally inclined
                    and endowed to amuse others; there has been besides in most communities a
                    definite class, the members of which have used their powers or weaknesses in
                    this direction as a regular means of getting a livelihood. Savage jugglers,
                    medicine-men, and even priests, have certainly much in common with the jester by
                    profession. There existed in ancient Greece a distinct class of professed fools
                    whose habits were not essentially different from those of the jesters of the
                    Middle Ages. Of the behaviour of one of these, named Philip, Xenophon has given
                    a picturesque account in the <hi rend="italic">Banquet.</hi> Philip of Macedon
                    is said to have possessed a court fool, and certainly these (as well as court
                    poets and court philosophers, with whom they have sometimes been not
                    unreasonably confounded) were common in a number of the petty courts at that era
                    of civilization. <hi rend="italic">Scurrae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >moriones</hi> were the Roman parallels of the mediaeval witty fool; and during
                    the empire the manufacture of human monstrosites was a regular practice, slaves
                    of this kind being much in request to relieve the languid hours. The jester
                    again has from time immemoral existed at eastern courts. Witty stories are told
                    of Bahalul (see D’Herbelot, <hi rend="italic">s.vſ)</hi> the jester of Haroun Al
                    Raschid, which have long had a place in Western fiction. On the conquest of
                    Mexico court fools and deformed human creatures of all kinds were found at the
                    court of Montezuma. But that monarch no doubt hit upon one great cause of the
                    favour of monarchs for this class when he said that “more instruction was to be
                    gathered from them than from wiser men, for they dared to tell the truth.” Mr
                    Douce, in his essay <hi rend="italic">On the Clowns and Fools of
                    Shakespeare,</hi> has made a ninefold division of English fools, according to
                    quality and place of employment, as the domestic fool, the city or corporation
                    fool, the tavern fool, the fool of the mysteries and moralities. The last is
                    generally called the “vice,” and is the original of the stage clowns so common
                    among the dramatists of the time of Elizabeth, and who embody so much of the wit
                    of Shakespeare. A very palpable classification is that which distinguishes
                    between such creatures as were chosen to excite to laughter from some deformity
                    of mind or body, and such as were so chosen for a certain (to all appearance
                    generally very shallow) alertness of mind and power of repartee,—or briefly,
                    butts and wits. The dress of the regular court fool of the Middle Ages was not
                    altogether a rigid uniform. To judge from the prints and illuminations which are
                    the sources of our knowledge on this matter, it seems to have changed
                    considerably from time to time. The head was shaved, the coat was motley, and
                    the breeches tight, with generally one leg different in colour from the other.
                    The head was covered with a garment resembling a monk’s cowl, which fell over
                    the breast and shoulders, and often bore asses’ ears, and was crested with a
                    cockscomb, while bells hung from various parts of the attire. The fool’s bauble
                    was a short staff bearing a ridiculous head, to which was sometimes attached an
                    inflated bladder, by means of which sham castigations were effected. A long
                    petticoat was also occasionally worn, but seems to have belonged rather to the
                    idiots than to the wits.</p>
                <p>The fool’s business was to amuse his master, to excite him to laughter by sharp
                    contrast, to prevent the over-oppression of state affairs, and, in harmony with
                    a well-known physiological precept, by his liveliness at meals to assist his
                    lord’s digestion. The names and the witticisms of many of the official jesters
                    at the courts of Europe have been preserved by popular or state records. In
                    England the list is long between Hitard, the fool of Edmund Ironside, and Muckle
                    John, the fool of Charles I., and probably the last official royal fool of
                    England. Many are remembered from some connexion with general or literary
                    history. Scogan was attached to Edward IV., and under his name Andrew Boorde
                    published a collection of poor jests. Will Sommers, of the time of Henry VIII.,
                    seems to have been α kind-hearted as well as a witty man, and occasionally used
                    his influence with the king for good and charitable purposes. Arnim, who, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Nest of Ninnies,</hi> gives a full description of Sommers, and
                    introduces many popular fools, says of him—</p>
                <p>“Only this much, he was a poor man’s friend, And helpt the widow often in her
                    end.</p>
                <p>The king would ever grant what he would crave, For well he knew Will no exacting
                    knave.’</p>
                <p>The literature of the period immediately succeeding his death is full of
                    allusions to Will Sommers. John Heywood was an educated man, a poet and
                    dramatist, as well as jester to Queen Mary, Some of his dialogues have in
                    conception a racy national humour. John Tarleton, famous as a comic actor,
                    cannot be omitted from any list of jesters. A book of Tarleton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Jests,</hi> was published in 1611, and, together with his <hi
                    rend="italic">News Out of Purgatory,</hi> was reprinted by Mr Halliwell for the
                    Shakespeare Society in 1844. Archie Armstrong, for a too free use of wit and
                    tongue against Laud, lost his office and was banished the court. The conduct of
                    the archbishop against the poor fool is not the least item of the evidence which
                    convicts him of a certain narrow-mindedness and pettiness. In French history,
                    too, the figure of the court-jester flits across the gay or sombre scene at
                    times with fantastic effect. Caillette <pb break="no"

                    times of Francis I. Triboulet appears in Rabelais’s romance, and is the hero of
                    Victor Hugo’s <hi rend="italic">Le Roi s’amuse,</hi> and, with some changes, of
                    Verdi’s opera <hi rend="italic">Rigoletto;</hi> while Chicot, the lithe and
                    acute Gascon, who was so close a friend of Henry HL, is pourtrayed with
                    considerable justness by Dumas in his <hi rend="italic">Dame de Monsoreau.</hi>
                    In Germany Rudolph of Hapsburg had his Pfaff Cappadox, Maximilian I. his Kunz
                    von der Rosen (whose features, as well as those of our own Will Sommers, have
                    been preserved by the pencil of Holbein) and many a petty court its jester after
                    jester. Late in the 16 th century appeared <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sottilissime Astuzie di Bertoldo,</hi> which is one of the most
                    remarkable books ever written about a jester. It is by Giulio Cesare Croce, a
                    street musician of Bologna, and is a comic romance giving an account of the
                    appearance at the court of Alboin king of the Lombards of a peasant wonderful in
                    ugliness, good sense, and wit. The book was for a time the most popular in
                    Italy. A great number of editions and translations appeared, and it was even
                    versified. Though fiction, both the character and the career of Bertoldo are
                    typical of the jester. That the private fool existed as late as the last century
                    is proved by Swift’s epitaph on Dicky Pearce, the earl of Suffolk’s jester.</p>
