                    an English historian, biographer, journalist, and critic, was born April 2,
                    1812, at Newcastle, where his father, a member of the Unitarian Church, followed
                    the occupation of a butcher. He was well grounded in classics and mathematics at
                    the grammarschool of his native town, and gave early promise of future
                    distinction. After a brief residence at Cambridge he removed in 1828 to London,
                    where he attended law classes in connexion with the recently founded university,
                    but devoted himself chiefly to literary pursuits. The earlier productions of his
                    pen were contributed to various liberal papers, particularly to <hi

                    for the last-named journal, he from the outset showed much conscientiousness,
                    discrimination, and tact, and the influence of his powerful individuality soon
                    made itself strongly felt. He had not long passed his twentieth year when the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Lives of Eminent British Statesmen</hi>
                    began. This work, originally undertaken for Lardner’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclopaedia,</hi> and published separately in 1840 under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England, with a Treatise on
                    the Popular Progress in English History,</hi> was immediately recognized as a
                    work of great interest and value, entitling its author to high literary rank.
                    Thenceforward he was a prominent figure in that distinguished circle of literary
                    men which included such names as Bulwer, Talfourd, Fonblanque, Landor, Carlyle,
                    Dickens. In 1843 he was called to the bar by the benchers of the Inner Temple;
                    but while highly valuing this honourable connexion with the legal profession, ho
                    never became or sought to become a practising lawyer. His energies were mainly
                    devoted to laborious historical investigations, while relaxation was sought
                    chiefly in lighter forms of literary activity. For some years he edited the <hi

                    Fonblanque, he became editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> and this
                    post he retained till 1856. From 1836 onwards he contributed to the <hi

                    articles, some of which were republished in two volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographical and Historical Essays</hi> in 1858. In 1848 appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Oliver Goldsmith,</hi> which, especially as revised and
                    improved in a second edition (1854), has taken an acknowledged place as one of
                    the most admirably executed biographies to be found in the whole range of
                    English literature. Continuing his original researches into English history at
                    the period of the Revolution, he published in 1860 two volumes, respectively
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Arrest of the Five Members by Charles I.— A Chapter
                    of English History rewritten,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Debates on the
                    Grand Remonstrance, with an Introductory Essay on English Freedom.</hi> These
                    were followed by his <hi rend="italic">Biography of Sir John Eliot,</hi>
                    published in 1864, an elaborate and finished picture from one of his earlier
                    studies for the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Statesmen.</hi> In 1868 appeared
                    his biography of his friend Walter Savage Landor. For several years he had been
                    collecting materials for a life of Swift, but his studies in this direction were
                    for a time suspended in consequence of the death of Charles Dickens, with whom
                    he had long been on terms of intimate friendship. The first volume of Forster’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> appeared in 1871, and the work was
                    completed in 1874. Towards the close of 1875 the first volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Swift</hi> was published; and he had made some progress in
                    the preparation of the second, when he was seized with an illness of which he
                    died on the 1st of February 1876. He lies buried in Kensal-Green Cemetery, where
                    a just and discriminative inscription tells that he was “noted in private life
                    for the robustness of his character and the warmth of his affections; for his
                    ceaseless industry in literature and business, and the lavish services which, in
                    the midst of his crowded life, he rendered to his friends; for his keen
                    appreciation of every species of excellence, and the generosity of his judgments
                    on books and men.” In 1855 Forster had been appointed secretary to the Lunacy
                    Commission, and for some years after 1861 he held the office of a commissioner
                    in lunacy. In 1860 he received the honorary degree of LL.D, from the university
                    of Edinburgh. His valuable collection’of manuscripts, along with his books and
                    pictures, was bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum.</p>
