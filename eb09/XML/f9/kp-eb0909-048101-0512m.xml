                    from death by exposure, and it is therefore difficult to describe them properly
                    apart from the general subject of infanticide. This practice was extremely
                    common among nearly all ancient nations. It may still be studied in such
                    horrible institutions of savage life as the Areoi of the Society Islands, or the
                    Meebra of New South Wales; and it may be found in the greatest variety of form
                    among the tribes of Hindustan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Baluchistan, where children are often drowned in milk, there is a euphemistic

                    extremely practical. As the natives of Gujarat said to Major Walker, “Pay our
                    daughters’ marriage portions, and they shall live.” The feeling here was one of
                    social dignity mixed with the strong contempt which many savages express for the
                    single life. But in most cases children were killed simply because the parents,
                    having no realized wealth, did not expect to be able to clothe and feed them.
                    This is especially seen in the frequent killing of female children and those who
                    are sick or deformed. In some places the practice has been confined to the
                    children of concubines, of stranger fathers, or of mothers dying from sickness.
                    In the earliest society the right to kill belonged to the father, sometimes
                    assisted by a person skilled in omens, or by a council of friends. But the usage
                    soon hardened into a binding custom or into express legislation. Thus in the
                    exogamous communities girls were clearly a source, not of weakness only, but of
                    danger. At a much later period the number of a family, or of the daughters, was
                    often fixed by law, and both Lycurgus and the Roman decemvirs directed the
                    slaughter of deformed children. This violence to the domestic affections was
                    probably made easier by the notion which appears in Greek science and in Roman
                    law that neither the foetus nor the newly-born child is entitled to the
                    privileges of humanity. The Greek pastoral of Longus <hi rend="italic">(The
                    Loves of</hi><hi rend="italic">Daphnis</hi><hi rend="italic">and Chloe),</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Heautontimorumenos</hi> of Terence, show still better
                    than the text of laws how the conscience of a civilized society reconciled
                    itself to such cruelties. And the sober reasoning of Aristotle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Republic,</hi> vii. c. 16) goes even beyond the custom of his time. Pliny the
                    elder defends infanticide as a necessary check on population, and Quintilian and
                    Seneca bear witness to the frightful mortality among children exposed, and the
                    systematic mutilation of those who survived. Notwithstanding the eloquent
                    protests of the Christian fathers, it was not till the time of Severus and
                    Caracalla that a Roman lawyer ventured to make the noble statement, “Necare
                    videtur non tantum is qui partum perfocat, sed is qui abjicit et qui alimonia
                    denegat, et is qui publicij locis misericordiae causa exponit quam ipse non

                    a declaration that the killing of a son was parricide, but the famous law of
                    Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian (unusquisque suam sobolem nutriat, C. viii. 52,
                    2) punished exposure by the loss of the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi>
                    and secured the rights of the foster-father. Finally, by Novel 153, Justinian
                    declared that the foundling should no longer be the slave of the foster-father,
                    but should be free. This, however, did not affect western Europe, where social
                    disorder and the recurrence of famine led to extensive sales of children.
                    Against this evil, which was noticed by several councils, the church provided a
                    rough system of relief, children being deposited <hi rend="italic"
                    >(jactati)</hi> in marble shells at the church doors, and tended first by the
                    <hi rend="italic">matricularii</hi> or male nurses, and then by the <hi

                    are said to have existed in the Eastern empire at this time, nor of the public
                    tables (such as Velleiana, Baebiana) which particular emperors are said to have
                    provided for the support of children. The earlier traditions of a hospital at
                    the Cynosarges in Athens and at the Columna Lactaria in the vegetable market at
                    Rome are disputed. It is in the 7th and 8th centuries that definite institutions
                    for foundlings are established in such towns as Trêves, Milan, and Montpellier.
                    In the 15th century Garcias, archbishop of Valentia, is a conspicuous figure in
                    this charitable work; but his fame is entirely eclipsed by that of St Vincent

                <p>Paul, who in the reign of Louis XIII., with the help of the countess of Joigny,
                    Mme. le Gras, and other religious ladies, rescued the foundlings of Paris from
                    the horrors of a primitive institution named La Couche (Rue St Landry), and
                    ultimately obtained from Louis XIV. the use of the Bicêtre for their
                    accommodation. Letters patent were granted to the Paris hospital in 1670. The
                    Hôtel-Dieu of Lyons was the next in importance. No provision, however, was made
                    outside the great towns; the houses in the cities were overcrowded and
                    administered with laxity; and in 1784 Necker prophesied that the state would yet
                    be seriously embarrassed by this increasing evil.<note anchored="true"

                    Revolution undertook as a state debt the support of every foundling. For a time
                    premiums were given to the mothers of illegitimate children, the “enfants de la

                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> The present laws of France relating to this part
                    of what is called L’Assistance Publique are the decree of January 1811, the
                    instruction of February 1823, the decree of 5th March 1852, ami the law of 5th
                    May 1869. These laws carry out the general principles of the law of 7th Frimaire
                    An V., which completely decentralized the system of national poor relief
                    established, by the Revolution. The “enfants assistés ’’include, besides orphans
                    and foundlings proper, infants brought by their parents into the asylum, and
                    those born in lying-in hospitals and left there by their mothers, children of
                    persons undergoing a judicial sentence, children temporarily taken in while
                    their parents are in the hospital, and an increasing number of children,
                    legitimate, illegitimate, and orphans, who are supported by a system of out-door
                    relief. The asylum which receives them is a departmental and not a communal
                    institution. The state pays only the cost of inspection and superintendence.
                    There remain the “home” expenses, for the nurse (nourrice sédentaire), washing,
                    and clothes; and the “out-door” expenses, which include (1) temporary assistance
                    to unmarried mothers in order to prevent desertion; (2) allowances to the
                    foster-fathers (pères nourriciers) in the country for board, school money,
                    &amp;c.; (3) clothing; (4) travelling money for nurses and children; (5)
                    printing, &amp;c.; and (6) expenses in time of sickness and for burials and
                    apprentice fees. In 1868 the total cost wasll,3OO,171 frs., of which 2,570,171
                    frs. were paid by the regular foundling asylums, and 8,730,000 frs. by the
                    departments and communes. This represented the support of 67,000 children. In
                    1828 there were 112,730 children supported at a cost of 9,794,737 frs. The
                    decrease is attributed partly to out-door relief and partly to the suppression
                    of the “tours,” of which there were 235 in 1812, and only 25 in 1860. No
                    payments are made for the children after the age of twelve. They are generally
                    apprenticed to a peasant or artisan, and until majority they remain under the
                    guardianship of the administrative commissioners of the department. These
                    commissioners are about to receive a representative character, the councils of
                    the communes and the department, the chambers of øonimerce, and the chief
                    religious communities receiving a right of nomination, as well as the prefect
                    who represents the state. The ministry of marine have a legal claim to the
                    services of male foundlings, which is seldom exercised. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >droit de recherche</hi> is conceded to the parent on payment of a small fee.
                    The decree of 1811 contemplated the repayment of all expenses by a parent
                    reclaiming a child. The same decree directed a ‘ ‘ tour” or revolving box <hi
                    rend="italic">(DrchcyUnder</hi> in Germany) to be kept at each hospital. These
                    have been gradually discontinued. The “Assistance Publique” of Paris is
                    specially provided for by the law of 10th January 1849. The management consists
                    of a “directeur” appointed by the minister of the interior, andassociated with a
                    representative “conseil de surveillance.” The Paris Asylum for Enfants Trouvés,
                    with a small branch at Forges, contains about 700 beds. It receives about 4200
                    children in the year, or nearly one-seventh of the whole annual supply in
                    France; and the total average cost of each child for twelve years is said to be
                    only 1500 frs. There is also in Paris (43 Rue de Journelles) a private charity
                    called <hi rend="italic">Oeuvre de</hi><hi rend="italic">VAdoption</hi> for the
                    adoption of poor children and orphans. Among the better known school farms which

                <p><hi rend="italic">Belgium.—</hi> In this country the arrangements for the relief
                    of foundlings and the appropriation of public funds for that purpose very much
                    resemble those in France, and can hardly be usefully described apart from the
                    general questions of local government and poor law administration. The
                    Commissions des Hospices Civiles, however, are purely communal bodies, although
                    they receive pecuniary assistance from both the departments and the state. A
                    decree of 1811 directed that there should be an asylum and a wheel for receiving
                    foundlings in every arrondissement. The last “wheel,” that of Antwerp, was
                    closed in 1860. The present law of 30th July 1834 distinguishes foundlings born
                    of unknown parents from infants abandoned by known parents. Of the former the
                    cost is divided between commune and province; of the latter the cost falls

                    secours.</hi> The law of 1834 directs that the state budget shall contain an
                    annual foundling subsidy, which is distributed among the provinces. The
                    suppression of the ‘ ‘ wheels” is supposed to nave reduced the subsidy from
                    94,608 frs. to 50,000 frs. in 1873, and the number of foundlings from 7703 in
                    1849 to 5745 in 1860. The great mass of the foundlings are in Brabant, that is,
                    in Brussels, which in 1872 paid out nearly 300,000 frs. on their account. In the
                    Netherlands many of the foundlings are sent to the “beggar
                    colonies,”—agricultural, spinning, and weaving establishments introduced in 1810

                    The law concerning charitable works (3d August 1862) contemplates the erection
                    of a charity board in every commune. At present both the communal council and
                    the provincial deputation have certain rights of control over charitable
                    administration. (See <hi rend="italic">Della Carita Prevcntiva in Italia,</hi>
                    by Signor Fano.) In'Rome one branch of the St Spirito in Sassia (so called from
                    the Sohola Saxonum built in 728 by King Ina in the Borgo) has, since the time of
                    Pope Sixtus IV., been devoted to foundlings. For ten years before 1869 the
                    annual average of children admitted was 1141, of whom 382 were ascertained to be
                    illegitimate and 300 legitimate, the rest uncertain. The average annual number
                    of foundlings supported is 3268, the average annual deaths 981. The death-rate
                    in the hospital is said to be 88'78; in the country at the nursing houses 12'80.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Conservatory</hi> is for the support of foundling girls
                    who after passing through the hospital do not get settled in life. The whole
                    institution costs 305,603 frs. per annum. (See <hi rend="italic">The Charitable
                    Institutions of Rome,</hi> by Cardinal Morichini.) In Naples the foundling
                    hospital is called “1’Annunziata.” It receives yearly about 2000 “figli della
                    Madonna,” as they are called. It must not be confounded with the more famous
                    Albergo Reclusorio, or Seraglio dei Poveri, which is an ordinary charity for the
                    education of children and the maintenance of infirm old persons. The chief house
                    at Florence is called “degli Innocenti”;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    from the “Riunione di Instituti Pii,” and placed under provincial
                    administration. The splendid legacy of the last doge, Ludovico Manin, is applied
                    to the support of about 160 children by the “Congregazione di Carita” acting

                <p><hi rend="italic">Austria.—</hi> In Austria foundling hospitals occupied a very
                    prominent place in the general instructions which, by rescript dated 16th April
                    1781, the emperor Joseph II. issued to the charitable endowment commission.
                    Acting under the advice of Count Boucquoy, the author of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Neighbourly Love Association,</hi> which supplied first Bohemia and then the
                    empire with a type of poor law administration, the emperor provided for the case
                    of destitute children before proceeding to deal with the cases of destitute sick
                    and infirm poor. This class of children includes, besides foundlings proper, the
                    children born in lying-in hospitals of unmarried women, and the children of
                    unmarried women who can show that they have been suddenly confined when on their
                    way to the lying-in hospital, and even in some cases legitimate children whose
                    parents are prevented by illness or other temporary cause from maintaining them,
                    and orphans when below the age required for admission to a regular orphanage. In
                    1818 these foundling asylums and the lying-in houses were declared to be state
                    institutions. They were accordingly supported by the state treasury until the
                    fundamental law of 20th October 1860 handed them over to the provincial
                    committees. They are now local institutions, depending on provincial funds, and
                    are quite separate from the ordinary parochial poor institute. Admission is
                    gratuitous when the child is actually found on the street, or is sent by a
                    criminal court, or where the mother undertakes to serve for four months as nurse
                    or midwife in an asylum, or produces a certificate from the parish priest and
                    “poorfather” (the parish inspector under the Boucquoy scheme) that she has no
                    money. In other cases payments of 30 to 100 florins are made. "When two months
                    old the child is sent for six or ten years to the houses in the neighbourhood of
                    respectable married persons, who have certificates from the police or the
                    poor-law authorities, and who are inspected by the latter and by a special
                    medical officer. These persons receive a constantly diminishing allowance, and
                    the arrangement may be determined by 14 days’ notice on either side. The
                    foster-parents may retain the child in their service or employment till the age
                    of twenty-two, but the true parents may at any time reclaim the foundling on
                    reimbursing the asylum and compensating the foster-parents. The enlightened
                    principles of the rescript of 1781, with regard to the general and technical
                    education of the children, do not seem to be earned out in practice. It is said
                    that there are in the empire 35 foundling hospitals, receiving annually 120,000
                    children.</p>

                    works very efficiently at Constantinople, a large sum is spent on foundlings.

                    child with some poor family for a small monthly payment, and afterwards provide
                    the child with some sort of remunerative work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia.—</hi> Under the old Russian system of Peter I.
                    foundlings were received at the church windows by a staff of women paid by the
                    state. But since the reign of Catherine II. the foundling hospitals have been in
                    the hands of the provincial officer of public charity (prykaz obshestvennago
                    pryzrenya). The great central institutions (Vospitatelnoi Dom), at Moscow and St
                    Petersburg (with a branch at Gatchina) were founded by Catherine. When a child
                    is brought the baptismal name is asked, and a receipt is given, by which the
                    child may be reclaimed up to the age of ten. The mother may nurse her child.
                    After the usual period of six years in the country very great care is taken with
                    the education, especially of the more promising children. Of the 26,000 sent
                    annually to these two houses from all parts of Russia, only 25 per cent, are
                    said to reach majority. The hospital is still, however, a valuable source of
                    recruits for the public service. Malthus (<hi rend="italic">The Principles &lt;ſ
                    Population,</hi> vol. i. p. 434) has made a violent attack on these Russian
                    charities. He argues that they discourage marriage and therefore population, and
                    that the best management is unable to prevent a high mortality. He adds: “An
                    occasional child murder from false shame is saved at a very high price if it can
                    be done only by the sacrifice of some of the best and most useful feelings of
                    the human heart in a great part of the nation.” It does not appear, however,
                    that the rate of illegitimacy in Russia is comparatively high; it is so in the
                    two great cities. The rights of parents over the children were very much
                    restricted, and those of the Government much extended by a ukase issued by the
                    emperor Nicholas in 1837. The most eminent Russian writer on this subject is Μ.
                    Gouroff. See his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Enfants Trouvés,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Essai sur l’histoire des Enfants Trouvés,</hi> Paris,

                <p>In <hi rend="italic">America</hi> the foundling hospitals are chiefly private
                    charities. There is a large one called the <hi rend="italic">Cuna</hi> in the
                    city of Mexico. The house for girls at Rio de Janeiro is once a year frequented
                    by men in want of wives, each application being considered by the managers. In
                    Brazil there are several houses of mercy for foundlings, and exposures are often
                    made at the doors of private houses. The foundling asylum of the sisters of
                    charity in New York was opened in 1869. In 1873 it received 1124 infants not
                    three weeks old. The annual cost is 115,000 dollars. A crib is placed in the
                    vestibule at night, and the name and date of birth are generally left with the
                    child.</p>

                <p>guishing mark was put on each child by the parent These were often marked coins,
                    trinkets, pieces of cotton or ribbon, verses written on scraps of paper. The
                    clothes, if any, were carefully recorded. One entry is, “Paper on the breast,
                    clout on the head.” The applications became too numerous, and a system of
                    balloting with red, white, and black balls was adopted. In 1756 the House of
                    Commons came to a resolution that all children offered should be received, that
                    local receiving places should be appointed all over the country, and that the
                    funds should be publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the
                    hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two to twelve months,
                    and a flood of children poured in from the country workhouses. In less than four
                    years 14,934 children were presented, and a vile trade grew up among vagrants of
                    undertaking to carry children from the country to the hospital,—an undertaking
                    which, like the French <hi rend="italic">meneurs,</hi> they often did not
                    perform, or performed with great cruelty. Of these 15,000 only 4400 lived to be
                    apprenticed out. The total expense was about £500,000. This alarmed the House of
                    Commons. After throwing out a bill which proposed to raise the necessary funds
                    by fees from a general system of parochial registration, they came to the
                    conclusion that the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued. The
                    hospital, being thus thrown on its own resources, adopted a pernicious system of
                    receiving children with considerable sums <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> £100),
                    which sometimes led to the children being reclaimed by the parent. This was
                    finally stopped in 1801; and it is now a fundamental rule that no money is
                    received. The committee of enquiry must now be satisfied of the previous good
                    character and present necessity of the mother, and that the father of the child
                    has deserted it and the mother, and that the reception of the child will
                    probably replace the mother in the course of virtue and in the way of an honest
                    livelihood. The principle is in fact that laid down by Fielding in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tom Jones—</hi> “Too true I am afraid it is that many women have
                    become abandoned and have sunk to the last degree of vice by being unable to
                    retrieve the first slip.” At present the hospital supports about 500 children up
                    to the age of fifteen. The average annual number of applications is 236, and of
                    admissions 41. The children used to be named after the patrons and governors,
                    but the treasurer now prepares a list. After three years in the country the
                    children come back to town. At sixteen the girls are generally apprenticed as
                    servants for four years, and the boys at the age of fourteen as mechanics for
                    seven years. There is a small benevolent fund for adults. The hospital has an
                    income of above £11,000, which will be enormously increased in 1895, when the
                    leaseholds of the Lamb’s Conduit grounds expire. From the famous chapel built by
                    Jacobsen in 1747 the hospital derives a net income of £500. The musical service,
                    which was originally sung by the blind children only, was made fashionable by
                    the generosity of Handel, who frequently had the ‘ ‘ Messiah” performed there,
                    and who bequeathed to the hospital a MS. copy (full score) of his greatest
                    oratorio. The altar-piece is West’s picture of Christ presenting a little Child.
                    In 1774 Dr Burney and Signor Giardini made an unsuccessful attempt to form in
                    connexion with the hospital a public music school, in imitation of the
                    Conservatorium of the Continent. In 1847, however, the present successful
                    “Juvenile Band” of about 30 boys was started. The educational effects of music
                    have been found excellent, and the hospital supplies many musicians to the best
                    army and navy bands. The early connexion between the hospital and the eminent
                    painters of the reign of George II. is one of extreme interest. The exhibitions
                    of pictures at the Foundling, which were organized by the Dilettanti Club,
                    undoubtedly led to the formation of the Royal Academy in 1768. Hogarth painted a
                    portrait of Captain Coram for the hospital, which also contains his March to
                    Finchley, and Roubiliac’s bust of Handel. Coram, the founder, was remarkable for
                    the versatility of his public spirit. He did much for the development of Georgia
                    and Nova Scotia. (See <hi rend="italic">History and Objects of the Foundling
                    Hospital, with Memoir of its Founder,</hi> by J. Brownlow, 3d ed., 1865.)</p>
                <p>In 1704 the Foundling Hospital of Dublin was opened. No inquiry was made about
                    the parents, and no money received. From 1500 to 2000 children were received
                    annually. A large income was derived from a duty on coal and the produce of car
                    licences. In 1822 an admission fee of £5 was charged on the parish from which
                    the child came. This reduced the annual arrivals to about 500. In 1829 the
                    select committee on the Irish miscellaneous estimates recommended that no
                    further assistance should be given. The hospital had not preserved life or
                    educated the foundlings. The mortality was nearly 4;n 5, and the tptal cost
                    £10,000 a year. Accordingly in 1835 Lord Glenelg (then Irish Secretary) closed
                    the institution.</p>
                <p>Scotland never seems to have possessed a foundling hospital. In 1759 John Watson
                    left funds which were to be applied to the pious and charitable purpose “of
                    preventing child murder” by the establishment of a hospital for receiving
                    pregnant women and taking care of their children as foundlings. But by an Act of
                    Parliament in 1822, which sets forth “doubts as to the propriety” of the
                    original purpose, the money was given to trustees to erect a hospital for the
                    maintenance and education of destitute children. The fundamental difference
                    between Scotland and most other Protestant countries on the one hand, and those
                    Catholic countries which have adopted the Code Napoleon on the other, is that in
                    the former proceedings for aliment may be taken against the putative father.
                    Hence the mother is not helpless. She cannot, however, in Scotland deposit her
                    bastard in the poorhouse, unless she herself is entitled to relief and prepared
                    to go there; and relief is of course given only so long as the mother is not
                    able to support herself. An infant absolutely deserted would of necessity be
                    taken care of by the poor law authority. It is in Scotland a crime at common law
                    to “expose” a young child to the risk of death or to any serious danger; and it
                    is also an offence against the Poor Law Act of 1845 for either the mother or the
                    putative father (who has acknowledged the paternity) to desert an illegitimate
                    child. In England the offence is defined as the abandoning or exposing a child
                    under the age of two, whereby its life is endangered, or its health is, or is
                    likely to be, permanently injured (24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, § 27). Besides this
                    the provisions of the Industrial Schools Acts apply to a large proportion of the
                    cases of homeless and deserted children which in other countries might be
                    entrusted to the foundling hospitals. And indeed the system of boarding out
                    pauper children seems to have realized most of the advantages promised by the
                    hospital. The disagreeable feature of the Scotch practice is the number of women
                    who, without any feeling of shame, get a family of illegitimate children by
                    different fathers, whom they attack in succession for aliment. The rate of
                    illegitimacy in some Scotch counties has reached 14, 15, and 16 per cent. It is
                    not likely, however, that the hospital principle, though cured of its worst
                    fault, that of secret admission without inquiry<note anchored="true"

                    The key-note of public opinion on the question was probably struck by Lord
                    Brougham in his <hi rend="italic">Letters to Sir Samuel Eomilly on the Abuse of
                    Charities,</hi> and by Dr Chalmers in his <hi rend="italic">Christian Economy of
                    Large Towns.</hi> The true solution, however, depends less on abstract political
                    reasoning than on prudent management of existing institutions. In France, for
                    instance, a great fund of practical skill in administration has been
                    accumulated. In Great Britain the evil may be more safely left to private
                    charity and religious effort. If fewer women fall there, there is perhaps a
                    profounder degradation of those who do.</p>

                    it does not contain the German editor’s European statistics. Some recent

                    communicated to the Local Government Board by the Foreign Secretary. <hi
