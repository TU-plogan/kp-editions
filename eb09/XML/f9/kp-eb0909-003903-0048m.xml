                <p><label type="entry">FAROE ISLANDS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Feroe
                    Islands</hi></label> (Danish, <hi rend="italic">Far'derne),</hi> a group in the
                    North Sea belonging to Denmark. They are situated between Iceland and the
                    Shetland Islands, about 200 miles N.W. of the latter, between 61’ 20' and 62°
                    25' N. 1at., and between 6° 16' and 7° 40' W. long. The total area of the group
                    is 510 square miles, and that of the seventeen inhabited islands 490. The
                    population in 1850 amounted to 9150, in 1860 to 8922, and in 1874 to 10,500. The
                    principal islands are Strömö with 2400 inhabitants, Osterö 2067, Süderö 1387,
                    Vaagö 702, Sandö 618, and Bordö 358. They consist throughout of rocks and hills,
                    separated from each other by narrow valleys or ravines; but though the hills
                    rise abruptly, there are often on their summits, or at different stages of their
                    ascent, plains of considerable magnitude. They everywhere present to the sea
                    perpendicular cliffs, broken into a thousand fantastic forms, affording at every
                    turn, to those who sail along the coast, the most picturesque and varied
                    scenery. The highest peaks are Slattaretind in Osterσ, and Skelling-fjeld,
                    Skalingfield, or Ben Scarfing in Strömö’, which, according to barometric
                    measurement, rise respectively to about 2890 and 2506 feet above the sea. The
                    rocks are generally trap, and exhibit little variety of composition, though they
                    present some striking geological phenomena. The zeolites and chalcedonies of the
                    Faroes have long supplied the best specimens to the cabinets of Europe. Turf is
                    abundant. Coal is found in Süderö and some of the other islands in sufficient
                    quantity to make it a matter of exploitation. In 1872 an expedition was sent out
                    by the United Steamship Company <hi rend="italic">(forenede
                    Damρski}jselskab)</hi> to investigate the geology of the coal-fields, and in
                    1876 works were commenced at Trangisvaag and Frodebo.</p>
                <p>The climate is foggy, and violent storms are frequent at all seasons. July and
                    August are the only true summer months, but the winters are not very severe. It
                    seldom freezes for more than one month, and the harbours are rarely ice-bound.
                    The only grain crop is barley; and on account of the uncertainty of the weather,
                    it is frequently reaped in a half ripe condition. Agriculture is in a very
                    backward state, the infield or cultivated land being calculated to be to the
                    outfield or uncultivated in the proportion of one to sixty. As the plough is ill
                    suited to the rugged and uneven surface of the land, the ground is usually
                    turned up with the spade, care being taken not to destroy the roots of the
                    grass. Horses and cows are few in number, and the latter give very little milk,
                    in consequence probably of the very coarse hay upon which they are fed. Sheep
                    form the chief riches of the islanders; some individuals having flocks of from
                    three to five hundred, and the total number in the islands being about 80,000.
                    They are never housed either in summer or winter, and in severe seasons they
                    suffer considerably. The wool is generally coarse, and is torn off the animals
                    in so rough a manner as often to lacerate the skin. The northern hare <hi
                    rend="italic">( Lepus αlpinus)</hi> is pretty abundant in Strömö and Ostero <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> having been introduced into the islands about 1840-50.
                    Besides the ordinary Norway rat there still exist some few representatives of
                    the older black rat <hi rend="italic">(Mus ratius),</hi> and, according to
                    popular accounts, a third species not yet scientifically identified. The
                    catching of the numerous sea birds which build their nests upon the face of the
                    cliffs forms an important source of subsistence to the inhabitants. Sometimes
                    the fowler is let down from the top of the cliff; at other times he climbs the
                    rocks, or, where that is possible, is pushed upwards by poles made for the
                    purpose·. The puffin <hi rend="italic">(Älca</hi><hi rend="italic">arctica)</hi>
                    is the commonest species, and the eider duck is frequently shot for food. The
                    cod fishery is especially important,—the dried fish being exported to Spain and
                    France, the swim-bladders made into gelatine, and the ovaries prepared for the
                    anchovy fisher of the Mediterranean. Several Salmonidae are found in the streams
                    and lakes,—among them the charr <hi rend="italic">(Sahna salvelinus),</hi> which
                    occurs in Upper Bavaria and Scotland. According to Mörch, there are 13 species
                    of land and fresh-water mollusks, but not one of them is peculiar to the
                    islands.</p>
                <p>The trade of the Faroe Islands was for some time a monopoly in the hands of a
                    mercantile house at Copenhagen, and this monopoly was afterwards assumed by the
                    Danish Government, but by the law of March 21, 1855, all restrictions were
                    removed. Hosiery, tallow, dried and salt fish, train-oil, feathers, skins, and
                    butter are the chief exports. Thorshavn, the chief town of the islands, is
                    situated on the S.E. side of Strömö, upon a narrow tongue of land, having creeks
                    on each side, where ships may be safely moored. Its population is only between
                    500 and 600; but it is the seat of the chief Government and ecclesiastical
                    officials, and has a castle, a hospital, and a library. The houses are built of
                    wood and roofed with birch bark covered with turf, the greenness of which makes
                    it impossible at a very short distance to distinguish the place from the
                    surrounding fields. The character of the people ia generally marked by great
                    simplicity of manners, kind-' ness, and hospitality. They are well fed and
                    clothed, and seem to be kindly treated by the Danish Government. The average
                    duration of life, as stated by Dr Panum, is 44-∣ years, while in Denmark it is
                    only 36.</p>
                <p>The Faroe Islands were, it would appear, first colonized <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0049-0040"/> by a certain Grim Kamban in the time of Harold
                    Haarfager; and Christianity was introduced by Sigmund Bres-terson at the command
                    of Olaf Tryggvason. They are said to derive their present name from the numberof
                    sheep (/aar); in the Middle Ages they were known by the name of Friesland, which
                    was corrupted by the Arabian geographers into Reslanda. English adventurers gave
                    great trouble to the inhabitants in the 16th century, and the name of Magnus
                    Heiresen, a native of Stromo, who was sent by Frederick II. to clear the seas,
                    is still celebrated in many a song and story. There was formerly a bishopric at
                    Kirkebo, but it was abolished at the introduction of Protestantism by Christian
                    III., and the islands are now ecclesiastically dependent on the bishopric of
                    Zealand. The kingdom of Denmark retained possession of the Faroes at the peace
                    of Kiel in 1815, though they had originally belonged to Norway. The language of
                    the people is a remnant of the Old Norse, but that of the courts, churches, and
                    schools is the modern Danish. The statement that there is no native literature
                    is a mistake: not to speak of the famous <hi rend="italic">Farey-inga Saga,</hi>
                    which was published by Rufn and Mohnike at Copenhagen in 1833, the botanist H.
                    C. Lyngbye, who visited the islands for the study of their Algae, brought back
                    and published in 1822 a number of the popular songs about Sigurd, and a new
                    treatment of the same theme appeared at Paderborn in 1877.</p>
