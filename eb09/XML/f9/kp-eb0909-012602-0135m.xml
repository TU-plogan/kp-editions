                <p><label type="entry">FEZ</label>, one of the chief cities in the empire of
                    Morocco, into which kingdom it was incorporated in the year 1548. It is situated
                    in 34° 6' 3 ’ ' N. lat. and 4° 58' 15 ' W. long., being about 197 miles N.E. of
                    Morocco, 100 miles E. from the Atlantic, and 85 miles S. of the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>The city is beautifully situated on the slopes of a pearshaped valley, through
                    which flows the Wad-el-Jubar (or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0136-0127"/> River of Pearls). The stream is fordable
                    throughout, and is an affluent of the Wad-el-Sebu, which it joins about six
                    miles to the north of the town. The Wad-el-Jubar divides the city into two
                    quarters, the ancient town (Fas-el-bali) on the right bank, and the new
                    (Fas-el-djedid) on the left.</p>
                <p>Like many Oriental cities, Fez from a distance is a peculiarly striking looking
                    place. It stretches out between low hills, crowned by the ruins of ancient
                    fortresses; and from the turreted walls stand out in bold relief countless
                    domes, minarets, and flat-roofed houses. The old battlemented wall, which still
                    surrounds the place, though falling into decay, is yet flanked by strong masonry
                    towers. The surrounding country is well cultivated. In some places the view is
                    marvellous. The whole neighbourhood seems covered with ruined buildings of every
                    sort,—cells of recluses, broken columns, massive stone aqueducts, domelike
                    tombs, dilapidated forts, and ruined houses. Except on the south side the city
                    is surrounded by hills interspersed with groves of orange, pomegranate, and
                    various fruit trees, and large olive gardens.</p>
                <p>The interior of the city is far from pleasing; the walls are lofty, and the
                    streets are narrow and dirty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In a paper published in the <hi rend="italic">Medical Times
                    and Gazette</hi> of July 28, 1877, a correspondent (Dr Leared) writes—“If there
                    is any truth in the influence of sanitary arrangements on the public health, how
                    is it that health is preserved at all in Moorish towns? Take for example this
                    capital. Fez is a town of about 45,000 inhabitants, surrounded by high walls. So
                    narrow are the streets that in many of them it would be impossible for two
                    people to walk abreast. Even the principal streets in which business is
                    conducted are not more than ten feet wide. Owing to the height of the houses,
                    many of which are of three stories, and the practice of covering the street on a
                    level with the first story with reed roofs and often with vines, the rays of the
                    sun never reach the streets except here and there in some more open spots. The
                    consequence of this is that the inhabitants of Fez, hardly ever exposed to the
                    sun, are a comparatively light-complexioned race of Moors; many indeed present a
                    pallid etiolated appearance. The shops are mere cells placed about four feet
                    from the ground, andin these the owners sit crouched up the whole day waiting
                    for customers. The walls of the houses and shade roofs spoken of are covered
                    with dust and festooned with cobwebs. The streets are rarely swept, and bad
                    smells are prevalent. It is noteworthy, however, that one never experiences the
                    smell of sewage. The reason is not far to seek. Fez, like other Moorish towns,
                    possesses a system of drains, and an abundant and continuous water supply. Every
                    house of any pretension is provided with a fountain in its own courtyard, by
                    which the drains are constantly flushed. Moreover, there is no communication
                    between the streets and the sewers. The surface water finds its way out of the
                    streets by other channels. The closet is usually placed just inside the street
                    entrance of the dwelling-houses, and too often makes its presence known by a
                    vile smell. But it is no doubt owing to the abundance of water that the bad
                    effects of sewage fermentation are not severely felt, since the sewers open only
                    into the houses. The drinking water of Fez is procured from a river which flows
                    through the town, and which receives its drainage. The water almost invariably
                    produces diarrhoea in strangers.” </p></note> In the old town, where is the
                    chief emporium of trade, there is one long narrow street running the entire
                    length of the town. It is irregularly paved with round pebbles about the size
                    and shape of a cocoa-nut; these worn smooth by the tread of slippered feet are
                    sore stumbling blocks to the few equestrians who chance to ride through the
                    town. Compared to its fellows this is a wide street,—that is, it varies from 6
                    to 9 feet in breadth.</p>
                <p>The tradesman usually sits cross-legged in a corner of his shop, with his goods
                    so arranged that he can reach them without moving. As a rule, men of a trade
                    congregate together, using the cellars underneath the shop as working places. No
                    stock of goods is kept on hand; they are only made to order. The houses
                    generally consist of two or three stories, with a trellis-work verandah on the
                    roof. They are lighted with wooden gratings in the side streets. The windows all
                    look into the courtyards, so that the traveller sees only the gloomy prospect of
                    a lofty blank wall.</p>
                <p>In olden times Fez was the great seat of learning in western Africa. Leo
                    Africanus states in his work that there were not only 700 mosques, but a large
                    university, numerous theological schools, and one of the finest libraries in the
                    world. Now, however, all that is changed. Dr Leared, who visited the city in
                    1877, endeavoured in vain to gain access to some small collections of ancient
                    books and manuscripts in connexion with the mosques. The two chief mosques are
                    the Caroubin, which is very large, and is said to contain a glass lustre holding
                    500 lamps, the spoil of some Christian church, and one named after Edris, the
                    reputed founder of the city. The latter is a place of refuge for criminals, and
                    the former has a special court for women to pray in—a most unusual thing in
                    mosques. The palace gardens are fairly well kept; one of them, a beautifully
                    wooded plot of ground on the banks of the river, contains some magnificent
                    myrtles, rising to a height of 40 feet, with trunks like forest trees, and there
                    are fruit and other trees in great variety. The palace, called Lallah A1mina,
                    built as usual of a mixture of clay and lime, is situated about two miles from
                    the town; the courtyard, which is 100 paces long by 50 wide, is paved with
                    highly glazed and very effectively coloured tiles. This palace is said to have
                    been built by Christian slaves, among whom were many English captives.</p>
                <p>As a commercial town Fez is a great depot for the trade of Barbary, where also
                    are collected wares brought from the east and south by caravans. The chief
                    exports are almonds, gums, raisins, dates, caraway seeds, anise seed, citrons,
                    capers, olive oil, honey, tallow, hides, tanned leather, ostrich feathers, lead,
                    some gold, ivory, and gold dust, silken goods (such as bright-coloured scarfs,
                    turbans, and sashes), coarse linen, carpets, and saddlery. The “fez,” or
                    national head-dress of the Turks, is largely made. Until recent times, the city
                    had a monopoly of the manufacture, for it was supposed that the dye which
                    imparts the peculiar dull crimson hue of these skull-caps could not be obtained
                    elsewhere; now, however, they are manufactured both in France and in Turkey. The
                    dye is obtained from the juice of a small berry which grows in large quantities
                    in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, and is also extensively used in the
                    tanning of morocco leather, one of the chief articles of export. Some gold work
                    is made, the precious metal being brought from the interior of Africa by
                    caravans which trade regularly with Timbuctoo. These start in the spring and
                    autumn, and are usually about 140 days on the journey, of which only 54 are
                    actually spent in marching. The merchants of Fez send by this means to the
                    cities in the interior of Africa various articles of European manufacture and
                    foreign produce, linens, muslins, fine cloths, silks, beads, brass nails,
                    coffee, tea, and sugar, and in return they receive, gums, gold, elephants’
                    tusks, ambergris, ostrich feathers, and slaves.</p>
                <p>It is believed that Fez was built in the year 793, by a prince named Edris; and,
                    having soon become a city of much importance, it rose to be the capital of the
                    Mahometan states of western Africa. The Moors considered it the finest city in
                    the world; and it is held in extreme veneration also by all Moslem inhabitants
                    of Africa. Leo Africanus mentions it as one of the most famous resorts of
                    pilgrims in the 16 th century, as well as the principal Arabic university in the
                    world. It is filled with tombs of holy men, which impart to it an air of
                    sacredness. In the 10th century, when the road to Mecca was unsafe, pilgrimages
                    were performed to Fez, instead of to the tomb of the prophet. Subsequently its
                    schools of religion, philosophy, and astronomy enjoyed a great reputation in
                    Africa, and also throughout southern Europe, and were attended even by
                    Christians. On the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, refugees of all sorts
                    flocked to Fez, partly on account of the asylum it afforded as a sacred city.
                    These bringing with them some knowledge of arts, sciences, and manufactures, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n137/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0137-0128"/> for a time the city flourished; but the vices and
                    traditional conservatism of the Moslem religion prevented permanent improvement,
                    so that it gradually sank to the unknown and unimportant position it now
                    occupies.</p>
                <p>During the summer the heat is intense, but in winter the climate is excellent.
                    Travellers differ much as to the number of inhabitants. Dr Leared computes them
                    at from 45,000 to 50,000, but without sufficient data. Berbers, Arabs, negroes,
                    and Jews are the principal races dwelling in the city. The Jews suffer great
                    persecutions and many indignities, but many of them contrive to amass money.</p>
                <p>The best method of reaching Fez is from Tangier, the total distance being about
                    160 miles. The road, though a mere bridle path, is quite practicable for camels
                    and horses. There are numerous towns and villages at suitable distances, which
                    afford convenient halting-places for travellers.</p>
