                <p><label type="entry">FERROL</label>, a seaport town of Spain, province of Coruna,
                    is situated on the northern arm of the bay of Belanzos, 12 miles N.E. of Coruna.
                    The town is divided into three parts, the old,· the new, and the “esteiro.” The
                    old town is very irregular, but the new town is a parallelogram of seven streets
                    in width, by nine in length, intersecting each other at right angles. It has two
                    squares, in one of which is a fountain, erected in 1812 in honour of Cosme
                    Churruca, a naval officer killed at Trafalgar. Ferrol is invisible from the sea,
                    and is so strongly fortified that it is considered impregnable. Its arsenal is
                    one of the three largest in the kingdom, and along with the wharves and
                    dockyards exceeds 23 acres in extent. The dockyard is divided into a smaller
                    outward and a larger inward portion. Behind the inner dock are the dwellings of
                    the operatives, and in the north angle are the foundries, ropeworks, and
                    magazines. On the dockyard 15 ships of the line can be built at one time.
                    Connected with the arsenal is a school for engineering, and also a marine
                    observatory. The harbour, which is one of the best in Europe, is deep,
                    capacious, and secure; but the entrance, which is a strait about two miles in
                    length, admits at the narrowest part only one ship at a time, and is commanded
                    by forts Palma and San Felipe on opposite sides. The chief industries of the
                    town are ropemaking, sail-making, and the manufacture of leather. It contains
                    two hospitals, three large churches, a monastery, a consistor} <hi

                    for 6000 men. The population in 1860 was 21,120.</p>
                <p>Until 1752 Ferrol was a mere fishing village, but in that year Ferdinand VI.
                    began to fit it for becoming an arsenal. In 1799 the English made a fruitless
                    attempt to capture it, but on the 4th November 1805 they defeated the French
                    fleet in front of it and compelled its surrender. On the 27th January 1809 it
                    was through treachery delivered over to the French, but it was vacated by them
                    on the 22d July of the same year. On the 15th July 1823 another blockade was
                    begun by the French, and it surrendered to them on the 27th August.</p>
