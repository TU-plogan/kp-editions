                    after he had spent some time in Germany for the sake of his education, brought
                    him back to Paris in 1798. The following year, young Flahaut, being only fifteen
                    years of age, enlisted in a troop of volunteer cavalry, who were to accompany
                    General Bonaparte, then first consul, to Italy. He had a brilliant career, being
                    successively aide-de-camp to Murat, Berthier, and Napoleon. In 1813 he was first
                    gazetted general of brigade, and then general of division, and, although already
                    a count by birth, received a second time this title from the great soldier of
                    fortune who sought by his simple fiat to create a new empire to be propped up by
                    a new nobility. He was a peer of France during the Hundred Days, and supported
                    with all his influence the project of making Marie-Louise regent, and of thus
                    securing the imperial throne for the young king of Rome under the title of
                    Napoleon II. On the second return of the Bourbons he left France, and lived in
                    exile from 1815 to 1830. In England, his usual place of retreat, he married
                    (28th July 1817) the daughter of Admiral Keith, who became an Irish peeress as
                    Baroness Keith in 1823, and succeeded to the Scottish barony of Nairn in 1838.
                    By her he had no sons, but several daughters, the eldest of whom married the
                    fourth marquis of Lansdowne. After the revolution of July 1830 he returned to
                    France, was restored to his former rank in the army, and was made a peer by the
                    Government of Louis-Philippe. He soon became a favourite with the duke of</p>
                <p>Orleans, the king’s eldest son, who gave him a situation of trust in his
                    household. He also received at the same time the dignity of the grand cross of
                    the Legion of Honour, of which he had been a commander since 1814. His services
                    as a diplomatist were made use of more than once: he was ambassador at Berlin in
                    1831, and at Vienna from 1842 until the revolution of 1848. When Louis Bonaparte
                    became Napoleon III., Flahaut de la Billarderie, whoso mother had brought up the
                    duke of Morny, did not consider his fidelity as any longer pledged to the
                    Orleans family, and was appointed senator (31st December 1852). Nor was this the
                    only imperial favour he could boast of. From 1860 until 1862 he was ambassador
                    to London, and, on the 28th of January 1864 he was promoted to the high dignity
                    of grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour. After that time Flahaut did not
                    play any considerable part in the management of public business. He died on the
                    1st of September 1870.</p>
