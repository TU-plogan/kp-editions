                    necessary briefly to point out how the leading facts of the ecclesiastical
                    history of Scotland during the last 320 years are accentuated and construed by
                    those who read them in a Free Church sense.</p>
                <p>In that history the Free Churchman sees three great reforming periods. In his
                    view these deserve to be called reforming on many accounts, but most especially
                    because in them the independence of the church, her inherent scriptural right to
                    exercise a spiritual jurisdiction in which she is responsible to her Divine Head
                    alone, was both earnestly asserted and practically maintained. The first
                    reformation extended from 1560, when the church freely held her first General
                    Assembly, and of her own authority acted on the First Book of Discipline, to
                    1592, when her Presbyterian order was finally and fully ratified by the
                    parliament. The second period began in 1638, when after 20 years of suspended
                    animation, the Assembly once more shook off Episcopacy, and terminated in 1649,
                    when the parliament of Scotland confirmed the church in her liberties in a
                    larger and ampler sense than before. The third period began in 1834, when the
                    Assembly made use of what the church believed to be her rights in passing the
                    Veto and Chapel Acts. It culminated in the Disruption of 1843.</p>
                <p>The fact that the church, as led first by Knox and afterwards by Melville,
                    claimed an inherent right to exercise a spiritual jurisdiction is notorious.
                    More apt to be overlooked is the comparative freedom with which that right was
                    actually used by the church irrespective of state recognition. That recognition
                    was not given until after the queen’s resignation in 1567;<note anchored="true"

                    for several years before it came, the church had been holding her Assemblies and
                    settling all questions of discipline, worship, and administration as they arose,
                    in accordance with the first book of polity or discipline which had been drawn
                    up in 1560. Further, in 1581 she, of her own motion, adopted a second book of a
                    similar character, in which she expressly claimed an independent and exclusive
                    jurisdiction or power in all matters ecclesiastical, “which flows directly from
                    God and the Mediator Jesus Christ, and is spiritual, not having a temporal head
                    on earth, but only Christ the only king and governor of his church;” and this
                    claim, though directly negatived in 1584 by the “Black Acts,” which included an
                    Act of Supremacy over estates spiritual and temporal, continued to be asserted
                    by the Assemblies, until at last it also was practically allowed in the Act of
                    1592.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Second Book of
                    Discipline was not formally recognized in that Act; but all former Acts against
                    “the jurisdiction and discipline of the true Kirk as the same is used and
                    exercised within the realm” were abolished; and all “liberties, privileges,
                    immunities, and freedoms whatsoever” previously granted were ratified and
                    approved.</p></note> This legislation of 1592, however, did not long remain in
                    force. An Act of Parliament in 1606, which “reponed, restored, and reintegrated”
                    the estate of bishops to their ancient dignities, prerogatives, and privileges,
                    was followed by several Acts of various subservient assemblies, which,
                    culminating in that of 1618, practically amounted to a complete surrender of
                    jurisdiction by the church itself. For twenty years no Assemblies whatever were
                    held. This interval must necessarily be regarded from the Presbyterian point of
                    view as having been one of very deep depression. But a second reformation,
                    characterized by great energy and vigour, began in 1638. The proceedings of the
                    Assembly of that year, afterwards tardily and reluctantly acquiesced in by the
                    state, finally issued in the Acts of Parliament of 1649, by which the
                    Westminster standards were ratified, lay-patronage was abolished, and the
                    coronation oath itself framed in accordance with the principles of Presbyterian
                    church govern ment. Another period of intense reaction soon set in. No
                    Assemblies were permitted by Cromwell after 1653; and, soon after the
                    Restoration, Presbytery was temporarily overthrown by a series of rescissory
                    Acts. Nor was the Revolution Settlement of 1690 so entirely favourable to the
                    freedom of the church as the legislation of 1649 had been. Prelacy was
                    abolished, and various obnoxious statutes were repealed, but the Acts rescissory
                    were not cancelled; presbyterianism was re-established, but the statutory
                    recognition of the Confession of Faith took no notice of certain qualifications
                    under which that document had originally been approved by the Assembly of
                    1647;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The most important
                    of these had reference to the full right of a constituted church to the
                    enjoyment of an absolutely unrestricted freedom in convening Assemblies. This
                    very point on one occasion at least threatened to be the cause of serious
                    misunderstandings between William and the people of Scotland. The difficulties
                    were happily smoothed, however, by the wisdom and tact of Carstares.</p></note>
                    the old rights of patrons were again discontinued, but the large powers which
                    had been conferred on congregations by the Act of 1649 were not wholly restored.
                    Nevertheless the great principle of a distinct ecclesiastical jurisdiction,
                    embodied in the Confession of Faith, was accepted without reservation, and a
                    Presbyterian polity effectively confirmed both then and at the ratification of
                    the treaty of Union. This settlement, however, did not long subsist unimpaired.
                    In 1712 the Act of Queen Anne, restoring patronage to its ancient footing, was
                    passed in spite of the earnest remonstrances of the Scottish people. For many
                    years afterwards (until 1784) the Assembly continued to instruct each succeeding
                    commission to make application to the king and the parliament for redress of the
                    grievance. But meanwhile a new phase of Scottish ecclesiastical politics
                    commonly known as Moderatism had been inaugurated, during the prevalence of
                    which the church became even more indifferent than the lay patrons themselves to
                    the rights of her congregations with regard to the “calling” of ministers. From
                    the Free Church point of view, the period from which the secessions under
                    Erskine and Gillespie are dated was also characterized by numerous other abuses
                    on the Church’s part which amounted to a practical surrender of the most
                    important and distinctive principles of her ancient Presbyterian polity.<note

                    present century there were many circumstances, both within and without the
                    church, which conspired to bring about an evangelical and popular reaction
                    against this reign of “Moderatism.” The result was a protracted struggle, which
                    is commonly referred to as the Ten Years’ Conflict, and which has been aptly
                    described as the last battle in the long war which for nearly 300 years had been
                    waged within the church itself, between the friends and the foes of the doctrine
                    of an exclusive ecclesiastical jurisdiction. That final struggle may be said to
                    have begun with the passing in 1834 of the “Veto” Act, by which it was declared
                    to be a fundamental law of the church that no pastor should be intruded on a
                    congregation contrary to the will of the people,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This principle had been asserted even by an
                    Assembly so late as that of 1736, and had been invariably presupposed in the
                    “call,” which had never ceased to be regarded as an indispensable pre-requisite
                    for the settlement of a minister.</p></note> and by which it was provided that
                    the simple dissent of a majority of heads of families in a parish should be
                    enough to warrant a presbytery in rejecting a presentee. The question of the
                    legality of this measure soon came to be tried in the civil courts; and it was
                    ultimately answered in a sense unfavourable to the church by the decision (1838)
                    of the Court of Session in the Auchterarder case, to the effect that a
                    presbytery had no right to reject a presentee simply because the parishioners
                    protested against his settlement<pb break="no"

                    rend="smallcaps">Chalmers,</hi> vol. v. pp. 376, 377). This decision elicited
                    from the Assembly of that year a new declaration of the doctrine of the
                    spiritual independence of the church. The “exclusive jurisdiction of the civil
                    courts in regard to the civil rights and emoluments secured by law to the church
                    and the ministers thereof” was acknowledged without qualification; and continued
                    implicit obedience to their decisions with reference to these rights and
                    emoluments was pledged. At the same time it was insisted on “that, as is
                    declared in the Confession of Faith of this National Established Church, ‘the
                    Lord Jesus Christ, as King and Head of the church, hath therein appointed a
                    government in the hand of church officers distinct from the civil magistrate;’
                    and that in all matters touching the doctrine, discipline, and government of the
                    church her judicatories possess an exclusive jurisdiction, founded on the Word
                    of God, which power ecclesiastical” (in the words of the Second Book of
                    Discipline) “flows immediately from God and the Mediator the Lord Jesus Christ,
                    and is spiritual, not having a temporal head on earth, but only Christ, the only
                    spiritual King and Governor of His Kirk.” And it was resolved to assert, and at
                    all hazards defend, this spiritual jurisdiction, and firmly to enforce obedience
                    to the same upon the officebearers and members of the church. The decision of
                    the Court of Session having been confirmed by the House of Lords early in 1839,
                    it was decided in the Assembly of that year that the church, while acquiescing
                    in the loss of the temporalities at Auchterarder, should reaffirm the principle
                    of non-intrusion as an integral part of the constitution of the Reformed Church
                    of Scotland, and that a committee should be appointed to confer with the
                    Government with a view to the prevention, if possible, of any further collision
                    between the civil and ecclesiastical authorities. While the conference with the
                    Government had no better result than an unsuccessful attempt at compromise by
                    means of Lord Aberdeen’s Bill, which embodied the principle of a dissent with
                    reasons, still graver complications were arising out of the Marnoch and other
                    cases, the nature of which has been briefly indicated in vol. v. as above.<note

                    congregations; (2) ’that the civil courts had power to interfere with and
                    interdict the preaching of the gospel and administration of ordinances as
                    authorized and enjoined by the church; (3) that the civil courts had power to
                    suspend spiritual censures pronounced by the courts of the church, and to
                    interdict their execution as to spiritual effects, functions, and privileges;
                    (4) that deposed ministers, and probationers deprived of their licence, could be
                    restored by the mandate of the civil courts to the spiritual office and status
                    of which the church courts had deprived them; (5) that the right of membership
                    in ecclesiastical courts could be determined by the civil courts; (6) that the
                    civil courts had power to supersede the majority of a church court of the
                    Establishment in regard to the exercise of its spiritual functions as a church
                    court, and to authorize the minority to exercise the said functions in
                    opposition to the court itself and to the superior judicatories of the church;

                    provision could be made for the spiritual care of a parish, although such
                    provision left all civil rights and patrimonial interests untouched.</p></note>
                    In the circumstances it was resolved by the Assembly of 1842 to transmit to the
                    Queen, by the hands of the lord high commissioner, a “claim, declaration, and
                    protest,” complaining of the encroachments of the Court of Session,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The narrative and argument of
                    this elaborate and able document cannot be reproduced here. In substance it is a
                    claim “as of right” on behalf of the church and of the nation and people of
                    Scotland that the church shall freely possess and enjoy her liberties,
                    government, discipline, rights, and privileges according to law, and that she
                    shall be protected therein from the foresaid unconstitutional and illegal
                    encroachments of the said Court of Session, and her people secured in their
                    Christian and constitutional rights and 1 iberties. This claim is followed by
                    the “declaration” that the Assembly cannot intrude ministers on reclaiming
                    congregations, or carry on the government of Christ’s church subject to the
                    coercion of the Court of Session; and by the “protest” that all Acts of the
                    Parliament of Great Britain passed without the consent of the Scottish church
                    and nation, in alteration or derogation of the government, discipline, rights,
                    and privileges of the church, as also all sentences of courts in contravention
                    of said government, discipline, rights, and privileges, “are and shall be in
                    themselves void and null, and of no legal force or effect.”</p></note> and also
                    an address praying for the abolition of patronage. The home secretary’s answer
                    (received in January 1843) gave no hope of redress. Meanwhile the position of
                    the evangelical party had been further hampered by the decision of the Court of
                    Session declaring the ministers of chapels of ease to be unqualified to sit in
                    any church court. A final appeal to parliament by petition was made in March
                    1843, when, by a majority of 135 (211 against 76), the House of Commons declined
                    to attempt any redress of the grievances of the Scottish Church.<note

                    party was made in a protest, signed by upwards of 200 commissioners, to the
                    effect that since, in their opinion, the recent decisions of the civil courts,
                    and the still more recent sanction of these decisions by the legislature, had
                    made it impossible at that time to hold a free Assembly of the church as by law
                    established, they therefore “protest that it shall be lawful for us, and such

                    and the administration of the affairs of Christ’s house according to His holy
                    word.” The reading of this document was followed by the withdrawal of the entire
                    non-intrusion party to another place of meeting, where the first Assembly of the
                    Free Church was constituted, with Dr Thomas Chalmers as moderator. This Assembly
                    sat from the 18th to the 30th of May, and transacted a large amount of important
                    business. On Tuesday the 23d, 396<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The number ultimately roseto 474.</p></note> ministers and
                    professors publicly adhibited their names to the Act of Separation and Deed of
                    Demission by which they renounced all claim to the benefices they had held in
                    connexion with the Establishment, declaring them to be vacant, and consenting to
                    their being dealt with as such. By this impressive proceeding, the signatories
                    voluntarily surrendered an annual income amounting to fully £100,000.</p>
                <p>The first care of the voluntarily disestablished church was to provide incomes
                    for her clergy and places of worship for her people. As early as 1841 indeed the
                    leading principle of a “sustentation fund” for the support of the ministry had
                    been announced by Dr Candlish; and at “Convocation,” a private unofficial
                    meeting of the members of the evangelical or non-intrusion party held in
                    November 1842, Dr Chalmers was prepared with a carefully matured scheme
                    according to which “each congregation should do its part in sustaining the
                    whole, and the whole should sustain each congregation.” Between November 1842
                    and May 1843, 647 associations had been formed; and at the first Assembly it was
                    announced that upwards of £17,000 had already been contributed. At the close of
                    the first financial year (1843-44) it was reported that the fund had exceeded
                    £61,000. It was participated in by 583 ministers; and 470 drew the full equal
                    dividend of £105. Each successive year showed a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n780/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0780-0745"/> steady increase in the gross amount of the fund;
                    but owing to an almost equally rapid increase of the number of new ministerial
                    charges participating in its benefits, the stipend payable to each minister did
                    not for many years reach the sum of £150 which had been aimed at as a minimum.
                    Thus in 1844-45 the fund had risen to £76,180, but the ministers had also
                    increased to 627, and the equal dividend therefore was only £122. During the
                    first ten years the annual income averaged £84,057; during the next decade
                    £108,643; and during the third £130,246. The mini mum of £150 was reached at
                    last in 1868; and since then the balance remaining after that minimum has been
                    provided has been treated as a surplus fund, and distributed among those
                    ministers whose congregations have contributed at certain specified rates per
                    member. In 1878 the total amount received for this fund was upwards of £177,000;
                    in this 1075 ministers participated. The full equal dividend of £157 was paid to
                    766 ministers; and additional grants of £36 and £18 were paid out of the surplus
                    fund to 632 and 129 ministers respectively.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>To provide for the erection of the buildings which, it was foreseen, would be
                    necessary, a general building fund, in which all should share alike, was also
                    organized, and local building funds were as far as possible established in each
                    parish, with the result that at the first Assembly a sum of £104,776 was
                    reported as already available. By May 1844 a further sum of £123,060 had been
                    collected, and 470 churches were reported as completed or nearly so. In the
                    following year £131,737 was raised, and 60 additional churches were built. At
                    the end of four years considerably more than 700 churches had been provided.</p>
                <p>During the winter session 1843-44 the divinity students who had joined the Free
                    Church continued their studies under Dr Chalmers and Dr Welsh; and at the
                    Assembly of 1844 arrangements were made for the erection of suitable collegiate
                    buildings. The New College, Edinburgh, was built in 1847 at a cost of £46,506;
                    and divinity halls have subsequently been set up also in Glasgow and Aberdeen.
                    In 1878 there were 13 professors of theology, with an aggregate of 230
                    students,—the numbers at Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen respectively being
                    129, 69, and 32.</p>
                <p>A somewhat unforeseen result of the Disruption was the necessity for a duplicate
                    system of element ιry schools. At the 1813 Assembly it was for the first time
                    announced by Dr Welsh that “schools to a certain extent must be opened to afford
                    a suitable sphere of occupation for parochial and still more for private
                    teachers of schools, who are threatened with deprivation of their present office
                    on account of their opinions upon the church question.” The suggestion was taken
                    up with very great energy, and with the result that in May 1845 280 schools had
                    been set up, while in May 1847 this number had risen to 513, with an attendance
                    of upwards of 44,000 scholars. In 1869 it was stated in an authoritative
                    document laid before members of parliament that at that time there were
                    connected with and supported by the Free Church 598 schools (including two
                    normal schools), with 633 teachers and 64,115 scholars. The school buildings had
                    been erected at a cost of £220,000, of which the committee of privy council had
                    contributed £35,000, while the remainder had been raised by voluntary effort.
                    Annual payments made to teachers, &amp;c., as at 1869, amounted to £16,000. The
                    total sum expended by the Free Church since the Disruption for educational
                    purposes has beennotless than £600,000. In accordance with certain provisions of
                    the Education Act of 1872 most of the schools of the Free Church were
                    voluntarily transferred, without compensation, to the local school boards.</p>
                <p>It has been already seen that during the period of the Ten Years’ Conflict the
                    non-intrusion party strenuously denied that in any one respect it was departing
                    from acknowledged principles of the National Church. It continued to do so after
                    the Disruption. In 1846, however, it was found to have become necessary, “in
                    consequence of the late change in the outward condition of the church,” to amend
                    the “questions and formula” to be used at the licensing of probationers and the
                    ordination of office-bearers. These were amended accordingly; and at the same
                    time it was declared that, “while the church firmly maintains the same
                    scriptural principles as to the duties of nations and their rulers in reference
                    to true religion and the Church of Christ for which she has hitherto contended,
                    she disclaims intolerant or persecuting principles, and does not regard her
                    Confession of Faith, or any port ion thereof when fairly interpreted, as
                    favouring intolerance or persecution, or consider that her office-bearers by
                    subscribing it profess any principles inconsistent with liberty of conscience
                    and the right of private judgment.” The main difference between the “formula” of
                    the Free Church and that of the Established Church is that the former refers to
                    the Confession of Faith simply as “approven by General Assemblies of this
                    Church,” while the latter describes it as “approven by the General Assemblies of
                    this National Church, and ratified by law in the year 1690, and frequently
                    confirmed by divers Acts of Parliament since that time.” The former inserts an
                    additional clause,—“I also approve of the general principles respecting the
                    jurisdiction of the church, and her subjection to Christ as her only Head, which
                    are contained in the Claim of Right and in the Protest referred to in the
                    questions already put to me;” and also adds the words which are here
                    distinguished by italics,—“And I promise that through the grace of God I shall
                    firmly and constantly adhere to the same, and to the utmost of my power shall in
                    my station assert, maintain, and defend the said doctrine, worship, discipline,
                    and government of this church by kirk-sessions, presbyteries, provincial synods,
                    and general assemblies, <hi rend="italic">together with the liberty and
                    exclusive jurisdiction thereof</hi>; and that I shall, in my practice, conform

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be added that, while the Free Church
                    requires elders to subscribe the same formula as ministers, the Established
                    Church requires them to sign an older and shorter one.</p></note> In the year
                    1851 an Act and Declaration anent the publication of the subordinate standards
                    and other authoritative documents of the Free Church of Scotland was passed, in
                    which the historical fact is recalled that the Church of Scotlaud had formally
                    consented to adopt the Confession of Faith, catechisms, directory of public
                    worship, and form of church government agreed upon by the Westminster Assembly;
                    and it is declared that “these several formularies, as ratified, with certain
                    explanations, by divers Acts of Assembly in the years 1645, 1646, and
                    particularly in 1647, this church continues till this day to acknowledge as her
                    subordinate standards of doctrine, worship, and government.’’<note

                    ministers, along with a considerable number of their people, joined the Free
                    Church in the following year.</p></note></p>
                <p>In 1858 circumstances arose which, in the opinion of many, seemed fitted to
                    demonstrate to the Free Church that her freedom was an illusion, and that all
                    her sacrifices had been made in vain. Mr John Macmillan, minister of Cardross,
                    accused of immorality, had been tried and found guilty by the Free Presbytery of
                    Dumbarton. Appeal having been taken to the synod, an attempt was there made to
                    revive one particular charge, of which he had been finally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0781-0746"/> acquitted by the presbytery; and this attempt was
                    successful in the General Assembly. That ultimate court of review did not
                    confine itself to the points appealed, but went into the merits of the whole
                    case as it had originally come before the presbytery. The result was a sentence
                    of suspension. Mr Macmillan, believing that the Assembly had acted with some
                    irregularity, applied to the Court of Session for an interdict against the
                    execution of that sentence; and for this act he was summoned to the bar of the
                    Assembly to say whether or not it was the case that he had thus appealed. Having
                    answered in the affirmative, he was deposed on the spot. Forthwith he raised a
                    new action (his previous application for an interdict had been refused)
                    concluding for reduction of the spiritual sentence of deposition, and for
                    substantial damages. The defences lodged by the Free Church were to the effect
                    that the civil courts had no right to review and reduce spiritual sentences, or
                    to decide whether the General Assembly of the Free Church had acted irregularly
                    or not. Judgments adverse to the defenders were delivered on these points; and
                    appeals were taken to the House of Lords. But before the case could be heard
                    there, the lord president took an opportunity in the Court of Session to point
                    out to the pursuer that, inasmuch as the particular General Assembly against
                    which the action was brought had ceased to exist, it could not therefore be made
                    in any circumstances to pay damages, and that the action of reduction of the
                    spiritual sentence, being only auxiliary to the claim of damages, ought
                    therefore to be dismissed. He further pointed out that Mr Macmillan might obtain
                    redress in another way, should he be able to prove malice against individuals.
                    Very soon after this deliverance of the lord president, the case as it had stood
                    against the Free Church was withdrawn, and Mr Macmillan gave notice of an action
                    of a wholly different kind. But this last was not persevered in. The appeals
                    which had been taken to the House of Lords were, in these circumstances, also
                    departed from by the Free Church. It is perhaps to be regretted, from the legal
                    point of view, that the case did not advance sufficiently to show how far the
                    courts of law would be prepared to go in the direction of recognizing voluntary
                    tribunals and a kind of secondary exclusive jurisdiction founded on
                    contract.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Taylor

                    for her part continued to believe that she had an inherent spiritual
                    jurisdiction, and remained unmoved in her determination to act in accordance
                    with that resolution “notwithstanding of whatsoever trouble or persecution may

                <p>In 1863 a motion was made and unanimously carried in the Free Church Assembly for
                    the appointment of a committee to confer with a corresponding committee of the
                    United Presbyterian Synod, and with the representatives of such other
                    disestablished churches as might be willing to meet and deliberate with a view
                    to an incorporating union. Formal negotiations between the representatives of
                    these two churches were begun shortly afterwards, which resulted in a report
                    laid before the following Assembly. From this document it appeared that the
                    committees of the two churches were not at one on the question as to the
                    relation of the civil magistrate to the church. While on the part of the Free
                    Church it was maintained that he “may lawfully acknowledge, as being in
                    accordance with the Word of God, the creed and jurisdiction of the church,” and
                    that “it is his duty, when necessary and expedient, to employ the national
                    resources in aid of the church, provided always that in doing so, while
                    reserving to himself full control over the temporalities which are his own gift,
                    he abstain from all authoritative interference in the internal government of the
                    church,” it was declared by the committee of the United Presbyterian Church
                    that, “inasmuch as the civil magistrate has no authority in spiritual things,
                    and as the employment of force in such matters is opposed to the spirit and
                    precepts of Christianity, it is not within his province to legislate as to what
                    is true in religion, to prescribe a creed or form of worship to his subjects, or
                    to endow the church from national resources.” In other words, while the Free
                    Church maintained that in certain circumstances it was lawful and even incumbent
                    on the magistrate to endow the church and on the church to accept his endowment,
                    the United Presbyterians maintained that in no case was this lawful either for
                    the one party or for the other. Thus in a very short time it had been made
                    perfectly evident that a union between the two bodies, if accomplished at all,
                    could only be brought about on the understanding that the question as to the
                    lawfulness of state endowments should be an open one. The Free Church Assembly,
                    by increasing majorities, manifested a readiness for union, even although
                    unanimity had not been attained on that theoretical point. But there was a
                    minority which did not sympathize in this readiness, and after ten years of
                    fruitless effort it was in 1873 found to be expedient that the idea of union
                    with the United Presbyterians should for the time be abandoned. Other
                    negotiations, however, which had been entered upon with the Reformed
                    Presbyterian Church at a somewhat later date proved more successful; and a
                    majority of the ministers of that church with their congregations were united
                    with the Free Church in 1876.</p>

                    amount of nearly £13,000,000 has been raised. In 1878 the number of

                    published in 1851 in an easily accessible form, along with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Act and Declaration</hi> of that year. Of these “standards” (the Holy
                    Scriptures being held supreme as the “rule of faith and manners ”) the most
                    important is the <hi rend="italic">Confession of Faith,</hi> which alone is
                    imposed by subscription. The <hi rend="italic">Catechisms (Larger</hi> and <hi

                    handled in a considerable number of well-known works, which need not be
                    enumerated here. Among books professedly dealing with the Free Church question,
                    the most valuable are Sydow’s <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Schottische</hi><hi rend="italic">Kirchen· fraqe</hi> (Potsdam, 1845), and <hi
