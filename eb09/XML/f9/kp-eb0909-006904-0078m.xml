                    understand the use of the weapon. The foil with which the art of fencing is
                    practised is a small quadrangular blade, about the length of a small-sword, and
                    mounted in nearly the same manner; but, for the convenience of the exercise, it
                    is made lighter, blunted, and covered with leather at the point, to prevent
                    accidents in practice.</p>
                <p>The first weapon in use among mankind, whether for offensive or defensive
                    purposes, appears to have been the sword. The most ancient records make frequent
                    mention of it. The early swords were probably made of wood, like those used by
                    the natives of Mexico when first visited by the Spaniards; but after the
                    discovery of metals, bronze swords were introduced, of which kind many have at
                    different times been found. As soon, however, as the art of tempering steel had
                    been discovered, that metal superseded all other substances in the fabrication
                    of arms; nor is it probable that any change in this respect will take place, or
                    that any further improvement is attainable. The form of sword, however, has
                    varied at different times and in different countries. Those used by the Roman
                    legions were short and strong, with a blade seldom exceeding nineteen inches in
                    length, but two-edged, and calculated both for the cut and the thrust. The
                    British swords, called <hi rend="italic">spathoe,</hi> were large, long, and
                    heavy; and the Saxon and the Norman partook of the same character. The ancient
                    practice of the weapon was probably carried to its greatest perfection amongst
                    the Romans, whose partiality for gladiatorial exhibitions formed a remarkable
                    feature of their character. The various and complicated methods of combat in
                    which that people took delight are either alluded to or described by most of
                    their writers, particularly by Livy, Juvenal, Seneca, and Suetonius.</p>
                <p>The history of the modern small-sword or rapier is involved in some obscurity.
                    The latter term, though now <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0079-0070"/> considered as synonymous with the former,
                    probably denotes a long, ordinary, old-fashioned cutting sword. But by a rapier
                    is now always meant a sword for the thrust, in contradistinction to one adapted
                    for cutting. The smallsword or rapier is undoubtedly very ancient, although
                    there is reason to believe that it was not brought into general use until armour
                    for protecting the body began to go out of fashion. Since that time the art of
                    fencing has always been considered as a gentlemanly accomplishment, and in many
                    parts of the Continent it is cultivated with the greatest zeal and assiduity.
                    Some have maintained that the weapon was not used in England before the reign of
                    Elizabeth; and Darcie <hi rend="italic">{Annals of Elizabeth)</hi> informs us
                    that one Rowland York, who appears to have betrayed Deventer to the Spaniards in
                    the year 1587, was the first who brought into England “that wicked, pernicious
                    fashion to fight in the fields in duels with a rapier called a tucke only for
                    the thrust.” Stowe also mentions that long tucks and long rapiers began about
                    the twelfth or thirteenth year of Elizabeth, and that “he was held the greatest
                    gallant that had the deepest ruffe and largest rapier. The offence,” he adds,
                    “to the eye of the one, and the hurt unto the life of the subject that came by
                    the other, caused her Majesty to make proclamation against them both, and to
                    place selected grave citizens at every gate to cut the ruffes and break the
                    rapiers’ points of all passengers that exceeded a yard in length of their
                    rapiers, and a nayle of a yard in depth of their ruffes.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In <hi rend="italic">The Two Angry Women of
                    Abingdon,</hi> a comedy printed in 1599, we find the following pathetic
                    complaint: “Sword and buckler fights begin to grow out of use. I am sorry for
                    it; I shall never see good manhood again. If it be once gone, this poking fight
                    of rapier and dagger will come up; then a tall man, and a good sword-and-buckler
                    man, will be spitted like a cat or a rabbit.”</p></note></p>
                <p>But at whatever time the small-sword came into use in this country, it is not
                    surprising that, when once introduced, it should have been cultivated as the
                    most equitable instrument of duelling. Before this period meetings for the
                    purpose of single combat were utterly revolting to all notions of fairness. No
                    regard was paid to equality of arms or numbers; advantages, however unfair, were
                    seized whenever an opportunity offered; and the ferocious passions, instead of
                    being curbed, had fuller scope given for their gratification. “The duellist of
                    former times,” says Sir Walter Scott, in a note to <hi rend="italic">The Lady of
                    the Lake,</hi> “did not always stand upon those punctilios respecting equality
                    of arms which are now judged essential to fair combat. It is true that in formal
                    combats in the lists, parties were, by the judges of the field, put as nearly as
                    possible in the same circumstances. But in private duels it was often
                    otherwise.” The practice of deciding duels with the sword may be considered as
                    now extinct in England. When the rapier was looked upon as an indispensable part
                    of a gentleman’s dress, the facility of immediate rencounter which it offered
                    gave occasion to frequent and dangerous brawls, by which the public tranquility
                    was disturbed, and the lives of peaceable citizens sometimes sacrificed. Since
                    arms have ceased to be worn, such an objection can no longer be urged against
                    the art of defence; and it may perhaps be questioned whether it ever had much
                    weight.</p>
                <p>The practice of the foil is here considered as applied to the most laudable
                    purposes, namely, the enjoyment of salutary recreation and the acquisition of a
                    graceful and unconstrained deportment. The beneficial effects of moderate
                    fencing to persons of weak constitutions, or of studious and sedentary habits,
                    have been attested by medical practitioners of the first eminence. To the public
                    speaker, the practice of the fencing-room has been found to impart an ease and
                    freedom of gesture attainable by no other exercise. For while the use of the
                    foil and the broadsword diffuses ease, elegance, and grace all over the body,
                    and imparts to the look and gesture an appearance of intellectual vigour, it
                    teaches invaluable lessons of patience and selfcommand, and contributes to
                    discipline the temper. “Perhaps there is no exercise whatever,” says Mr Roland
                    <hi rend="italic">{Theory and Practice of Fencing),</hi> “more calculated for
                    these purposes (developing and cultivating bodily strength and activity) than
                    fencing. Riding, walking, sparring, wrestling, running, and pitching the bar are
                    all of them certainly highly beneficial; but, beyond all question, there is no
                    single exercise which combines so many advantages as fencing. By it the muscles
                    of every part of the body are brought into play; it expands the chest, and
                    occasions an equal distribution of the blood and other circulating fluids
                    through the whole system. More than one case has fallen under the author’s own
                    observation, in which affections of the lungs, and a tendency to consumption,
                    have been entirely removed by occasional practice with the foil.”</p>
                <p>We now proceed to give such definitions as appear to be requisite for conveying a
                    general idea of the science of fencing, referring the reader for the necessary
                    details to the numerous manuals published on the subject.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Attacks and Parades.—</hi> After the first positions have been
                    acquired, the modes of attack come to be considered. Attacks are made in three
                    ways :—first, by a quick thrust proceeding merely from the wrist, the arm at the
                    same time being elevated and advanced, with the point directed towards the
                    adversary’s breast; secondly, by what is technically called an extension; and
                    lastly, by longeing and recovering. The parades, in which consists the defensive
                    part of the art, naturally follow the attack. A parade is a defence of the body,
                    made by an opposition of one’s blade to that of an adversary, in such a
                    situation as upon his attack to prevent the point of his sword hitting. The
                    parades are eight in number, viz., six simple, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >quarte,</hi><hi rend="italic">tierce, circle, octave, prime,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quinte,</hi> and two round or counter parades in quarte and
                    tierce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thrusts, &amp;c.—</hi> The next division of the subject
                    includes straight thrusts, simple disengagements, and bindings of the blade. A
                    <hi rend="italic">straight thrust</hi> is used as an attack, when an antagonist,
                    from his position on guard, leaves sufficient opening to enable him to be
                    touched upon that side of the body on which blades are joined. When such an
                    opportunity offers, the wrist must be suddenly raised, so as to bring the
                    “forte” of one’s sword to the “foible” of the adversary’s; after which longe
                    immediately on the same line to his breast, observing, however, to preserve a
                    correct opposition. In fencing, “opposition” signifies the art of covering the
                    body at the time of delivering a thrust, on that side where the foils happen to
                    cross, in order to prevent an antagonist exchanging hits. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >disengagement</hi> is made either as an attack, or as a return after defending
                    one’s self from a thrust, and is executed both under and over the wrist or
                    foils. A disengagement over the arm may be parried with tierce or prime, and, if
                    made low, by the parade of circle; from the position of octave by quarte or, if
                    the thrust be delivered low, by circle; from the position of quinte by prime as
                    the readiest defence, but quarte and tierce are also correct parades against
                    this thrust. There are three different ways of <hi rend="italic">binding the
                    blade.</hi> Of these, “flanconnade” is the principal, as it is sometimes a safe
                    attack when any other mode would be attended with considerable danger; it is
                    also made as a “riposte.” The attack of flanconnade is commenced when the blades
                    are joined in quarte, and it is parried either by octave or quinte, or by the
                    parade of quarte. The return over the arm, after the parade of circle, is
                    parried by prime or tierce, or by changing quickly to the counter in quarte. The
                    return over the arm, after the parade of prime, is parried by prime or tierce,
                    or, if made at a considerable distance, by the counter in quarte.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Feints.—</hi> In fencing there are a great variety of feints,
                    which it is not easy to describe intelligibly without figures. A feint is an
                    intentional movement made to deceive an adversary. All thrusts, therefore, may,
                    strictly speaking, come under the definition of feints, as the fencer’s object,
                    in all his attacks, is to deceive his antagonist. For the sake of convenience,
                    however, straight thrusts and simple disengagements have been arranged under a
                    separate head. In executing the feint called <hi rend="italic">one two,</hi>
                    inside of the arm, supposing the adversary’s body to be cohered in quarte, the
                    parade of tierce is deceived; commencing from the outside, that of quarte is
                    deceived; from the position of the circle the octave, and from that of the
                    octave the circle is deceived. This feint, if made inside the arm, is parried by
                    the parade of quarte, or by the counter in tierce, made upon an opponent’s
                    second disengagement; upon the outside of the arm, by tierce, prime, or the
                    counter in quarte; and from the position of the octave, by octave or quinte. The
                    feint <hi rend="italic">one two</hi> is likewise made as a return after the
                    parade of quarte or tierce, or sometimes after that of circle or octave. The <hi
                    rend="italic">cut and disengage</hi> is a species of <hi rend="italic">one
                    two,</hi> in making which from the position of quarte an adversary’s parade of
                    tierce is deceived, and from the position of tierce his parade of quarte. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cut and disengage,</hi> if made inside of the arm, is parried by
                    quarte, or the counter in tierce; if outside, by tierce or counter in quarte.
                    <hi rend="italic">Feint</hi><hi rend="italic">seconde</hi> is another feint very
                    nearly resembling <hi rend="italic">one two,</hi> and is generally made as a
                    return after the parades of tierce, prime, or quinte. In this feint the octave
                    or quinte is deceived; and it is parried by tierce, prime, or quarte, the two
                    former being the readiest where quinte is the parade deceived, but if the feint
                    has been answered with octave, the thrust must then be parried with quarte. The
                    feint <hi rend="italic">one tιvo three</hi> is made on either side of the blade,
                    upon precisely the same principles as <hi rend="italic">one two,—</hi> the only
                    difference between them consisting in making one disengagement more in the
                    latter than in the former movement. The <hi rend="italic">met and one two</hi>
                    is a species of <hi rend="italic">one two three.</hi> These feints, if made over
                    the arm, are parried with the simple parade of tierce; if on the inside, with
                    simple quarte. The other feints are— <hi rend="italic">doubling,</hi> which, <hi
                    rend="italic">mutcttis mutandis,</hi> is executed upon precisely the same
                    principles; <hi rend="italic">one two and deceive the circle,</hi> executed from
                    the inside position of quarte; <hi rend="italic">one two and deceive the
                    counter,</hi> which may be made from either side of the blade, but most
                    frequently commences from the position of tierce; <hi rend="italic">feint
                    fianconnade,</hi> which can be commenced only from the engagement of quarte; <hi
                    rend="italic">feint seconde</hi><hi rend="italic">and deceive</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quarte,</hi> which is always commenced from the outside
                    engagement, whether made as an attack or a return; <hi rend="italic">feint
                    seconde</hi><hi rend="italic">and deceive tierce,</hi> which differs from the
                    preceding only in the last disengagement; <hi rend="italic">one two and
                    deceive</hi><hi rend="italic">quarte</hi><hi rend="italic">from the position of
                    the circle,</hi> when the first disengagement is made over the adversary’s wrist
                    towards the body under the arm, and the second over the wrist towards the inside
                    of the body; and <hi rend="italic">doubling on both sides of the arm,</hi> which
                    is too complicated a feint to be frequently used in actual fencing, because it
                    is difficult to follow the adversary’s sword with certainty through many
                    different parades, and there is much danger of “time thrusts” upon feinte which
                    consist of so many disengagements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Time thrusts</hi> are so called because the success of these
                    movements depends entirely upon their being executed at the exa <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> ct moment of time employed by the adversary in
                    planning or in executing his attack; and, when made correctly, they are by far
                    the most scientific movements in fencing. There are two sort of time thrusts, in
                    the execution of one of which it is necessary that the blades should cross each
                    other, but for the completion of the other it is not absolutely necessary that
                    the blades should even meet. Those time thrusts in the execution of which the
                    blades cross are more scientific, and expose the fencer less to exchanged hits.
                    There are two time thrusts ί?» <hi rend="italic">opposition—</hi> one the <hi
                    rend="italic">time over the arm,</hi> and the other the <hi rend="italic">time
                    in octave.</hi> The former is applicable to all thrusts, however simple or
                    complex the feint may be, provided the longe is made upon the outside; whereas
                    all longes directed to the inside of the body, or under the arm, are exposed to
                    the time in octave; and thus almost every thrust made in fencing affords an
                    opportunity for one or other of these two movements. Those time thrusts in which
                    the opposition is not essential are made upon incorrect movements of the
                    adversary, when he exposes himself by the wideness of his attacks, or by
                    quitting the blade in a dangerous position, or by making too many disengagements
                    in his feints, or by giving a variety of openings which the judgment of the
                    fencer must determine how he is to take advantage of. This thrust is practised
                    almost entirely upon irregular attacks, and requires great caution to be
                    observed. It has been already stated that time thrusts in opposition, when
                    correctly made upon good attacks, are perhaps the finest movements in fencing;
                    but young fencers should nevertheless attempt them very seldom, from the danger
                    of misjudging the attack, and thus exposing themselves to the certainty of being
                    hit. And the time out of opposition is attended with still greater hazard, as
                    its success depends rather upon the wideness and irregularity of an adversary’s
                    movements than on the security of one’s own situation afforded by the opposition
                    in the former species of time thrust.</p>
                <p>When fencing was comparatively little known, it was thought necessary that there
                    should be some intermediate practice for the pupil between the lesson of the
                    master and his making the assault; for which purpose, it appears, he was taught
                    to longe, at a proper distance, at the wall. This was called by the French <hi
                    rend="italic">tirer au mur,</hi> and was considered as useful for planting the
                    learner well upon his legs, accustoming him to measure distance correctly, and
                    causing his motions, in making his extension and longe, to follow one another in
                    the proper succession. But as the art became better understood, observation
                    induced masters to place pupils together for their mutual advantage, the one to
                    attack by simple disengagements, the other to parry by quarte and tierce
                    alternately; and this practice, from its origin, was long called <hi
                    rend="italic">tirer au mur.</hi> It is now, however, generally known as <hi
                    rend="italic">quarte</hi><hi rend="italic">and tierce,</hi> and, in its improved
                    state, is not merely intended as an exercise for the scholar, but also as a
                    graceful display of the principal motions of fencing; for which reason it should
                    be invariably practised before commencing the assault, and in fencing before
                    company it is never dispensed with. Quarte and tierce appears very simple in its
                    execution, yet it is exceedingly useful to fencers in all stages of their
                    progress, and difficult to acquire with such correctness that all its movements
                    shall take place in their proper succession, and be made with the grace and
                    precision characteristic of a good fencer. The <hi rend="italic">counters</hi>
                    is also a practice of importance to young fencers.</p>
                <p>In the language of the fencing-room, making the <hi rend="italic">assauU</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">playing loose</hi> are synonymous, signifying the practice of
                    attack and defence, or, in other words, a just application of the lessons
                    received, which, in fact, ought to be done as correctly as if with sword in
                    hand. In the assault, the mere movements should be almost mechanical; for the
                    mind being wholly employed in discovering and counteracting the designs of the
                    adversary, as well as in concealing its own, the hand should, on the proper
                    opportunity beiDg given, instantly execute that which the mind conceives without
                    any consideration of the manner in which the particular motion is to be
                    made.</p>
                <p>The rules to be observed are few and distinct. The first thing which the
                    attention of a young fencer should naturally be directed to is the most secure
                    manner in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n81/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0081-0072"/> which he can come into the position of the guard,
                    when opposed to an adversary ready to take every advantage of his inexperience.
                    Whilst advancing into distance, it is also an object of importance to have one
                    side of the body secured by the position, particalarly that side to which the
                    antagonist’s blade is opposed; <hi rend="italic">so</hi> that, if he commence an
                    attack during this movement, he must quit the blade in order to direct his
                    thrust or feint at any opening afforded him by the position of his opponent; and
                    the opportunities of attack being few, his designs will thus be the more easily
                    discovered. Tn short, the commanding an opponent’s blade almost obliges him to
                    effect some change in the relative situations of the contending parties, before
                    he advances into distance; and as the necessity of such previous movement must
                    be foreseen, any attempt of this kind is favourable for making an attack on him.
                    And, generally, whilst standing in the position of the guard, it is an advantage
                    to have one side of the body covered, and to command the foible of the
                    adversary’s blade. Straight thrusts and simple disengagements, executed with
                    quickness and vigour, should frequently be attempted, even though they do not
                    succeed in hitting; and this should be particularly attended to in fencing with
                    a stranger. Quick simple thrusts are almost the only certain way of ascertaining
                    his favourite parades, and consequently of knowing by what feints to attack him
                    with a probability of success. The suddenness and rapidity of the attack will
                    inevitably extort from him the secret of his favourite defence.</p>
                <p>Many masters of the old school, and some, too, of the present day, have treated
                    <hi rend="italic">disarming</hi> as of importance in the art; but from its
                    inutility, not to mention danger, in the field, it is now considered
                    incompatible with good fencing, and indeed no better than a trick. The only
                    advantage of disarming is that of annoying the person disarmed; for, sword in
                    hand, it is rendered nugatory by the use of a sword-knot, with which, it may be
                    presumed, every person at all acquainted with the weapon will take especial care
                    to fasten it to his wrist in a serious affair. As the manoeuvre may therefore be
                    defeated by the most ordinary precaution, attempting it can serve no other
                    purpose than to cause heavy and unpleasant play; whilst the strength it requires
                    for its execution is a drawback, and affords an adversary favourable moments of
                    attack during the time an attempt is being made to bind his blade.</p>
                <p>As far back as 1692 a very curious book on the subject of fencing was published
                    by Sir William Hope; it is now very scarce. In 1780 a Lieutenant M‘Arthur
                    published a work on fencing, which he dedicated to the duke of Argyll. Several
                    modern works of merit have appeared on this subject; one of the most valuable
                    and complete is Roland’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Theory and, Practice
                    of the Art of Fencing.</hi></p>
