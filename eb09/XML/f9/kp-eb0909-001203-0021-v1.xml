                    (1274-1355), doge of Venice, was bom in 1274. In 1346 he commanded the Venetian
                    forces at the siege of Zara, where, being attacked by Louis the Great of Hungary
                    with a force of 80,000 men, he totally defeated them, inflicting a loss of 8000,
                    and compelling him to abandon all further attempts to raise the siege, which was
                    concluded shortly afterwards by the surrender of the defenders at discretion. As
                    commander of the Venetian fleet he also gained several victories and captured
                    Capo d’Istria. He was elected doge 11th September 1354. His reign was short, and
                    it had both a disastrous commencement and a tragic close. Very soon after his
                    election the Venetian fleet was captured by the Genoese, and hardly had he
                    concluded a four months’ truce with Genoa, when a very trivial incident occurred
                    which resulted in his arrest and execution. It would appear that, though an able
                    general and prudent statesman, Faliero possessed a temper so choleric that when
                    he was provoked reason for a time almost forsook him. On the occasion of the
                    usual court feast on Shrove Thursday, a young nobleman named Michele Steno,
                    perhaps excited by wine, took some liberties with one of the maids of honour,
                    and the doge on that account caused him to be ignominiously expelled from the
                    hall. Provoked at such a public affront Steno went to the hall of audience and
                    wrote on the doge’s chair the following words— <hi rend="italic">Manni Falieτi
                        dαlla bellα mοglie, al tri la godeedegli larnantiene</hi> (Marino Faliero,
                    the husband of the beautiful wife; others kisβ her, he keeps her). The author of
                    the insult was soon discovered and arrested, but the council sentencing him only
                    to two months’ imprisonment, the doge resolved to have adequate revenge, and
                    with this view formed a conspiracy to seize all the nobles and leading citizens,
                    and to make himself despot of Venice. The plot being, however, discovered a
                    short time before the day fixed on, the doge and principal conspirators were
                    arrested, and were executed on the 17th April 1355.</p>

                <p>The reign of Faliero has formed the subject of tragedies by Lord Byron, by
                    Delavigne, and by Albert Lindner; and Hoffman has employed it to furnish
                    materials for a romance. It also forms the subject of the libretto of one of
                    Donizetti’s operas. Byron has added to his tragedy a good many notes on the
                    character of Faliero, and on the incidents of his reign, together with an
                    English translation—made by F. Cohen—of the old <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of
                        Marino Faliero.</hi> The circumstances of Faliero’s plot are related in one
                    of the letters of Petrarch, who was his contemporary and friend.</p>
