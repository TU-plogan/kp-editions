                    quill, and again from the structure and elasticity of the vane; while for
                    ornamentation, sometimes beauty of form and offener brilliancy of colour are the
                    qualities which commend different feathers for use. The chief purposes for which
                    feathers become commercially valuable may be comprehended under four divisions
                    :—1st, bed and upholstery feathers; 2d, quills for writing; 3d, ornamental
                    feathers; and 4th, miscellaneous uses of feathers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bed and Upholstery Feathers.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    qualities which render feathers available for stuffing beds, cushions, &amp;c.,
                    are lightness, elasticity, freedom from matting, and softness. These are
                    combined in the most satisfactory degree in the feathers of the goose and of
                    several other allied aquatic birds, whose bodies are protected with a warm downy
                    covering. Goose feathers and down, when plucked in spring from the living bird,
                    are most esteemed, being at once more elastic, cleaner, and less liable to taint
                    than those obtained from the bodies of killed geese. The down of the eider duck,
                    <hi rend="italic">Anas</hi><hi rend="italic">mollissima,</hi> is esteemed above
                    all other substances for lightness, softness, and elasticity; but it has some
                    tendency to mat, and is consequently more used for quilts and in articles of
                    clothing than unmixed for stuffing beds. The feathers of swans, ducks, and of
                    the common domestic fowl are also largely employed for beds; but in the case of
                    the latter bird, which is of course non-aquatic, the feathers are harsher and
                    less downy than are those of the natatorial birds generally. Feathers which
                    possess strong or stiff shafts cannot without some preliminary preparation be
                    used for stuffing purposes, as the stiff points they present would not only be
                    highly uncomfortable, but would also pierce and cause the escape of the feathers
                    from any covering in which they might be inclosed. The barbs are therefore
                    stripped or cut from these feathers, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n69/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0069-0060"/> when so prepared they, in common with soft
                    feathers and downs, undergo a careful process of drying and cleaning, without
                    which they would acquire an offensive smell, readily attract damp, and become a
                    refuge for vermin. The drying is generally done in highly heated apartments or
                    stoves, and subsequently the feathers are smartly beaten with a stick, and
                    shaken in a sieve to separate all dust and small debris. Bed feathers come to
                    the British market most largely from Germany; in Russia geese are kept almost
                    exclusively on account of their feathers and quills; and from that country as
                    well as France large quantities of goose and other upholstery feathers are
                    obtained. The fine down of the eider duck obtained from high latitudes, as
                    already mentioned, is principally consumed in bed quilts and for down-quilted
                    articles of ladies’ attire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Quills for Writing.—</hi> The earliest period at which the use
                    of quill feathers for writing purposes is recorded is the 6th century; and from
                    that time till the introduction of steel pens in the early part of the present
                    century they formed the principal writing implements of civilized communities.
                    It has always been from the goose that quills have been chiefly obtained,
                    although the swan, crow, eagle, owl, hawk, and turkey all have more or less been
                    laid under contribution. Swan quills, indeed, are better and more costly than
                    are those from the goose, and for fine lines crow quills have been much
                    employed. It is only the five outer wing feathers of the goose that are useful
                    for writing, and of these the second and third are the best, while left-wing
                    quills are also generally more esteemed than those of the right wing, from the
                    fact that they curve outward and away from the writer using them. Quills
                    obtained in spring, by plucking or otherwise, from living birds are by far the
                    best, those taken from dead geese, more especially if fattened, being
                    comparatively worthless. To take away the natural greasiness, to remove the
                    superficial and internal pellicles of skin, and to give the necessary qualities
                    of hardness and elasticity, quills require to undergo some processes of
                    preparation. The essential operation consists in heating the quills, generally
                    in a fine sand-bath, to from 130" to 180° Fahr, according to circumstances, and
                    scraping them under pressure while still soft from heat, whereby the outer skin
                    is removed and the inner shrivelled up. If the heating has been properly
                    effected, the quills are found on cooling to have become hard, elastic, and
                    somewhat brittle. While the quills are soft and hot, lozengeshaped patterns,
                    ornamental designs, and names are easily and permanently impressed on them by
                    pressure with suitable instruments or designs in metal stamps.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ornamental Feathers.—</hi> Feathers do not appear to have been
                    much used, in Europe at least, for ornamental purposes till the close of the
                    13th century. They are found in the conical caps worn in England during the
                    reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.; but not till the period of Henry V. did
                    they take their place as a part of military costume. Towards the close of the
                    15th century the fashion of wearing feathers in both civil and military life was
                    carried to an almost ludicrous excess. In the time of Henry VIII. they first
                    appeared in the bonnets of ladies; and during Elizabeth’s reign feathers began
                    to occupy an important place as head-dress ornaments of women. From that time
                    down to the present, feathers of endless variety have continued to be leading
                    articles of ornamentation in female liead-attire; but, except for military
                    plumes, they have long ceased to be worn in ordinary male costume. At the
                    present day it is scarcely too much to say that all feathers of all birds are,
                    in one way or other, turned to account by ladies for the purpose of personal
                    ornament. Ostrich feathers, however, hold, as they have always held, a
                    pre-eminent position among ornamental feathers; and the ostrich is the only bird
                    which may be said to be reared exclusively for the sake of its feathers. Ostrich
                    farming is now recognized as one of the established industries of South Africa.
                    On these farms the birds are hatched by artificial incubation from eggs which
                    are valued at <hi rend="italic">£5</hi> each. The birds are estimated to be
                    worth about .£30 apiece, a fine full-grown male being valued as high as £75. The
                    birds begin to yield feathers when about a year old, and continue to an advanced
                    age to produce two crops of plumes annually of a present yearly average value of
                    £15. The feathers are generally plucked from the living animal —a process which
                    does not appear to cause any great inconvenience. In the male bird, the long
                    feathers of the rump and wings are white, and the short feathers of the body are
                    jet black; while the rump and wing feathers of the female are white tinged with
                    a dusky grey, the general body colour being the latter hue. The feathers of the
                    male are consequently much more valuable than those of the female, and they are
                    separately classified in commerce. The art of the plumassier embraces the
                    cleaning, bleaching, dying, curling, and making up of ostrich and other plumes
                    and feathers. White feathers are simply washed in bundles in hot soapy water,
                    run through pure warm water, exposed to sulphurous fumes for bleaching,
                    thereafter blued with indigo solution, rinsed in pure cold water, and hung up to
                    dry. When dry the shafts are pared or scraped down to give the feathers greater
                    flexibility, and the barbs are curled by drawing them singly over the face of a
                    blunt knife or by the cautious application of a heated iron. Dull-coloured
                    feathers are usually dyed black with logwood and sulphate or acetate of iron.
                    Feathers which are dyed light colours are first bleached by exposure in the open
                    air, and the dyes employed are the same as those for other animal substances.
                    Much ingenuity is displayed in the making up of plumes, with the general result
                    of producing the appearance of full, rich, and long feathers from inferior
                    varieties and from scraps and fragments of ostrich feathers; and so dexterously
                    can factitious plumes be prepared that only an experienced person is able to
                    detect the fabrication.</p>
                <p>To enumerate all the feathers used for ornamental purposes would be practically
                    to give a complete list of all known and obtainable birds; but there are a few
                    in addition to those of the ostrich which form steady articles of commercial
                    demand. Among these are the feathers of the South American ostrich, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhea americana,</hi> the marabout feathers of India obtained from
                    <hi rend="italic">Leptoptilos argala</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L.
                    javanica,</hi> the feathers of the various species of birds of paradise, and of
                    numerous species of humming-birds. Swan-down and the skins of various penguins
                    and grebes and of the albatross*are used, like fur, for muffs and
                    collarettes.</p>
                <p>The Chinese excel in the preparation of artificial flowers and other ornaments
                    from bright natural-coloured or dyed feathers; and the French also skilfully
                    work fragments of feathers into bouquets of artificial flowers, imitation
                    butterflies, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Applications of Feathers.—</hi> Quills of various
                    sizes are extensively employed as holders for the sable and camel hair brushes
                    used by artists, &amp;c. Feather brushes and dusters are made from the
                    wing-feathers of the domestic fowl and other birds; those of a superior quality,
                    under the name of vulture dusters, being really made of American ostrich
                    feathers. A minor application of feathers is found in the dressing of artificial
                    fly-hooks for fishing. A3 steel pens came into general use it became an object
                    of considerable importance to find applications for the supplanted goose-quills;
                    and in this quest no one was more deeply interested than M. Bardin, of Joinville
                    le Pont near Paris, whose establishment sent out about 20,000,000 quills
                    annually—the product of 2,000,000 geese. M. Bardin competed with the steel-pen
                    makers by cutting several pens of the shape of metallic pens from each quill,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n70/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0070-0061"/> but more largely he devoted himself to the
                    preparation of quill tooth-picks. The cutting up of the feathers in this way
                    leaves the shaft and barbs unused, and these he utilized in various ingenious
                    ways, the principal products being a kind of mat into which the barbs are woven,
                    the shafts yielding a fibrous substance not unlike hogs’ bristles, from which
                    useful brushes are fabricated. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j. pa.)</hi></p>
