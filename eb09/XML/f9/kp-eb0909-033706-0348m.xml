                    estate. His uncle, the marquis of Florian, who had married a niece of Voltaire,
                    introduced him at Ferney, and Florianet, as he was soon affectionately
                    nicknamed, spent a pleasant time with the old dictator of French literature. In
                    1768 he became page in the household of the duke υf Penthièvre at Anet, and
                    throughout his life he was the object of the powerful patronage of that cultured
                    nobleman. Having studied for some time at the artillery school at Bapaume he
                    obtained from the duke a commission in a dragoon regiment, and in this capacity
                    it is said he displayed a boisterous behaviour as unlike as might be to what the
                    reader of his works would naturally imagine. He afterwards left the army and
                    became gentleman in ordinary. On the breaking out of the French Revolution he
                    retired to Sceaux, but he was soon discovered and dragged to prison by the
                    Parisian sans-culottes; and though his incarceration was not of long
                    continuance, it so injured his health that he survived his release only a few
                    months. His death took place on September 13, 1794.</p>
                <p>Florian’s first literary efforts took the shape of little comedies; but he first
                    attracted attention by an epistle in verse entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voltaire</hi><hi rend="italic">et le</hi><hi rend="italic">serf du Mont
                    Jura</hi> and an eclogue called <hi rend="italic">Ruth,</hi> which were crowned
                    by the French Academy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. In the latter year he also
                    produced his <hi rend="italic">Galatêe,</hi> a professed imitation of the
                    Galatea of Cervantes, and this was followed two years later by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Numa</hi><hi rend="italic">Pompilius,</hi> an equally undisguised imitation of
                    Fénelon’s <hi rend="italic">Télémaque,</hi> which as an educational work has
                    proved only less popular than its prototype. In 1788 ho became a member of the
                    French Academy and published <hi rend="italic">Estelle,</hi> a pastoral of the
                    same class as <hi rend="italic">GalaCee,</hi> which is reckoned one of the best
                    of his works. Another romance, <hi rend="italic">Gonzalve de Cordoue,</hi>
                    preceded by an historical notice of the Moors, appeared in 1791, and his famous
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> in 1792. After his death there
                    appeared an unfinished treatment of the story of William Tell, to which he had
                    devoted the leisure of his confinement, and an <pb break="no"

                    being a correct representation of the original, had great success.</p>
                <p>Florian was a professed imitator of Gessner, and his style has all the artificial
                    delicacy and sentimentality of the Gessnerian school. Perhaps the nearest
                    example of the class in English literature is afforded by Wilson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life.</hi> He is least affected in
                    his fables, his comedies, and some of his minor tales. Among the best of the
                    fables are reckoned “the Monkey showing the Magic Lantern,” “the Blind Man and
                    the Paralytic,” and “the Monkeys and the Leopard”; and <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Deux Billets,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Bon Père,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Bon Menage</hi> are the best known of the comedies. In
                    the latter he brought the arlequinades again into fashion, and raised them to a
                    higher level. Florian’s <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Complètes</hi> appeared at
                    Paris in 16 volumes, 1820; his <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres inédites</hi> in 4
                    volumes, 1824. Didot published an edition in 24 volumes, Briand another in 13,
                    and Jauffret a third in 12. The editions of some of the more popular works are
                    extremely numerous.</p>
