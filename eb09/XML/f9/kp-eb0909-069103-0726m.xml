                    immediately involved in the first of his famous wars with France, in which, till
                    1795, he had the support of the king of Prussia. In 1794 he himself was with the
                    Austrian army which defeated the French at Tournay; but when fortune turned on
                    the side of France he went back to Vienna. He was compelled, mainly in
                    consequence of the victories of Napoleon, who pressed northward from Italy into
                    Carinthia, to conclude, on the 17th October 1797, the treaty of Campo Formio,
                    whereby the empire lost the greater part of the left bank of the Rhine, and
                    Austria had to give up the Netherlands and Lombardy. Austria received in return
                    Venetia, Friuli, Istria, and Dalmatia. In 1799 war broke out afresh, the emperor
                    having on this occasion England and Russia as allies. During the first campaign
                    the French were everywhere defeated; but in the following year Napoleon gained
                    the brilliant victory of Marengo, while Moreau was equally successful at
                    Hohenlinden. The shock of these two battles made it impossible for Austria to
                    continue the war, and on the 9th February 1801 she concluded t’.ie treaty of
                    Lunéville, which confirmed that of Campo Formio, besides exacting fresh
                    sacrifices. France now obtained the whole of the left bank of the Rhine. Once
                    more in association with Russia and England, the emperor began another war with
                    France in 1805. The capitulation of tſlm and the battle of Austerlitz, great as
                    were these disasters, did not make the case of Austria hopeless, for she still
                    had large forces, Russia was willing to continue the war, and the power of
                    France had been seriously crippled at Trafalgar. But Francis was dispirited, and
                    craved peace. On December 25, 1805, was concluded the treaty of Presburg, which
                    deprived Austria of Venetia and Tyrol. In 1806, after the formation of the
                    Confederation of the Rhine, he formally resigned the imperial crown, thus
                    bringing to an end the ∣Holy Roman Empire and the kingdom of Germany.
                    'Forgetting the true meaning of the word emperor, he had in 1804 proclaimed
                    himself, as Francis I., hereditary emperor of Austria; and this title has been
                    retained by his successors. He took no part in the war of Prussia with France in
                    1806, but after some time began to make preparations for a determined struggle,
                    by which he should regain all the advantages lost in previous wars. The new
                    conflict broke out in 1809, and the whole of Germany awaited the result with
                    intense anxiety. Austria was unfortunate at first; but the highest hopes were
                    excited by her thorough victory of Aspern. It was followed by the battle of
                    Wagram, which enabled Napoleon to dictate peace from the palace of Schönbrunn,
                    where he had once before taken up his quarters. By the treaty of Schönbrunn
                    (October 14, 1809) he transferred the allegiance of about four millions of
                    Austrian subjects to other rulers; but as in the following year he married Maria
                    Louisa, the eldest daughter of Francis, it seemed probable that the two
                    sovereigns would in future be on friendly terms. Francis was the ally of
                    Napoleon in his war with Russia in 1812; and when, after the retreat from
                    Moscow, France found herself confronted by Russia and Prussia, Austria at first
                    remained neutral, and in the summer of 1813 acted as mediator. In August of the
                    same year she joined the allies; and, like the sovereigns of Prussia and Russia,
                    Francis accompanied his troops in the war which followed. The settlement of
                    Europe which resulted from the final defeat ’of Napoleon made Francis a more
                    powerful sovereign than he had been at the beginning of his reign; and from this
                    time forward he lived at peace, except that he had to put down a rising in
                    Lombardy in 1821. He was a well-meaning ruler, but had been so alarmed by the
                    successes of the French Revolution that he detested modern ideas of government.
                    The aspirations of his various states for some measure of independence he
                    regarded as criminal, and in Prince Metternich he found a willing agent for his
                    policy of stern repression. Thus a large amount of discontent was excited, which
                    prepared serious, troubles for the emperors who came after him. Francis was
                    married four times, having by his second wife, Maria Theresa, princess of
                    Sicily, thirteen children. He died on the 2d March 1835, and was succeeded by
                    his son Ferdinand.</p>
