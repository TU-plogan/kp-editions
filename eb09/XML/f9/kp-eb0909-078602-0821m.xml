                    (1547-1590), scholar and poet, was born on the 22d of September 1547, at
                    Balingen, Wurtemberg, where his father was parish minister. He was educated at
                    Tübingen, and in 1568 was promoted to the chair of poetry and history. In 1575
                    for his comedy of <hi rend="italic">Rebecca,</hi> which he read at Ratisbon
                    before the emperor Maxmilian II., he was rewarded with the laureateship and with
                    the honour of knighthood. Some time afterwards he was made a comes palatinus. In
                    1582 his unguarded language and his reckless life had made it necessary that he
                    should leave Tübingen; he accordingly accepted a quiet mastership at Laibach in
                    Carniola, which he held for about two years. Shortly after his return to the
                    university in 1584, he was threatened with a criminal prosecution on a charge of
                    immoral conduct, to which, it was alleged, he had exposed himself some years
                    previously, and the threat led to his withdrawal to Frankfort in 1587. Of the
                    remaining four years of his life little is recorded. For eighteen months he
                    taught in the Brunswick Gymnasium, and he appears also to have resided
                    occasionally at Strasburg, Marburg, and Mainz. From the last-named city he wrote
                    certain libellous letters, which led to his being arrested in March 1590 at the
                    instance of the authorities of Würtemberg. He was imprisoned in the fortress of
                    Hohenurach, near Reutlingen, where, on the night of the 29th of November 1590,
                    he was killed by a fall in attempting to let himself down from the window of his
                    cell. His prolific and versatile genius produced a great variety of works, which
                    entitle him to some rank both among poets and among scholars. In his Latin verse
                    he has often successfully imitated the classical models; his comedies are not
                    without freshness and vivacity; and some of his versions and commentaries,
                    particularly those on the <hi rend="italic">Georgies</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bucolics</hi> of Virgil, though now well-nigh forgotten, were important
                    contributions to the scholarship of his time.</p>
                <p>No collected edition of his works has ever been published, to enumerate them
                    exhaustively would be almost impossible. Among those most widely known may be
                    mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Hebraeis,</hi> a Latin epic based on the
                    Scripture history of the Jews; the <hi rend="italic">Elegiaca,</hi> in
                    twenty-two books; the <hi rend="italic">Opera Scenica,</hi> consisting of six
                    comedies and two tragedies; the <hi rend="italic">Grammatica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Latina;</hi> the versions of Callimachus and Aristophanes; and the
                    commentaries on Persius and Virgil. See the monograph of Strauss <hi
                    rend="italic">(Leben und Schriften des Dichters und Philologen Frischlin,</hi>
