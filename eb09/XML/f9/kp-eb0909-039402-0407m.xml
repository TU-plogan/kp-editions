                    grandfather, Sir John Popham, was successively attorney-general and lord chief
                    justice. John Ford, like his cousin and namesake (to whom, with other members of
                    the society of Gray’s Inn, he dedicated his play of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Lover’s Melancholy),</hi> entered the profession of the law, being admitted of
                    the Middle Temple in 1602; but he seems never to have been called to the bar.
                    Four years afterwards he made his first appearance as an author with an elegiac
                    effusion called <hi rend="italic">Fame’s Memorial, or the Earl of Devonshire
                    deceased,</hi> and dedicated to the widow of the earl (Charles Blount Lord
                    Mountjoy, “coronized,” to use Ford’s expression, by King James in 1603 for his
                    services in Ireland, which the elegy celebrates) •—a lady who would have been no
                    unfitting heroine for one of Ford’s tragedies of lawless passion, the famous
                    Penelope formerly Lady Rich. This panegyric, which is accompanied by a series of
                    epitaphs, and is composed in a strain of fearless extravagance, was, as the
                    author declares, written “unfee’d”; it shows Ford to have sympathized, as
                    Shakespeare himself is supposed to have done, with the “awkward fate” of the
                    countess’s brother, the earl of Essex. Who the “flint-hearted Lycia” may be, to
                    whom the poet seems to allude as his own disdainful mistress, is unknown;
                    indeed, the record of Ford’s private life is, like that of the lives of so many
                    of our old dramatists, little better than a blank. To judge, however, from the
                    dedications, prologues, and epilogues of his various plays, he seems to have
                    enjoyed the patronage or goodwill of several men of rank— among them the
                    excellent earl (afterwards duke) of Newcastle, “himself a muse” after a fashion,
                    and the gallant Lord Craven, supposed to have been the husband of the exqueen of
                    Bohemia. Ford’s tract of <hi rend="italic">Honor Triumphant, or the Peeres
                    Challenge</hi> (printed 1606), and the simultaneously published verses <hi
                    rend="italic">The Monarches Meeting, or the King of Denmarkes welcome into
                    England,</hi> exhibit him as an occasional contributor to the festive demands of
                    court and nobility; and a kind of moral essay by him, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Line of Life</hi> (printed 1620), which contains a few not uninteresting
                    references to Raleigh, ends with a climax of praise to the address of “a good
                    man, of whom it may be verified that he is <hi rend="italic">bonorum
                    maximus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">magnorum optimus”</hi> —viz., King James I.
                    Yet it may be noted in passing that one of Ford’s plays contains an implied
                    protest against the absolute system of government which usually found ready
                    acceptance with the dramatists of the early Stuart reigns.<note anchored="true"

                    it was natural that he should exchange complimentary verses with Shirley, a more
                    various though less intense dramatic poet of his own age and school, and that he
                    should join in the chorus of laments with which the poets of the time mourned
                    the decease of their acknowledged veteran chief, Ben Jonson. It is more
                    interesting to notice an epigram in honour of the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Love’s Sacrifice</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Broken Heart</hi> by a poet of
                    a very different kind, but in whose genius it is not paradoxical to assert that
                    there were points of contact with Ford’s—Richard Crashaw, morbidly passionate in
                    one direction as Ford was in another. Towards the public Ford seems, by reason
                    either of his social position or of his personal character, to have assumed an
                    attitude of independence; but for an assailant of the theatre, such as the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Histriomastix,</hi> he displays, like his friend
                    Shirley, a dramatist’s inevitable scorn.</p>
                <p>It has been concluded, from evidence of a rather vague description, that in the
                    latter part of his life he gratified the tendency to seclusion for which he has
                    been thought to be ridiculed in a contemporary poem, by withdrawing from
                    business (it had probably been legal business of one kind or another), and from
                    literary life in London, to his native place; but nothing is known as to the
                    date of his death. His career as a dramatist very probably began with some plays
                    in which he assisted, or was assisted by, other authors. The titles of these
                    (all we possess of them) are not without significance. With Dekker he wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">The Fairy Knight</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bristoιve</hi><hi rend="italic">Merchant</hi>; with Webster <hi
                    rend="italic">A late Murther of the Sonne upon the Mother.</hi> A play
                    attributed to Ford alone, and entitled <hi rend="italic">An ill Beginning has a
                    good End,</hi> was brought on the stage as early as 1613; and in 1615 followed
                    <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas Overbury’s Life and untimely Death—</hi> a subject
                    to which the poet devoted some lines, which are preserved, of indignant regret.
                    He also wrote, at dates unknown, <hi rend="italic">The London Merchant</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">The. Royal Combat;</hi> a tragedy by him, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beauty in a Trance,</hi> was entered in the Stationer’s Register in 1653, but
                    never printed. Of the plays by Ford preserved to us the dates span little more
                    than a decade—the earliest, <hi rend="italic">The Lover's Melancholy,</hi>
                    having been acted in 1628 and printed in 1629, the latest, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Lady’s Trial,</hi> acted in 1638 and printed in 1639.</p>
                <p>When writing <hi rend="italic">The Lover's Melancholy,</hi> it would seem that
                    Ford had not yet become fully aware of the bent of his own dramatic genius,
                    although he was already master of bis powers of poetic expression. We may
                    suppose him, when he first became a dramatic author, to have been attracted
                    towards both domestic tragedy and romantic comedy—to the former by an
                    irresistible desire to sound the depths of abnormal conflicts between passion
                    and circumstances, to the latter by a strong though not widely varied
                    imaginative faculty, and by a self-delusion (such as will alone account for his
                    repeated—and nearly always unsuccessful—efforts in this direction) that he was
                    possessed of abundant comic humour. In his next two works, undoubtedly<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n408/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0408-0395"/> those most characteristically expressive of his
                    peculiar strength, viz., <hi rend="italic">'Tis</hi><hi rend="italic">Pity
                    she</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">a Whore</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Broken Heart</hi> (both printed 1633), he had found themes the
                    horrible situations in which required dramatic explanation by intensely powerful
                    motives. Ford by no means stood alone among our dramatists in his love of
                    abnormal subjects; but few were so capable of treating them sympathetically, and
                    at the same time without that reckless grossness or extravagance of expression
                    which renders the morally repulsive aesthetically intolerable, or converts the
                    horrible into the grotesque. For in Ford’s genius there was an element of true
                    refinement, except when the self-delusion referred to came into play. In a third
                    tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Love's Sacrifice</hi> (also printed in 1633) he again
                    worked on similar materials; but this time he unfortunately essayed to base the
                    interest of his plot upon an unendurably unnatural possibility— doing homage to
                    virtue after a fashion in which to honour is almost equivalent to insulting her.
                    He might seem by this time to have been in danger of indulging still further a
                    morbid tendency, the corroding influence of which is fatal to any genius
                    abandoning itself to it; yet we find him in <hi rend="italic">Perkin
                    Warbeck</hi> (printed 1634) choosing an historical subject, and, alone among the
                    dramatists of his age, seeking to emulate the glory of the great series of
                    Shakespeare’s national histories. It is true that his treatment of his theme,
                    though neither unskilful nor unworthy, could not at once compass the breadth and
                    variety which this species of drama demands. But the effort is one of the most
                    commendable, as it was by no means one of the least successful, in the dramatic
                    literature of this period; and we may unhesitatingly regret that he should not
                    have made another essay in the same field, instead of turning to romantic
                    comedy, for which he was without the requisite buoyancy of spirit, while all but
                    devoid of the faintest vestige of comic humour. <hi rend="italic">The Fancies
                    Chaste and Noble</hi> (printed 1638), though it includes scenes of real force
                    and feeling, is dramatically a failure, of which the main idea is almost
                    provokingly slight and feeble; and <hi rend="italic">The Lady's Trial</hi>
                    (acted 1638, printed 1639) is only redeemed from utter wearisomeness by an
                    unusually even pleasingness of form. There remain two other dramatic works, of
                    very different kinds, in which Ford co-operated with other writers, the mask of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Sun's Darling</hi> (acted 1624, printed 1657), which is
                    hardly to be placed in the first rank of early compositions, and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Witch of Edmonton</hi> (printed 1658, but probably acted about
                    a quarter of a century earlier), in which we see Ford as a joint writer of one
                    of the most powerful domestic dramas of our own or any other stage.</p>
                <p>À few notes may be added on some of the more remarkable of the plays enumerated.
                    A wholly baseless anecdote, condensed into a stinging epigram by Endymion
                    Porter, asserted that <hi rend="italic">The Lover's Melancholy</hi> was stolen
                    by Ford from Shakespeare’s papers. Lesser dramatists are in the habit of
                    borrowing from greater; and there were few among the writers of our old drama,
                    of whatever eminence or calibre, to whom plagiarism, whether in the matter of
                    situations and characters, or of passages and expressions, would have seemed a
                    literary liberty requiring defence. Undoubtedly, the madness of the hero of this
                    play of Ford’s occasionally recalls Hamlet, while the heroine is one of the
                    many, and at the same time one of the most pleasing, parallels to Viola. But
                    neither of them is a copy, as Friar Bonaventura in Ford’s second play may be
                    said to be a copy of Friar Lawrence, whose kindly pliability he disagreeably
                    exaggerates, or as D’Avolos in <hi rend="italic">Love’s Sacrifice</hi> is
                    clearly modelled on Iago. The plot of <hi rend="italic">The Lover's
                    Melancholy,</hi> which is ineffective because it leaves no room for suspense in
                    the mind of the reader, seems original; in the dialogue, on the other hand, a
                    justly famous passage in Act i. (the beautiful version of the story of the
                    nightingale’s death) is translated from Strada; while the scheme of the tedious
                    interlude exhibiting the various forms of madness is avowedly taken, together
                    with sundry comments, from that storehouse of useless learning, Burton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy.</hi> Already in this play Ford exhibits the
                    singular force of his pathos; the despondent misery of the aged Meleanαer, and
                    the sweetness of the last scene, in which his daughter comes back to him, alike
                    go to tbs heart A situation—hazardous in spite of its comic substratum</p>
                <p>—between Thaumasta and the pretended Parthenophil is conducted, as Gifford points
                    out, with real delicacy; but the comic scenes are merely stagey,
                    notwithstanding, or by reason of, the effort expended on them by the author.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">'Tis</hi><hi rend="italic">Pity she</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >’s</hi><hi rend="italic">a JFhore</hi> has been justly recognized as a tragedy
                    of extraordinary power; but it seems no hard matter to join in this recognition,
                    while reserving to oneself the right, which no canon of criticism can rebut, of
                    protesting against the abuse of art of which this play furnishes an almost
                    unparalleled example. Mr Swinburne, in his eloquent essay on Ford, has rightly
                    shown what is the meaning of this’tragedy, and has at the same time indicated
                    wherein consists its poison. He dwells with great force upon the different
                    treatment applied by Ford to the characters of the two miserable lovers—brother
                    and sister. “The sin once committed, there is no more wavering or flinching
                    possible to him, who has fought so hard against the demoniac possession; while
                    she who resigned body and soul to the tempter almost at a word, remains liable
                    to the influences of religion and remorse.” This different treatment shows the
                    feeling of the poet—the feeling for which he seeks to evoke our inmost
                    sympathy—to oscillate between the belief that an awful crime brings with it its
                    awful punishment (and it is sickening to observe how the argument by which the
                    Friar persuades Annabella to forsake her evil courses mainly appeals to the
                    physical terrors of retribution), and the notion that there is something fatal,
                    something irresistible, and therefore in a sense self-justified, in so dominant
                    a passion. The key-note to the conduct of Giovanni lies in his words at the
                    close of the first scene—</p>
                <p>‘ All this I’ll do, to free me from the rod</p>
                <p>Of vengeance; <hi rend="italic">else</hi><hi rend="italic">Γll</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">swear my fate</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">my
                    god.”</hi></p>
                <p>Thus there is no solution of the conflict (which in one form or the other all men
                    have to undergo) between passion on the one side, and law, duty, and religion on
                    the other; and passion triumphs, in the dying words of “the student struck blind
                    and mad by passion”—</p>
                <p>“O, I bleed fast!</p>
                <p>Death, thou’rt a guest long look’d for; I embrace Thee and thy wounds: 0, my last
                    minute comes! Where’er I <hi rend="italic">go,</hi> let me enjoy this grace</p>
                <p>Freely to view my Annabella’s face.”</p>
                <p>It has been observed by a recent critic of mark that “English poets have given us
                    the right key to the Italian temperament</p>
                <p>The love of Giovanni and Annabella is rightly depicted as more imaginative than
                    sensual.” It is difficult to alloλv the appositeness of Mr J. A. Symonds’s
                    special illustration; on the other hand, Ford has even in this case shown his
                    art of depicting sensual passion without grossness of expression; for the
                    exception in Annabella’s language to Soranzo seems to have a special intention,
                    and is true to the pressure of the situation and the revulsion produced by it in
                    a naturally weak and yielding mind. The entire atmosphere, so to speak, of the
                    play is stifling, and is not rendered less so by the underplot with
                    Hippolita.</p>
                <p>Like this tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Broken Heart</hi>
                    was probably founded upon some Italian or other novel of the day; but since in
                    the latter instance there is nothing revolting in the main idea of the subject,
                    the play commends itself as the most enjoyable, while, in respect of many
                    excellences, an unsurpassed specimen of Ford’s dramatic genius. The complicated
                    plot is constructed with greater skill than is usual with this dramatist, and
                    the pathos of particular situations, and of the entire character of Penthea—a
                    woman doomed to hopeless misery, but capable of seeking to obtain for her
                    brother a happiness which his cruelty has condemned her to forego—has an
                    intensity and a depth which are all Ford’s own. Even the lesser characters are
                    more pleasing than usual, and some beautiful lyrics are interspersed in the
                    play.</p>
                <p>Of the other plays written by Ford alone, <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Historie</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Perkin</hi><hi rend="italic">IVarbcck—A Strange Truth</hi> alone appears to
                    call for special attention. A repeated perusal of this drama suggests the
                    judgment that it is overpraised when ranked at no great distance from
                    Shakespeare’s national dramas. Historical truth has not to be taken into
                    consideration in the matter; and if (notwithstanding Mr Gairdner) there are
                    still credulous persons left to think and assert that Perkin was not an
                    impostor, they will derive little satisfaction from Ford’s play, which with
                    really surprising skill avoids the slightest indication as to the poet’s own
                    belief on the subject. That this tragedy should have been reprinted in 1714 and
                    acted in 1745 only snows that the public, as is often the case, had an eye to
                    the catastrophe rather than to the development of the action. The dramatic
                    capabilities of the subject are, however, great, and it afterwards attracted
                    Schiller, who, however, seems to have abandoned it in favour of the similar
                    theme of the Russian Demetrius. Had Shakespeare treated it, he would hardly have
                    contented himself with investing the hero with the nobility given by Ford to
                    this personage of his play,—for it is hardly possible to speak of a personage as
                    a <hi rend="italic">character</hi> when the clue to his conduct is intentionally
                    withheld. Nor could Shakespeare have failed to bring out with greater variety
                    and distinctness the dramatic features in Henry VII., whom Ford depicts with
                    sufficient distinctness to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"

                    but still with a tenderness of touch which would have been much to the credit of
                    the dramatist’s skill had he been writing in the Tudor age. The play is,
                    however, founded on Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> of which the text is
                    used by Ford with admirable discretion. The minor characters of the honest old
                    Huntley, whom the Scottish king obliges to bestow his daughter’s hand upon
                    Warbeck, and of her lover the faithful “Dalyell,” are most effectively drawn;
                    even “the men of judgment,” the adventurers who surround the chief adventurer,
                    are spirited sketches, and the Irishman among them has actually some humour;
                    while the style of the play is, as befits a “Chronicle History,” so clear and
                    straightforward as to make it easy as well as interesting to read.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Witch of Edmonton</hi> was attributed by its publisher to
                    William Rowley, Dekker, Ford, “ &amp;c.,” but the body of the play has been
                    generally held to be ascribable to Ford and Dekker only. Mr Swinburne agrees
                    with Gifford in thinking Ford the author of the whole of the first act; and he
                    is most assuredly right in considering that “there is no more admirable
                    exposition of a play on the English stage.” Supposing Dekker to be chiefly
                    responsible for the scenes dealing with the unfortunate old woman whom
                    persecution as a witch actually drives to become one, and Ford for the domestic
                    tragedy of the bigamist murderer, it cannot be denied that both divisions of the
                    subject are effectively treated, while the more important part of the task fell
                    to the share of Ford. Yet it may be doubted whether any such division can be
                    safely assumed; and it may suffice to repeat that no domestic tragedy has ever
                    taught with more effective simplicity and thrilling truthfulness the homely
                    double lesson of the folly of selfishness and the mad rashness of crime. To us
                    such plays as this are singularly interesting, both as pictures of the manners
                    of the age which they depict without the effort more or less perceptible in
                    comedy, and as illustrations of a species of the modern drama which, in its best
                    examples, is perhaps of all the least liable to essential change.</p>
                <p>With Dekker Ford also wrote the mask of <hi rend="italic">The Sun’s
                    Darling·,</hi> or, as seems most probable, they founded this production upon <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaeton,</hi> an earlier mask, of which Dekker had been sole
                    author. Gifford holds that Dekker’s hand is perpetually traceable in the first
                    three acts of <hi rend="italic">The Sun’s Darling,</hi> and through the whole of
                    its comic part, but that the last two acts are mainly Ford’s. If so, he is the
                    author of the rather forced occasional tribute on the accession of King Charles
                    I., of which the last act largely consists. This mask, which furnished abundant
                    opportunities for the decorators, musicians, and dancers, in showing forth how
                    the seasons and their delights are successively exhausted by a “wanton darling,”
                    Ray-bright the grandchild of the Sun, is said to have been very popular. It is
                    at the same time commonplace enough in conception; but there is much that is
                    charming in the descriptions, Jonson and Lyly being respectively laid under
                    contribution in the course of the dialogue, and in one of the incidental
                    lyrics.</p>
                <p>Ford holds a position of his own among our dramatists of the second order. This
                    he owes not to his skill as a constructor of plots, which he at times prepares
                    better than he executes them, thus verifying the observation that the supreme
                    skill of the dramatist lies, not in devising or finding the chief situation of
                    his play, but in the harmonious building-up of the action and development of the
                    characters towards it. Nor does he owe it even to the beauty, of his
                    versification, the fluency and strength of which are incontestable,
                    notwithstanding a certain obscurity of style. His peculiar power lies in the
                    intensity of his passion, in particular scenes and passages where the character,
                    the author, and the reader are alike lost in the situation and in the sentiment
                    evoked by it; and this gift is a supreme dramatic gift. But his plays—with the
                    exception of <hi rend="italic">The Witch of Edmonton,</hi> in which he doubtless
                    had a prominent share—too often disturb the mind like a bad dream which ends as
                    an unsolved dissonance; and this defect is a supreme dramatic defect. It is not
                    the rigid or the stolid who have the most reason to complain of the
                    insufficiency of tragic poetry such as Ford’s; nor is it that morality only
                    which, as Ithocles says in <hi rend="italic">The Broken Heart,</hi> “is formed
                    of books and school-traditions,” which has a right to protest against the final
                    effect of the most powerful creations of his genius. There is a morality which
                    both</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Keeps the soul in tune, At whose sweet music all our actions dance,” and is
                    able to physic</p>
                <p>“The sickness of a mind</p>
                <p>Broken with griefs.”</p>
                <p>Of that morality—or of that deference to the binding power within man and the
                    ruling power above him— tragedy is the truest expounder, even when it
                    illustrates by contrasts; but the tragic poet who merely places the problem
                    before us, and bids us stand aghast with him at its cruelty, is not to be
                    reckoned among the great masters of a divine art.</p>

                    1869). Mr Swinburne’s “Essay on Ford,” to which reference has been made in this
                    article, is reprinted among his <hi rend="italic">Essays and Studies</hi>
