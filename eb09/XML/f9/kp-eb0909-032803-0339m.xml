                    proceeded to the Temple. Possessing a competent fortune, high social position,
                    and considerable family influence, be determined to devote himself to a
                    political life, and obtained a seat in the Irish House of Commons for his own
                    county of Kilkenny. His abilities soon placed him in the position of a leader of
                    the opposition or popular party, to which he rendered good service on several
                    occasions. Among his more intimate friends at this time were the agreeable and
                    gifted Lord Charlemont, Mr Bushe, and the famous Grattan, who owed a good deal
                    to Flood’s assistance in entering upon public life. Though somewhat too solemn
                    and dignified, Flood was an orator of considerable power, and especially master
                    of that unsparing invective which was then one of the best employed weapons of
                    debate, and which often degenerated into what would now be considered
                    unwarrantable personalities. At that time, indeed, political rivalry frequently
                    ended in personal hatred. In 1769 Flood had the misfortune to be involved in an
                    election quarrel with a Mr Agar. The result was a duel, and on the second
                    exchange of shots Agar was mortally wounded. Flood was brought to trial, but
                    acquitted. In 1775 Flood was persuaded to an act which seriously diminished his
                    influence. He accepted the office of vice-treasurer under Lord Harcourt and the
                    duke of Buckingham. But in 1780, in consequence of his strong sympathy with the
                    cause of Irish independence and his position as lieutenant-colonel of the Irish
                    volunteers, he felt obliged to resign this office, and in consequence he was
                    removed by the Government from the council, treatment which ho bitterly
                    resented. His influence was now entirely devoted to the support of the popular
                    party, which in fact he had never deserted. He was present at the great armed
                    convention of the volunteers which met at Dungannon, and proposed a resolution
                    that the powers exercised by the Privy Council were unconstitutional. After the
                    passing of the Irish Bill of Right through the splendid efforts of Grattan,
                    Flood made an attempt to achieve what he considered would be a still greater
                    triumph. He declared that the mere repeal of the Act (6 Geo. I.) which had
                    subjected Ireland to the control of the English parliament w as not enough, and
                    insisted upon an express renouncement of the right of the English parliament to
                    interfere in any way with the government of Ireland. Grattan, maintaining that
                    his own measure was sufficient, vigorously opposed the bill which Flood
                    introduced; and the two orators, forgetting their old friendship, exchanged
                    speeches full of the bitterest personal invective. The quarrel was about to end
                    in a duel, and arrangements were actually being made for a meeting, when the
                    affair was discovered, and both were bound over to keep the peace. Flood’s bill
                    was completely defeated, for it was altogether unnecessary, and could only have
                    served as a triumph to Irish national vanity. In 1783 Flood obtained a seat in
                    the English House of Commons (while retaining his seat in the Irish House),
                    being elected M.P. for Winchester. He was afterwards (1785) member for Seaford.
                    But his success was not such as he had enjoyed in Ireland, and his career in the
                    English parliament was not of much importance. Perhaps his greatest effort was
                    his speech against Pitt’s famous commercial treaty. Flood died on the 2d <pb

                    College, Dublin, part of which was to found a professorship of Irish and furnish
                    prizes for English and Irish composition, but this destination of the bequest
                    was set aside.</p>
