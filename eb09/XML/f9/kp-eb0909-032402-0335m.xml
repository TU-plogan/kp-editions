                    (1774-1814), English navigator, explorer, and man of science, was born at
                    Donington, near Boston, in Lincolnshire, March 16, 1774. Matthew was at first
                    designed to follow his father’s profession of surgeon, but his enthusiasm in
                    favour of a life of adventure impelled him to enter the royal navy, which he
                    did, October 23, 1789. After a voyage to the Friendly Islands and West Indies,
                    and after serving in the “Bellerophon” during Lord Howe’s “glorious first of
                    June”(1794) off Ushant, Flinders went out in 1795 as midshipman in the
                    “Reliance” to New South Wales. For the next few years he devoted himself to the
                    task of accurately laying down the outline and bearings of the Australian coast,
                    and he did his work so thoroughly that he left comparatively little for his
                    successors to do. With his friend George Bass, the surgeon of the “Reliance,” in
                    the year of his arrival he explored George’s River; and, after a voyage to
                    Norfolk Island, again in March 1796 the two friends in the same boat, the “Tom
                    Thumb,” only 8 feet long, and with only a boy to help them, explored a stretch
                    of coast to the south of Port Jackson. After a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope,
                    when he was promoted to a lieutenancy, Flinders was engaged during February 1798
                    in a survey of the Furneaux Islands, lying to the north of Tasmania. His delight
                    was great when, in September of the same year, he was commissioned along with
                    Bass, who had already explored the sea between Tasmania and the south coast to
                    some extent and inferred that it was a strait, to proceed in the sloop “Norfolk”
                    (25 tons) to prove conclusively that Van Diemen’s Land was an island by
                    circumnavigating it. In the same sloop, in the summer of next year, Flinders
                    made an exploration to the north of Port Jackson, the object being mainly to
                    survey Glasshouse Bay (Moreton Bay) and Hervey’s Bay. Returning to England he
                    was appointed to the command of an expedition for the thorough exploration of
                    the coasts of Terra Australis, as the southern continent was still called,
                    though Flinders is said to have been the first to suggest for it the name
                    Australia. On July 18, 1801, the sloop “Investigator” (334 tons), in which the
                    expedition sailed, left Spithead, Flinders being furnished with instructions and
                    with a passport from the French Government to all their officials in the Eastern
                    seas. Among the scientific staff was Robert Brown, one of the most eminent
                    English botanists; and among the midshipmen was Flinders’s relative, John
                    Franklin, of Arctic fame. Cape Leeuwin, on the south-west coast of Australia,
                    was reached on November 6, and King George’s Sound on December 9. Flinders
                    sailed round the Great Bight, examining the islands and indentations on the east
                    side, noting the nature of the country, the people, products, &amp;c., and
                    paying special attention to the subject of the variation of the compass. Spencer
                    and St Vincent Gulfs were discovered and explored. On April 8, 1802, shortly
                    after leaving Kangaroo Islands, at the mouth of St Vincent Gulf, Flinders fell
                    in with the French exploring ship, “Le Géographe,” under Captain Nicolas Baudin,
                    in the bay now known as Encounter Bay. In the narrative of the French expedition
                    published in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n336/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0336-0325"/> 1807 (when Flinders was a prisoner in the
                    Mauritius) by Μ. Peron, the naturalist to the expedition, much of the laud west
                    of the point of meeting was claimed as having been discovered by Baudin, and
                    French names were extensively substituted for the English ones given by
                    Flinders. It was only in 1814, when Flinders published his own narrative, that
                    the real state of the case was fully exposed. Flinders continued his examination
                    of the coast along Bass’s Strait, carefully surveying Port Phillip. Port Jackson
                    was reached on May 9, 1802.</p>
                <p>After staying at Port Jackson for about a couple of months, Flinders set out
                    again on July 22 to complete his circumnavigation of Australia. The Great
                    Barrier Reef was examined with the greatest care in several places. The
                    north-east entrance of the Gulf of Carpentaria was reached early in November;
                    and the next three months were spent in an examination of the shores of the
                    gulf, and of tho islands that skirt them. An inspection of the “Investigator”
                    showed that she was in so leaky a condition that only with the greatest
                    precaution could the voyage be completed in her. Flinders completed the survey
                    of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and after touching at tho island of Timor, the
                    “Investigator” sailed round the west and south of Australia, and Port Jackson
                    was reached on Juno 9, 1803. Much suffering was endured by nearly all tho
                    members of the expedition-, a considerable proportion of tho men succumbed to
                    disease, and their leader was so reduced by scurvy that his health was greatly
                    impaired.</p>
                <p>Flinders determined to proceed home in II. M.S.. “Porpoise” as a passenger,
                    submit the results of his work to the Admiralty, and obtain, if possible,
                    another vessel to complete his exploration of the Australian coast. The
                    “Porpoise” left Port Jackson on August 10, accompanied by the H.E.I.C.’s ship
                    “Bridgewater” (750 tons) and tho “Cato” (450 tons) of London. On the night of
                    the 17th, tho “Porpoise” and “Cato” suddenly struck on a coral reef, and were
                    rapidly reduced to wrecks. Tho officers and men encamped on a small sandbank
                    near, 3 or 4 feet above high water, a considerable quantity of provisions, with
                    many of tho papers aud charts, having been saved from tho wrecks. The reef was
                    in about 22° 1Γ S. and 155° E., and about 800 miles from Port Jackson. Flinders
                    returned to Port Jackson in a six-oared cutter in order to obtain a vessel to
                    rescue the party. The reef was again reached on October 8, and all tho officers
                    and men having been satisfactorily disposed of, Flinders on tho 11th left for
                    Jones Strait in an unsound schooner of 29 tons, tho “Cumberland,” with ten
                    companions, and a valuable collection of papers, charts, geological specimens,
                    &lt;fcc. On December 15 he put in at Mauritius, when he discovered that France
                    and England were at war. Tho passport he possessed from tho French Government
                    was for the “Investigator”; still, though he was now on board another ship, his
                    mission was essentially the same, and the work lie was on was simply a
                    continuation of that commenced in the unfortunate vessel. Nevertheless, on her
                    arrival at Port Louis the “Cumberland” was seized by order of the
                    governor-general De Caen. Flinders’s papers were taken possession of, and he
                    found himself virtually a prisoner. We need not dwell on the sad details of this
                    unjustifiable captivity, which lasted to Juno 1810. But there can be no doubt
                    that the hardships and inactivity Flinders was compelled to endure for upwards
                    of six years told seriously on his health, and brought his life to a premature
                    end. He reached England in October 1810, after an absence of upwards of nine
                    years. The official red-tapeism of the day barred all promotion to tho
                    unfortunate explorer, who set himself to prepare an account of his explorations,
                    though unfortunately an important part of his record had been retained by De
                    Caen. The results of his labours were published in two large quarto volumes,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">A Voyage to Terra Australis,</hi> with a folio volume
                    of maps. The very day (July 19, 1814) on which his work was published Flinders
                    died, at the early age of forty. The great work is a model of its kind,
                    containing as it does not only a narrative of his own and of previous voyages,
                    but masterly statements of the scientific results, especially with regard to
                    magnetism, meteorology, hydrography, and navigation. Flinders paid great
                    attention to the errors of the compass, especially to those caused by the
                    presence of iron in ships. He is understood to have been the first to discover
                    the source of such errors (which had scarcely been noticed before), and after
                    investigating the laws of the variations, he suggested counter-attractions, an
                    invention for which Professor Barlow got much credit many years afterwards.
                    Numerous experiments on ships’ magnetism were conducted at Portsmouth by
                    Flinders, by order of the Admiralty, in 1812. Besides the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyage,</hi> Flinders wrote <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Coast of Van
                    Diemen's Land, Bass’s Strait,</hi> &amp;c., and two papers in tho <hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,—</hi> one on the “Magnetic Needle” (1805), and the
                    other “Observations on the Marine Barometer” (180G). <hi rend="smallcaps"
