                    countrymen to the most notorious and dreaded of modem Italian brigands; and the
                    name, associated during his lifetime with the political revolutions of southern
                    Italy, has acquired a world-wide celebrity since it became the title of a
                    favourite French opera. His real name was Michele Pezza. It would be as hopeless
                    to fix the precise dates in his career as to determine those in the lives of Rob
                    Roy or Jonathan Wild. He is stated, however, to have been born at ItrL His
                    crimes became invested with a more general and political interest in 1799. At
                    that time, from the frequency and audacity of his robberies and murders along
                    the frontier of the Terra di Lavoro, he became known as Fra Diavolo, the popular
                    superstition investing him with the blended attributes of a monk and a demon.
                    When the kingdom of Naples was overrun by the troops of the French Republic, Fra
                    Diavolo, acting in concert with the head of the Bourbon partisans, Cardinal
                    Ruffo, waged a fierce aud untiring war against the French soldiers, whenever his
                    superior knowledge of the localities afforded the prospect of his being able to
                    do so with effect. He continued for a considerable period in absolute possession
                    of the line of communication from the Garigliano to Portello, falling upon and
                    massacring the French Government couriers, and all whom he suspected of
                    conveying information to the military or civil functionaries of the Republic. At
                    one moment he succeeded in completely interrupting all communication between
                    Naples and Rome. Like his fellow agents under Cardinal Ruffo—like Mammone,
                    Pronio, Sciarpa Guar-riglia—he styled himself “the faithful servant and subject
                    of his Sicilian Majesty.” As the turning point in Fra Diavolo’s career must be
                    regarded the arrival in Naples of Joseph Bonaparte, and the establishment of the
                    extraordinary tribunals charged with the repression of this half civil half
                    political brigandage. Fra Diavolo was sentenced to death, and a price was set on
                    his head. After spreading terror through Calabria by his deeds of cruelty he had
                    passed over into Sicily, but soon returned to the mainland at the head of 300
                    liberated convicts placed at his disposal by the Bourbon Government. His landing
                    at Spelonza with these ruffians was marked by unusual excesses, but the French
                    troops were everywhere on the alert to capture him, and he was compelled to seek
                    refuge amongst the woods and mountains of Lenola. During a period of two months
                    he succeeded in evading his pursuers, always in the hope of making his way back
                    to Sicily. A t length, exhausted by hunger and requiring medical aid, he
                    repaired in disguise to the village of Baronissi, but was there recognized and
                    put to death. It is stated that on his person were found papers from Queen
                    Caroline of Naples and Admiral Sidney Smith, those from the former recognizing
                    his rank as colonel in the Bourbon army, and that in his last moments he cursed
                    both his employers and his own folly which had led him to engage in such a
                    reckless enterprise. The most authentic source for the career of Fra Diavolo is
                    Colletta’s <hi rend="italic">History of Naples,</hi> which the English reader
                    may consult in the version, equally faithful and spirited, of Miss Horner.</p>
