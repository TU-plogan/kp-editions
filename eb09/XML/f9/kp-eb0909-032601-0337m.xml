                    Clwydian range to the S. and S.W. The greatest length of the county from S.E. to
                    N.W. is 26 miles, and its breadth is from 10 to 12—Maelor being 9 miles by 5.
                    The chief part of it is situate on the Coal-Measures and other members of the
                    Carboniferous rocks group. A hilly tract of 50 miles breadth separates the
                    Anglesey Coal-Measures from the Flintshire coal-field, which is again separated
                    from that of Denbighshire to S.E. by the elevation of Mountain Limestone and
                    Millstone Grit between Gresford and Hope. The latter runs continuously along the
                    southern edge of the coal strata, followed, except in the extreme south, where
                    we have the Wenlock rocks, by the Mountain Limestone. The extreme west and east,
                    as well as the detached hundred, of the county is on the New Red Sandstone.
                    Symonds says,—“The coal measures may be traced along the shore from Flint to the
                    Point of Air; and the route from Flint to the west of Holywell crosses the
                    Millstone Grit to the Mountain Limestone.” The Wenlock rocks, of considerable
                    altitude, forming the northern limb of the Berwen mountains, extend to within a
                    mile of the shore of the Dee, near the western limit of the county, the margin
                    still west being composed of the alluvial flat of Rhuddlan marsh and part of the
                    vale of Clwyd. To the south the water-shed of the Berwens divides Flintshire and
                    Denbighshire for some distance,—Moel Fammau, a member of the range common to
                    both, rising to 1845 feet. This is high for Flintshire, though Buckley and
                    Halkin mountains, with the rest of the hill system north and south, indicate a
                    generally mountainous character. A narrow alluvial tract to the east lies
                    parallel to that already mentioned in the extreme west, and both are connected
                    by a fertile strip of reclaimed land on the south shore of the estuary. The
                    hundred of Maelor is flat, fertile, and highly picturesque.</p>
                <p>Flint has some lovely valleys, such as those of the Clwyd, partly in the county,
                    and the Alyn, and dingles and ravines, such as the course of theWepre brook from
                    Ewloe Castle to the Dee. The chief rivers are the Dee, Clwyd, and Alyn. The Dee,
                    entering the county near Overton, divides Maelor from Denbighshire on the west,
                    and, after passing Chester, bounds it also on the north. The Clwyd, rising in
                    Denbighshire, enters Flintshire near Bodfary, and after a brief northward
                    course, joins the Elwy near Rhuddlan, past which they flow in one channel into
                    the Irish Sea near Rhyl. The Alyn, a Denbighshire tributary, enters Flintshire
                    near the base of Moel Fammau, winds between Cilcen and Mold,—with an underground
                    course of half a mile, like fabled Alpheus, near Hesp-Alyn,—and then bending
                    south to Caergwyrle, re-enters Denbighshire to join the Dee. Of Flintshire
                    lakes, unimportant compared with those of neighbouring counties, Llyn Helig near
                    Whitford is the chief.</p>
                <p>Sloping seaward, with a mild climate, a moderate elevation and shelter, and
                    sufficient irrigation, Flintshire is well adapted for agriculture. Three-fourths
                    of its area is under cultivation, as follows:—</p>

                <p>Of green crops, turnips and swedes are the chief; mangolds are little grown. To
                    every 100 acres of cultivated land the proportion of horses is 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5, of cattle 42 ’ 4, of sheep 100 ’ 8, and of pigs 11
                    ’ 8,—the cattle and pigs being about the same proportion as for Denbighshire,
                    while the horses and sheep number only about one-half. Stock and dairy farming
                    are keenly pursued by the Flintshire farmer, who crosses his native cattle with
                    Herefords and Downs, his native sheep with Leicesters and Southdowns. Flintshire
                    farms are of more than average size, and their occupiers are intelligent and
                    progressive. In the thickly planted mining population they find a ready market
                    for beef and mutton, as well as for cheese and butter.</p>
                <p>With this important increment to their agricultural population, the census of
                    1871 gives Flintshire a population of 76,312, or an increase in ten years of
                    above 6500. In 1801 the number was 39,469, so that the increase during the
                    century has been nearly double. Flint is now one of the most densely peopled
                    counties for its size, ranking the third in numbers of North Wales. Its
                    collieries, of which there are 27 of note in the county, producing an annual
                    average of 500,000 tons, begin at Llanasa, and run south-east through Whitford,
                    Holywell, Flint, Halkin, Northop, Buckley, Mold, and Hawarden. Much of the yield
                    is exported. Lead is raised in Halkin mountain, and in some nine or ten mines of
                    note about Mold, Holywell, Prestatyn, and Talacre, near Llanasa, the average
                    annual produce being about 1200 tons. The town of Holywell has been reckoned the
                    headquarters of the “lead ore ticketings.” In some cases it is smelted on the
                    spot. Elsewhere it is sent to Bagilt, Flint, or Chester for that purpose. At
                    Dyserth zinc is worked to a limited extent, and copper in Talargoch mine.
                    Flintshire has also calamine mines; and in addition to frequent smelting works,
                    large manufactories of oil, vitriol, potash, ⅛c., employ the dwellers near the
                    coast, while coarse clay-potteries, the products of which go by train and rail
                    to Connah’s Quay, occupy those around Buckley. Little ironstone is now raised,
                    the seams being thin and the yield low; but an important source of industry is
                    the large limestone quarries, eight in number, which produce a quantity of
                    building stone, burnt lime, and small stone for chemical works about Halkin and
                    elsewhere.</p>

                <p>In 1873 the county was divided between 3510 owners, of whom 2048, or 58 per
                    cent., possessed less than one acre, or much the same proportion as Denbighshire
                    (see vol. vit p. 77). The average size of properties was 40£ acres, the average
                    value per acre £2, 13s. 8∣d. More than one-third of the county is owned by 13
                    proprietors, viz., Lord Hanmer (Hamner Hall), 7318 acres; Captain Conwy (Rhyl),
                    5526; Mostyn Trustees, 5460; Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, 6908; Sir Piers Mostyn

                    sessional divisions are—Mold; Northop; Hawarden and Broughton; Caergwyrle;
                    Holywell; Caerwys; Rhyl, Prestatyn, and St Asaph; and Hanmer. Flint borough has
                    its separate commission of the peace, the borough magistrates holding their
                    petty sessions at the town-hall for the borough district. The whole county
                    constitutes one lieutenancy, and there are no highway districts. The principal
                    towns are Flint, Mold, St Asaph, Rhyl, Holywell.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flint</hi> (said to be derived from a corruption of the
                    documentary term “Castellum apud Fluentum” into “Apud le Flynt”) is the capital
                    and sole corporate town of the county, a seaport and contributory borough, 173
                    miles from London, on the south of the Dee estuary, between the sea and the
                    hills inland. It has some good houses, and has recovered its decadence of twenty
                    years ago since the establishment of vast chemical works, which make it the seat
                    of great alkali manufactures, by Messrs Muspratt Brothers, Huntley, and others.
                    Its chief imports are sulphur and other chemicals; its exports coal, soda,
                    potash, copper, and various chemical products. The church is not remarkable; but
                    there are good parochial schools and several nonconformist chapels. The footways
                    of the town are flagged, and there are other street improvements. Until five
                    years ago the county jail occupied (as at Haverfordwest) an angle of the
                    Edwardian Castle on the edge of the estuary; it was then removed to Mold—where,
                    however, the new and costly jail has been closed by the New Prisons Act, and
                    Flintshire prisoners are now sent to Chester Castle. The old Flint jail has been
                    bought by the Messrs Muspratt, and turned to good use as a “working men’s club.”
                    It was in Flint Castle that Percy betrayed Richard II. to Bυlingbroke in 1399.
                    In 1643 it surrendered to the Roundheads, and four years later was dismantled.
                    Its constable is still appointed by the crown, with duties limited since the
                    Municipal Corporations Reforms Act to the care of the ruins,—a square court with
                    towers at the angles abutting the sea, and a massive round tower with a
                    drawbridge. Flint was made a borough by Edward I., and chartered by Edward III.
                    and Edward the Black Prince, as earl of Chester. Since the Reform Act it is
                    governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen, and 12 councillors. It is the nomination place
                    for the group of contributory boroughs, viz., Flint, Caergwyrle, Caerwys,
                    Overton, Rhuddlan, which with St Asaph, Holywell, and Rhyl returns one member of
                    parliament. In 1871 the population of Flint was 4269, as against 3296 in
                    1851.</p>

                    great locale of county business. Its restored church of the early 16th century
                    is one of the finest in the diocese; and the Bailey Hill is the site of an
                    ancient fortress stormed in 1144 and in 1322. The population of Mold is 12,237

                    Estyn, near Caergwyrle; and Overton, in the detached part of Flint. Bodfary
                    retains the tradition of Roman occupation. There is a fortified British post at

                <p>The history and antiquities of Flintshire are of some im portance. Maes-y-Garmon,
                    a mile from Mold, is the scene of the bloodless victory of the Britons under

                    >a,d.,</hi> remembered as the “Alleluia victory.” Bangor Iscoed, “the great high
                    choir in Maelor,” preserves the site of the monastery suddenly and totally
                    destroyed with more than 2000 monks by Ethelfred of Northumberland in 607.
                    Watt’s Dyke and Offa’sDyke—supposed to have run, the former from the coast near
                    Basingwerk, past Halkin, Hope, and the Alyn gorge, towards Oswestry, and the
                    latter from Prestatyn southward towards Mold, Minera, and across the Severn over
                    the Long Mountain—perpetuate the names, one of a local hero, the other of a
                    great Mercian ruler. At Cynsyllt, or Coleshill, is the scene of a second defeat
                    of Henry II. by 0wain Gwynedd about a mile from Flint, the first having been at
                    Coed Ewloe, where a lone tower remains to recall the tale. Tumuli, maenhirs, and
                    inscribed stones are frequent in Flintshire, the most remarkable of the last
                    being the “Maen Achwynfan” of the 9th to 12th century near Pantasa, and the
                    14th-century cross in Newmarket churchyard. Most of the Flint castles are
                    Edwardian, that at Caergwyrle bespeaking an earlier Roman and even British
                    occupation.</p>
