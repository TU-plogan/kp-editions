                    sour, grape juice passes into wine, wine into vinegar, vinegar into a foul
                    insipid fluid—without the application or addition from without of any agent or
                    reagent; but the “spontaneity” in the eyes of the chemical investigator does not
                    go far. All chemical reactions are spontaneous; and wherever a ease occurs of
                    two things acting upon each other, it makes <hi rend="italic">no</hi> difference
                    whether one of them be added, say, to the solution of the other from a bottle,
                    or whether it were present in the liquid from the first. What caused chemists to
                    group together fermentative changes as a class of phenomena different from
                    ordinary reactions was the fact that wherever they succeeded in reducing the
                    phenomena to a degree of simplicity sufficient for translating the respective
                    reaction into an equation, this equation, though perfectly correct in <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0101-0092"/> the sense of chemical arithmetic, appeared to
                    assert something which ran contrary to the known chemical tendencies of the
                    substances concerned. To explain this by an example, let us take the case of the
                    souring of milk, a fermentation which, when stripped of what, from the purely
                    chemical standpoint, would appear unessential, involves only one reaction, which
                    consists in this, that the milk sugar of the milk, by a mere rearrangement of
                    its ultimate ingredients, passes into lactic acid, according to the equation C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 22</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 11</hi>.H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = 4C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>.</p>
                <p>Milk Sugar. Lactic Acid.</p>
                <p>Now, this in itself is nothing exceptional. A solution of cyanate of ammonia
                    (NCOH.NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) is no sooner prepared than it passes into
                    one of urea <hi rend="smallcaps">CO(NH</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps">
                    2</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">)</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">j</hi> cyanic acid, (NCHO) when left to itself, soon passes
                    into cyamelide, just as the milk sugar of the milk passes into lactic acid. But
                    there is this great difference, that this latter change cannot be realized,
                    under any known set of conditions, in a solution of pure milk sugar in pure
                    water. And so it is in all other analogous cases. But this comes to the same as
                    saying that fermentations, as a class of chemical reactions, are
                    characteristically <hi rend="italic">non-spontaneous,</hi> and consequently must
                    be caused by reagents, although these reagents have no place in the mere
                    balance-sheet of the reaction. In fact, experience shows that no fermentable
                    chemical species will ferment except in presence of water, and unless it be kept
                    by means of that water in direct contact with some specific “ferment,” which,
                    although it contributes nothing to the substance of the products which figure in
                    the equation, nevertheless induces the reaction “by its presence,” as the phrase
                    goes. The presence alone, of course, will not do. It is simply inconceivable
                    that a reagent should act chemically unless it were itself in a state of
                    chemical change, although this change may be (and with some ferments probably
                    is) a cycle of changes which always brings back the reagent to its original
                    condition.</p>
                <p>Of all the multitude of chemical processes which fall under our heading, vinous
                    fermentation is the one which is by far the best known and most satisfactorily
                    explained; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the present science of
                    the whole subject has been evolved from the study of that particular case. Hence
                    the best course that we can adopt in this article is to begin with a popular
                    exposition of the growth of our knowledge of vinous fermentation, which may
                    familiarize even the general reader with the main points of the whole subject,
                    and then to append a short epitome of the facts concerning the more important of
                    the different fermentative changes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vinous fermentation</hi> means that peculiar change which all
                    native sacchariferous juices are liable to undergo when left to themselves at
                    the ordinary temperature, and which results in the formation of some kind of
                    “wine.” The general course of the phenomena being the same in all cases, we
                    shall assume in what follows that it is grape juice we have to deal with. Such
                    juice, as is well known, when recently prepared, forms an intensely sweet
                    yellowish liquid, which, if it is not so by nature, may be rendered perfectly
                    limpid and transparent by filtration through bibulous paper. Grape juice when
                    left to itself, after having been thus clarified, may remain unchanged for an
                    indefinite time, but when mixed with ever so little of unfiltered juice, it is
                    sure sooner or later to undergo a change, which manifests itself in the
                    appearance of a turbidity in the liquid. This turbidity is owing to two causes,
                    namely, (1) the evolution of carbonic acid, and (2) the formation within the
                    liquid of a finely-divided solid, which, through the gas-evolution, is partly
                    kept in suspension, partly thrown up to the surface as a scum, and which is
                    known by the name of “yeast.” The process, from an almost imperceptible
                    beginning, gradually develops into a more and more vivid effervescence (which
                    not unfrequently assumes the character of a violent ebullition), the yeast at
                    the same time becoming more and more abundant; and when a sufficient quantity of
                    “must” is operated on, the temperature of the fermenting mass soon rises
                    perceptibly beyond that of the surrounding air. Sooner or later of course the
                    reaction reaches a climax, from which onwards it gradually loses in intensity
                    until at last it dies out. The yeast then settles down as a slimy deposit, above
                    which there is left a clear yellow liquid, which, instead of the originally
                    sweet, now has a “vinous” taste, and is endowed with that well-known
                    physiological action characteristic of “fermented liquors.” Chemically the
                    change in the nature of the liquid consists substantially in this, that the
                    sugar has mostly or perhaps wholly disappeared, and given place to a
                    corresponding percentage of a volatile inflammable liquid called <hi
                    rend="italic">alcohol.</hi> To any one who has a real knowledge of these facts
                    it must necessarily suggest itself as a highly probable hypothesis that it is
                    the destroyed sugar which has furnished the ingredients for the formation of the
                    carbonic acid and of the alcohol, while most persons will be inclined to look
                    upon the yeast as a bye product formed from the secondary constituents of the
                    juices.</p>
                <p>This view, which is endorsed substantially by our present knowledge of the
                    matter, one is inclined to think should have forced itself even at the earliest
                    times upon the minds all who reasoned on the process as a material
                    metamorphosis. But although now-a-days everybody looks almost instinctively upon
                    chemical reactions as nothing more than rearrangements of the ultimate
                    ingredients of the bodies concerned, which ingredients in themselves are, as a
                    matter of course, assumed to be uncreatable and indestructible, we must not
                    forget that this notion dates back only to the time of Boyle, and that is not
                    much longer than air, and gases generally, have been recognized as species of
                    weighable matter. Hence for many centuries the carbonic acid was not recognized
                    even by chemists as forming a factor in the chemical reaction; it was known only
                    as an effervescence, a phenomenon pure and simple, not as a substance. Van
                    Helmont (born in 1577) was the first to show that the gas which rises from
                    fermenting “must” is different from air, and identical with the <hi
                    rend="italic">gas</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvestre</hi> formed in the combustion
                    of charcoal and in the calcination of limestone. Long before Van Helmont’s time,
                    the “alcohol” had been recognized as a definite kind of matter. The art of
                    concentrating the intoxicating principle of wine by distillation, in fact, was
                    known and practised industrially in the 8th century; and nobody could practise
                    this art without finding out that a spirit can be strengthened by repeated
                    distillations, with elimination of water. But it was only about the 13th century
                    that chemists learned to remove all the water from spirits of wine, and thus to
                    prepare “absolute,” that is, pure alcohol.</p>
                <p>Ordinary cane sugar and honey were known to the ancients; and chemists from the
                    earliest times took it for granted that these two substances and the sweet
                    principles in fruit juices must be closely related to one another. It is also an
                    old experience that cane sugar or honey when added to grape juice ferments with
                    the sugar originally present in the latter. But the idea that the differences
                    between the several kinds of sugar are owing to the existence of a number of
                    distinct chemical species is comparatively new, and it is only in the course of
                    the present century that the problem of isolating these several species has been
                    satisfactorily solved.</p>
                <p>But to return to our proposition; plausible as it is as an hypothesis, to be able
                    to test even its potential correctness, we must know the weights of alcohol and
                    carbonic acid produced in the fermentation of a given weight of sugar, and know
                    also the quantitative elementary compositions of the three substances. Lavoisier

                    not reasonably have been attempted by anybody before him, as it is he to whom we
                    owe our knowledge of the qualitative elementary composition of the substances
                    concerned, and indeed of organic substances generally.</p>
                <p>Before giving his numbers, it may be stated that he regarded acetic acid (a small
                    quantity of which is present in most wines) as, like alcohol and carbonic acid,
                    a constant product of vinous fermentation. According to Lavoisier, 95 <hi

                <p>From these numbers Lavoisier concluded (and he was quite justified in doing so,
                    considering the imperfections of his methods of analysis) that sugar in
                    fermenting simply breaks up into these three substances, without any access of
                    matter from without. But if he thus managed to arrive at what we now know to be
                    a substantially correct conclusion, this can be credited to him (if at all) only
                    as a happy stroke of divinatory genius, as his numbers are all of them
                    monstrously incorrect, the errors going far beyond what even, with his
                    necessarily imperfect method, could be tolerated as “observational errors.”
                    Lavoisier’s numbers were subsequently corrected by Gay-Lussac according to his
                    own analyses of sugar, alcohol, and carbonic acid. His results, which have
                    remained unimpugned to the present day, may be stated, with substantial

                <p>The agreement being by no means satisfactory, Gay-Lussac suspected that his
                    analyses of sugar were infected with unobserved errors, and he corrected his
                    figures so as to make them agree with those given above opposite to “Sums.”
                    These values, when measured by the customary units (namely C for twelve parts of
                    carbon, H for one part of hydrogen, O for sixteen parts of oxygen), assign to
                    sugar the very simple formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> leading to an equally

                <p>This equation is still looked upon as substantially correct, though not in
                    Gay-Lussac’s sense. It is so, if by sugar we understand either of the tw o kinds
                    of “glucose” which form the bulk of the sweetening principles in fruit juices,
                    and which are composed according to the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H

                    analysis, which, as is easily seen, corresponde to the formula C <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O means the elements of 18 parts of water; and these 18
                    parts of water, as Dumas and Boullay showed, actually are taken up in the
                    fermentation of C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2θ</hi>

                <p>Gay-Lussac’s equation being, as we said, only substantially correct, we must now
                    state the qualifications implied. Schmidt of Dorpat found in 1847 that vinous
                    fermentation always results in the formation of small quantities of succinic
                    acid. Guerin Vary showed, by quantitative experiments, that in the fermentation
                    of glucose the alcohol and carbonic acid produced account only for about 96 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 per cent, of the glucose. And the present writer
                    happens to know that a certain German apothecary made the interesting discovery
                    that wines, beside the unfermented remnant of glucose that may be left, may
                    contain an unfermentable sweet principle which he recognized as glycerine. These
                    observations, however, were little heeded until Pasteur, in a now classical
                    memoir, proved that glycerine and succinic acid are constant products of normal
                    vinous fermentation, the correct balance sheet of the reaction, according to
                    him, being as follows :—100 parte of cane sugar, in fermenting, pass into 105 ’
                    4 parte of glucose, which then break up, yielding (approximately) of</p>

                <p>But even this is not quite an exhaustive statement, a small portion of the sugar
                    always passing into the form of higher alcohols (“fusel-oil”) and compound
                    ethers.</p>
                <p>Vinous fermentation, then, is a far more complex reaction than Gay-Lussac
                    imagined; but it still remains true that all the products formed are derived
                    from the dissociation of the sugar. What is it that brings about this singular
                    decomposition! We call it a singular reaction, because it is one which sugar has
                    never been seen to undergo when subjected by itself or as an aqueous solution to
                    the action of heat or electricity or any ordinary reagent. And we have
                    theoretical grounds for presuming that the reaction is not likely ever to be
                    realized by some “reagent” that has not yet been tried. According to many
                    experiences, an arithmetically possible reaction is the more likely to be
                    realized the greater the heat evolution which, supposing it were realized, it
                    would involve. Now, the reaction formulated in Gay-Lussac’s equation C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">

                    <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O, as Professor Dewar pointed out some years ago,
                    supposing dry sugar could be made thus to split up, would yield only an
                    insignificant amount of heat, if any. Actual fermentation does involve a
                    liberation of heat, as we know, but the quantity of heat per unit weight of
                    sugar destroyed, according to Dewar’s experiments, amounts only to about 83
                    heat-units, which can be accounted for as being produced by the hydration of the
                    alcohol formed, and, at any rate, is too small to characterize the decomposition
                    of sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol as being at all of itself a probable
                    reaction. Even the somewhat higher result previously arrived at by Dubrunfaut,
                    namely, 135 heat-units per unit of sugar, cannot affect this conclusion. Before
                    going further let us take an exact survey, from the chemical standpoint, of the
                    conditions which are known to favour or impede the actual process.</p>
                <p>(1.) Pure solutions of cane sugar or glucose do not ferment under any
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>(2. ) Many kinds of impure sugar solutions, such as grape juice, brewers’ wort,
                    &amp;c., do ferment. The range of temperatures most favourable to this process
                    lies between about 20* and 24* C. (or 68° and 75° F. ). But even grape juice
                    does not ferment at temperatures lying too close to the freezing-point, nor does
                    it fermentat temperatures exceeding a certain limit, which lies at about 60° C.
                    (140 <hi rend="superscript"> δ</hi> F.). The most lively fermentation comes to a
                    stop when the liquid is boiled, and, after cooling, it takes a longer or shorter
                    time before it resumes.</p>
                <p>(3.) Grape juice which has been strengthened by evaporation or addition of sugar
                    from without, does not ferment, when the ratio of water to sugar falls below a
                    certain limit-value.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0103-0094"/>
                <p>(4.) Fermentation is impeded and may be entirely stopped by addition of alcohol.
                    Hence the wines produced from the rich juices of southern grapes always contain
                    unfermented sugar.</p>
                <p>(5.) Fermentation may be stopped more or less completely by addition to the
                    liquid of even small quantities of certain reagents called antiseptics. Of these
                    corrosive sublimate (and many other heavy metallic salts), sulphuric acid,
                    sulphurous acid, bisulphide of carbon, and carbolic acid may be mentioned as
                    examples.</p>
                <p>(6.) Perfectly pure grape juice does not ferment, unless the process has been
                    started by at least temporary contact with ordinary air. This cardinal fact was
                    discovered by Gay-Lussac in a now classical series of experiments. He caused
                    clean grapes to ascend through the mercury of a large barometer into the
                    Toricellian vacuum, where he crushed them by means of the mercurial column. The
                    juice thus produced and preserved remained unchanged; but the addition to it of
                    ever so small an air-bell (as a rule) induced fermentation, which, when once
                    started, was always found to take care of itself.</p>
                <p>(7.) Ordinary vinous fermentation always involves the formation of yeast. This is
                    the most important of positive facts made out.</p>
                <p>(8.) The rate at which a fermentation progresses is (in a limited sense)
                    determined by the quantity of yeast present within the liquid.</p>
                <p>(9.) Spontaneous fermentation of grape juice is always slow in beginning;
                    addition of yeast from without starts it immediately.</p>
                <p>From these facts it is legitimate to conclude that it is the yeast or some
                    constituent of the yeast which somehow or other causes the sugar to break up
                    into alcohol, carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic acid. But what is the
                    rationale of the action? Chemically speaking, it would appear to be vain to
                    attempt an answer without first knowing what yeast is made of in the chemical
                    sense. Unfortunately the present state of our knowledge on this point is very
                    unsatisfactory. All we know is that yeast is a highly complex mixture of
                    chemical substances which may be arranged under the four heads of—(1) fats
                    (forming about 2 per cent, of the whole); (2) cellulose (about 18 per cent.);
                    (3) nitrogenous substances more or less closely allied to white of egg, some of
                    them soluble, some insoluble in water (about 60 per cent.); (4) incombustible
                    salts, which, when the yeast is burned, remain as “ash” (about 7 per cent.).
                    According to Mitscherlich’s analysis, yeast-ash consists mainly of phosphoric
                    acid (54 to 59 per cent.), united with potash (28 to 40 per cent.), magnesia (6
                    to 8 per cent.), and lime (1 to 4 per cent ). That such a complex mixture should
                    act, chemically, as a whole cannot reasonably be assumed; chemists, accordingly,
                    have always been unanimous in thinking that it is some one constituent or set of
                    constituents of the yeast which constitutes the characteristic reagent in vinous
                    fermentation; but none of them has succeeded in isolating that reagent. The only
                    clue in this respect which we have is an important discovery of Mitscherlich’s,
                    who showed that an aqueous extract of yeast, although capable of converting
                    cane-sugar into glucose, does not induce fermentation in the glucose formed,
                    whence it at once follows that the ferment must be sought for amongst the
                    insoluble portion of the yeast.</p>
                <p>Their non-success in isolating the vinous ferment did not prevent chemists from
                    speculating on its mode of action. Berzelius gave it as his opinion (which was
                    adopted by Mitscherlich and others of the leading chemists) that the action was
                    a purely “catalytic” one. What he meant by this is best explained by an example.
                    Peroxide of hydrogen (a compound of the elements of water and oxygen) is
                    perfectly stable at ordinary temperatures. Add to it a mere speck of platinum
                    black (a peculiar form of finely divided platinum), and it at once breaks up
                    into water and oxygen, the platinum which caused the decomposition remaining
                    unchanged. In an exactly similar manner Berzelius thought the yeast acted upon
                    the sugar, and caused it to break up into alcohol and carbonic acid. The merit
                    of the idea was that it apparently reduced the explanation of a seemingly
                    complex to that of an undoubtedly simpler phenomenon. But unfortunately neither
                    Berzelius nor any of his followers succeeded in proving the objective existence
                    of the analogy by experimental evidence. Hence Berzelius’s theory really
                    amounted to no more than showing that vinous fermentation and the “catalytic”
                    reactions of inorganic chemistry were both unexplained phenomena.</p>
                <p>Something far more worthy of the name of a theory had been offered 200 years
                    before by Stahl. The originator of the phlogiston theory justly divined that
                    vinous fermentation and putrefaction are phenomena of the same order, and,
                    starting from the well-known infectious nature of the latter, explained both as
                    disturbances in the “molecules” of the fermenting body, brought about by a
                    pre-existing molecular motion. “Ein Körper der in der Faulung begriffen ist
                    bringet in einem anderen von der Faulung annoch befreiten sehr leichtlich die
                    Verderbung zu Wege, ja es kann ein solcher, bereits in innerer Bewegung
                    begriffener Körper einen anderen annoch ruhigen, jedoch zu sothaner Bewegung
                    geneigten sehr leicht in eine solche innere Bewegung hineinreissen.”</p>
                <p>These ideas of Stahl’s, at the time of Berzelius’s catalytic theory, had long
                    been forgotten, and they remained lost to science until they were revived and
                    brought into a more definite form by Justus Liebig, who, in a powerful and
                    comprehensive memoir on fermentative changes, which he published in 1848, used
                    them as the basis of a new theory of these phenomena, which justly attracted
                    universal attention, as it—or rather the wonderfully lucid memoir which embodied
                    it—exhibited the subject in a clearer light than anything else that had been
                    said or written on it before. With Liebig as with Stahl, all “fermentations” and
                    “putrefactions” are analogous phenomena. Putrefactions are owing mainly, to the
                    inherent instability of the albuminoid constituents of the respective substances
                    in presence of water. So unstable are these albuminoids that even an incipient
                    oxidation (see Gay-Lussac’s experiment) may suffice to disturb their chemical
                    equilibrium to such an extent as to cause the whole of the atoms of the mass to
                    gradually rearrange themselves into new products of lesser complexity and
                    consequently higher stability. The decomposition when once started, readily
                    propagates itself through the whole mass, aided as it is by the inherent
                    tendency of the molecule to pass into more highly stable forms, just as a stone
                    which rolls down a hill and strikes other stones on its way causes them to roll
                    down likewise. This is so clear and plausible as almost to command assent. It is
                    less easy to agree with Liebig when he tries to explain fermentation, when he
                    says, for instance, that the sugar in grape juice, although not naturally
                    gravitating towards a rearrangement as alcohol plus carbonic acid, is
                    nevertheless caused to undergo this change by its immediate contact with the
                    albuminoids of the juice or yeast, which are in a state of atomic commotion; and
                    it is still less easy to see how such an atomic revolution could progress from
                    sugar to sugar, as he says it may. That the nitrogenous matters of the juice, in
                    all ordinary cases of vinous fermentation, assume the form of yeast, is,
                    according to Liebig, a purely accidental phenomenon, and, if yeast is so
                    characteristically powerful as a ferment, it is so only through its consisting
                    largely of exceptionally unstable albuminoid substances.</p>
                <p>Liebig’s ideas, more perhaps through the brilliancy of his mode of exposition
                    than the force of his arguments, took firm hold of the scientific mind of the
                    time; amongst chemists at least the general impression was, and it prevailed for
                    a considerable time, that Liebig’s theory in a satisfactory manner summed up the
                    whole of the empirical knowledge of the subject—although it totally ignored at
                    least one most important feature in the phenomena which had been brought out and
                    firmly established by Schwann and Cagniard-Latour.</p>
                <p>In 1680 a Dutch philosopher, Leuwenhoek, fell upon examining yeast under the
                    microscope, and found it to con-εist<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0104-0095"/> of minute globular or ovoid particles.
                    Microscopes in his time were very imperfect or he would have made a great
                    discovery. Schwann and Cagniard-Latour, who (about 1838, and independently of
                    each other) resumed the old Dutchman’s inquiry, used the better instruments of
                    their time, and discovered that Leuwenhock’s globules are membranous bags, which
                    exhibit all the morphologic characteristics of vegetable cells, and, like these,
                    when brought under the proper conditions, increase and multiply in the biologic
                    sense. Taking this together with the long known fact that in vinous fermentation
                    the yeast increases as the process progresses, they naturally concluded that
                    yeast is a species of plant, and that it is the life of that plant which somehow
                    or other causes the chemical change. It is the special merit of Schwann to have
                    adduced powerful experimental evidence in favour of this view. In his case, the
                    observations on yeast were incidental only to a more comprehensive
                    investigation, the original aim of which had been to solve the great question of
                    spontaneous generation. Processes of putrefaction having long been known to be
                    invariably accompanied by the formation of vibriones and other microscopic
                    organisms endowed with voluntary motion, he prepared infusions of flesh and
                    other putrescible matters in glass flasks, and, after having hermetically closed
                    these, exposed them for a time to the heat of boiling water, so as to destroy
                    every trace of living germs that might be present. The contents, when preserved
                    in that condition for ever so long, showed no sign of putrefaction or of life of
                    any kind. But when exposed to the air they did putrefy, and soon swarmed with
                    living organisms of various kinds. Obviously it was the air which caused this
                    two-fold change. But then the air which had been shut up with the infusions did
                    not act. This, however, might have been owing to an absorption of the oxygen by
                    the juices. Schwann therefore, in another set of experiments, allowed the boiled
                    (and consequently germless) infusions to communicate freely with the atmosphere,
                    in such a manner, however, that no particle of air could enter the flasks
                    without having first passed through a red-hot glass tube, and thus been freed
                    from any germs that might float about in it. In this case the air had fair play
                    in a chemical sense, but yet, not only did no life of any kind make its
                    appearance, but even the chemical changes failed to set in. Exactly similar
                    results were obtained by Schwann in experiments with grape juice, whether
                    previously mixed or not with yeast. Gay-Lussac’s famous experiment failed when
                    the air-bell, before being admitted to the juice, had been heated, and thus
                    freed from living germs. In a few of these experiments, it is true, the results
                    were contradictory to the general evidence afforded by the rest of the work. But
                    Schwann had no doubt in his mind about the close analogy between vinous
                    fermentation and putrefaction; and as the putrefaction experiments had all given
                    one and the same answer, he explained these anomalies as having been caused by
                    unobserved slips in the respective experiments, and did not admit them to
                    invalidate his general proposition that both putrefaction and fermentation are
                    inseparably connected with characteristic biologic phenomena;—the less so, as
                    his experiments on the action of certain antiseptics had shown that what is an
                    “antiseptic” to a fermentative change is a poison to the organisms
                    characteristic of the case. Thus, for instance, he found that white arsenic<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Schützenberger,
                    who, however, does not quote his authority, arsenious acid does not impale
                    vinous fermentation.</p></note> and corrosive sublimate, being poisonous to both
                    plants and animals, stop both putrefaction and fermentation; while extract of
                    nux vomica, being destructive of animal but not of vegetable life, prevents
                    putrefaction, but does not interfere with vinous fermentation? The mechanism of
                    the latter process he imagined to consist probably in this, that the
                    “sugar-fungus* (the yeast) lives at the expense of the nitrogenous matters and
                    of the sugar of the juice, and that those of the elements of these substances
                    which the plant does not assimilate are eliminated chiefly as alcohol. This
                    special theory of Schwann’s, as the reader is aware, is not quite correct, but
                    it does not affect his general views on the phenomenon, which were fully
                    confirmed by subsequent investigators. Amongst these we may mention Helmholtz,
                    who showed that oxygen evolved by electrolysis from water does not, like air,
                    induce vinous fermentation. The same observer showed that boiled grape juice,
                    when tied up in a bladder, does not ferment, even when suspended within a tub
                    full of fermenting juice. The evidence afforded by this experiment was
                    considerably strengthened by Mitscherlich, who proved that even a septum of
                    filter paper effectually stops the propagation of the reaction. More striking
                    still is an experiment which was made, many years later, by H. Hoffmann. He took
                    a tes't-tube full of sugar water, and by a plug of cotton wool inserted within
                    it divided the liquid into two parts. To the upper part he added yeast, which of
                    course induced fermentation there; but the change did not propagate itself
                    through the cotton wool to the lower portion. The same material had done good
                    service some years before in the hands of Schröder and Dusch, who proved in
                    1854, by a most extensive series of experiments, that the something in air which
                    enables it to start fermentative changes in boiled infusions of meat or malt, in
                    grape juice, Ac., can be effectually removed by filtration of the air through
                    cotton wool. It is true the “&amp;c.” here does not include milk, which they
                    found to turn sour in filtered as well as in ordinary air, but this exception
                    was subsequently explained away by Pasteur, who found that germe immersed in
                    alkaline liquids may survive temperatures considerably higher than 100° C.</p>
                <p>A number of other important researches, which led to substantially similar
                    results, must be passed over here, and may be, because what we have quoted has
                    never been disproved, and is consequently quite sufficient to show that, in the
                    case of vinous fermentation and putrefaction at any rate, those atomic motions,
                    which, according to Liebig, cause the disintegration of the fermenting
                    substances,—if the notion is to be maintained at all,—cannot be admitted to have
                    an existence outside the living bodies of certain organisms characteristic of
                    the respective changes. To any unprejudiced person this would appear to be sound
                    logic; but Liebig did not see it, and for a long time he had the majority of
                    chemists at least on his side. No reasonable person could have denied the
                    irresistible force of the arguments of Schwann and his followers; but these
                    chemists somehow or other managed to ignore the facts, until Pasteur, by means
                    of a most thorough and extensive experimental research (of which the principal
                    portions were published from 1857 to 1861), simply forced the attention of
                    everybody to the physiological side of the subject, and, by absolutely
                    unimpeachable evidence, proved that Schwann’s views are substantially correct.
                    Of this investigation it is impossible to speak otherwise than in terms of the
                    highest admiration. Even the purely critical portion of Pasteur’s work would be
                    enough to immortalize his name. He did the whole of the work of Schwann and the
                    rest of his predecessors over again, modifying and perfecting the experimental
                    methods, so as to silence any objection or doubt that might possibly be raised,
                    repeating and multiplying his experiments until every proposition was firmly
                    established. But his work was synthetical as well as analytical. Some of his
                    discoveries will be noticed below; suffice it here to mention one of the general
                    results which he arrived at. Vinous fermentation is only one of a number of
                    fermentative changes to which sugar is liable. The same substance sugar, which,
                    when placed under certain conditions, breaks <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0105-0096"/> up into alcohol and carbonic acid, under certain
                    other sets of conditions ferments into lactic acid, or through lactic into
                    butyric acid, or into gum plus mannite. This has long been known. What Pasteur
                    showed is that each of these changes is the exclusive function of a certain
                    species (or at least genus) of organism. What the yeast plant is for vinous a
                    certain other organism is for lactic, a third for mannitic, a fourth for butyric
                    fermentation. No two of these species, even if they belong to the same genus,
                    will ever pass into each other. Pasteur arrived at this great generalization by
                    means of his invention of an ingenious method for cultivating pure growths of
                    the several species, so that each of them could be examined separately for its
                    chemical functions. To explain the method, let us suppose we wanted an unmixed
                    growth of the species of yeast-plant called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saccharomyces</hi><hi rend="italic">cerevisioe.</hi> The first step of course
                    is to procure a specimen of yeast which, when examined under the microscope,
                    proves a fair approximation to what is wanted. This being done, we place a
                    quantity of brewers’ wort in a flask provided with two necks, one long and very
                    narrow and bent like a gas-evolution tube, the other short and wide like the
                    tubulus of a retort. We boil the wort in the flask to kill the germs, and during
                    the boiling close first the tubulus by means of a (germless) glass stopper, then
                    the narrow tube by means of a previously ignited plug of asbestos. We now allow
                    the flask to cool down slowly, and by exposing it for several days to the proper
                    temperature make sure that there is no potential life in our medium. We then, by
                    means of a thin platinum wire, introduce a speck of the yeast through the
                    tubulus, which, of course, is stopped up again without delay. We then place the
                    flask in a chamber kept at the particular temperature which is most favourable
                    to the development of “Saccharomyces.” The saccharomyces-cells, being in the
                    majority and enjoying a position of advantage, will multiply at a greater rate
                    than the foreign cells, of which many in fact will go to the wall, so that what
                    we ultimately obtain is a closer approximation to pure Saccharomyces than the
                    speck of yeast which we used as seed, and which, in general, was already a
                    little better (in all probability) than the bulk of the yeast it came from. Of
                    the relatively pure yeast we now again take a speck and sow it in a fresh supply
                    of germless wort, and so on until the foreign cells can be assumed to be
                    “Darwinized” out of existence. This method of Pasteur’s, apart from its
                    scientific value, is of the greatest practical importance; supposing it to be
                    carried out on a large scale—which, in fact, has been done with some measure of
                    success—it will enable the brewer to grow and use pure Saccharomyces, and thus
                    to avoid all the many “diseases” which beer, as brewed with ordinary yeast, is
                    liable to.</p>
                <p>After Pasteur’s researches it became impossible not to admit that those
                    fermentative changes which he investigates are, at least in a practical sense,
                    physiological and not purely chemical phenomena; but there appears to be no
                    necessity for assuming, as many do, that it is the life of those minute
                    organisms, gwαlife, which directly causes the phenomena. It seems far more
                    rational and philosophic to adopt the view taken by Berthelot and Hoppe-Seyler,
                    who go no further than to admit that those living organisms are the only known
                    sources for the ferments proper, which in themselves are chemical substances
                    pure and simple.</p>
                <p>Proceeding now to give a short account of the different fermentative changes, we
                    begin with those that are proved to be functions of purely chemical
                    reagents.</p>

                <p>Many other “glucosides” (native substances containing potential glucose) behave

                    understood; pending exact investigations, they may be explained, according to
                    Lyon Playfair, by a tendency of the acid to combine with the elements of one of
                    the products, which tendency, although sufficient to sever these elements from
                    the rest, is defeated ultimately by the stability of the compound formed by
                    their union with one another.</p>

                    germination of grain (in malting), and which has the power of converting many

                    the presence of water at about 66° C. Diastase has not yet been isolated in the

                    The common idea that bitter almonds contain prussic acid is erroneous; that
                    acid, like the benzaldehyde, is present only potentially, viz., as amygdaline,
                    which, when the almond meal is treated with water, undergoes the above
                    fermentative change. Many other glucosides are decomposed by emulsine, as they
                    are by dilute acids. It may be said, in passing, that the acrid volatile oil
                    contained in table-mustard is not found ready formed in the mustard seed, but is
                    produced from a constituent of the seed by a fermentative action closely
                    analogous to that we have just been explaining.</p>

                    an aqueous extract of yeast, though devoid of the power of inducing vinous
                    fermentation, converts cane sugar into dextrose and levulose. The ferment, as
                    Berthelot showed, can be precipitated from the liquid, in an impure state, by
                    addition of alcohol.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Pepsine.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Stomach digestion (in
                    man and animals nearly related to man) consists mainly in this that the gastric
                    juice dissolves the albuminoids of the food, as hydrochlorates of peptones, the
                    only form, it seems, in which they can be assimilated by the system. The juice
                    owes this power to the presence in it of small percentages of two things,
                    namely, of free hydrochloric acid and of “pepsine,” both of which are
                    continuously produced by the mucous membrane. Beal pepsine has never been seen;
                    but an impure substance, possessing the specific properties of the ferment, can
                    be extracted from the mucous membrane of the stomach by a laborious process
                    which we have no space to describe. Highly dilute hydrochloric acid alone
                    dissolves certain albuminoids, but it does not convert them into peptones; it
                    acquires this property by the addition to it of a small quantity of the
                    preparation named. It is as well to state in passing, that the so-called pepsine
                    of the pharmaceutist is only a very poor apology for even the pepsine of the
                    physiological chemist.</p>

                    pancreatine is to the secretion of the pancreas gland, whose function it is to

                    include three ferments, namely, a kind of diastase (see above), a ferment
                    similar in its functions to pepsine, and a ferment which has the power of
                    converting fats into fatty acids and glycerine. None of these has been

                <p>L <hi rend="italic">Vinous Fermentation.—</hi> This case having already been
                    considered, we confine ourselves here to a few additions and qualifications.
                    Vinous fermentation, as we see it going on in the brewers’ vats and in the
                    wine-producers’ casks, is a function of <hi rend="italic">Saccharomyces,</hi> a
                    genus of fungi, consisting of minute cells, which sometimes are isolated from
                    one another, sometimes grouped together in a variety of forms, but never united
                    into an organized tissue. There is a variety of species, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">S. cercvisiae</hi> (the main constituent of ordinary yeast, as
                    produced in the high fermentation of beer) is the most important. It consists of
                    cells of about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi>
                    millimetre diameter. According to Pasteur, saccharomyces thrives best when
                    immersed in grape juice or wort, or similar liquids. It multiplies only by
                    budding, never by sporification. In pure sugar-water it lives, so to say, at its
                    own expense, and gradually becomes exhausted; but on addition of phosphates
                    (yeast-ash works best) and ammonia salt to the sugar, the plant thrives as well
                    almost as in native sugar juices. When saccharomyces is not fully immersed in
                    the liquor, and otherwise constrained to live under abnormal conditions, it
                    passes into “aerobiotic” forms which are similar to mucors and mucedos (mould
                    plants), and which, like these, live on atmospheric oxygen. But these abnormal
                    forms, when reimmersed in wort, &amp;c., always relapse into the non-aerobiotic
                    form of saccharomyces. Real mucedos, &amp;c., for instance <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mycoderrna vini</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eerevisiae,</hi> which by nature are
                    aerobiotic, when immersed in wort or grape juice, and thus placed in what to
                    them is an abnormal condition, assume non-aerobiotic forms, and produce vinous
                    fermentation, but (contrary to what was formerly assumed by Pasteur himself)
                    they are never converted into saccharomyces, and their fermentative power soon
                    comes to an end, unless they are occasionally revived by re-exposure to the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The power of inducing vinous fermentation, however, is by no means confined to
                    microscopic organisms. It has long been known, from the experiments of
                    Döbereiner and others, that sweet fruit, when kept within an inert atmosphere
                    devoid of free oxygen, evolves carbonic acid with formation of alcohol, and it
                    has been proved by Pasteur that this fermentation, which may extend to a
                    considerable portion of the sugar present, is not accompanied by the development
                    of any microscopic species. Closely related to this fact is the well-established
                    experience that large quantities of sugar may be made to ferment by means of
                    yeast without the latter multiplying to any noteworthy extent. On the other
                    hand, large growths of yeast may be obtained (and as a matter of fact are
                    obtained every day by the makers of German barm) without producing much alcohol.
                    Oskar Brefeld, by means of a peculiar artifice, succeeded in growing
                    saccharomyces in brewers’ wort, -without producing a trace of alcohol. From
                    these experiences we must conclude that vinous fermentation, fax from being the
                    characteristic lite-function of healthy saccharomyces, is dependent on a certain
                    pathologic condition of “non-photobiotic” plant-cells <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> cells which habitually live in darkness) generally, which is
                    brought about by immersing them in sacchariferous fluids and shutting them out
                    from the oxygen-gas which they need for their healthy development. Hence, even
                    in the ordinary cases of fermentation, the normal life of the yeast-plant on the
                    one hand, and the dissociation of the sugar on the other, are not only not
                    necessarily related, but, in the individual cell, positively exclude each other.
                    In any given mass of yeast, healthy cells and diseased cells are in general
                    mixed up together, and thus, in practice, the two phenomena come to be
                    accidental concomitants. But this brings us back almost precisely to the later
                    views of Liebig, as set forth in his last memoir on the subject.</p>
                <p>In regard to the genesis of the yeast plant little is known. According to
                    Pasteurs experiments and observations the yeast which forms spontaneously in
                    grape juice is derived chiefly from certain germs which abound about harvest
                    time on the grapes, and still more on the grape-stalks. These germs are largely
                    diffused also through the atmosphere of breweries, wine cellars, and
                    laboratories where fermentation experiments are carried on, but they are not by
                    any means widely diffused through the atmosphere generally.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lactic Fermentation.—</hi> Milk when left to itself in warm
                    weather, as everybody knows, soon turns sour, the main feature in the chemical
                    process being the transmutation of the milk sugar into lactic acid, as expressed
                    by the equation</p>

                    3</hi> Hydrated Milk sugar. Lactic acid.</p>
                <p>The milk sugar, before assuming the form of lactic acid, probably passes through
                    the condition of glucose. At any rate, ordinary glucose, when dissolved in milk,
                    ferments into lactic acid along with the milk sugar originally present. But in
                    this case, if the total percentage of sugar goes beyond a certain limit, the
                    reaction comes to a stop as soon as the acidity of the liquid has attained a
                    certain limit-value. Addition of chalk or carbonate of soda, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i. e.,</hi> conversion of the lactic acid into a neutral lactate, then τevives
                    the process. A. solution of “invert-sugar” (as produced by boiling cane sugar
                    water with a little vitriol), when mixed with excess of chalk and some putrid
                    cheese, and kept at 30°-35° C., soon ferments, with formation of large
                    quantities of lactate of lime (Bensch). Lactic fermentation, according to
                    Pasteur, is caused by the development in the mass of a microscopic fungus,
                    consisting of cylindrical cells which are far smaller than those of
                    saccharomyces. We are not aware that this “lactic ferment” has ever been seen in
                    ordinary sour milk; in Bensch’s process it is produced largely as a greyish
                    deposit on the chalk, from which pure growths of the fungus may be obtained by
                    Pasteur’s method (see above) The lactic ferment, to the annoyance of brewers,
                    frequently occurs in ordinary yeast as an impurity.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that that fungus which Pasteur calls <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    lactic ferment is capable of inducing lactic fermentation; but it does not by
                    any means follow that it is the thing which actually causes the souring of milk
                    under ordinary circumstances. On the contrary, from a remarkable set of
                    experiments made by Lister in 1873, tlιis appears not to be the case. According
                    to him, milk can be completely purged of germs by exposing it (within a germless
                    flask) to the temperature of boiling water for some hours, and, when protected
                    against atmospheric germs by a slightly carbolized stopper of cotton wool, keeps
                    sweet for an indefinite time. Specimens of such germless milk, when exposed to
                    the atmosphere of his study, were found by Lister to undergo a variety of
                    fermentative changes, accompanied sometimes by the development of an acid
                    reaction, but none of them set into sour milk. A specimen of ordinary unboiled
                    dairy milk when kept in the same room did get sour as usual, and, when examined
                    under the miscrosc·ope, was found to contain, not Pasteur’s fungus, but a kind
                    of motionless bacterium which Lister calls <hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lactis,</hi> because the introduction of it (or rather of a trace
                    of the sour milk containing it) into the germless milk determined normal lactic
                    fermentation, the <hi rend="italic">Bacterium</hi><hi rend="italic">lactis</hi>
                    multiplying at the same time. The same bacterium, when made topass successively
                    through germless urine and other germless organic liquids, underwent a series of
                    metamorphoses, but, when ultimately put back into milk, caused normal lactic
                    fermentation. The germs of this bacterium must be assumed to abound in the
                    atmosphere of cows’ stables and dairies, although they do not seem to be
                    abundantly diffused through the atmosphere generally.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Viscous Fermentation</hi> is a peculiar change which has
                    long been known to occasionally accompany vinous fermentation, and which
                    manifests itself in this that the wine becomes thick and viscous, so that, when
                    poured from one vessel into another, it draws into long threads. This property
                    is caused by the presence of a kind of gum (of the composition C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> I Uoθιo) which is invariably accompanied by mannite, a
                    sweet crystalline substance of the composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> (z.e. containing the

                    the reaction is not established; in fact, we do not know whether it is one
                    reaction or a set of reactions going on simultaneously. According to the usually
                    adopted equation, 100 parts of cane sugar should yield 51 of mannite, <hi
                    rend="italic">45 5</hi> of gum, and 6 of carbonic acid. According to Péligot
                    (supported by Pasteur) the “viscous ferment” is a fungus consisting of very

                <p>The temperature most favourable to the change lies near 40° C. A number of
                    similar changes (of other organic acids than lactic) are known, but they are
                    passed over here, being of a more purely scientific interest. According to
                    Pasteur, butyric fermentation is caused by the development in the mass of a
                    special kind of vibrio, a worm-shaped animalcule, consisting of a number of
                    longitudinal cells, each about 0Ό02 millimetre thick, and from 0Ό02 to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 02 mm. long. Butyric fermentation, strictly speaking,
                    is only one of a large genus of changes customarily summed up under the generic
                    name of putrefaction.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Putrefaction.—</hi> The scientific meaning of this term
                    coincides pretty much with its popular acceptation, except that it must be
                    understood to be exclusiveof all cases of oxidation. In olden times it was
                    assumed that organized matter (the tissues of plants and animals, blood
                    corpuscles, &amp;c.) could hold together even chemically only as long as
                    supported by the vital force. But this is a long exploded notion. In absolute
                    absence of water, or at very low temperatures, dead organized matter remains
                    chemically (and even structurally) unchanged. In support of this assertion we
                    need only refer to that well known case of the mammoth of the Siberian cave,
                    which was found sweet and fresh thousands of years after the extinction of life.
                    And since the time of Appert (who discovered the now so extensively used process
                    of preserving meats in sealed-up tins) we know that prolonged exposure to
                    boiling heat and subsequent absolute exclusion of air prevent putrefaction, even
                    in presence of liquid water and at the ordinary temperature, as long as the air
                    remains excluded. Chemically speaking, ordinary putrefaction is a most complex
                    phenomenon, always involving the simultaneous on-going <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0107-0098"/> of a multiplicity of chemical reactions. A
                    comparatively simple case is the putrefaction of urine, which substantially
                    consists in this that the urea, by assimilating water, passes into carbonate of
                    ammonia, just as it does when heated by itself with pure water to high
                    temperatures. In the case of animal tissues, which, broadly speaking, may be
                    said to consist of fats and albuminoids, the latter always give way first. Their
                    decomposition is a most complex set of successive reactions,—leucine, tyrosine,
                    fatty acids, and many other things appearing as primary products, ammonia,
                    compound ammonias, sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrogen, and nitrogen as secondary
                    ones. Less rapidly, but none the less constantly, the fats are changed, being
                    decomposed, in the first instance, into fatty acids and glycerine, which latter
                    undergoes further transmutations, while the former survive for a considerable
                    time. The “adipocere” which is so well known as one of the constant ultimate
                    products of the decay of dead bodies that have been kept from the air, and which
                    consists of palmitate and stearate of lime (Hoppe-Seyler), well illustrates the
                    high stability of fatty acids. Regarding the causes of putrefaction, we can
                    scarcely do more than refer to what we have quoted from the researches of
                    Schwann and his followers. From these researches two things are clear, namely,
                    (1) that putrefaction is not possible under conditions precluding the
                    development of life, or, in other words, that there is no putrefaction where
                    there is not at least potential life; and (2) that in 999 out of a thousand
                    cases this potential life assumes the actual form of bacteria and
                    vibriones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bacteria are
                    microscopic organisms, composed of two elongated cells united end to end,
                    possessed of varied powers of motion, and almost without exception “rather in
                    themselves reproductive organs” (Lister) than beings possessed of powers of
                    reproduction. The vibriones are seemingly nothing more than polymerized bacteria
                    with intensified powers of locomotion. With regard to their position in the
                    world of life present evidence leaves it uncertain whether they are plants or
                    animals.</p></note></p>
                <p>Putrefactions going on in presence of air are always accompanied by <hi
                    rend="italic">processes of oxidation,</hi> the effects of which are difficult to
                    differentiate absolutely from those of putrefaction pure and simple.</p>
                <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Cases of Oxidation.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Acetous Fermentation</hi> is the best known of these.
                    Everybody knows that weak fermented liquors, when exposed to the air, soon turn
                    sour and ultimately become vinegar. The chemical reaction involved consists of
                    two stages. In the first the alcohol in the. liquor absorbs oxygen from the air,
                    with formation of aldehyde and water, according to the equation</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> O + O - C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O JH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Alcohol. Aldehyde. water.</p>
                <p>This aldehyde, however, in ordinary acetous fermentation never actually appears,
                    being at once oxidized by the direct action of the air into acetic acid,
                    thus:</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O + 0 = C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> Aldehyde. Acetic acid.</p>
                <p>These two reactions can be realized in all their chemical simplicity, not, it is
                    true, by oxygen-gas pure and simple, but easily by oxygen as condensed on
                    platinum-black; and as the deoxidized platinum-black readily reabsorbs oxygen
                    from the air, a small quantity of this reagent suffices to oxidize large
                    quantities of alcohol into acetic acid by means of atmospheric oxygen. Upon this
                    observation of Dobereiner’s Schiitzenbach based a rapid and practical method of
                    vinegar-making, which consists in this, that the dilute alcohol is made to
                    trickle through a tower of beech-wood shavings, packed into a tall barrel,
                    constructed so as to draw in an ascending current of air. When a temperature of
                    20° C. is maintained in the room, and the spirit introduced having a temperature
                    of 26°, the temperature within the barrel is found to rise to 38°-40°, the heat
                    being produced by the rapid oxidation of the alcohol into acetic acid. What, in
                    the old method of vinegar-making, required weeks or months is thus accomplished
                    in a day or even less. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in
                    Schützenbach's process the wood-shavings, besides serving to spread the alcohol
                    over an immense surface, act exactly as the platinum-black does in Dobereiner’s
                    experiment, condensing oxygen in their pores in order to hand it over to the
                    alcohol. And, supposing this theory to be correct, the old process, which
                    consists in exposing the wine to the air in half-filleα tubs or casks, would
                    appear to rest on the same principle,—the wood of the cask acting as the
                    shavings do in Schützenbach’s process, only far more slowly. But then it is an
                    old experience of vinegar-makers that the old process at least always involves
                    the formation of two organized products, namely, that of a kind of mould which
                    appears on the surface as a membrane, and goes by the name of “flowers of
                    vinegar,” and that of a mucilaginous mass within the liquid, called “mother of
                    vinegar;” and it has always been admitted that the presence of these substances
                    materially accelerates the process of oxidation. This, however, is no
                    contradiction to the theory; it would only prove that the mouldmembrane and the
                    mucilaginous mass are more effective carriers of oxygen than the wood of the
                    tub. Besides, in Schützenbach’s process, the shavings, according to experience,
                    work the better the freer they are of from organized deposits. Hence, one might
                    say, with Liebig, that the efficacy of these substances is a function only of
                    their physical and chemical condition, the presence of life in the mould plant
                    being purely accidental and immaterial to the process. According to Pasteur this
                    view is a mistake. With him it is the membranous mould on the surface of the
                    fermenting liquid which hands the oxygen to^ the alcohol, and it does so only
                    when it consists of living specimens of a certain species of mould-plant which
                    he calls <hi rend="italic">Mycoderma</hi><hi rend="italic">aceti.</hi> Other
                    moulds or dead <hi rend="italic">Mycoderma</hi><hi rend="italic">aceti</hi> do
                    not work. Mother of vinegar, according to Pasteur, is the “non-aerobiotic” form
                    of the mycoderma. Only the aerobiotic form acts. To keep it alive we must take
                    care that the liquid contains the phosphates and the albuminoids or ammonia,
                    which it needs as food. But, if it is to produce vinegar, it must not be fed too
                    liberally, because, when in a vigorous state of health, it oxidizes the alcohol
                    into carbonic acid and water. If the oxidation is to stop at acetic acid, the
                    mycoderma must be in a peculiar abnoιmal condition, which may be ensured by the
                    presence in the liquid of a certain limit percentage of alcohol. In the case of
                    Schützenbach’s process, Pasteur maintains (in spite of apparently contrary
                    experience) that it is the very same <hi rend="italic">Mycoderma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aceti</hi> which enables the wood shavings to act. One of his
                    arguments is the acknowledged fact that Schützenbach’s towers require to be
                    started with ordinary vinegar,although they can be worked with distilled
                    spirits. A more powerful argument he derives from the following experiment. A
                    very slow current of dilute alcohol was caused to trickle down a long string
                    suspended in a room kept at the most favourable temperature to acetous
                    fermentation. The alcohol failed to assume an acid reaction. But the slightest
                    coating of <hi rend="italic">Mycoderma</hi><hi rend="italic">aceti</hi> attached
                    to the string caused it to act exactly as the shavings do in the Schützenbach
                    casks. After all, however, it is a little difficult to believe that the many
                    pounds of alcohol which, in the course of a day, pass through a Schiitzenbach
                    tower and come out below as acetic acid, have all been under the direct
                    influence of the few grains of <hi rend="italic">Mycoderma accti</hi> which a
                    microscopist might hunt up amongst the wood shavings. It appears far more
                    rational to assume that the mycoderma acts only indirectly, perhaps by
                    converting a small portion of the alcohol into <hi rend="italic">aldehyde,</hi>
                    which diffuses itself through the whole mass of the alcohol, and, through its
                    inherent attraction for oxygen atoms, which is assisted by a similar tendency in
                    the porous wood, reduces the stability in a far larger number of oxygen
                    molecules than it needs itself, to such an extent that these so to say
                    half-liberated oxygen atoms become available for the oxidation of alcohol, the
                    more readily as the reaction itself involves a considerable liberation of
                    energy.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Eremacausis.—</hi> Animal and vegetable matters, besides
                    being liable to putrefy, are known, on exposure to air and water, to undergo a
                    slow process of oxidation which ultimately converts them into products of
                    simpler atomic constitution. Speaking quite generally, the process, in the case
                    of wood and vegetable tissues generally, consists in this, that the hydrogen is
                    eliminated more and more completely—most of it in the form of water, a small
                    portion in the form of marsh gas (CH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>), the rest of
                    the carbon passing gradually into substances more and more closely allied to
                    charcoal. In the case of albuminoids eremacausis is always preceded and
                    accompanièd by putrefaction,—the most general effect of the former being that
                    the ammonia produced by the latter is turned into nitrogen and water, or, in the
                    presence of basic substances, such as lime, carbonate of lime, carbonates of
                    alkalies, &amp;c., is oxidized into nitrites and nitrates successively. This
                    process of “nitrification” is going on in all porous soils and waters
                    contaminated with nitrogenous organic matter, and, under favourable
                    circumstances, progresses at a great rate. When sewage is filtered through a bed
                    of porous soil, the drainage waters are generally found almost free from
                    ammonia, the whole of the nitrogen having been oxidized into nitrites and
                    nitrates. According to recent researches by Schlosing and Müntz (which were
                    confirmed by Warrington) nitrification, like acetous fermentation, is determined
                    by the presence in the soil of organized ferments, the chief arguments being
                    that a purely inorganic soil does not act, and secondly, that nitrification in a
                    soil is stopped, or at least very effectually checked, by antiseptic vapours
                    such as those of bisulphide of carbon, chloroform, and carbolic acid. (W. D.
