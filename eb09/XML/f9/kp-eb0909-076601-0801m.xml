                    (1810-1876), a popular German poet, was born June 17, 1810, at Detmold, where
                    his father was a teacher in the Stadtschule. He was educated at the gymnasium of
                    his native town, and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to an uncle who kept
                    a grocer’s shop in Soest. Freiligrath had no great liking for trade. He was an
                    insatiable reader, especially of books of travel and adventure, and from his
                    childhood a scribbler of verse. At Soest he devoted some hours daily to the
                    study of English, French, and Italian, and towards the end of his five years’
                    apprenticeship was writing verses for several small Westphalian papers, such as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gunloda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mindener
                    Sonntagsblatt.</hi> Having spent other five years (1831-6) as clerk in a bank at
                    Amsterdam, Freiligrath returned to Soest, published his translations of Victor
                    Hugo’s <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Twilight Songs</hi>
                    (1836), and started, conjointly with his friends Ignaz Hub and A. Schnezler, a
                    journal, entitled <hi rend="italic">Rheinisches Odeon</hi> (1836-8). In 1837 he
                    went to Barmen as bookkeeper in a mercantile house, about which time also his
                    fugitive pieces, still appearing in Westphalian papers, among which were the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morgenblatt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Deutscher
                    Musenalmanach,</hi> had the good fortune to be praised by the poet Chamisso. A
                    year later appeared his first volume of <hi rend="italic">Gedichte,</hi> which
                    became immediately and widely popular. Finding himself at the age of
                    twenty-eight one of the favourite poets of his day, Freiligrath now gave up his
                    situation of bookkeeper in Barmen, and spent the next year at Unkel on the
                    Rhine, where he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Roland's Album</hi> (1840), and in
                    connexion with Levin Schücking compiled <hi rend="italic">Das malerische und
                    romantische</hi><hi rend="italic">Westfalen</hi> (1840-42). He married in 1841
                    Ida Melos, daughter of Professor Melos of Weimar, and removed first to St Goar,
                    where, with his friends Simrock and Matzerath, he edited the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rheinisches Jahrbuch</hi> (1840-41), and in 1842 to Darmstadt, where he
                    published, conjointly with Duller, a poem, <hi rend="italic">Zum Resten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Kölner Doms,</hi> and endeavoured also
                    to start a periodical, to be called <hi rend="italic">Britannica:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">für Englisches Leben und Englische Literatur,</hi> for which
                    Dickens and Bulwer had promised their assistance. This scheme, however, failed,
                    and Freiligrath returned to St Goar, there to complete his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karl</hi><hi rend="italic">Immermann, Blätter der Erinnerung an ihn</hi>
                    (1842). In the same year he received a pension of 300 thalers from King William
                    IV. Up to this time, Freiligrath’s poetry had borne no trace of the politician.
                    Among the <hi rend="italic">Gedichte,</hi> so popular in German households, were
                    his <hi rend="italic">Moos-thee, Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Auswanderer, Der
                    Blumenrache,</hi><hi rend="italic">Prinz Eugen,</hi><hi rend="italic">Der
                    Bilderbibel, Löwenritt,</hi> and many others written before 1840, all purely
                    imaginative in their character, and still, from a literary point of view,
                    unquestionably the poet’s masterpieces. When, after his return to St Goar,
                    Freiligrath was drawn irresistibly into the political controversies of the day,
                    he still endeavoured to keep clear of party feeling, declaring that the poet
                    stood “<hi rend="italic">auf einer höheren Warte als auf den Zinnen der
                    Partei!'</hi> But he was soon obliged to vacate this position and descend among
                    the politicians; and in 1844 he threw up his royal pension, published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Glaubensbekennt-niss,</hi> and finally joined the democratic
                    party. From this time forward he boldly proclaimed the democratic cause in
                    verse, till, as the author of <hi rend="italic">Trotz-alledem</hi> (a
                    translation of Burns’s <hi rend="italic">A Man</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">a Man for al
                    that),</hi><hi rend="italic">Jacta est</hi><hi rend="italic">Aiea, Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Freiheit! Das Recht!, Hamlet, England an Deutschland,</hi> and
                    other equally daring effusions, he was forced to seek safety in exile, and
                    retired first to Belgium and then to Switzerland. There he prepared for press a
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Englische Gedichte aus neuerer Zeit</hi> (1846),
                    containing translations from Mrs Hernans, L. E. L., Southey, Tennyson,
                    Longfellow, and others, and also a volume of political songs entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Ça</hi><hi rend="italic">Ira!</hi> The publication of this 1 ist
                    led to his flight to England, and for the next two years he lived in London, as
                    foreign correspondent to α mercantile house. In 1848 he was on the point of
                    emigrating with his family to America, there to join Longfellow and other
                    literary friends, when the Revolution broke out, and the amnesty of March 19
                    allowed him to return to Germany. He now took up his post at the head of the
                    democratic party at Düsseldorf, but was shortly afterwards imprisoned on account
                    of his poem <hi rend="italic">Die Todten an die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lebenden.</hi> On being liberated by verdict of the jury, he removed to
                    Cologne, to assist in the management of the <hi rend="italic">Neτιe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rheinische Zeitung.</hi> During this year also he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Februarklänge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Revolution.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zwischen den Garben, eine Nachlese älterer
                    Gedichte,</hi> appeared in 1849, and <hi rend="italic">Neue politische und
                    sociale Gedichte</hi> in 1850. Fresh impeachments drove Freiligrath again to
                    London in 1851, and he once more returned for a livelihood to the prosaic
                    existence of the desk and office stool, still, however, devoting his leisure
                    hours to literature, and specially to those translations from the English poets
                    which in Germany have earned him a position equal to Rückert’s as a translator
                    of English verse. In 1854 he published a selection of translations from English,
                    Scotch, and Irish literature, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Rose, Thistle, and
                    Shamrock;</hi> also <hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Dichter, eine
                    Anthologie.</hi> His translation of Longfellow’s <hi rend="italic">Hiawatha</hi>
                    appeared 1857. He also translated <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Winter's Tale</hi> for a German edition of Shakespeare, edited by
                    Bodenstedt. In 1866 a national testimonial, which ultimately reached the sum of
                    60,000 thalers, was set on foot in Germany, for the purpose of providing a
                    pension for the poet in his old age; and when, two years later, a general
                    amnesty was granted to political offenders, Freiligrath returned to his native
                    country, and was received with public enthusiasm. He now settled in Stuttgart,
                    where, at the beginning of the Franco-German war, he wrote some since popular
                    songs, such as <hi rend="italic">Hurrah Germania!</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trompete</hi><hi rend="italic">von Gravelotte.</hi> He removed to Cannstadt in
                    1875, and died there, March 18, 1876. An edition of his collected works was
                    published at Stuttgart (6 vols. 1870, 2 vols. 1871, and since) and there is also
                    a Tauchnitz edition, containing a selection of some of Freiligrath’s best known
                    poems, translated into English by various authors, and edited by his daughter
                    Mrs Freiligrath Kroeker (1869 and 1871).</p>
                <p>Powerful as Freiligrath’s poetry is, and masterly as his diction and rhythm are
                    admitted to be, he is yet wanting in the tenderness of a Chamisso, or the
                    exquisite subtlety of a Heine. The principal charm of his poetry lies in its
                    entire originality. He came, belonging to no school of versifiers; at a time
                    when old tastes were being cast off, and novelty was restlessly desired, and he
                    has been fitly christened a <hi rend="italic">bahnbrechender</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Poet.</hi> He was original in style of thought and choice of
                    subject, while in many of his poems, such as his <hi rend="italic">Iceland Moss
                    Tea, Skating Negro, Revenge of the Flowers, Lion's Ride,</hi> and many of his
                    grim, revolutionary parables, there is even an element of the fantastic—the
                    bizarre. And it was a part of this native originality of mind which made
                    Freiligrath so eminently a cosmopolitan poet. He was no traveller, and spent the
                    greater part of his days in a dusty counting house; yet, few as his sources of
                    inspiration could have been,—he himself acknowledges the old <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bilderbibel</hi> of his childhood as one, while others have traced them to the
                    busy docks and strange cargoes of a seaport town,—his fancy was rarely contented
                    with lingering among the scenery and legends at home, but branched rather into
                    new paths, into the distant parts of the earth,— into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Weltferne.</hi> This love of the <hi rend="italic">Weltferne,</hi> however,
                    predominates only in his earlier <hi rend="italic">Gedichte,</hi> to which the
                    intense patriotism of his later muse is a strange contrast. In England
                    Freiligrath’s political poetry is of secondary interest; for to the British
                    intellect it is scarcely comprehensible how such effusions—grim, outspoken, as
                    they are— should be a sufficient cause for imprisonment, or an almost <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0802-0767"/> life-long exile; and as poems of
                    occasion—although that occasion was a revolution—they rank lower with the
                    literary critic than the purely imaginative poetry of his youth. But by most
                    Germans Freiligrath is best remembered as the political poet; while among the
                    countrymen of his own party, old political friends and fellow exiles, he has
                    been called a poet martyr, the “bard of freedom,” and “inspired singer of the
                    revolution.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. μ.)</hi></p>
