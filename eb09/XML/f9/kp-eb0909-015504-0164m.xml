                <p><label type="entry">FIJI ISLANDS</label>. The Fiji, or more correctly Viti,
                    archipelago (Fiji being the pronunciation in the eastern part of the group
                    frequented by the Tongans) is one of the most important in the South Pacific.
                    Its nearest neighbours are the Samoan group 300 miles to the N.E., and the
                    Tongan or Friendly rather nearer to the S.E. Lying between 177° E. and 178° W.
                    long., and between 15° 40' and 20° S. lat., it is beyond the limits of the
                    perpetual S.E. trades, while not within the range of the N.W. monsoons. From
                    April to November the winds are steady between S.E. and E.N.E., after which the
                    weather becomes uncertain and the winds often northerly. In February and March
                    heavy gales are frequent, and hurricanes sometimes occur, causing scarcity by
                    destroying the crops. The rainfall is much greater on the windward than on the
                    lee sides of the islands (108 inches at Levuka), but the mean temperature is
                    much the same, viz., about 80° F. The greatest rise and fall of the tide is six
                    feet. The islands cover an area of some 7400 square miles, or about that of
                    Wales. Excluding the two large islands, they are classed by the natives in three
                    groups, viz., the “Lau” or Windward Islands, mostly small, but many of them very
                    fertile, of which Lakemba is the most important; “Loma-i-Viti,” or Inner Fiji,
                    t.e., the islands inclosed between the Lau and the two great islands Viti Levu
                    (Great Viti) and Vanua Levu (Great Land); and the “Ra” or Leeward Islands, a
                    chain of numerous small islands bounding the group to the westward.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scenery.—</hi> There is not much level country, except in the
                    small coral islets, and certain rich tracts along the coasts of the two large
                    islands, especially near the mouths of rivers. Elsewhere hill and valley, peak
                    and precipice, assume the most romantic forms, clothed almost always <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n165/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0165-0156"/> with a beautiful and luxuriant vegetation. The
                    large islands have a considerable extent of undulating country, dry and open on
                    their lee sides; the peaks rise from 4000 to 5000 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Diseases.—</hi> The climate, especially from
                    November to April, is somewhat enervating to the Englishman, but not unhealthy.
                    Fevers are hardly known. Dysentery, which is very common, and the most serious
                    disease in the islands, is said to have been unknown before the advent of
                    Europeans. Elephantiasis is common, but is curable by removal into higher and
                    better air. It is sometimes produced by immoderate use of kava. Influenza is at
                    times prevalent and very fatal. Rheumatism is common. The natives have a bad
                    skin disease, thoko, affecting also the bones, from which few escape; but it is
                    said to be avoidable by a sounder hygiene.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hivers.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Streams and rivers are
                    abundant,—the latter very large in proportion to the size of the islands,
                    affording a water-way to the rich districts along their banks. These and the
                    extensive mud flats and deltas at their mouths aie often flooded, by which their
                    fertility is increased, though at a heavy cost to the cultivator.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geological Formation.—</hi> The geological features of the
                    group point to repeated volcanic action at considerable intervals. The tops of
                    many of the mountains, from Kandavu in the S.W., through Nairai and Koro, to the
                    Ringgold group in the N.E , have distinct craters, but their activity has long
                    ceased. The various decomposing volcanic rocks—tufas, conglomerates, and
                    basalts—mingled with decayed vegetable matter, and abundantly watered, form a
                    very fertile soil. Most of the high peaks on the larger islands are basaltic,
                    and the rocks generally are igneous, with occasional upheaved coral found
                    sometimes over 1000 feet above the sea; but certain sedimentary rocks observed
                    on Viti Levu seem to imply a nucleus of land of considerable age. Hot springs
                    occur on Viti Levu, on Ngau, at Wainunu and Savu-Savu on VanuaLevu; the last
                    have a temperature of 200°-210° F., and cover an area of half a square mile.
                    Earthquakes are occasionally felt. Volcanic activity in the neighbourhood is
                    further shown by the quantities of pumice-stone drifted on to the south coasts
                    of Kandavu and Viti Levu; malachite, antimony, and graphite, gold in small
                    quantities, and specular iron-sand occur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Islands.—</hi> The islauds number about 250, of which perhaps
                    80 are inhabited. Viti Levu, about 80 by 55 miles, is the largest and most
                    important from its fertility and variety of surface, number of large rivers, and
                    population,— which is about one-third of that of the whole group. VanuaLevu,
                    somewhat smaller, about 100 by 25 miles, and less fertile and populous, has good
                    anchorages along its entire south coast. All the others are much smaller.
                    Taviuui, 25 by 5 miles, with a central ridge 2100 feet high and a lake at the
                    top, is fertile, but exceptionally devoid of harbours. Kandavu, 25 miles long
                    and very narrow, well-timbered, with a good harbour, contains a Wesleyan
                    training institution and model village. Fulanga and Kambara are well-timbered
                    and frequented by canoebuilders. Totoya, Moala, Ngau, Mbengga, Nairai, Koro, are
                    all valuable islands (the last especially fertile), 15 to 30 miles in
                    circumference. The Wilson or Exploring group consists of seven islands of
                    considerable size, well situated for the resort of vessels, with anchorages safe
                    and easily reached, and supplies abundant. The navigation between the islands is
                    in many places intricate, but the dangers can be much lessened by good surveys,
                    careful pilotage, and increased use of steam. There are good anchorages inside
                    the barrier reefs; the best harbours are those of Suva in Viti Levu, Savu-Savu
                    and Mbua or Sandalwood Bays in Vanua Levu, Galoa Bay in Kandavu, and Levuka.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The vegetation is mostly of a tropical
                    Iudo-Malayan character,—thick jungle with great trees covered with creepers and
                    epiphytes. The lee sides of the larger islands, however, have grassy plains
                    suitable for grazing, with scattered trees, chiefly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pandamus,</hi> and ferns. The flora has also some Australian and New Zealand
                    affinities (resembling in this respect the New Caledonia and new Hebrides
                    groups), shown especially in these western districts by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pandαnus,</hi> by certain acacias, epacrids, <hi rend="italic">Casuarvnoe,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Dammara,</hi> and by the peculiar habit of other species.
                    At about 2000 feet the vegetation assumes a more mountain type.</p>
                <p>Among the many valuable timber trees are the vesi <hi rend="italic">{Afzelia
                    bijugα)∙,</hi> the dilo <hi rend="italic">{Calophyllum Inophyllum),</hi> the oil
                    from its seeds being much used in the islands, as in India, in the treatment of
                    rheumatism; the dakua <hi rend="italic">{Dammara Vitiensis)</hi> allied to the
                    New Zealand kauri; the vaivai <hi rend="italic">{Scrianthes Vitiensis),</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Casuarina,</hi> and others, chiefly conifers, Guttiferae,
                    Myrtaceae, and Leguminosae. Most of the fruit trees are also valuable as timber.
                    The native cloth (masi) is beaten out from the bark of the paper mulberry <hi
                    rend="italic">{Broussonetia</hi><hi rend="italic">papyrifera),</hi> cultivated
                    for the purpose. Several useful fibres are supplied by plants of the Musaceae,
                    Bromelideae, Thymeleae, and other orders. Of the palms the cocoa-nut is by far
                    the most important. Dr Seemann discovered a sago-palm known to the natives by
                    the name of sogu, though they were then ignorant of its use. The yasi or
                    sandalwood is now rarely found, and only in a small district at the western
                    extremity of Vanua Levu. There are various useful drugs, spices, and perfumes;
                    and many plants are cultivated for their beauty, to which the natives are keenly
                    alive. Among the plants used as pot-herbs are several ferns, and two or three
                    Solanums, one of which, <hi rend="italic">S. aηthropophagorum,</hi> allied to
                    our N. <hi rend="italic">nigrum,</hi> was one of certain plants always cooked
                    with human flesh, which is said to be otherwise difficult of digestion. The use
                    of the kava root, here called yanggona <hi rend="italic">{Macropiper
                    methy</hi><hi rend="italic">stimm),</hi> from which the well-known national
                    beverage is made, was introduced, it is said, from Tonga.</p>
                <p>Of fruit-trees, besides the cocoa-nut, we can only mention the many varieties of
                    the bread-fruit, of bananas and plantains, of sugar-cane and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Citrus;</hi> the wi <hi rend="italic">{Spoηdiαs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dulcis),</hi> the kavika <hi rend="italic">{Eugenia

                    >{Inocarpus</hi><hi rend="italic">edulis),</hi> the pine-apple, and others
                    recently introduced. Edible roots are especially abundant. The chief staple of
                    life is the yam, the names of several months in the calendar having reference to
                    its cultivation and ripening, The <hi rend="italic">Dioscοrea alαta</hi> is the
                    variety chiefly planted; its roots are sometimes 8 feet long and 100 ft&gt; in
                    weight. The kawai <hi rend="italic">{D.</hi><hi rend="italic">aculeata)</hi> is
                    also a very fine esculent, and there are several wild species. The yaka, which
                    also grows wild, is a papilionaceous creeper <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pachyrhizus</hi><hi rend="italic">angulatus),</hi> with roots G to 8 feet long
                    and as thick as a man’s thigh; it is also much valued for its fibre. The taro or
                    dalo <hi rend="italic">{Colocasia esculenta)</hi> is grown in ditches, by
                    streams, or on irrigated ground; and there are other aroideous plants growing
                    wild, with huge edible corms. The natives use no grain or pulse, but make a kind
                    of bread <hi rend="italic">{mandrai)</hi> from the above roots, as well as from
                    the banana (which is the best), the bread-fruit, the ivi, the kavika, the
                    arrow-root <hi rend="italic">{Tacca pimnatifida</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >T.</hi><hi rend="italic">sativa),</hi> and in times of scarcity the mangrove.
                    This bread is made by burying the materials for months, till the mass is
                    thoroughly fermented and homogeneous, when it is dug up and cooked by baking or
                    steaming. This simple process, applicable to such a variety of substances, is a
                    valuable security against famine.</p>
                <p>The islands are well suited to sugar, maize, coffee, cotton (which here becomes a
                    perennial several feethigh), tobacco, manilla, india-rubber, &lt;kc.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Animals.—</hi> Besides the dog and the pig, which (with the
                    domestic fowl) must have been introduced into the Pacific islands in very early
                    ages, the only land Mammalia are a rat and five species of bats. Insects are
                    numerous, but the species few. Of 41 specie3 of laud birds, 17, Mr Wallace says,
                    are characteristic of the Australian region, 9 peculiarly Polynesian, and 15
                    belong to wide-spread genera. Birds of prey are few; the parrot and pigeon
                    tribes are better represented; of 15 aquatic species only one is peculiar.
                    Fishes, of an Iudo-Malay type, are numerous and varied; Mollusca, especially
                    marine, and Crustaceae are also very numerous. These three form an important
                    element in the food supply.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exports.—</hi> Numbers of cocoa-nuts have been planted, and the
                    export of copra (the dried kernel of the nut) is rapidly increasing. The chief
                    exports in 1876 were—copra £41,900, sugar £9036, maize £8465,—which are all on
                    the increase; cotton £11,922, and bêche-de-mer £2491, which have decreased; coir
                    £2727, pearl-shell, and arrowroot. The value of exports from Levuka was £80,890,
                    of imports £112,806. The customs returns were estimated at £15,000; the native
                    land revenue was assessed at £22,000. The revenue of 1878 is estimated at
                    £60,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">People.—</hi> The Fijian character was till lately proverbial
                    for every savage abomination. Cannibalism, if fenced round at one time by
                    religious sanctions, had degenerated to a morbid craving recklessly indulged
                    whenever possible. Shipwrecked or helpless strangers were nearly always killed
                    and eaten. Widows were strangled at the death of their husbands, slaves killed
                    at the death of their masters; victims were slain in numbers at the building of
                    a house or of a canoe, or at the visits of embassies from other tribes. The
                    lives of individuals were alwayβ subject to the caprices of the chiefs. In the
                    atmosphere of suspicion and treachery thus engendered few virtues could be
                    developed. Yet the people were always hospitable, open-handed, and remarkably
                    polite. They themselves attribute to affection the practice of killing their
                    sick or aged relations. They are sensitive, proud, vindictive, boastful, cleanly
                    in their houses, cookery, &amp;c., with good conversational and reasoning
                    powers, much sense of humour, tact, and perception of character. Their code of
                    social etiquette is minute and elaborate, and the gradations of rank
                    well-marked. These are—1, chiefs, greater and lesser; 2, priests; 3, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mata ni</hi><hi rend="italic">Vαnuα</hi> (lit., eyes of the land),
                    employés, messengers, or counsellors; 4, distinguished warriors of low birth; 5,
                    common people; 6, slaves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Institutions.—</hi> The family is the unit of
                    political society. The families are grouped in townships or otherwise <hi
                    rend="italic">{qali)</hi> under the lesser chiefs, who again owe allegiance to
                    the supreme chief of the <hi rend="italic">rnatanitu</hi> or tribe. The chiefs
                    are a real aristocracy, excelling the people in physique, skill, intellect, and
                    acquirements of all sorts; and the reverence felt for them, now gradually
                    diminishing, was very great, and had something of a religious character. All
                    that a man had belonged to his chief. On the other hand, the chief’s property
                    practically belonged to his people, and they were as ready to give a3 to take.
                    In a time of famine, a chief would declare the contents of the plantations to be
                    common property. A system of feudal service-tenures <hi rend="italic"
                    >{lala)</hi> is the institution on which their social and political fabric
                    mainly depended. It allowed the chief to call for the labour of any district,
                    and to employ it in planting, house or canoe building, supplying food on the
                    occasion of another chief’s visit, &amp;c., This power was often used with much
                    discernment; thus an unpopular chief would redeem his character by calling for
                    some customary service and rewarding it liberally, or a district would be called
                    on to supply labour or produce as a punishment. The privilege might of course be
                    abused by needy or unscrupulous chiefs, though they generally deferred somewhat
                    to public opinion; it has now, with similar customary exactions of cloth, mats,
                    salt, pottery, &lt;fcc., been reduced within definite limits. An allied custom,
                    <hi rend="italic">solevu,</hi> enabled a district in want of any particular
                    article to call on its neighbours to supply it, giving labour or something else
                    in exchange. Although, then, the chief is lord of the soil, the inferior chiefs
                    and individual families have equally distinct rights in it, subject to payment
                    of certain dues; and the idea of permanent alienation of land by purchase was
                    never perhaps clearly realized.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    all the best land, were purchased by whites before the annexation; but all the

                    that of <hi rend="italic">υasu</hi> (lit., nephew). The son of a chief by a
                    woman of rank had almost unlimited rights over the property of his mother’s
                    family, or of her people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">War.—</hi> In time of war the chief claimed absolute control
                    over life and property. Warfare was carried on with many courteous formalities,
                    and considerable skill was shown in the fortifications. There were well-defined
                    degrees of dependence among the different tribes or districts: the first of
                    these, <hi rend="italic">bati</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> is an
                    alliance between two nearly equal tribes, but implying a sort of inferiority on
                    one side, acknowledged by military service; the second, <hi rend="italic"
                    >qali,</hi> implies greater subjection, and payment of tribute. Thus A, being
                    bati to B, might hold C in qali, in which case C was also reckoned subject to B,
                    or might be protected by B for political purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> The people are now almost all Christians. Their
                    former creed, which had much in common with the Polynesian, included a belief in
                    a future existence, and in two classes of gods,—the first immortal, of whom
                    Ndengei is the greatest, said to exist eternally in the form of a serpent, but
                    troubling himself little with human or other affairs, and the others had usually
                    only a local recognition. The second rank (who, though far above mortals, are
                    subject to their passions, and even to death) comprised the spirits of chiefs,
                    heroes, and other ancestors. The gods entered and spoke through their priests,
                    who thus pronounced on the issue of every enterprise, but they were not
                    represented by idols; certain groves and trees were held sacred, and stones
                    which suggest phallic associations. The priesthood usually waβ hereditary, and
                    their influence great, and they had generally a good understanding with the
                    chief. The institution of Tabu existed in full force. The mburc or temple was
                    also the council chamber and place of assemblage for various purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Customs.—</hi> They have various games and amusements, dancing,
                    story-telling, and songs being especially popular. Their poetry has well-defined
                    metres, and a sort of rhyme. Their music is rude, and is said to be always in
                    the major key. The excellence of their pottery favours a good and varied
                    cuisine, and they have great and elaborate feasts; the preparations are
                    sometimes made months in advance, and enormous waste results from them. Mourning
                    is expressed by fasting, by shaving the head and face, or by cutting off the
                    little finger. This last is sometimes done at the death of a rich man in the
                    hope that his family will reward the compliment; sometimes it is done
                    vicariously, as when the chief cuts off the little finger of his dependants in
                    regret or in atonement for the death of another. Only the women are
                    tatooed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It will be
                    understood that in the present state of transition somo of the curious poli*y
                    and customs here recorded are becoming obsolete.</p></note><hi rend="italic"
                    >Houses.—</hi> The houses, of which the framework is timber and the rest lattice
                    and thatch, are ingeniously constructed, with great taste in ornamentation, and
                    are well furnished with mats, musquito-curtains, baskets, fans, nets, and
                    cooking and other utensils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population forty years ago was about <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0167-0158"/> 200,000, it has since rapidly diminished, owing
                    at first to the evils above described (aggravated probably by contact with the
                    vicious European element), and afterwards to that fatal languor which so often
                    accompanies the introduction of civilization, the deaths now outnumbering the
                    births. Before the annexation to Britain (1874) there were about 140,000, but
                    40,000 fell victims to measles soon after. This diminution might perhaps be
                    combated by the encouragement of their old athletic sports under an enlightened
                    Christianity. The exact ethnological position of the people is a problem. They
                    occupy the extreme east limits of Papuan territory, but far surpass the pure
                    examples of that race, combining their dark colour, harsh hirsute skin, crisp
                    hair, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and muscular limbs with the handsome
                    features of the brown Polynesian race. They are tall and well-proportioned, the
                    average physical development being much higher than our own. The features are
                    strongly marked, but not unpleasant, the eyes deep set, the beard thick and
                    bushy. The chiefs are fairer, much better looking, and of a less negroid cast of
                    face than the people. This negroid type is especially marked on the west coasts,
                    and stfll more in the interior of Viti Levu. Many other characteristics of both
                    races are found,— <hi rend="italic">e.y.,</hi> the quick intellect of the
                    fairer, and the savagery and suspicion of the dark; they wear a minimum of
                    covering, but, unlike the Melanesians, are strictly decent, while they are more
                    moral than the Polynesians. A partial circumcision is practised, which is
                    exceptional with the Melanesians, nor have these usually an elaborate political
                    and social system like that of Fiji The status of the women is also somewhat
                    better,—those of the upper class having considerable freedom and influence. Till
                    taught by the Tongans they were, like other Melanesians, timid sailors. The
                    prevalence of one language (though in several dialects) contrasts with the
                    endless variety among the Melanesians. It is copious, flexible,
                    vigorous,—fundamentally Melanesian, but largely modified in vocabulary and even
                    in structure by the Polynesian. It has been argued from, among other
                    considerations, the number of places with Tongan names, and from certain old
                    Tongan traditions, that the ancestors of that people, in their migration from
                    the west, were, after remaining a long time in Fiji, finally expelled thence by
                    the aboriginal and darker race. Fijian traditions, however, point to no such
                    movement, only asserting the greater unity of the race in former times, and
                    placing even the creation of man, the scene of the deluge, and of the building
                    of a tower of Babel, on Fijian soil. At all events the Fijian is a
                    well-established race, and the fusion of the elements which produced it
                    certainly dates from a remote past.</p>
                <p>If less readily amenable to civilizing influences than their neighbours to the
                    eastward, they show greater force of character and ingenuity. Possessing the
                    arts of both races they practise them with greater skill than either. They
                    understand the principle of division of labour and production, and thus of
                    commerce. They are skilful cultivators, and good boat-builders, the carpenters
                    being an hereditary caste; there are also tribes of fishermen and sailors; their
                    mats, baskets, nets, cordage, and other fabrics are substantial and tasteful;
                    their pottery, made—like much of the above—by women, is far superior to any
                    other in the South Seas, but, with many other native manufactures, is being
                    supplanted by European articles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> A few islands in the N.E. of the group were
                    first seen by Tasman in 1643. The southernmost of the group, Turtle Island, was
                    discovered by Cook in 1773. Bligh visited them in 1789, and Captain Wilson of
                    the “Duff” in 1797. In 1827</p>
                <p>D’Urville in the “Astrolabe” surveyed them much more accurately, but the first
                    thorough survey was that of the United States exploring expedition in 1840.</p>
                <p>Up to this time, owing to the evil reputation of the islanders, European
                    intercourse was very limited. About the year 1804 some escaped convicts from
                    Australia and runaway sailors established themselves around the east part of
                    Viti Levu, and by lending their services to the neighbouring chiefs probably led
                    to their preponderance over the rest of the group. Na Ulivau, chief of the small
                    island of Mbau, established before his death in 1829 a sort of supremacy, which
                    was extended by his brother Tanoa, and by Tanoa’s son, the well-known Thakombau,
                    a ruler of considerable capacity. In his time, however, difficulties thickened.
                    The Tongans, a Polynesian people 250 miles to the S.E. (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Friendly Islands),</hi> who had long frequented Fiji (especially for
                    canoe-building, their own islands being deficient in timber), now came in larger
                    numbers, led by an able and ambitious chief, Maafu, who, by adroitly taking part
                    in Fijian quarrels, made himself chief in the Windward group, threatening
                    Thakombau’s supremacy. He was harassed, too, by an arbitrary demand for £9000
                    from the American Government, for alleged injuries to their consul. Several
                    chiefs who disputed his authority were crushed by the aid of King George of
                    Tonga, who (1855) had opportunely arrived on a visit; but he afterwards, taking
                    some offence, demanded £12,000 for his services. At last Thakombau, disappointed
                    in the hope that his acceptance (1854) of Christianity would improve his
                    position, offered (1858) the sovereignty to England, with the fee simple of
                    100,000 acres, on condition of her paying the American claims. Colonel Smythe,
                    R.A., was sent out to report on the question, and decided against annexation,
                    but advised that the British consul should be invested with full magisterial
                    powers over his countrymen, a step which would have averted much subsequent
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Dr Seemann’s favourable report on the capabilities of the islands,
                    followed by a time of depression in Australia and New Zealand, led to a rapid
                    increase of settlers—from 200 in 1860 to 1800 in'1869. This produced fresh
                    complications, and an increasing desire among the respectable settlers for a
                    competent civil ana criminal jurisdiction. Attempts were made at
                    self-government, and the sovereignty was again offered, conditionally, to
                    England, and to the United States. Finally, in 1871, a “constitutional
                    government” was formed by certain Englishmen under King Thakombau; but this,
                    after incurring heavy debt, and promoting the welfare of neither whites nor
                    natives, came after three years to a dead lock, and the British Government felt
                    obliged, in the interest of all parties, to accept the unconditional cession now
                    offered. It had besides long been thought desirable to possess a station on the
                    route between Australia and Panama; it was also felt that the Polynesian, labour
                    traffic, the abuses in which had caused much indignation, could only be
                    effectually regulated from a point so contiguous to the recruiting field, and
                    where that labour was extensively employed. To this end the governor of Fiji is
                    also “High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.” Native laws, customs, and
                    polity have been tenderly handled, and utilized, as far as possible, under the
                    new rule. The chiefs are held responsible for good order, and for payment of the
                    revenue. Certain higher chiefs, called “Koko Tuis,” receive salaries, with
                    executive and magisterial powers, assisted in the latter function by a large
                    number of native subordinates, “Bulis,” all under the eye of a veιy few European
                    stipendiary magistrates. The employment of native labour is under strict
                    regulations. The revenue is raised in conformity with native ideas, each
                    district being assessed yearly to furnish certain supplies in kind, which are
                    disposed of by tender. The white settlers at the end of 1876 numbered 1569.</p>
                <p>The labours of the Wesleyan missionaries must always have a prominent place in
                    any history of Fiji. They came from Tonga in 1835, and naturally settled first
                    in the Windward Islands, where the Tongan element, already familiar to them,
                    preponderated. They perhaps identified themselves too closely with their Tongan
                    friends, whose dissolute, lawless, tyrannical conduct led to much mischief; but
                    it should not be forgotten that their position was a difficult one; their
                    services to humanity were certainly great, and it was mainly through their
                    efforts that the heathen abominations so recently in full vigour have become a
                    thing of the past.</p>
