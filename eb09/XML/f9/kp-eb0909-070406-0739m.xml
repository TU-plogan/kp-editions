                    150 feet high. It is distant 29 miles W.N.W. from Lexington, and 65 miles E.
                    from Louisville, by rail. The river is crossed at Frankfort by two bridges, and
                    that portion of the town lying on the south side of the river is known as South
                    Frankfort. The principal buildings are the State house, a marble building with a
                    handsome portico supported by Ionic columns, the institution for imbecile
                    children, the State penitentiary, the county court-house, and the public hall.
                    The beautiful cemetery contains the remains of Daniel Boone, the pioneer of
                    Kentucky, who died September 20, 1820. Frankfort has distilleries and flour and
                    cotton mills, and a considerable trade in lumber. The river is navigable for
                    steamers 40 miles above the city. Frankfort was laid out in 1787, and became the
                    capital of the State in 1792. In 1862 it was occupied for a short time by the
                    Confederates. The population in 1860 was 3702, and in 1870, 5396, of whom 2335
                    were coloured.</p>

                    >Frankfurt</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Frankfurth-am-Main,</hi> one of the
                    principal cities of the German empire, in the circle of Wiesbaden, in the
                    Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau, and till 1866 one of the four free cities of
                    Germany. It lies about 330 feet above the level of the sea, in 50° 6' 43' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> N. lat. and 8° 41' 9'' E. long., 22 miles E. of Mainz
                    and 16 miles N. of Darmstadt. The position which it occupies is one of no small
                    natural beauty in the broad and fertile valley of the Main, its northern horizon
                    being formed by the soft outlines of the Taunus range. The surrounding country
                    is richly clad with orchard and forest, and in the season of spring especially
                    presents a prospect of indescribable luxuriance. In earlier times the city with
                    its fortifications had the form of an irregular pentagon, of which the longest
                    side was defined by the right bank of the river; but now that the fortifications
                    have been demolished, new suburbs have spread out widely in all directions, and
                    the village of Sachsenhausen on the opposite side of the stream has extended in
                    a similar fashion, so that the whole area of architectural occupation measures
                    about 2£ miles from E. to W., and about 2 miles from N. to S. Even within the
                    old encincture great transformations have been effected, and much of the quaint
                    domestic architecture and the intricate network of narrow streets and lanes has
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0740-0705"/> given way to modern improvements. Only one side,
                    for example, of the famous Judengasse or Jews’ Street is now standing, the other
                    having been demolished since 1870; but the visitor can still see the house where
                    Ludwig Börne was born in 1786, and the dingy and unpretentious premises of No.
                    148 which saw the rise of the Rothschild family. When the whole of what remains
                    of this street has been pulled down and rebuilt, as it must be ere long, there
                    will still be many less celebrated parts of the old city of no small interest as
                    eloquent relics of bygone conditions of life. In the modern quarters Frankfort
                    will compare favourably, both in the general appearance of the streets and in
                    the architectural character of individual buildings, with all except a very few
                    of the greater cities of the Continent; and almost every year this is becoming
                    more certainly true. Among the more spacious streets are the Schöne Aussicht or
                    Beautiful Prospect along the Main, the Kaiser-Strasse or Emperor Street, and the
                    Zeil. The business of the city is largely concentrated in the Zeil, the
                    Rossmarkt or Horse Market, the Kaiser-Strasse, Friedens-Strasse, and their
                    immediate vicinity.</p>
                <p>The principal ecclesiastical building in Frankfort is the cathedral of St
                    Bartholomew’s, which is situated not far from the river between the Domplatz on
                    the N. and the Weekmarkt on the S. The date of its first foundation is not
                    precisely known. A church called Salvator’s was erected on the site by Louis the
                    German at least as early as 874 A.D., and he enriched it with considerable
                    donations, and instituted a chapter of twelve priests and an abbot. Charles the
                    Fat not only confirmed his father’s gifts in 882, but he added a <hi
                    rend="italic">nona</hi> or ninth of the produce of Frankfort, Trebur, Ingelheim,
                    Kreiznach, and other royal domains. In the 12th century the church obtained
                    possession of the skull of St Bartholomew, and by the early part of the 13th it
                    appears to have been known as St Bartholomew’s church. The building was by that
                    time in a very dilapidated condition; and consequently Pope Gregory IX. urged
                    the faithful of the diocese of Mainz to contribute to its restoration. When in
                    1315 the church was appropriated to the religious ceremonies connected with the
                    coronation of the emperors, it was found necessary to enlarge its dimensions.
                    The eastern portion, consisting of the choir and two towers, was pulled down and
                    rebuilt on a larger scale about 1338, and in the same century the wings of the
                    transepts and the imperial election chapel were added. The so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Pfarrthurnι</hi> or Parson’s Tower was built between 1414 and
                    1512. In 1855 the interior was renovated; but on the night of the 14th August
                    1867 the whole building was laid in ruins by a conflagration. In 1869 F. J.
                    Denziger, chief architect of the Ratisbon (or Regensburg) cathedral was
                    entrusted with the work of restoration, and his task has been steadily
                    prosecuted. The only portions of the enterprize uncompleted in 1878 were the
                    cloister and the grand organ. In the interior are still to be seen the high
                    altar at which after 1562 the imperial coronations were celebrated, the
                    tombstone of the emperor Günther of Schwarzburg, who died in Frankfort in 1349,
                    and the tombstone of Rudolph, the last knight of Sachsenhausen, who died in
                    1371. The other Catholic churches are Leonhardskirche and Liebfrauenkirche, and
                    the Deutschhauskirche in Sachsenhausen. St Leonhard’s ranks second to the
                    cathedral in point of antiquity, and is said to occupy the site of the palace of
                    Charles the Great. It possesses a stained glass window above the high altar,
                    with a Lord’s Supper by Hans Holbein. Our Lady’s Church was founded in 1322 by
                    Schöffen Weigel of Wambach, was made collegiate in 1326, and underwent a
                    restoration in the second half of the 18th century. St Paul’s (Paulskirche), the
                    principal church of the Evangelical Lutherans, was built between 1786 and 1833
                    on the site of the old church of the Minorites, and is mainly interesting as the
                    seat of the national parliament of 1848-49. The church of St Nicholas
                    (Nicolaikirche) dates from the 13th century, and has a fine cast-iron spire
                    erected in 1843. From 1570 to 1721, and again from 1813 to 1841, it was used as
                    a warehouse. St Catherine’s was built about 1678-1680 on the site of an older
                    building famous in Frankfort history as the place where the first Protestant
                    sermon was preached in 1522. The principal synagogue—there are three altogether
                    -—is a Mauro-Byzantine structure erected between 1855 and 1860 in room of an
                    older synagogue of the 15th century. Of the secular buildings in Frankfort
                    perhaps the most characteristic is the Rathhaus or Römer, which by a strange
                    coincidence bears a name suggestive of, though not derived from, its principal
                    historical associations. It was here, in the Wahlzimmer or election room, that
                    the electors or their plenipotentiaries decided the choice of the emperors, and
                    here, in the Kaisersaal or emperor’s hall, the coronation festival was held, at
                    which the new recipient of the crown dined with the electors after having shown
                    himself from the balcony to the people assembled in the Römerberg, as the open
                    place in front of the building is called. The building dates from the 15th
                    century, and occupies the site of the Golden Swan and two private houses which
                    from time immemorial had borne the name of the Römer. The Kaisersaal retained
                    its antique appearance till 1843; but it is now ornamented with a series of
                    modern paintings by Veit, Jung, Ballenberger, and a score of other German
                    artists representing the “German” emperors from Charlemagne to Francis II., in
                    all fifty-two. The palace of the prince of Thurn and Taxis is a large building
                    in the old French style of considerable historical interest: from 1806 to 1810
                    it was the residence of the “prince-primate,” or head of the confederation of
                    the Rhine; after the battle of Leipsic it was occupied by Francis I. of Austria;
                    and from 1816 to 1866 the parliament of the German confederation held its
                    sessions within its walls. The Eschenheim Tower is a picturesque<pb break="no"

                    the middle of the 14th century.</p>
                <p>Hardly any fact about Frankfort is more familiar to the reader of Goethe than
                    that it has an old bridge over the Main, and that on the bridge there has been
                    for centuries an iron crucifix surmounted by a somewhat insignificant figure of
                    a cock, commemorating, according to tradition, the unfortunate fowl which first
                    crossed the bridge, and thus fell a prey to the devil who, in hope of a nobler
                    victim, had sold his assistance to the original architect. The first distinct
                    mention of a bridge over the river occurs in 1222, and the present structure
                    dates from the 14th century. As late at least as 1475 the central span was not
                    arched over. There are now fourteen arches in all, the total length of the
                    bridge being 869 feet. The cock and crucifix are mentioned as early as 1405, and
                    antiquaries assert that it probably marks the spot where criminals in the olden
                    time were flung into the river. About half a mile below the old bridge a new
                    bridge, called the “Unter-Main Brücke,” was constructed by P. Schmick, between
                    1872 and 1874; and about midway between the two lies the footbridge or “Steg,”
                    erected by the same engineer in 1868-69, and the first example of its kind in
                    Germany. The “Ober-Main” or Upper-Main Bridge was opened to traffic in the
                    spring of 1878. Several other bridges for railway purposes are projected.</p>
                <p>Few cities of the same size as Frankfort are so richly furnished with literary,
                    scientific, and artistic institutions, or possess so many handsome buildings
                    appropriated to their service. The town theatre was built between 1780 and 1827
                    in a Dutch-French style, and was restored in 1855; and as it has proved too
                    small for the wants of the people, a new opera house has been erected near the
                    Bockenheim gate, after the plans of Professor Lucä of Berlin. There is a public
                    picture-gallery in the Saalhof, containing works by Hans Holbein, Grünewald,
                    Vandyck, Teniers, Van der Neer, Hans von Culmbach, Lucas Cranach, Martin Schön,
                    &amp;c. The nucleus of the collection is of very ancient date; considerable
                    additions were made in 1803 at the secularization of the monasteries; in 1839
                    Ernst Fr. K. Prehn’s cabinet of more than 850 small oil-paintings was presented
                    by his heirs, and 220 that had belonged to Johann G. Chr. Daems were added in
                    1856, in terms of his bequest. The Städel Art Institute (Städel’sche Kunst
                    Institut) takes its name from Johann Friedrich Städel, who not only left his
                    collection of paintings, engravings, and other property to the town, but
                    appropriated a million marks to the erection of an institute and college. Its
                    picture gallery and cabinet of engravings are both extremely rich in works of
                    German art: the latter in 1874 had 54,300 plates. In the town library, which is
                    kept in a building erected between 1820 and 1825, there are upwards of 100,000
                    volumes; and among its rarer treasures are a Gutenberg Bible printed at Mainz
                    between 1450 and 1455, another on parchment dated 1462, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutiones Justiniani,</hi> Mainz, 1468, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theuer∙</hi><hi rend="italic">Dank,</hi> with woodcuts by Hans Scheufelein,
                    Abyssinian manuscripts presented by the African traveller Rüppel, and autographs
                    of Luther, Melanchthon, Wallenstein, Napoleon I., Goethe, Schiller, &amp;c. The
                    Bethmann Museum owes its celebrity principally to Dannecker’s Ariadne, but it
                    also possesses the original plaster model of Thorwaldsen ’ s Entrance of
                    Alexander the Great into Babylon. Among the scientific institutions perhaps the
                    chief place belongs to those named after J. Chr. Senckenberg, the physician.
                    Senckenberg himself founded both the Bürger or citizens’ hospital and the
                    medical institute, with an anatomical theatre, botanical garden, and library;
                    and a society of natural science <hi rend="italic">(Senckenbergsehe
                    Naturforschende</hi><hi rend="italic">Gesellschaft)</hi> was instituted in his
                    honour in 1817, and now possesses an extensive and valuable museum. Large
                    gardens were opened for the patients of the citizens’hospital in 1851, and in
                    1875 new buildings were added. A physical association was founded in 1824, an
                    association for geography and statistics in 1836, a medical association in 1845,
                    the association for history and archaeology in 1857, and the free German
                    institute for science, art, and general culture in 1859. An association for the
                    cultivation of classical and especially of church music (the Cäcilien-Verein)
                    was instituted by Scheible in 1818, and a similar association (the Rühl’sche
                    Verein) by Rühl in 1851; and there are several other musical unions, such as the
                    Philharmonische Verein, the Liederkranz, &amp;c. In 1858 a zoological garden was
                    opened by a joint stock company near the Bockenheim Road; and in 1873 it was
                    transferred to a new site on the Pfingstweide or Pentecost Meadow, and assigned
                    to a new company. When in 1868 the duke of Nassau offered the plants of his
                    winter garden for sale, a company, the Palm Garden Company, was formed at
                    Frankfort, which purchased the collection, and established what is now the most
                    beautiful of all the pleasure-grounds in the city.</p>
                <p>Besides the Bürger Hospital already mentioned, Frankfort has several large
                    institutions for the sick and infirm. The Holy Ghost Hospital, originally
                    founded in 1278 for invalid pilgrims, is now appropriated to the servants and
                    apprentices of Frankfort citizens. Its convalescent hospital, opened in 1868 at
                    the Mainkur, was the first establishment of the kind in Germany. It maintains in
                    each of the fourteen quarters of the town a physician, a surgeon, and an
                    apothecary for the gratuitous assistance of the poor. The new asylum for the
                    insane, with room for 200 patients, was erected between 1859 and 1863, partly by
                    public subscription, and partly by a donation of 100,000 florins from Herr von
                    Wiesenhütten. For its deaf and dumb institution the town is indebted to Ludwig
                    Kosel, who in 1827 started with three pupils; and it was at his suggestion that
                    the blind asylum was established by the society for the furtherance of the
                    useful arts. The Waisenhaus or orphan asylum erected in 1829 is no longer
                    employed for its original purpose, as it has since 1860 been thought'better to
                    board the orphan children with families in the neighbouring villages of Lieh,
                    Wächtersbach, &amp;c. It is sufficient to mention the Jewish infirmary, built at
                    the expense of the Rothschilds; the new Jewish hospital, erected in 1874; Dr
                    Christ’s children’s hospital, originated in 1835; and the maternity hospital,
                    opened in,1855. Among thenumerous associations for benevolent purposes are the

                <p>Frankfort has always been much more of a commercial than an industrial town, and
                    at present it manufactures little else but Frankfort black, waxcloth, jewellery,
                    gold and silver thread, tapestry, and such like articles. Bockenheim, however, a
                    small town with which it is connected by tramway lines, is a flourishing
                    manufacturing centre; and the Frankfort capitalists are connected with the
                    industrial enterprises of Wiesbaden, Hanau, Offenbach, &amp;c. There are two
                    great fairs held in the town,—the Ostermesse or spring fair, and the Herbstmesse
                    or autumn fair. The former, which was the original nucleus of all the commercial
                    prosperity of the city, begins on the second Wednesday before Easter; and the
                    latter on the second Wednesday before the 8th of September. They last three
                    weeks, and the last day save one, called the <hi rend="italic"

                    horse fair has been held twice a year since 1862 under the patronage of the
                    agricultural society; and the wool market was reinstituted in 1872 by the German
                    Trade Society. Frankfort has long been famous as one of the principal banking
                    centres of Europe; and throughout the city there are upwards of 220 banking
                    offices. The so-called “Frankfort Bank” was founded in 1854, with a capital of
                    10,000,000 gulden. The exchange occupies a building opposite the Paulskirche,
                    erected since 1840 according to the plans of Stüler of Berlin; and it is
                    remarkable for the large business that is done in Government stock. In the 17th
                    century the town was the seat of a great booktrade; but it has long been
                    distanced in this department by Leipsic. The <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter

                <p>There are four railway stations in Frankfort: by the Weser station the traveller
                    leaves for Nauheim and Cassel, for Homburg, for Kronberg, and the north
                    generally; from the Taunus station he proceeds along the right bank of the river
                    to Mainz; from the Neckar station he leaves for Darmstadt and the south, and for
                    Mainz by the line along the left bank of the river; and from the Hanau station
                    he proceeds eastwards. In Sachsenhausen there is the Offenbach-Hanau station.
                    The Neckar railway crosses the river by a bridge erected in 1846-48, which is
                    also used by the Offenbach and the “Linksmainisch” lines, Several other bridges
                    across the river are projected in connexion with the scheme for centralizing the
                    railway systems. Communication within the town is facilitated by tramways; and
                    there is also a line all the way to Bockenheim.</p>
                <p>Frankfort has been the birthplace of not a few of the most celebrated men of
                    Germany. J. G. Schlosser the historian, Feuerbach the philosopher, Kirchner the
                    scholar and naturalist, Clement Brentano, Bettina von Arnim, and Ludwig Börne,
                    are all in the list; but what the city considers its highest literary
                    distinction is the fact that Johann Wolfgang Goethe was born in 1749 at No. 23
                    Hirschgraben. In 1863 the house was purchased for 56,000 florins by the Free
                    German “Hochstift” (or Grand Association) for the sciences, arts, and general
                    culture, and thus made for ever the common property of the German people. The
                    society consists of members in all parts of the world, associated by admiration
                    of the poet. Under the direction of Otto Volga the house has been as much as
                    possible put into the state in which it was in Goethe’s youth; and at the same
                    time the rooms are turned into so many little museums of Goethe literature and
                    art. On the high grounds to the south of the river there is a spot, now known as
                    the Gothe Ruhe, or Goethe’s Rest, where the poet is said to have admired the
                    prospect of his native town, and there a tasteful wooden tower in the Swiss
                    chalet style was built in 1877 by the Verschönerungs-Verein, or association for
                    the beautifying of the city. The Goethe statue was erected in 1844 in what is
                    now the Goethe Platz to the north of the Rossmarkt; it was designed by
                    Schwanthaler, and cast in the royal foundry at Munich.</p>
                <p>Of memorial monuments the largest and most elaborate in Frankfort is that erected
                    in 1858 in honour of the early German printers. It was modelled by Ed. von der
                    Lausitz and executed by Herr von Kreis. The statues of Gutenberg, Fust, and
                    Schöffer form a group on the top; an ornamented frieze presents medallions of a
                    number of famous printers; below these are figures representing the towns of
                    Mainz, Strasburg, Venice, and Frankfort; and on the corners of the pedestal are
                    allegorical statues of theology, poetry, science, and industry. The Schiller
                    statue, erected in 1863, is the work of a Frankfort artist, Dielmann. A monument
                    in the Bockenheim Anlage, dated 1837, preserves the memory of Guiollet, the
                    burgomaster, to whom the town is mainly indebted for the beautiful promenades
                    which occupy the site of the old fortification; and similar monuments have been
                    reared to Senckenberg (1863), Bethmann, and Wiesenhütten. A statue of
                    Charlemagne adorns the old Main bridge.</p>
                <p>The new cemetery (opened in 1828) contains the graves of Arthur Schopenhauer and
                    Feuerbach, of Passavant the biographer of Raphael, Ballenberger the artist,
                    Hessemer the architect, Sömmerring the naturalist, Dr Böhmer, and Städel. The
                    Bethmann vault attracts attention by three bas-reliefs from the chisel of
                    Thorwaldsen; and the Reichenbach mausoleum is a vast pile designed by Hessemer
                    at the command of William II. of Hesse, and adorned with sculptures by Zwerger
                    and Von der Lausitz. In the Jewish section, which is walled off from the rest of
                    the burying-ground, the most remarkable tombs are those of the Rothschild
                    family.</p>
                <p>The present municipal constitution of the town dates from 1867, and conforms to
                    the Prussian system. The electors choose 54 representatives for a term of 6
                    years; and every two years a third of the number retire, but are eligible for
                    re-election. The 54 representatives elect twelve town councillors, six of whom
                    receive a salary and serve for 12 years, while the rest receive no salary and
                    serve for 6 years. The chief burgomaster is nominated by the king for 12 years,
                    and the second burgomaster must receive the king’s recognition. Since 1873 the
                    town has been supplied with water from the Vogelsberg and the Spessart by the
                    Frankfurter Quellwasserleitung Gesellschaft at the rate of about a million cubic
                    feet per day, the natural pressure being sufficient to carry the water to the
                    highest stories. The population of Frankfort has continued almost steadily to
                    increase since the beginning of the century, the yearly percentage varying from
                    0 ’ l in 1843 to 8 ’ 9 in 1872. In 1817 the civil population was 41,458; in
                    1840, 55,269; in 1849, 58,599; in 1855, 63,495; and in 1864, 77,372. The events
                    of 1866 led to a decline, and in 1867 the number was only 75,918. By 1871 it had
                    again risen to 89,265; in 1872 it was 97,230; in 1873, 102,680; and in 1875,
                    103,136. Including the suburban villages (Bornheim 10,085, Bockenheim 13,043,
                    Oberrad 4609, and Rödelheim 3903), the total is 134,776.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Though the Romans certainly had settlements in
                    the valley of the Main, as at Mattiacum (Wiesbaden) and Novus Vicus
                    (Heddernheim), there is no proof that the site of Frankfort was l&gt;ermanently
                    occupied before the arrival of the Franks, from whom it derives its name. Father
                    Fuchs of Mainz, indeed, asserted in the end of the 18th century that he had
                    epigraphic evidence for the statement that Frankfort was founded by the Romans
                    in the 2d century of the Christian era, and that by the 3d century it had become
                    a great fortified city; but unfortunately none of the inscriptions to which he
                    referred have ever been shown to exist. Popular tradition connects the origin of
                    the town with the history of Charlemagne, asserting that the name Frankfort is
                    due to the fact that once, when he was retreating from the Saxons, he and his
                    Frankish army were safely conducted across the river by a doe, and that
                    Sachsenhausen was so called because he settled there a colony of the Saxons whom
                    he had subdued. The first truly historical notice of the town occurs in 793,
                    when Eginhard, Charlemagne’s biographer, tells us that he spent the winter in
                    the villa Frankonovurd. Next year there is mention more than once of a royal
                    palace there, and the early importance of the place is indicated by the fact
                    that it was chosen as the seat of an ecclesiastical council, which was attended
                    not only by German but by French and Italian bishops, as well as by two papal
                    legates. The name Frankfort is also found in several official documents of
                    Charlemagne’s reign; and from the notices that occur in the early chronicles and
                    charters it would appear that the place was the most populous at least of the
                    numerous villages of the Main district. During the Carlovingian period it was
                    the seat of no fewer than 16 imperial councils or colloquies. The town was
                    probably at first built on an island in the river. It was origin <pb break="no"

                    close of the empire it remained a purely imperial or royal town. It gradually
                    acquired various privileges, and by the close of the 14th century the only mark
                    of dependence was the payment of a yearly tax. Louis the Pious dwelt even more
                    frequently at Frankfort than his father had done, and about 823 he built himself
                    a new palace, the basis of the later Saalhof. In 822 and 823 two great diets
                    were held in the palace, and at the former there were present deputies from the
                    eastern Slavs, the Avars, and the Normans. The place continued to be a favourite
                    residence with Louis the German, and he died there in 876. By the rest of the
                    Carlovingian kings it was less frequently visited, and this neglect was
                    naturally greater during the period of the Saxon and Salic emperors from 908 to
                    1137. Diets, however, were held in the town in 951, 1015,1069, and 1109, and
                    councils in 1000 and 1006. From a privilege of Henry IV, in 1074, granting the
                    city of Worms freedom from tax in their trade with several royal cities, it
                    appears that Frankfort was even then a place of some commercial importance. In
                    1217 we find mention made of an imperial mint and a com market in the town.
                    About 1227 it was already in possession of a yearly fair. Between 1140 and the
                    beginning of the interregnum it saw 21 diets, and that of 1142 gave rise to the
                    Guelph and Ghibelline parties. No fewer than 10 new churches were erected in the
                    50 years from 1220 to 1270. It was about the same period, probably in 1240, that
                    the Jews first settled in the town. In the contest which Louis the Bavarian
                    maintained with the papal throne Frankfort sided with the emperor, and it was
                    consequently placed under an interdict for 20 years from 1329 to 1349. On
                    Louis’s death it refused to accept the papal conditions of pardon, and only
                    yielded to Charles IV., the papal elect, when Günther of Schwarzburg thought it
                    more prudent to abdicate in his favour. Charles granted the city a full amnesty,
                    and confirmed its liberties and privileges. By the famous bull of 1356, called
                    by way of distinction the Golden Bull, or, after the emperor, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bulla Carolina,</hi> Frankfort is declared the seat of the imperial elections
                    (Wahlstadt Reiches), and it still preserves an official contemporaneous copy of
                    the original document as the most precious of the eight imperial bulls in its
                    possession. In the 17th and 18th centuries, says Kriegk, the bull was regarded
                    as the most notable sight of the city, and was only exhibited to persons of high
                    rank. From the date of the bull to the close of the empire, Frankfort retained
                    the position of “Wahlstadt,’’ and only five of the two-and-twenty monarchs who
                    ruled during that period were elected elsewhere. In 1388-89 Frankfort assisted
                    the South-German towns in their wars with the princes and nobles, and in a
                    consequent battle with the troops of the Palatinate, the town banner was lost
                    and carried to Kronberg, where it was long preserved as a trophy. On peace being
                    concluded in 1391, the town had to pay 12,562 florins, and this brought it into
                    great financial difficulties. In the course of the next 50 years debt was
                    contracted to the amount of 126,772 florins. The diet at Worms in 1495 chose
                    Frankfort as the seat of the newly instituted Imperial Chamber, or <hi
                    rend="italic">“Ilcichs-</hi><hi rend="italic">Kammergericħtf</hi> for the
                    settlement of discussions between the different states of the empire; and it was
                    not till 1527 that the chamber was removed to Spires. At the Reformation
                    Frankfort heartily joined the Protestant party, and in consequence it was hardly
                    treated both by the emperor Charles V. and by the archbishop of Mainz. It
                    refused to subscribe the Augsburg Recess, but at the same time it was not till
                    1536 that it was prevailed to join the Smalkaldic League. On the failure of this
                    confederation it opened its gates of its own accord to the imperial general
                    Büren on 29th Dec. 1546, although he had passed by the city, which he considered
                    too strong for the forces under his command. The emperor was merciful enough to
                    leave it in possession of its privileges, but he inflicted a fine of 80,000 gold
                    gulden, and the citizens had to endure till Oct. 1547 the presence of from 8000
                    to 10,000 soldiers. This resulted in a pestilence which not only lessened the
                    population but threatened to give the deathblow to the great annual fairs; and
                    at the close of the war it was found that it had cost the city no less than
                    228,931 gulden. In 1522 Frankfort was invested for three weeks by Maurice of
                    Saxony, who was still in arms against the emperor, but it continued to hold out
                    till peace was concluded between the principal combatants. Between 1612 and 1616
                    occurred the great Fettmilch insurrection, perhaps the most remarkable episode
                    in the internal history of Frank-tort. The magistracy had been acquiring more
                    and more the character of an oligarchy; all power was practically in the hands
                    of a few closely-related families; and the gravest peculation and malversation
                    took place without hindrance. The ordinary citizens were roused to assert their
                    rights, and they found leaders in Fettmilch, Gerngross, and Schopp, who carried
                    the contest to dangerous excesses, but lacked ability to bring it to a
                    successful issue. An imperial commission was ultimately appointed, and the three
                    principal culprits and several of their associates were executed in 1616, with
                    the barbarous devices of the times. It was not till 1801 that the last
                    mouldering head of the Fettmilch companydroτ&gt;pedunnoticed from that oldtower
                    which, from its position near the bridge, is known as the Brücken-thurm. In the
                    words of Dr Kriegk, who has furnished a detailed history of the whole period,
                    the insurrection completely destroyed* the political power of the guilds, gave
                    new strength to the supremacy of the patriciate, and brought no further
                    advantage to the rest of the citizens than a few improvements in the
                    organization and administration of the magistracy. The Jews, who had been
                    attacked by the popular party, rvere solemnly reinstated by imperial command in
                    all their previous privileges, and received full compensation for their losses.
                    During the Thirty Years’ War Flankfort did not escape. In 1631 Gustavus Adolphus
                    garrisoned it with 600 men, who remained in possession till they were expelled
                    four years later by the imperial general Lamboy. In 1792 the citizens had to pay
                    2,000,000 gulden to the French general Custine; and in 1796 Kleber bombarded the
                    town, and exacted 8,000,000 francs. The independence of Frankfort was brought to
                    an end in 1806, on the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine; and in 1810
                    it was made the capital of a grand-duchy of Frankfort, which had an area of 3215
                    square miles, with 302,100 inhabitants, and was divided into the four districts
                    of Frankfort, Aschaffenburg, Fulda, and Hanau. On the reconstitution of Germany
                    in 1815 it again became a free city, and in the following year it was declared
                    the seat of the German Confederation. In April 1833 occurred what is known as
                    the Frankfort Riot (Frankfurter Attentat), in which a number of German students,
                    assisted by the peasants of the vicinity, attempted to break up the diet. The
                    city joined the German Zollverein in 1836. During the revolutionary period of
                    1848 the people of Frankfort took a chief part in political movements, and the
                    streets of the town were more than once the scene of conflict. In the war of
                    1866 they were on the Austrian side. On the 16th of July the Prussian troops,
                    under General Vogel von Falkenstein, entered the town, and on the 8th of October
                    it was formally incorporated with the Prussian state. A fine of 6,000,000
                    florins was exacted. In 1871 the treaty which concluded the Franco-German war
                    was signed in the Swan Hotel by Prince Bismarck and Jules Favre, and it is
                    consequently known as the Frankfort Peace.</p>
