                    its founder, who selected it for his burying place, and it was by far the most
                    important. The first abbot was Sturmius, the son of noble Christian parents in
                    Noricum, who along with several other youths left their homes to follow
                    Boniface, and were trained by him for missionary work. Boniface, notwithstanding
                    his intense hatred of the Celtic missionaries, the true apostles of Germany, was
                    content to imitate their mode of evangelical work; and the monastery of Fulda,
                    though under Benedictine rule, in almost all respects resembled the great
                    missionary institutions of Tours and Iona. Sturmius was sent by his master to
                    seek for a convenient place for the monastery, and after two unsuccessful
                    efforts he at length found a spot on the banks of the Fulda which Boniface
                    approved of. A grant of the site, with four miles of surrounding demesne, was
                    obtained from Carloman. Boniface himself superintended the clearing of the
                    forest and the erection of the building. He sent Sturmius for a year to Italy to
                    visit monasteries, and especially to study the mode of life in the great
                    Benedictine convent of Monte Cassino. The Benedictine rule was adopted, and
                    Sturmius with seven companions began their work of preaching, education, and
                    civilization. They taught the rude tribes agriculture, masonry, and the other
                    arts of peace. Soon a school was formed, and the educational organization seems
                    to have resembled in the closest way that of the great Celtic monasteries. The
                    school at Fulda speedily became the most famous portion of the monastery, and
                    was the centre of the earlier mediaeval theological learning. Rabanus Maurus,
                    the first of the schoolmen, was a teacher in the convent school, and many of the
                    most famous princes of the times were educated in the lay-school. When Alcuin
                    laid the basis of the university system of mediaeval Europe, it was to Fulda as
                    well as to Durham and Scotland that he looked for help in carrying out his
                    designs. Fulda became the parent of many other missionary monasteries, the most
                    famous of these being Hirschau in Swabia. In 968 the abbot of Fulda was
                    recognized as primate of the other abbeys of Germany; but wealth and power
                    brought corruption. In the beginning of the 11th century the monastery had to be
                    reformed, and this was done by turning out the old monks, bringing a number of
                    new ones from Scotland, and reestablishing in all its strictness the old
                    Benedictine rule. The later history of Fulda has merely an antiquarian and local
                    interest. Its practical work was done when the evangelization of Germany was
                    complete; for Fulda, like the Celtic monasteries, was fitted for missionary work
                    and little else. Investigations have shown curious sympathies with the
                    Reformation of the 16th century among the abbots and monks of Fulda.</p>
