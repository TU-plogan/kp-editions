                <p><label type="entry">FEZZAN</label> (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Phazania,</hi>
                    or country of the Garamantes), a country of the Sahara region of North Africa,
                    forming a “kaimakamlik” of the. Ottoman vilayet of Tripoli, extends 390 miles N.
                    to S. from the town of Bonjem, lat. 30° 40' N., to Bir 0mah, on the route from
                    Murzuk to Bornu, in lat. 24° 10' N.; and 420 miles E. to W. from the Akakus
                    Mountains near Ghat in long. 10° 30' W. to the village of Wau-Squair in long.
                    18° 20' W. Its ill-defined limits run from Bonjem, within 50 miles of the
                    Mediterranean on the north, south-westward by the Bir-el-Hassi to the Akakus
                    range east of Ghat, thence eastward to the Bir Omah south of the village of
                    Tejerri, from that to Wau-Squair or Wau-Namus at its south-eastern corner, and
                    thence northward past Zella to Bonjem, embracing an area of about 156,000
                    English square miles, or nearly three times the extent of England.</p>
                <p>The general form of the country is determined by the ranges of hills called the
                    Jebel-es-Sôda or Black Mountain, and the Haruj-el-Aswad or Black Haruj, which
                    cross it along the parallel of 28° N., forming the northern edge of a broad
                    desert plateau and the water-parting of the Mediterranean drainage slope, and
                    shutting off the northern region from the depressions in which lie the oases of
                    Fezzan proper in the south.</p>
                <p>The Jebel-es-Sυda is described by M. Duveyrier as an isolated volcanic mass in
                    the midst of a <hi rend="italic">hammada</hi> or bare desert plateau of white
                    limestone. Its length E. to W. is about 170 miles. At a point near the pass by
                    which M. Duveyrier crossed it, a summit reaches a height of 2415 feet; where
                    Rohlfs <hi rend="italic">(Quer durch Afrika,</hi> Leipsic, 1874) passed over it
                    between Tripoli and Murzuk he found its height to be 2982 feet. The volcanic
                    mass of the Haruj continues the line of the Soda in a S.E. direction for about
                    150 miles, and is crossed obliquely by the caravan routes from Fezzan to Egypt.
                    Where Von Beurmann crossed the Haruj on the route from Zella to Murzuk he
                    estimates its height at 1660 feet. The plateau of which these ranges mark the
                    northern edge appears to be a continuation of the great desert plateau of
                    Tripoli called the Hammada-el-Homra, and to have a general width of about 70
                    miles; where it is crossed on the western route over the Soda it is described as
                    shingly broken table-land, scattered over with large sandstone blocks; in the
                    neighbourhood of the Haruj on the east it presents a series of ridges running in
                    different directions 8 to 12 feet above the intermediate land. The wadis or
                    periodically filled rain-channels which drain northward from these heights are
                    for the most part tributaries of the Wadi-Um-el-Cheil, which is called Wadi Bel
                    where it opens on the coast of the greater Syrtis, and of the Wadi Tarnet east
                    of the former.</p>
                <p>The southern edge of the plateau behind the Soda descends to the Wadi-e-Shati
                    running east and west; then follows a latitudinal belt of about 70 miles in
                    average width, occupied by the sand dunes of Edeyen<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“E&lt;leyen” in Temâhag signifies
                    &lt;luπβ3.—Duveyrier.</p></note> which run across the frontier from the north of
                    the Tuareg plateau in the west, and in the east by <hi rend="italic">Serir,</hi>
                    the name applied to districts which differ from the hammada or true plateaus, in
                    being less elevated and everywhere covered with coarse gravel or rounded
                    water-worn stones, in contrast to the sharply broken blocks scattered on the
                    higher table-lands. To this follows southward the narrower belt called the
                    Hammada of Murzuk, of inconsiderable elevation, marked out on the north side by
                    the Amsak ridge which falls to the Wadi-el-Gharbi and its continuation the
                    Wadi-e-Sherki at its base, and which descends on the south to the line of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hofra,</hi> or slight depressions iu which lie the oasis groups of
                    Murzuk, Zuila, and Wau. Along the northern side of the Wadi-e-Sherki and
                    Wadi-el-Gharbi, about 60 miles N.W. of Murzuk, lie the celebrated Trona lakes of
                    Fezzan, which were first described by Dr Vogel. They are situated in a desert of
                    drift sand in which the camels sink up to their bellies; one of them, the
                    Bahr-el-Daud (Dauda = “worm ”), contains the remarkable shrimp noticed below. In
                    general the surface of Fezzan does not vary greatly in elevation; its numerous
                    wadis do not lie much below the level of the <hi rend="italic">Serir;</hi> the
                    height of Murzuk, for example, is estimated by Rohlfs at 1804 feet, or little
                    below the general level of the hammada in the north.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The average temperature of Murzuk was found by
                    Rohlfs to be 70° F., or 6° lower than that of Ghadames on the borders of western
                    Tripoli. This difference he accounts for by the greater winter cold, for the
                    heat of summer is probably greater here than in Tripoli; and his meteorological
                    tables show such low temperatures as 25° F. at sunrise on the 20th of December,
                    or 23° F. on the 30th of January, the thermometer having fallen below the
                    freezing point 24 times within three months. As in ail the rest of the desert,
                    the climate is a very regular one, and is in general healthy, the dryness of the
                    air in summer making the heat more bearable than on the sea coast, where the
                    moisture of the atmosphere hinders evaporation from the skin. Although Fezzan
                    does not lie within the zone of the tropical rains, and scarcely touches the
                    limit of the winter rains supplied by the Mediterranean, it is visited at rare
                    intervals by showers from the south. An almost perpetual blue sky overhangs the
                    desert, and the people of Fezzan are so unaccustomed to and so ill-prepared for
                    wet weather that, as in Tuat and Tidikelt, they pray to be spared from rain.
                    They are not dependent upon it, for water is found almost everywhere at small
                    depths, and little trouble is required to draw it from wells worked by men or
                    camels for the purposes of irrigation; the palm groves, indeed, require no
                    artificial watering, since their roots strike deep enough to reach the
                    water-bearing stratum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Products.—</hi> In the oases and cultivated spots of Fezzan
                    there are generally five grain harvests in the year: in the winter months wheat
                    and barley are sown, and in spring, summer, and autumn the various kinds of
                    durra, especially <hi rend="italic">ksob</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gafoli.</hi>
                    Ksob, first sown in March, is planted and reaped four times successively,
                    although the last harvest in December does not ripen, so that it is used only as
                    fodder for cattle. From year’s end to year’s end all kinds of vegetables could
                    be produced, but only a few sorts, such as melons and cucumbers in summer,
                    turnips and tubers in autumn, beans in winter, &amp;c., are grown. Among other
                    cultivated plants are tobacco (small and bad) and cotton. The latter flourishes,
                    is perennial for six or seven years, and gives large pods of moderate length of
                    staple. Olives, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n138/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0138-0129"/> figs, and almonds are the chief fruits, besides
                    the date, which is the great wealth of the land. The number of sorts of
                    date-palm found in the oases is very large: in that of Murzuk alone more than 30
                    varieties are counted, the most esteemed being named the Tillis, Tuati, and
                    Auregh. In all Fezzan the date is the staple food, not only for men, but for
                    camels, horses, and dogs. Even the stones of the fruit are softened and given to
                    the cattle. The huts of the poorer classes are entirely made of date-palm
                    leaves, and the more substantial habitations consist chiefly of the same
                    material. The produce of the tree is small, 100 full-grown trees yielding only
                    about 40 cwts. of dates, worth about 30s. at Murzuk, and about four times that
                    sum at Tripoli. They may generally be preserved about two years.</p>
                <p>Domestic animals include only the camel (in two varieties, the Tebu or Sudan
                    camel and the Arabian, differing very much in size, form, and capabilities),
                    domestic fowls, and pigeons,—for the few horses, perhaps 50 in all Fezzan, and
                    the miserable cattle, sheep, and goats imported, scarcely deserve mention. There
                    are no large carnivora in Fezzan; even the hyena and jackal are absent. In the
                    uninhabited oases gazelles and antelopes are occasionally found, but they are by
                    no means abundant. Among birds are sparrows, swallows, ravens, falcons, and
                    vultures; in summer wild pigeons and ducks are numerous, but in winter they seek
                    a warmer climate. There are no remarkable insects or snakes. A species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Artemia</hi> or brine shrimp, about a quarter of an inch in
                    length, of a colour resembling the bright hue of the gold fish, is fished for
                    with cotton nets in the Bahr-el-Daud before noticed, and, mixed with dates and
                    kneaded into a paste, which has the taste and smell of salt herring, is
                    considered a luxury by the people of Fezzan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">People.—</hi> The inhabitants of Fezzan are undoubtedly a mixed
                    people, derived from the surrounding Teda and Bornu on the south, Tuareg of the
                    plateaus on the west, Berbers and Arabs from the north. In colour the people
                    vary from black to pure white, but the prevailing hue of skin is a Malay-like
                    yellow, the features and woolly hair being negro. The chief languages in use in
                    Fezzan are, first, the Kamiri or Bornu language, which is spoken by little
                    children before they learn Arabic, and, secondly, Arabic itself. Many understand
                    Targish, the Teda, and Haussa languages. If among such a mixed people there can
                    be said to be any national language, it is that of Bornu, which is most widely
                    understood and spoken. The people of Sokna, north of the Jebel-es-Sôda, have a
                    peculiar Berber dialect which Rohlfs found to be very closely allied to that of
                    Ghadames. The natives of Fezzan are mild and conciliatory. As soon as one has
                    passed the frontier of their country there is no more need to fear robbers; and
                    this is the more remarkable since Tebus, who bear a thievish character in their
                    own country, are very numerous. The men wear a haik or barakan like those of
                    Tripoli, and a fez; short hose, and a large loose shirt called mansaria, with
                    red or yellow slippers, complete their toilet. Yet one often sees the large blue
                    or white <hi rend="italic">tobe</hi> of Sudan and Bornu, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">litham</hi> or shawl-muffler of the Tuareg, wound round the mouth
                    to keep out the blown sand of the desert. The women, who so Jong as they are
                    young have very plump forms, and who are generally small, are more simply
                    dressed, as a rule, in the barakan, wound round their bodies; they seldom wear
                    shoes, but generally have sandals made of palm leaf. Like the Arab women they
                    load arms and legs with heavy metal rings, which are of silver among the more
                    wealthy; a single one of these rings sometimes weighs a French pound. The hair,
                    thickly greased with butter, soon catching the dust, which forms a crust over
                    it, is done up in numberless little plaits round the head, in the same fashion
                    as in Bornu and Haussa. Little children run about naked until they attain the
                    age of puberty, which comes very early, for mothers of ten or twelve years of
                    age are not uncommon. Morality is at a very low stage, and the Fezzanians live a
                    careless and happy life: every evening the sounds of music and dancing are
                    heard.</p>
                <p>The greater number live in huts of palm leaves, which are set up in the simplest
                    manner; sometimes there is a small outer hut, which is plastered outside with
                    mud, and serves a3 a winter dwelling; the two are then surrounded by a little
                    palm fence. Towns, like the capital Murzuk, are either built of stone or of
                    lumps of earth, as these may be convenient to the site, but beyond the town wall
                    nothing is to be seen but palm huts.</p>
                <p>The houses are generally one-floored, and have one or two rooms; sometimes there
                    is a little courtyard; all are windowless, and have only a low doorway. Dates,
                    as has been already noticed, form the staple food, and camels’ flesh is only
                    eaten in the towns. In Murzuk, on an average, three camels are slaughtered every
                    day, with one sheep and one goat, which serve for the whole population without
                    and within the walls of about 8000∙</p>
                <p>With regard to the numbers of the population of Fezzan the estimates of various
                    travellers, in the absence of any trustworthy data, are widely different.
                    Hornemann gives 70,000 to 75,000, Richardson only 26,000, Vogel 54,000. Rohlfs,
                    who visited Fezzan at a prosperous period in 1865, believes the number 200,000
                    to be a moderate estimate; but Nachtigal, in 1870, thinks the whole population
                    cannot exceed 40,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> Fezzan is governed by a kalmakam or lieu
                    tenant-governor, under the governor of the vilayet, province, or regency of
                    Tripoli. At the time of Rohlfs’s visit, the twelve mudirates or districts into
                    which it had formerly been divided had been reduced to seven, but the Government
                    was on the point of restoring the twelve districts, and of marking out their
                    limits more distinctly. These districts are those of Bonjem, Sokna, Shati,
                    Temenhint, Sebha, Wadi Sherki, Wadi Gharbi, Hofra, Sherguîa, Zella, Rhodua, and
                    Gatron. All the mudirs are appointed by the kalmakam of Fezzan, and deposed by
                    him, if he should see fit, without reference to the mushir of Tripoli. The
                    government is like that of the other Turkish provinces, practically absolute—for
                    the will of the kalmakam or the mudir is law— although in form constitutional,
                    since a mijelis or council, in most cases only imaginary, is supposed to have a
                    voice in the legislature.</p>
                <p>Although the inhabited parts of Fezzan are naturally rich and fertile, the
                    Turkish Government shows little skill in taking advantage of its resources.
                    Under the most favourable circumstances the direct revenue of the country
                    amounts to about 800,000 piastres, or about £72,000. Besides this, however, the
                    Government receives a large sum from the sale of dates. Round Murzuk alone the
                    number of palm trees belonging to the Government is reckoned by Rohlfs at a
                    million. The direct receipts serve to salary the officials, including the
                    kalmakam and the troops, who, however, are not very regularly paid. Except it
                    may be a present of slaves or other articles sent by the kalmakam, not a
                    farthing passes to Tripoli or Constantinople. On the contrary, all clothing,
                    arms, even provisions, such as rice, sugar, and coffee for the soldiers, come
                    from Tripoli or Stamboul. At the time of M. Duveyrier’s visit the garrison of
                    Murzuk consisted of 250 men of the regular Ottoman army (redîf), nearly all
                    natives of Fezzan or negroes. At a later date Rohlfs found a garrison of 500
                    men.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade.—</hi> The commerce of Fezzan is unimportant, and has
                    never been great. The country serves as a depot or middle station between Bornu
                    and its surrounding negro states in the south and Tripoli and Egypt in the
                    north, the caravan <pb break="no"

                    and centring at Murzuk. In later times the slave trade seems rather to have
                    increased than diminished: the slaves are partly sent on to be sold in Tripoli
                    and Tunis, partly by Aujila towards Egypt. The whole number that pass northward
                    by the main caravan route from Kuka in Bornu is estimated at 10,000
                    annually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> Murzuk, the present capital, lies in the western
                    corner of the Hofra depression, in lat. 25° 55' N. and long. 14° 10' E. It was
                    founded about 1310. One of the earliest buildings was the kasbah in the west of
                    the town. The Turks have restored it as well as the wall of the town, which
                    forms almost a perfect square. The town is cut in two by a wide street, the <hi
                    rend="italic">deηdal,</hi> with shops on each side, which open at each end to
                    the chief gates. The population within its walls is estimated by Rohlfs at 3000,
                    excluding the garrison of 500 men; with its extra-mural huts it may have 8000
                    inhabitants. In its main streets a busy market is held in which provisions,
                    meat, bread, and vegetables are bought; but it is insignificant in comparison
                    with some of the other markets of the Sahara, such as that of Abuam in Tafilet.
                    There are two Turkish coffee-houses which are busily frequented. Sokna, about
                    midway between Tripoli and Murzuk, situated on a great gravel plain north of the
                    Soda range, seems to stand next to Murzuk in point of importance. Its population
                    was estimated by Vogel at 2500. The other noteworthy centres of population
                    are—Zuila and Temissa, on the route towards Egypt, E.N.E. of Murzuk; Germa, or
                    Djerma, a walled place in the Wadi Sherki, 70 miles N.W. of Murzuk, near which
                    was the ancient capital of Garama, which gave its name to the nation of the
                    Garamantes; Gatron (1000 inhabitants) and Tejerri on the southern route towards
                    Bomu, the latter being the frontier castle round which a village of low mud huts
                    has grown up; Sebha in its oasis 90 miles N.N.E. of Murzuk; Fughâa on the
                    plateau S.W. of the Haruj-el-Aswad; and Zella at the northern base of that
                    range.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The group of oases in the south of the present
                    country of Fezzan represents the ancient Phazania, which has had for its
                    capitals at successive periods Germa or Djerma under the Garamantes, Garama
                    under the Romans, Trâghen under the Nesûr, Zuila under the conquering Arabs, and
                    Murzuk under the dynasty of Uled Mohammed, under Abd-el-Jelîl, and under the
                    Turks. The capital of the Garamantes is found under the name of
                    Djerma-el-Kedîma, south of the modern Djerma (N.W. of Murzuk), in a sort of bay
                    formed by the hill edge of Amsâk. The capital under the Nesûr is represented
                    still by the ruins of the ancient castle of Trâghen (40 miles E. of Murzuk). Of
                    the Garama of the Romans there remains now only one well-preserved monument,
                    which is depicted in M. Duveyrier’s work <hi rend="italic">(Les Touaregs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Hord,</hi> Paris, 1864) situated amid ruins to the south of
                    modern Djerma. Zuila, the Arab capital, remains as the chief place of the
                    depression called the Sherguia, east of the Murzuk, through which the most
                    direct Egyptian route leads. Tradition and history are in accord in representing
                    the most ancient inhabitants of the oases to have been the Berâuna, a name under
                    which the Arabs group the negroes of Bornu as well as the Tebu. The oldest
                    dynasty of the Berâuna was that of the Nesûr, originally from the Sudan. Its
                    kings reigned at Trâghen, and were long in power before they were conquered and
                    dethroned by an Arab tribe, that of Khormân, who reduced the people of Fezzan to
                    a state of slavery. During this period of bondage, a sherif of Morocco,
                    Sîd-el-Monteser-uld-Mohammed by name, on a pilgrimage to Mecca, passed through
                    Fezzan. Yielding to the supplications of the people, on his return from the
                    sacred city, he gathered a force of devotees and set out to liberate the
                    Fezzanians. He defeated and expelled the Khormân Arabs, and, being elected
                    sultan, founded the dynasty of Uled Mohammed. This dynasty, which reigned for
                    about 550 years, advanced the interests of the country, and gradually extended
                    its borders as far as Sokna in the north. The last of these sultans was killed
                    in the vicinity of Trâghen in 1811 by El-Mukkeni, one of the lieutenants of
                    Yousef-Pasha, the last sovereign of the independent Karamanli dynasty of
                    Tripoli. El-Mukkeni now made himself sultan of Fezzan, and became notorious by
                    his slaving expeditions into Nigritia, in which he advanced as far as Borgu, the
                    Bahr-el-ghazal, and Bagirmi. In 1831, after the lieutenant of the Karamanli had
                    reigned for 20 years, Abd-el-Jelîl, the celebrated chief of the Uled-Slimân
                    Arabs, usurped the sovereign authority, and held it for ten years, during which
                    time he maintained a contest which kept all Fezzan in a ferment. In 1841,
                    Tripoli having meanwhile been erected into a province of the Ottoman empire,
                    Bakir Bey was sent at the head of a column of troops to subjugate Fezzan. A
                    battle took place at El-Bagla, not far from the sea, in which Abd-el-Jeûl was
                    slain, and soon after this Fezzan was made a kalmakamlik of the Ottoman
                    empire.</p>
                <p>From 1811 onward there is no doubt about the facts above enumerated. Previous to
                    1811, the documents preserved by the marabouts of Trâghen show that the dynasty
                    of Uled-Mohammed occupied the throne of Fezzan for many centuries; but the date
                    of its establishment, 1261, is perhaps questionable. Μ. Duveyrier adduces a
                    number of proofs to show that the Berâuna above mentioned were identical with
                    the Garamantes, so that it becomes almost a matter of certainty that at a very
                    ancient date a negro civilization prevailed over the northern Sahara; and that
                    this was very far advanced for its time is shown by the remains of remarkable
                    hydraulic works, by tombs of distinct character, and by rock sculptures which
                    record the chief facts of their history.</p>
                <p>The most notable of the European travellers who have visited Fezzan, and to whose
                    works the student is referred for more detailed information regarding it, are,
                    taking them in the order of date, as follows :—Homemann, 1798; Lyon, 1819;
                    Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, 1822; Richardson, 1845; Barth, 1850-55; Vogel,
                    1854; Duveyrier, 1859-1861; Von Beurmann, 1862; Rohlfs, 1865; Nachtigal, 1870.
