                <p><label type="entry">FLAX</label>. The terms flax or lint (German <hi
                    rend="italic">Flachs,</hi> French <hi rend="italic">Lin,</hi> Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Linum)</hi> are employed at once to denote the fibre so called,
                    and the plant from which it is prepared. The flax plant <hi rend="italic">(Linum
                    usitatissimum)</hi> belongs to the natural order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Linaceae,</hi> and, like most plants which have been long under cultivation, it
                    possesses numerous varieties, while the wild or parent condition is not known.
                    As cultivated it is an annual with an erect stalk rising to a height of from 20
                    to 40 inches, with alternate, sessile, linear-lanceolate leaves, branching only
                    at the top into a corymbose panicle of bright blue flowers. The flowers are
                    regular and symmetrical, having five ovate-acute, slightly ciliate sepals, five
                    deciduous petals, and a syncarpous pentacarpellary ovary with five distinct
                    styles. The fruit or boll is round, containing five cells or loculaments, each
                    of which is divided into two by a spurious dorsal dissepiment, thus forming ten
                    divisions, each of which contains a single seed. The seeds, well known as
                    linseed, are flat, oval in form, dark brown in colour, with a smooth shining
                    mucilaginous <pb break="no"

                    other species which have been and are cultivated to an inconsiderable extent as
                    sources of fibre, as the Greek or spring flax <hi rend="italic">{L.</hi><hi

                    parts of Austria, and the narrow-leaved flax <hi rend="italic">{L.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">angustifolium),</hi> which was utilized at a very remote
                    period.</p>
                <p>The cultivation and preparation of flax are the most ancient of all textile
                    industries, very distinct traces of their existence during the stone age being
                    preserved to the present day. “The use of flax,” says Keller <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lake Dwellings of Switzerland,</hi> translated by J. E. Lee), “reaches back to
                    the very earliest periods of civilization, and it was most extensively and
                    variously applied in the lake dwellings even in those of the stone period. But
                    of the mode in which it was planted, steeped, heckled, cleansed, and generally
                    prepared for use, we can form no idea any more than we can of the mode or tools
                    employed by the settlers in its cultivation Rough or unworked flax is found in
                    the lake dwellings made into bundles, or what are technically called heads, and,
                    as much attention was given to this last operation, it was perfectly clean and
                    ready for use.” As to its applications at this early period, Keller
                    remarks—“Flax was the material for making lines and nets for fishing and
                    catching wild animals, cords for carrying the earthenware vessels and other
                    heavy objects; in fact one can hardly imagine how navigation could be carried
                    on, or the lake dwellings themselves be erected, without the use of ropes and
                    cords; and the 'erection of memorial stones (menhirs, dolmens) at whichever era,
                    and to whatever people these monuments may belong, would be altogether
                    impracticable without the use of strong ropes.” As to the variety of flax
                    cultivated by the prehistoric races, Dr Heer is of opinion that it was the
                    small-leaved flax <hi rend="italic">{Linunι</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >angustifolium),</hi> a plant native of the Mediterranean coasts from Greece and
                    Dalmatia to the Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>That flax was extensively cultivated and was regarded as of much importance at a
                    very early period in the world’s history there is abundant testimony. Especially
                    in ancient Egypt the fibre occupied a most important place, linen having been
                    there not only generally worn by all classes, but it was the only material the
                    priestly order was permitted to wear, while it was most extensively used as
                    wrappings for embalmed bodies and for general purposes. In the Old Testament we
                    are told that Pharaoh arrayed Joseph “in vestures of fine linen” (Gen. xlii.
                    42), and among the plagues of Egypt that of hail destroyed the flax and barley
                    crops, “for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled” (Exod. ix. 31).
                    Further, numerous pictorial representations of flax culture and preparation
                    exist to the present day on the walls of tombs and in Egypt. Sir J. G. Wilkinson
                    in his description of ancient Egypt shows clearly the great antiquity of the
                    ordinary processes of preparing flax. “At Beni Hassan,” he says, “the mode of
                    cultivating the plant, in the same square beds now met with throughout Egypt
                    (much resembling our salt pans), the process of beating the stalks and making
                    them into ropes, and the manufacture of a piece of cloth are distinctly pointed
                    out.” The preparation of the fibre as conducted in Egypt is illustrated by
                    Pliny, who says—“The stalks themselves are immersed in water, warmed by the heat
                    of the sun, and are kept down by weights placed upon them, for nothing is
                    lighter than flax. The membrane, or rind, becoming loose is a sign of their
                    being sufficiently macerated. They are then taken out and repeatedly turned over
                    in the sun until perfectly dried, and afterwards beaten by mallets on stone
                    slabs. That which is nearest the rind is called <hi rend="italic">stupa</hi> [‘
                    tow’], inferior to the inner fibres, and fit only for the wicks of lamps. It is
                    combed out with iron hooks until the rind is all removed. The inner part is of a
                    whiter and finer quality. Men are not ashamed to prepare it” (Pliny, <hi
                    rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xix. 1). For many ages, even do
                    wn to the early part of the 14th century, Egyptian flax occupied the foremost
                    place in the commercial world, being sent into all regions with which open
                    intercourse was maintained. Among Western nations it was, without any
                    competitor, the most important of all vegetable fibres till towards the close of
                    the 18th century, when, after a brief struggle, cotton took its place as the
                    supreme vegetable fibre of commerce.</p>
                <p>Flax, as a field crop, having been described under the heading <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agriculture</hi> (see vol. i. p. 380), it is unnecessary to
                    dwell here on that feature of the subject. When flax is cultivated primarily on
                    account of the fibre, the crop ought to be pulled before the capsules are quite
                    ripe, when they are just beginning to change from a green to a pale brown
                    colour, and when the stalks of the plant have become yellow throughout about
                    two-thirds of their height. The various operations through which the crop passes
                    from this point till flax ready for the market is produced are—(1) pulling, (2)
                    rippling, (3) retting, and (4) scutching.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pulling</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rippling</hi> may be
                    dismissed very briefly. Flax is always pulled up by the root, and under no
                    circumstances is it cut or shorn like cereal crops. The pulling ought to be done
                    in dry clear weather; and care is to be taken in this, as in all the subsequent
                    operations, to keep the rootends even, and the stalks parallel. At the same time
                    it is desirable to have, as far as possible, stalks of equal length
                    together,—all these conditions having considerable influence on the quality and
                    appearance of the finished sample. As a general rule the removal of the “bolls”
                    or capsules by the process of <hi rend="italic">rippling</hi> immediately
                    follows the pulling, the operation being performed in the field; but under some
                    systems of cultivation, as, ∙for example, the Courtrai method, alluded to below,
                    the crop is made up into sheaves, dried, and stacked, and is only bolled and
                    retted in the early part of the next ensuing season. The best rippler, or
                    apparatus for rippling, consists of a kind of comb having, set in a wooden
                    frame, iron teeth made of round-rod iron three-sixteenths of an inch asunder at
                    the bottom, and half an inch at the top, and 18 inches long, to allow a
                    sufficient spring, and save much breaking of flax. The points should begin to
                    taper 3 inches from the top. A sheet or other cover being spread on the field,
                    the apparatus is placed in the middle of it, and two rippiers sitting opposite
                    each other, with the machine between them, work at the same time. It is
                    unadvisable to ripple the flax so severely as to break or tear the delicate
                    fibres at the upper part of the stem. The two valuable commercial products of
                    the flax plant, the seeds and the stalk, are separated at this point. We have
                    here to do with the latter only.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retting</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rotting</hi> is an operation
                    of the greatest importance, and one in connexion with which in recent years
                    numerous experiments have been made, and many projects and processes put forth,
                    with the view of remedying the defects of the primitive system or altogether
                    supplanting it. From the earliest times two leading processes of retting have
                    been practised, termed respectively water-retting and dew-retting; and as no
                    method has yet been introduced which satisfactorily supersedes these operations,
                    they will first be described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water-retting.—</hi> For this—the process by which flax is
                    generally prepared—pure soft water, free from iron and other materials which
                    might colour the fibre, is essential. Any water much impregnated with lime is
                    also specially objectionable. The dams or ponds in which the operation is
                    conducted are of variable size, but should be not more than 4 feet in depth. It
                    is calculated that a dam 50 feet long, 9 feet broad, and 4 feet deep is
                    sufficient to ret the produce of an acre of flax. The rippled stalks are tied in
                    small bundles and packed, roots downwards, in the dams <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n306/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0306-0295"/> till they are quite full; over the top of the
                    upper layer is placed a stratum of rushes and straw, or sods with the grassy
                    side downwards, and above all stones of sufficient weight to keep the flax
                    submerged. Under favourable circumstances a process of fermentation should
                    immediately be set up, which soon makes itself manifest by the evolution of
                    gaseous bubbles. After a few days the fermentation subsides; and generally in
                    from ten days to two weeks, the process ouglít to be complete; but everything
                    depends upon the weather; aud as the steeping is a critical operation, it is
                    essential that the stalks be frequently examined and tested as the process nears
                    completion. When it is found that the fibre separates readily from the woody
                    “shive” or core, the beets or small bundles are ready for removing from the
                    dams. It is next spread, evenly and equally, over a grassy meadow, where it is
                    left for about a fortnight, at the end of which time the fibres will have partly
                    separated from the core and “bowed.” At this point advantage is taken of fine
                    dry weather to gather up the flax, which is now ready for scutching, but the
                    fibre is improved by stocking and stacking it for some time before it is taken
                    to the scutching mill.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dew-retting</hi> is the process by which all the Archangel flax
                    and a large portion of that sent out from St Petersburg are prepared. By this
                    method the operation of steeping is entirely dispensed with, and the flax is,
                    immediately after pulling, spread on the grass where it is under the influence
                    of air, sun-light, night-dews, and rain. The process is tedious, the resulting
                    fibre is brown in colour, and. it is said to be peculiarly liable to undergo
                    heating (probably owing to the soft heavy quality of the flax) if exposed to
                    moisture and kept close packed with little access of air. Archangel flax is,
                    however, peculiarly soft and silky in structure, although in all probability
                    water-retting would result in a fibre as good or even better in quality.</p>
                <p>The theory of retting, according to the investigations of J. Kolb, is that a
                    peculiar fermentation is set up under the influence of heat and moisture,
                    resulting in a change of the intercellular substance—pectose or an analogue of
                    that body—into pectin and pectic acid. The former, being soluble, is left in the
                    water; but the latter, an insoluble body, is in part attached to the fibres,
                    from which it is only separated by changing into soluble metapectic acid under
                    the action of hot alkaline ley in the subsequent process of bleaching.</p>
                <p>To a large extent retting continues to be conducted in the primitive fashions
                    above described, although numerous and persistent attempts have been made to
                    improve upon it, or to avoid the process altogether. The uniform result of all
                    experiments has only been to demonstrate the scientific soundness of the
                    ordinary process of water-retting, and all the proposed improvements of recent
                    times seek to obviate the tediousness, difficulties, and uncertainties of the
                    process as carried on in the open air. In the early part of the present century
                    much attention was bestowed, especially in Ireland, on a process invented by Mr
                    James Lee. He proposed to separate the fibre by <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi>
                    purely mechanical means without any retting whatever; but after the Irish Linen
                    Board had expended many thousands of pounds aud much time in making experiments
                    and in erecting his machinery, his entire scheme ended in complete failure.
                    About the year 1851 Chevalier Claussen sought to revive a process of
                    “cottonizing” flax—a method of proceeding which had been suggested
                    three-quarters of a century earlier. Claussen’s process consisted in steeping
                    flax fibre or tow for twenty-four hours in a weak solution of caustic soda, next
                    boiling it for about two hours in a similar solution, and then saturating it in
                    a solution containing 5 per cent, of carbonate of soda, after which it was
                    immersed in a vat containing water acidulated with a half per cent, of sulphuric
                    acid. The action of the acid on the carbonate of soda with which the fibre was
                    impregnated caused the fibre to split up into a fine cotton-like mass, which it
                    was intended to manufacture in the same manner as cotton. A process to turn good
                    flax into bad cotton had however, on the face of it, not much to recommend it to
                    public acceptance; and Claussen’s process therefore remains only as an
                    interesting and suggestive experiment.</p>
                <p>The only modification of water-retting which has hitherto endured the test of
                    prolonged experiment, and taken a firm position as a distinct improvement, is
                    the warm-water retting patented in England in 1846 by an American, Robert B.
                    Schenck. For open pools and dams Schenck substitutes large wooden vats under
                    cover, into which the flax is tightly packed in an upright position. The water
                    admitted into the tanks is raised to and maintained at a temperature of from 75°
                    to 95° Fahr, during the whole time the flax is in steep. In a short time a brisk
                    fermentation is set up, gases at first of pleasant odour, but subsequently
                    becoming very repulsive, being evolved, and producing a frothy scum over the
                    surface of the water. The whole process occupies only from 50 to 60 hours. A
                    still further improvement, due to Mr Pownall, comes into operation at this
                    point, which consists of immediately passing the stalks as they are taken out of
                    the vats between heavy rollers over which a stream of pure water is kept
                    flowing. By this means, not only is all the slimy glutinous adherent matter
                    thoroughly separated, but the subsequent processes of breaking and scutching are
                    much facilitated.</p>
                <p>A process of retting by steam was introduced by W. Watt of Glasgow in 1852, and
                    subsequently modified and improved by J. Buchanan. The system possessed the
                    advantages of rapidity, being completed in about 10 hours, and freedom from any
                    noxious odour; but it yielded only a harsh, ill-spinning fibre, and consequently
                    failed to meet the sanguine expectations of its promoters.</p>
                <p>In connexion with improvements in retting, Mr Michael Andrews, the energetic
                    secretary of the Belfast Flax Supply Association, has made some suggestions and
                    experiments which deserve close attention. In a paper contributed to the
                    International Flax Congress at Vienna in 1873, he entered into details regarding
                    an experimental rettery he had formed, with the view of imitating by artificial
                    means the best results obtained by the ordinary methods. In brief, Mr Andrews’s
                    method consists in introducing water at the proper temperature into the retting
                    vat, and maintaining that temperature by keeping the air of the chamber at a
                    proper degree of heat. By this means the flax is kept at a uniform temperature
                    with great certainty, since even should the heat of the air vary considerably
                    through neglect, the water in the vat only by slow degrees follows such
                    fluctuations. “It may be remarked,” says Mr Andrews, “that the superiority
                    claimed for this method of retting flax over what is known as the ‘ hot-water
                    steeping ’ is uniformity of temperature; in fact the experiments have
                    demonstrated that an absolute control can be exercised over the means adopted to
                    produce the artificial climate in which the vats containing the flax are
                    situated.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scutching</hi> is the process by which the fibre is freed from
                    its woody core and rendered fit for the market. For ordinary water-retted flax
                    two operations are required, first <hi rend="italic">breaking</hi> and then <hi
                    rend="italic">scutching,</hi> and these are done either by hand labour or by
                    means of small scutching or lint mills, driven either by water or steam power.
                    Hand labour, aided by simple implements, is still much used in Continental
                    countries; but the use of scutching mills is now very general, these being more
                    economical, and turning out flax of a much better quality. The breaking is done
                    by passing the stalks between grooved rollers, to which in some cases a
                    reciprocating motion is communicated<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0307-0296"/>, and the broken shives are beaten out by
                    suspending the fibre in a machine fitted with a series of revolving blades,
                    which, striking violently against the flax, shake out the bruised and broken
                    woody cores. A great many modified scutching machines and processes have been
                    proposed and introduced with the view of promoting economy of labour and
                    improving the turn-out of fibre, both in respect of cleanness and in producing
                    the least proportion of codilla or scutching tow.</p>
                <p>The celebrated Courtrai flax of Belgium is the most valuable staple in the
                    market, on account of its fineness, strength, and particularly bright colour.
                    There the flax is dried in the field, and housed or stacked during the winter
                    succeeding its growth, and in the spring of the following year, it is retted in
                    crates sunk in the sluggish waters of the river Lys. After the process has
                    proceeded a certain length, the crates are withdrawn, and the sheaves taken out
                    and stooked. It is thereafter once more tied up, placed in the crates, and sunk
                    in the river to complete the retting process; but this double steeping is not
                    invariably practised. When finally taken out, it is unloosed and put up in
                    cones, instead of being grassed, and when quite dry it is stored for some time
                    previous to undergoing the operation of scutching. In all operations the
                    greatest care is taken, and the cultivators being peculiarly favoured as to
                    soil, climate, and water, Courtrai flax is a staple of unapproached
                    excellence.</p>
                <p>An experiment made by Professor Hodges of Belfast on 7770 5&gt; of air-dried flax
                    yielded the following results. By rippling he separated 1946 lb of bolls which
                    yielded 910 lb of seed. The 5824 lb (52 cwt.) of flax straw remaining lost in
                    steeping 13 cwt., leaving 39 cwt. of retted stalks, and from that 6 cwt. 1 qr. 2
                    lb (702 ft&gt;) of finished flax was procured. Thus the weight of the fibre was
                    equal to about 9 per cent, of the dried flax with the bolls, 12 per cent, of the
                    bolled straw, and over 16 per cent, of the retted straw. One hundred tons
                    treated by Schenck’s method gave 33 tons bolls, with 27'50 tons of loss in
                    steeping; 32'13 tons were separated in scutching, leaving 5'90 tons of finished
                    fibre, with 1'47 tons of tow and pluckings. The following analysis of two
                    varieties of heckled Belgian flax is by Dr Hugo Müller (Hoffmann’s <hi

                    from 20 to 140 centimetres, the length of the individual cells being from 2'0 to
                    4'0 millimetres, and the limits of breadth between 0'012 and 0 <hi

                <p>Among the circumstances which have retarded improvement both in the growing and
                    preparing of flax, the fact that, till comparatively recent times, the whole
                    industry was conducted only on a domestic scale has had much influence. At no
                    very remote date it was the practice in Scotland for every small farmer and
                    cotter not only to grow lint ’ or flax in small patches, but to have it retted,
                    scutched, cleaned, spun, woven, bleached, and finished entirely within the
                    limits of his own premises, and all by members or dependants of the family. The
                    same practice obtained and still largely prevails in other countries. Thus the
                    flax industry was long kept away from the most powerful motives to apply to it
                    labour-saving devices, and apart from the influence of scientific inquiry for
                    the improvement of methods and processes. As cotton came to the front, just at
                    the time when machine-spinning and power-loom weaving were being introduced, the
                    result was that in many localities where flax crops had been grown for ages, the
                    culture gradually drooped and ultimately ceased. The linen manufacture by
                    degrees ceased to be a domestic industry, and began to centre in and become the
                    characteristic factory employment of special localities, which depended,
                    however, for their supply of raw material primarily on the operations of small
                    growers, working, for the most part, on the poorer districts of remote thinly
                    populated countries. The cultivation of the plant and the preparation of the
                    fibre have therefore, even at the present day, not come under the influence
                    (except in certain favoured localities) of scientific knowledge and experience,
                    and the greater part of the flax in use at the present moment is prepared
                    precisely by the processes employed in Egypt when the descendants of Jacob dwelt
                    in the land of Goshen.</p>
                <p>In England and Scotland the acreage under flax is now so limited, and it has
                    decreased with such steadiness and rapidity, that, as a crop, flax may be
                    regarded as practically extinct in these countries. Indeed, notwithstanding the
                    numerous measures by which Government sought during last century to foster flax
                    cultivation, and the direct grants to cultivators in Scotland, which down to the
                    year 1828 were paid by the board of trustees for fisheries and manufactures, the
                    cultivation cannot be said ever to have thriven in a healthy manner. The
                    following summary, showing the extent in acres of the cultivation in Great
                    Britain for the years 1870 till 1877 inclusive, has been communicated by Mr

                    experience is that it is a rapidly declining agricultural crop. In the time of
                    Queen Anne a board of trustees of the linen and hempen manufactures for Ireland
                    was instituted, by which body liberal grants were administered. The board
                    continued its operations till the parliamentary grants were withdrawn in 1827,
                    and itself dissolved in the following year. In 1841 a Royal Flax Society of
                    Ireland was formed, which received from Government an annual subsidy of £1000,
                    and it continued to exist till 1859. Still more recently a joint flax committee
                    of the Royal Dublin Society and the Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland was
                    formed, and administered grants from the imperial exchequer from the year 1864
                    till 1871. The acreage of Irish flax cultivated has fluctuated with these
                    subsidies, having reached a maximum of 181,909 acres in 1824, from which it
                    steadily declined to 53,863 acres in 1848. In 1853, partly stimulated by high
                    prices and scarcity owing to Russian complications, it it again rose to 174,579
                    acres; and the cotton famine consequent on the civil war in America again
                    greatly <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"

                    1862 onwards. The following are periodical returns from the registrar-general’s

                <p>It thus appears that the breadth of lands under flax in Russia alone is little
                    less than four-sevenths of the entire acreage devoted to the production of the
                    fibre, and that it alone produces practically one half of the total produce of
                    the world. The large extent to which the British manufacturers are dependent on
                    Russia is shown in the following table :—</p>

                <p>Messrs George Armitstead &lt;fc Co. of Dundee have courteously placed at our
                    disposal their flax list for the week ended 14th May 1878, which not only shows
                    the sources and varieties of flax found in the British market, but also gives an
                    idea of the relative value of the various staples. For the substance of the
                    remarks on the commerce which follow we have also to express obligation to that

                <p>The names and letters attached to the various brands are thus explained,

                <p>It will be observed that the “H” stands for “light” coloured flaxes; but besides
                    being bracked as above, any of the Riga crown flaxes which are of a “white” or
                    “grey” colour are laid aside and shipped from Riga as under (mostly, however, to
                    France and Belgium), viz. :—</p>
                <p>GK or WK, Grey crown, or white crown.</p>

                <p>Pernau flax is shipped as Livonian and Fellin sorts, the latter being the best.
                    The lowest mark of Pernau flax is the LOD. In addition to the exports from Riga
                    and Pernau, shipments of flax are made from Narva, Libau, Memel, and Revel; but,
                    as compared with the two first-mentioned ports, the flax trade of the others is
                    inconsiderable. The only remaining localities from which flax is extensively
                    exported to Scotland are Archangel and St Petersburg. From St Petersburg both
                    white and brown flax is sent, the former variety being water-retted, the latter
                    dew-retted. All the flax of Archangel is dew-retted.</p>
                <p>The Pscow, Louga, Staro Russ, and Saletsky flaxes are steeped or white flax,
                    whereas the Rjeff flax is dew-retted. There are many other kinds which come into
                    the Dundee market from St Petersburg, such as Melinki, Bejetsky, Ouglitch,
                    Kostroma, Jaroslav, Vologda, Wiasma, &amp;c., taking their names from the
                    various districts, and all dew-</p>
                <p>retted flax. These Petersburg brown flaxes are bracked mostly in 1st, 2d, 3d, and
                    4th crown, also Zabrack, the lowest mark. Some Petersburg sorts leave out the
                    1st crown and 4th crown, but in the Archangel flaxes all these marks appear, and
                    the Zabrack is divided into two sorts, 1st and 2d Zabrack.</p>
                <p>The distinction between codilla and tow is that the former is the tow or broken
                    and ravelled fibres produced in the scutching process, therefore often called
                    scutching tow, while tow proper is the similar product separated in the
                    subsequent operation of heckling the flax preparatory to spinning. See <hi
