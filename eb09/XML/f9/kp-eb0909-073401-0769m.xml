                    electoral title and the electoral lands, the remaining territories being divided
                    among his half-brothers. On his accession in 1688 this will was set aside, with
                    the sanction of the emperor, whose support he had obtained beforehand by signing
                    away in his father’s lifetime his rights in Schwiebus, a proceeding which, he
                    afterwards maintained, restored his claim to the Silesian principalities.
                    Frederick, having a strong love of pomp and show, strove hard to make his court
                    an imitation of that of Louis XIV. Although without his father’s firmness and
                    energy, he seized every occasion of increasing his dominions by purchase; and he
                    obtained, partly in virtue of certain claims inherited from his mother, partly
                    through the influence of William III. of England, the principality of
                    Neufchatel. It had been the intention of the Great Elector to give William III.
                    vigorous support both in his struggle for the English crown and in the wars with
                    France which were seen to be inevitable. Frederick gave effect to this purpose,
                    and his troops played an important part in the battle of the Boyne. In the
                    course of his reign he exercised considerable influence on European politics by
                    placing auxiliary forces at the disposal of friendly princes. The accession of
                    Augustus the Strong of Saxony to the throne of Poland fired his ambition, and
                    for years he endeavoured to induce the emperor Leopold I. to recognize him as
                    king of Prussia. At last, in November 1700, the emperor consented, insisting,
                    however, on various strict conditions, one of which was that in the approaching
                    war of the Spanish succession Prussia should contribute a force of 10,000 men to
                    the Austrian army. Immediately after receiving the imperial sanction, Frederick
                    started with his whole court for Königsberg, where, on January 18, 1701, with
                    much ceremony he crowned himself. He sent 20,000 men into the war of the Spanish
                    succession, and a portion of them did excellent service at the battle of
                    Blenheim. In 1706 Prince Leopold of Dessau led 6000 Prussians to victory at
                    Turin. Frederick died on the 25th February, 1713. By his extravagance he not
                    only exhausted the treasure amassed <pb break="no"

                    heavy taxes. He was not, however, an unpopular sovereign, and by making Prussia
                    a kingdom he undoubtedly advanced it several stages towards its future
                    greatness. He founded the university of Halle and the Berlin Academy of
                    Sciences, and was fond of protecting enlightened men who suffered persecution.
                    He was three times married, his second wife, Sophie Charlotte, sister of George
                    I. of England, being well known as the friend of Leibnitz and as one of the most
                    cultivated princesses of the age.</p>
