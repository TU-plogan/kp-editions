                    widely differing in style or execution. When Franz Francken the first found a
                    rival in Franz Francken the second, he described himself as the “elder,” in
                    contradistinction to his son, who signed himself the “younger.” But when Franz
                    the second was threatened with competition from Franz the third, he took the
                    name of “the elder,” whilst Franz the third adopted that of Franz “the younger.”
                    It is possible, though not by any means easy, to sift the works of these
                    artists. The eldest of the Franckens, Nicholas of Herenthals, died at Antwerp in
                    1596, with nothing but the reputation of having been a painter. None of his
                    works remain. He bequeathed his art to three children. Jerom Francken, the
                    eldest son, after leaving his father’s house, studied under Franz Floris, whom
                    he afterwards served as an assistant, and wandered, about 1560, to Paris. In
                    1566 he was one of the masters employed to decorate the palace of Fontainebleau,
                    and in 1574 he obtained the appointment of court painter from Henry III., who
                    had just returned from Poland and visited Titian at Venice. In 1603 when Van
                    Mander wrote his biography of Flemish artists, Jerom Francken was still in Paris
                    living in the then aristocratic Faubourg St Germain. Among his earliest works we
                    should distinguish a Nativity in the Dresden Museum, executed in co-operation
                    with Franz Floris. Another of his important pieces is the Abdication of Charles
                    V. in the Amsterdam Museum. Equally interesting is a Portrait of a Falconer,
                    dated 1558, in the Brunswick Gallery. In style these pieces all recall Franz
                    Floris. Franz, the second son of Nicholas of Herenthals, is to be kept in memory
                    as Franz Francken the first. He was born about 1544, matriculated at Antwerp in
                    1567, and died <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0738-0703"/> there in 1616. He, too, studied under Floris, and
                    never settled abroad, or lost the hard and gaudy style which he inherited from
                    his master. Several of his pictures are in the Museum of Antwerp, one dated 1597
                    in the Dresden Museum represents Christ on the road to Golgotha, and is signed
                    by him as D. υ (Den ouden) F. Franck. Ambrose, the third son of Nicholas of
                    Herenthals, has bequeathed to us more specimens of his skill than Jerom or Franz
                    the first. He first started as a partner with Jerom at Fontainebleau, then he
                    returned to Antwerp, where he passed for his guild in 1573, and he lived at
                    Antwerp till 1618. His best works are the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes and
                    the Martyrdom of St Crispin, both large and ambitious compositions in the
                    Antwerp Museum. In both these pieces a fair amount of power is displayed, but
                    marred by want of atmosphere and shadow, or by hardness of line and gaudiness of
                    tone. There is not a trace in the three painters named of the influence of the
                    revival which took place under the lead of Rubens. Franz Francken the first
                    trained three sons to his profession, the eldest of whom, though he practised as
                    a master of guild at Antwerp from 1600 to 1610, left no visible trace of his
                    labours behind. Jerom the second took service with his uncle Ambrose. He was
                    born in 1578, passed for his guild in 1607, and in 1620 produced that curious
                    picture of Horatius Codes defending the Sublician bridge which still hangs in
                    the Antwerp Museum. The third son of Franz Francken the first is Franz Francken
                    the second, who signed himself in pictures till 1616 “the younger,” from 1630
                    till his death “the elder” F. Francken. These pictures are usually of a small
                    size, and are found in considerable numbers in Continental collections. Franz
                    Francken the second was born in 1581. In 1605 he entered the guild, of which he
                    subsequently became the president, and in 1642 he died. His earliest composition
                    is the Crucifixion in the Belvedere at Vienna, dated 1606. His latest
                    compositions as “the younger” F. Francken are the Adoration of the Vif <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> gin (1616) in the Gallery of Amsterdam and the Woman
                    taken in Adultery (1628) in Dresden. From 1616 to 1630 many of his pieces are
                    signed F. Francken; then come the Seven Works of Charity (1630) at Munich,
                    signed “the elder F. F.,” the Prodigal Son (1633) at the Louvre, and other
                    almost countless examples. It is in F. Francken the second’s style that we first
                    have evidence of the struggle which necessarily arose when the old customs,
                    hardened by Van Orley and Floris, or Brueghel and De Vos, were swept away by
                    Rubens. But F.Franck the second, as before observed, always clung to small
                    surfaces; and though he gained some of the freedom of the moderns, he lost but
                    little of the dryness or gaudiness of the earlier Italo-Flemish revivalists. F.
                    Francken the third, the last of his name who deserves to be recorded, passed in
                    the Antwerp guild in 1639, and died at Antwerp in 1667. His practice was chiefly
                    confined to adding figures to the architectural or landscape pieces of other
                    artists. As Franz Pourbus sometimes put in the portrait figures for Franz
                    Francken the second, so Franz Francken the third often introduced the necessary
                    personages into the works of Pieter Neefs the younger (museums of St Petersburg,
                    Dresden, and the Hague), In a Moses striking the Rock, dated 1654, of the
                    Augsburg Gallery, this last of the Franckens signs D. õ (Den ouden) F. Franck.
                    In the pictures of this artist we most clearly discern the effects of Rubens’s
                    example.</p>
