                    upon freshly-laid plaster lime whilst it remains damp, with colours capable of
                    resisting the caustic action of the lime with which they are mixed or brought
                    into contact. Frescopainting might be called lime-painting, lime being the
                    vehicle with which the colours are fixed, but the term would not be sufficiently
                    distinctive, because colours mixed with lime may be applied under certain
                    conditions to plaster which has been allowed to dry, an art which the Italians
                    call painting “a secco,” to distinguish it from “a fresco” or painting on
                    newly-laid and still wet plaster. The art of painting with colours mixed with
                    lime is very ancient; it was in use in Egypt from the remotest periods of the
                    monumental history of that country; but as it was carried to perfection by the
                    Italians, it is needless to trace its development elsewhere than in Italy, where
                    the most primitive examples—those existing in Etruscan sepulchral chambers dug
                    in tufa—are marked by technical peculiarities which survive in fresco-painting
                    to this day. The walls of tufa were prepared by being whitewashed with lime,—a
                    method revived in mediaeval mural pictures; and the outlines of the figures were
                    drawn with a metal point or stylus, and subsequently coloured on the whitewash,
                    which from the percolation of water through the tufa remained permanently <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0805-0770"/> damp. In examples at Chiusi this outline is found
                    limited exclusively to the external forms of the figures, a custom which
                    reappears in mediaeval pictures of the school of the neighbouring Siena, whilst
                    drawing on wet plaster with the stylus belongs to this art in every age. The
                    colours used were earths, which were mixed with lime and laid on in fiat tints,
                    and earths for the most part are the colours still employed in fresco-painting.
                    The Romans, probably owing to Greek influence and example, carried the art much
                    further than their Etruscan predecessors, and established real fresco-painting
                    in Italy. Vitruvius remarks, “Colours when carefully applied on moist stucco do
                    not therefore fade, but last for ever. Stuccoed walls, when well executed, do
                    not easily become dirty, nor do they lose their colours when they require to be
                    washed, unless the painting was carelessly done, or executed after the surface
                    was dry.” This is emphatically descriptive of fresco-painting. In this art it is
                    essential that a given amount of plaster be laid for the painter at one time,—in
                    modern practice only enough for a day’s work,—and therefore frescos are readily
                    recognized by the joinings in the plaster, most frequently following the
                    outlines of the figures or other objects. These joinings vary in distinctness in
                    different works according to the skill of the plasterer. Sometimes they are
                    clearly perceptible, at other times they are only discoverable on minute
                    examination. It has been observed on painted walls in Pompeii that such joinings
                    exist, but they are further apart and less frequent than in modern works
                    generally, suggesting either that the ancient artists painted more rapidly, or
                    that several worked together on the same sheet of plaster, or that they knew how
                    to keep the plaster fresh for more than one day, which, considering their great
                    technical skill, is not improbable. Such wide divisions are found in the
                    fragments of a mural painting of the 14th century existing in Sta Croce, and in
                    others by Paolo Uccello, but this is explained by the completion of these
                    pictures in distemper, whilst the Pompeian paintings are in fresco; for, besides
                    the joinings, which are not inconsistent with the presence of tempera, there are
                    also marks showing the use of the stylus on damp plaster, and by experiments
                    made by the late Sir Humphry Davy, it has been shown that all the colours
                    employed contain lime; therefore they are fresco and not tempera.</p>
                <p>It may be doubted whether any works of art produced in later times could have
                    withstood the trials to which the mural paintings of Pompeii have been subjected
                    from the action of heat and damp, the latter for centuries, without serious
                    damage. The expression of Vitruvius that they would last for ever has been so
                    far justified. The processes of the ancients were not limited to
                    fresco-painting; they were familiar with others of great beauty and durability,
                    but these do not enter within the scope of the present notice. The construction
                    of the walls and the system of plastering then in use are more important
                    subjects of inquiry in connexion with fresco. Those unsurpassed builders, the
                    Romans, faced walls intended to be painted, with a lining of bricks set on edge,
                    detached by a small space from the main structure to which it was secured with
                    leaden clamps. This was a precaution against damp well worthy of imitation.
                    Generally, three preparatory coats of plaster were laid on this brick facing or
                    on any other description of wall, the first consisting of lime mixed with
                    pounded brick and pozzolana, the other two with lime and pozzolana. The
                    finishing coat was frequently composed of lime and pounded marble, which was
                    susceptible of an exquisite polish, after which it was painted by durable
                    processes, the secret of which is now lost. For fresco-painting the last coat or
                    intonaco consisted of lime mixed with sand only. A long gap now occurs in the
                    progress of mural painting. Its practice is feebly illustrated in tombs and
                    catacombs, interesting historically, but of little value technically. Finally it
                    was displaced for a time by mosaic, but it was again revived in the 13 th
                    century, that great epoch of the resuscitation of the fine arts. The works of
                    Giunta Pisano and some of his contemporaries in the upper church of St Francis
                    at Assisi, executed in the first half of the 13th century, clearly indicate a
                    knowledge of a system of fresco. In a history of the practice of this art these
                    mural paintings, with those of Cimabue and his colleagues or assistants, and
                    those by Giotto and his followers, deserve special consideration. They
                    illustrate the early processes of fresco and mural painting upon which all the
                    methods subsequently followed were based. It is evident from the structure of
                    the interior of the beautiful upper church of St Francis that the architect did
                    not provide for its being painted internally. It was complete in its admirable
                    masonry, and when it was determined to paint it, the only preparatory process
                    possible was to cover the aslar with a thin coat of intonaco about one-eighth of
                    an inch in thickness. Any plan of preparatory coats of plaster in the Roman
                    manner would have buried the string courses and other mouldings, and ruined the
                    proportions of the piers. True fresco-painting under such conditions was
                    consequently very difficult, for the thin intonaco, laid on a stone wall which
                    could not be soaked with water, of necessity dried rapidly. The mixed art of
                    fresco and distemper which was thus made imperative at Assisi prevailed in mural
                    painting, with certain modifications, for a long period everywhere.!</p>
                <p>The following is a brief statement of the methods of Giunta Pisano and Cimabue.
                    Both artists practised, if they did not inaugurate, the system of outlining
                    their subjec⅛ on the walls, which continued for two centuries, till it was
                    abandoned for the better plan of preparing cartoons* A sketch was first made,
                    and w as squared in the usual manner with vertical and horizontal lines drawn to
                    scale. The space to be painted was then squared proportionately, and, guided by
                    the squares, the artist outlined his subject full size with charcoal on the
                    wall. This done, with a hair pencil and some ochre mixed with water he passed
                    over the general lines, and then brushed off the charcoal; he next marked in the
                    entire composition with red “'terra rossa* mixed with water only, this time
                    entering more into detail, and even indicating the chiaroscuro. Where the
                    ancient intonaco has fallen off, these red outlines are visible; they have a
                    mysterious grandeur, and those by the hand of Cimabue prove the possession on
                    his part of freedom and power of drawing. Over these outlines the intonaco was
                    spread in portions, and on it the artist marked the squares once more, and drew
                    the outlines of the figures he meant to paint. . That the intonaco was prepared
                    in sections is proved, not only by the visible lines in the plaster, but also by
                    the falling off of the leg of a figure, showing the cut made by the artist when
                    he had finished his work. The cut follows the outline of the limb, and this
                    process suffices to show that fresco-painting was practised in the first half of
                    the 13th century, if any doubt should be entertained. The intonaco being spread,
                    the artist painted his subject in a slight manner with terra rossa, laying in
                    the chiaroscuro and details, after which the plaster was allowed to dry. The
                    picture thus prepared was then coloured in distemper, and completed in every
                    part. By the aid of Vasari and of Cennino Cennini a pupil of the school of
                    Giotto, who completed his treatise on painting on the 31st July 1437, we have
                    clear statements of the methods of mural painting followed by the Byzantine
                    artists, and subsequently by the Italians. Cennino, in the most express terms,
                    states that mural pictures, although commenced in fresco, were <hi rend="italic"
                    >always</hi> finished in distemper. The distempers used were a mixture of egg,
                    including both the albumen and the yolk, with the milky fluid which exudes from
                    twigs of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0806-0771"/> the fig tree; size made from glue or from gum
                    tragacanth is also mentioned. A list of the colours employed by Giotto and his
                    pupils and successors is given below; and the same, there can be little doubt,
                    were iu use on the part of Giunta, of Cimabue, and their contemporaries. Amongst
                    these white lead played an important part in painting on panels and on walls.
                    All who are familiar with old pictures must have frequently seen those of black
                    Madonnas and saints, held iu especial veneration for their sanctity and
                    antiquity. The colours with which they were painted were freely mixed with white
                    lead and with the yolk and albumen of egg, which darkens whilst the white lead
                    oxidizes; hence their present state.</p>
                <p>This partially explains the singular appearance presented by the mural pictures
                    of Giunta at Assisi, in which the shadows are red executed in fresco, and the
                    lights painted in distemper are black. The explanation is not entirely
                    satisfactory, however, for the change is not universal, and in a considerable
                    number of the pictures the colours have not changed; but wherever damp has
                    penetrated, the paintings have become very dark; the microscope would probably
                    show that this is due to the presence of fungus, the produce of the egg
                    distemper. As the works attributed to Cimabue are for the most part in better
                    preservation than those given to Giunta, they suggest that this great artist,
                    who did so much for design, also improved the technical processes of mural art.
                    He undoubtedly carried frescopainting further, although on thin intonaco; but he
                    prepared for the finishing processes as his predecessors had done. This
                    statement is based upon the examination of a Madonna and Child with Angels in
                    the lower church of St Francis, which is executed in the same manner as the
                    pictures in the upper church ascribed to Giunta. This fragment is so noble in
                    design, the heads are so beautiful, the whole work is so much better than the
                    picture of the Borgo Allegri, now in St Maria Novella Florence, that although in
                    its method it is like the works of Giunta, in design it is far beyond his
                    powers. Cimabue’s method of outlining on the wall has been described; but there
                    are traces of his use of the stylus, to which he had recourse when he wished to
                    alter an outline after the work was begun, and it is therefore evident that the
                    plaster was damp when he had recourse to this instrument. His preparations in
                    fresco being dry, he proceeded to paint the shadows of flesh with terra vert in
                    distemper, and then modelled the features with the requisite colours. That he
                    heightened the lights with white lead is apparent, for these have become black
                    even in places which damp did not reach. A glaring example of this is the
                    table-cloth in a picture of the Marriage at Cana in Gallilee, which, once white,
                    is now an intense black; the plates, viands, and vases upon it are unchanged in
                    colour; these no doubt are in pure fresco, which explains the difference.</p>
                <p>We can form no idea now of the splendid appearance which the paintings in the
                    interior of St Francis presented when newly done. There are abundant traces of
                    the use of a mordant for gilding, showing that the high lights upon dresses and
                    the edges of folds were gilt, as well as embroideries on the borders, and on the
                    aureoles of saints. It is obvious that such ideas were derived from mosaics, in
                    which the lights sparkle with gold. Regarded simply as decorative art, these
                    paintings at Assisi, with their clear bright colouring, the rich gilding, and
                    with the windows filled with coloured glass, must have been magnificent. The art
                    was very conventional, still the beginnings are perceptible of a higher
                    imitative system, and of a growing appreciation of truth to nature. The heads of
                    angels are characterized by expressive beauty; the bride in the Marriage at Cana
                    has a very pleasing face, and even the idea of portraiture is observable; the
                    look of surprise in the countenance of the husband is naturally expressed, and
                    with good taste. Those who have not seen these paintings, and only judge of the
                    merits of Cimabue by his altarpieces at Florence, can have little conception of
                    the ability of this remarkable artist.</p>
                <p>Beneath the paintings of Cimabue, and under the gallery which represents a
                    triforium, range the mural pictures of Giotto and his contemporaries or pupils.
                    By Giotto the art of fresco received a new impetus; he continued the mixed
                    method then prevalent, but with a more moderate use of distemper, and laid the
                    foundation of the system carried to perfection by his greatest successors. The
                    part of the wall which was assigned to him apparently admitted of thicker
                    plastering, for he caused preparatory coats of plaster to be spread with due
                    care; on the last of these, when dry, he no doubt made his outlines according to
                    the manner of his predecessors, and over these the intonaco was distributed with
                    singular dexterity. Plastering in his time was a branch of fine art, so that it
                    is at all times difficult to discover the joinings in the works of Giotto and
                    his followers. An account of his method of mural painting will convey a clear
                    idea of the technical processes improved by him and followed by other artists
                    after him.</p>
                <p>The lime prepared for the intonaco having been kept till it had parted with much
                    of its caustic quality, was mixed with sand in the proportion of two of sand to
                    one of lime. The pigments used were :—White—biancosangiovanni, or lime carefully
                    ground with pure water and dried in the sun in the form of cakes; black—charcoal
                    of vinewood, a black chalk, or lamp black; red—cinabrese, a red earth of intense
                    colour, and sinopia, a lighter red, also an earth, and burnt ochre; amatista—not
                    now known by this name, but a fine purple red; green—terra vert; yellow—two
                    qualities of ochre, dark and light, and giallolino, which resembled Naples
                    yellow in tone. This is a very moderate palette, but it was supplemented by the
                    colours subsequently applied in distemper. These were orpiment, cin-abro (a red
                    oxide), German blue (apparently a cobalt), vermilion, lake, verdigris, indigo,
                    and white lead. When the picture was commenced in fresco, particular grounds
                    were laid on the wet plaster in preparation for the colours which were to
                    follow; for instance, the sky to be painted blue in distemper was prepared with
                    a deep red (cinabrese) in fresco. The virgin’s blue robe was first grounded with
                    black mixed with red, and then painted with blue mixed with size prepared from
                    glue, for red of egg would have made it green. The blue, however, has frequently
                    become a bright green, spite of this care. There are numerous examples of these
                    methods in pictures, extending from the age of Giotto to that of Raphael. In a
                    painting by Lippo Memmi at Assisi a dark rich red in distemper is laid over a
                    preparation of light red in fresco. By Ghirlandajo a brown robe has been
                    coloured in tempera over pale grey in fresco. The dark purple robe of the
                    Cardinal Bonaventura in the fresco called the Dispute on the Sacrament, by
                    Raphael, is spread over a preparation of red. Many other cases might be cited
                    were it necessary. The most singular of all was the preparation for painting
                    trees and bushes by a ground in fresco of black, on which the leaves, branches,
                    sprays, buds, and flowers were executed of the proper colours in distemper.
                    Illustrations of this custom are observable in pictures by Orcagna, Pietro
                    Laurati, Simone Μemmi, Masolino, Paolo Ucello, and many other artists; it did
                    not survive the 15th century, and it is due to Masaccio to point out that he
                    appears to have been the first to escape from this commonplace
                    conventionality.</p>
                <p>The methods of mixing colours and tints and their use in painting were reduced to
                    system, whether for painting drapery or the nude. It was usual to prepare three
                    pots of each colour carefully graduated. Thus, for instance, in the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0807-0772"/> preparation of a flesh tint, a certain quantity
                    of lime, biancosangiovanni, was mixed with red; in another pot the same red,
                    with much more lime; two equal portions of these tints were mixed in the third
                    pot: thus three equal gradations were secured. A head, hand, or any part of the
                    body being drawn on the wet plaster with fine lines with the brush, the shadows
                    were painted with terra vert, then, the lightest flesh tint being taken, the
                    lights were put in. This done, the middle tint was applied, the junctions
                    between the two tints being carefully softened; next the darker colour was laid
                    in, all these tones being fused together in a proper way. The operations were
                    repeated till sufficient solidity —impasto—was obtained. Another and much
                    lighter tone served to mark the high lights, such as those on the nose, chin,
                    and parts of the ears; lastly, the small and most brilliant points of light were
                    touched with pure white, and the whites of the eyes were painted. The artist
                    next outlined the nostrils, eyelids, and apertures of the ears with black,
                    touched in the lower eyelids and the eyebrows with shades of sinopia, and with
                    the same colour the nostrils, upper lip, and the line between the lips. The hair
                    was broadly shaded with terra vert, and washed over with light ochre; then the
                    locks were defined with dark ochre, and the lights pencilled with a much lighter
                    tint of the same; lastly, the outlines were strengthened with sinopia. Such
                    usually were the methods pursued by Giotto and his followers. It is evident that
                    painting thus, according to a fixed system, a master and his trained pupils
                    could act together and harmonize their work in a manner otherwise unattainable.
                    At the same time the individuality of the artist was not obliterated by this
                    prevalence of rule. In the frescos attributed to Giotto and his followers or
                    compeers, it is not difficult to distinguish the different handiwork. In some
                    the green shadows are modified with a warmer tint; in others the results are
                    cold and formal; some paint with soft gradations, others in a harder manner, but
                    the difference between the artists is still more observable in the drawing and
                    proportions of the figures. As guiding cartoons were not prepared by the master;
                    probably the assistants or pupils were only provided with his sketches, which
                    they enlarged on the wall with such skill as they possessed; hence the varieties
                    of proportion which are so remarkable.</p>
                <p>Draperies were painted with graduated colours prepared in the same way; the
                    lights, according to the usage of the Tuscan school, were heightened with pure
                    white, and the shadows were glazed with washes of unmixed colour, showing that
                    the intonaco must have been damp when these were applied or they would not have
                    adhered. Thus in these pictures the most important part of the work was pure
                    fresco, whilst the tempera, although undoubtedly used, was less freely applied
                    by Giotto than by his master Cimabue and his predecessors, judging from the
                    mural paintings at Assisi To the taste and genius of Giotti was owing this great
                    improvement in the technical processes of mural painting.</p>
                <p>The architectural details, where they occur as accessories or backgrounds, are
                    carefully drawn and painted with infinite grace, and as architectural designs
                    they are singularly beautiful, especially in the works of Giotto. It is true
                    that they are invariably too small in proportion to the figures,— a peculiarity
                    which they probably owe to the imitation of similar adjuncts in ancient Roman
                    bassi-rilievi. The conventional routine of thus designing backgrounds lasted for
                    rather more than a hundred and fifty years. There is an appearance of
                    perspective, showing observation, but no knowledge of optical laws. The method
                    was in every respect analogous to that which regulated the drawing of very
                    similar details in ancient Roman art.</p>
                <p>These mediaeval mural pictures in Italy place painting much more upon an equality
                    with the sister arts of architecture and sculpture than was the case in other
                    parts of Europe; they exhibit intense thought, sentiment, and ascetic religious
                    expression. They have not the weird grandeur and sublimity of the designs of
                    Cimabue, nor do they show efforts like his to represent ideal beauty; but they
                    approach much more nearly towards the representation of familiar nature, and the
                    expression of human emotion. Still this art was conventional; of the infinite
                    and beautiful variety of inanimate nature, or of its effects of sunshine and
                    shade, the artists had no perception whatever.</p>
                <p>The idea that painting possessed such a power had not yet been awakened; but at
                    the beginning of the 15 th century a genius was born who led it into new paths,
                    and exercised a good influence upon it, which produced the most beneficial
                    results. Tommaso da San Giovanni, called Masaccio, was this great painter.
                    Another artist, at the present time of a more widespread reputation, divides the
                    honours of the first portion of the 15th century with Masaccio, to whom,
                    however, he was far inferior in originality or perception of nature’s variety
                    and beauty. This was Fra Beato Angelico (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fiesole).</hi>
                    He continued the technical processes of the artists of the preceding century,
                    and in his work mediaeval painting culminated and became perfect technically;
                    but before he left the scene of his loving labours he was so far influenced by
                    the rising wave of the revival that he abandoned Gothic forms in his accessories
                    for timid imitations of classic architecture.</p>
                <p>In practice Fra Beato adhered to the last to the precepts of the older school,
                    but with a freshness of colour, a beauty of form, and a grace of manipulation
                    all his own. He finished his mural pictures with solid distemper of such
                    peculiar excellence—very probably employing gum tragacanth, so insoluble is the
                    mixture—that it remains comparatively unchanged; and he transmitted to his
                    successors the old schemes of preparatory grounds in fresco for the subsequent
                    finishing coats in tempera, which for so long a period characterized monumental
                    art. This is observable in many of his numerous works, and especially in his
                    great mural painting of the Crucifixion in the chapter house of St Mark’s,
                    Florence. In conformity with traditional custom, he laid in the sky in deep red
                    in preparation for blue, which, however, has never been applied. It is to be
                    regretted that the pious artist did not finish this his most important work, but
                    it illustrates in a very remarkable way how far he carried fresco before having
                    recourse to distemper.</p>
                <p>The great and gifted painter Masaccio relinquished the precepts which had guided
                    his predecessors and were practised by his contemporary Fra Beato, as he
                    departed from theirmetlιods of composition, drawing, and chiaroscuro. His
                    insight into the true appearances of nature was that of genius, and he painted
                    these with fidelity, and not conventionally, like the older masters. His art was
                    a revelation: he burst through the routine by which painting had hitherto been
                    bound; it may be said that he anticipated all that was to be done after him, and
                    that no artist, however great, of those who followed him could escape finding in
                    the works of this wonderful originator anticipations of his own qualities as an
                    artist They were studied as models by the greatest artists of succeeding times,
                    by Michelangelo, and by Raphael, who imitated him to the extent of plagiarism.
                    Standing before the frescos of Masaccio we are introduced to new rules destined
                    at a future time to regulate the practice of the art. No frescos hitherto
                    painted had been so pure; they are not entirely free from retouching in
                    distemper, but this was reduced to a minimum, yet with the attainment of a
                    richness of colour and a force of chiaroscuro never surpassed. Masaccio could
                    paint the effects of sunlight with extraordinary power and brilliancy; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n808/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0808-0773"/> when he chose he could rival the finish and
                    refinement of Leonardo da Vinci; he created the art of characteristic
                    portraiture, whilst lie could rise to a lofty ideal. He shadowed forth the power
                    of form of Michelangelo, the natural dignity of Raphael, the brilliant
                    chiaroscuro of Correggio, and the rich colour of Titian. He cast behind him the
                    conventional pattern-like landscape of his predecessors, and hinted at a new and
                    true idea of representing scenery. Technically he painted with an impasto, and a
                    freedom hitherto unthought of, except by his reputed master Masolino da
                    Panicale, who had sufficient insight in moments of his existence to escape from
                    formalism and to feel the influence of nature. It is not to be wondered at that
                    with such qualities as these Masaccio’s frescos should have been objects of
                    study and admiration to generations of artists. An aberration in modern
                    criticism and a fantastic and somewhat weak devotion to mediaeval forms gives a
                    transient preference to the works of his devout contemporary; but in those of
                    Masaccio the great principles of the revival rise brilliantly above the horizon;
                    in those of Fra Beato the ideas of the Middle Ages set with pure and tranquil
                    ray.</p>
                <p>With the advancement of the art of painting we have a discreditable decline in
                    the requisite structural preparations, which has produced disastrous effects on
                    many noble works of art. Frescos were only too frequently painted upon ill-built
                    rubble walls, with unequal surfaces, which were not brought to a level by
                    careful preparatory coats of plaster. This is unfortunately exemplified in the
                    frescos of Masaccio. The results of uneven surfaces are the accumulation of dust
                    on the pictures and of other impurities, seldom removed, and the removal of
                    which is accompanied by a certain risk. The careful structure of the Romans was
                    known to their Italian successors, and was described by Leon Battista Alberti
                    and other architects, but apparently with little effect. It is absolutely
                    necessary that walls intended to be painted upon should be very carefully
                    constructed; the Pompeian system is excellent, and to it may be added thin beds
                    of asphalt at the bases and summits of the stone or brick work. It must never be
                    forgotten that damp is a deadly enemy to fresco-painting, and that unequal
                    surfaces are unsightly as well as destructive.</p>
                <p>The history of mural painting may next be illustrated by reference to the works
                    of Benozzo Gozzoli. As a pupil of Fra Beato Angelico it might be expected that
                    he would continue to use distemper painting extensively, and such was the case.
                    Greatly excelling his master in power of drawing, although with less sentiment,
                    endowed with prolific fancy and capable of unwearied exertion, he has left very
                    important mural pictures, which were begun in fresco, but were so entirely
                    finished with distemper as to be in fact distemper pictures. The joinings of the
                    intonaco in his works present a somewhat unusual appearance. They are for the
                    most part carefully concealed, but in one of his compositions at Pisa they are
                    very observable, and they are invariably cut at some distance from the outlines
                    of the figures; they are not unlike the joints between the polygons which form
                    an Etruscan wall. Thus they include considerable portions of the background.
                    Other artists, notably Masolino, and at a later period Michelangelo, frequently
                    included parts of the background in the day’s painting, which artists will
                    readily recognize as, where possible, important in principle. The objection,
                    however, is obvious. The joinings which do not follow the outlines disfigure the
                    surface, unless carefully concealed by the help of distemper painting, which in
                    modern times would be considered objectionable. When the paintings are so far
                    from the eye that the joinings are invisible, as in the Capella Sistina, the
                    method is valuable. Towards the close of the 15 th century Filippino Lippi in
                    his works further illustrates the history of mural painting. He was employed to
                    finish Masaccio’s fresco in the Brancacci Chapel, representing the Raising of
                    the King’s Son, and he showed himself to be in every respect worthy of the
                    honourable commission. He painted in the centre of the picture a group of eight
                    figures, the heads of which in truth to nature and refined execution literally
                    never have been excelled. He lacks the force of Masaccio; he did not see the
                    effect of sunlight in the same way; he rather painted twilight; but he
                    introduced into fresco a variety in the management of flesh tints and grace of
                    technical execution which unfortunately diminished in his later works. These
                    were his characteristics when he painted in competition with Masaccio. His
                    method was also to prepare the draperies of the figures in fresco, and then to
                    glaze them copiously with distemper colour. Whilst Masaccio invariably painted
                    hands in fresco, Fillippino as invariably painted them in tempera over the
                    draperies. This may have saved trouble, but was not otherwise commendable. It is
                    to be remarked that apparently he first shaded them with terra vert like the
                    mediaeval painters, subsequently adding the flesh tints. Domenico Ghirlandajo
                    follows as an important and very able mural painter. He also commenced his works
                    in fresco, in which he painted admirably with a large effective manner combined
                    with finish. He used distemper extensively; and as an unctuous glazing has been
                    found upon frescos by his brother Rodolfo, it is possible that a new process of
                    retouching was introduced by these brothers. It may have been in their studio
                    that Michelangelo when a boy learnt to retouch fresco in tempera; he undoubtedly
                    retained in his method some impressions derived from his first teachers.</p>
                <p>Pietro Perugino excelled in the art of fresco-painting as it was understood in
                    his time. His works illustrate two very different methods. He painted in pure
                    fresco; and it may be observed that, whilst his oil pictures are marked by such
                    rich and powerful colouring, some of his frescos are like delicate water-colour
                    drawings. A glance at the wall paintings of Masaccio would have shown him how
                    far colour can be obtained in fresco. No doubt he had his motives, and when he
                    wished to produce force and colour, like all other artists of the time he had
                    recourse to retouching in distemper. His famous frescos in the Sala del Cambio
                    at Perugia, are thus retouched all over, and consequently the usual and unequal
                    darkening of the colours has taken place. They have force, but they have lost
                    all brilliancy, and they illustrate in a remarkable way the inexpediency of a
                    manner of painting which would suffer from the mephitic atmosphere of a crowded
                    place of meeting. Pure frescos would have remained clear or could have been
                    cleaned, whilst retouched frescos darkened without remedy.</p>
                <p>Another remarkable contemporary artist, Bernardino Pinturicchio may be said to
                    have carried distemper painting over fresco to the most extravagant degree of
                    any master of his time. He fell back on the primitive conventions of gilt
                    rilievo ornaments in stucco in his paintings, on hatching with gold, and other
                    barbaric splendours of early art. His mural pictures at Siena resemble
                    illuminations in choral books. They are in excellent preservation, having
                    escaped damp and bad air within the well-built library of the cathedral.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the progress made in oil-painting in the 15 th century must
                    have produced important effects upon fresco and ideas connected with it. Some
                    oil painters transferred to their art the light brilliancy of wall painting, and
                    notably Michelangelo in his oil picture for Angelo Doni. Leonardo da Vinci
                    estimated more justly the capabilities of the more powerful vehicle. Tempera,
                    after a brief struggle, sank before it, and disappeared from amongst the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0809-0774"/> processes of art, whilst in mural painting the
                    habits long prevalent of retouching and glazing with strong distempers were
                    confirmed for a time, and new methods were invented to make fresco rival the
                    splendour and force of oil. It is to be regretted that it was not seen that this
                    could be adequately attained, as had been demonstrated by Masaccio, with little
                    aid from extraneous means. Leonardo da Vinci evidently thought that
                    fresco-painting was unequal to produce the effects which he desired, and he
                    executed his great mural picture of the Battle of Anghiari in encaustic, and his
                    still more celebrated work, the Last Supper, in oil, with what disastrous
                    results need not be recorded here except as a warning to artists to avoid
                    methods not sanctioned by experience and not tested by time.</p>
                <p>A period is now reached, the close of the 15th and first years of the 16th
                    centuries, when modifications were made in the technical preparations for
                    fresco. Benozzo Gozzoli was probably one of the last of the artists who drew the
                    outlines of his mural pictures upon the preparatory coat of plaster. Writers
                    upon fresco have only noticed one illustration of this custom in the ruins of a
                    fresco by Pietro di Orvieto at Pisa, but it was a generally established method
                    from the 13th to the close of the 15th century.</p>
                <p>The account which we have in Vasari of the preparation of the cartoons by
                    Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo for their rival mural pictures in the hall of
                    the municipal palace of Florence brings the history of fresco-painting to an
                    important epoch. The execution of such full-size drawings, and of the previous
                    sketches and studies requisite under the circumstances, involved an amount of
                    thought and care hitherto little contemplated. The drawings in red on walls or
                    rough plaster were freely executed with little study, and were not calculated to
                    improve the artist’s skill in the delineation of form; but the preparation of
                    the cartoon was for art the most important step ever taken towards the
                    cultivation of mastery in design, and to the acquisition of that profound
                    knowledge of form which characterized the great painters of the first part of
                    the 16th century, the golden age of art. The cartoonist first prepared his
                    sketch on a small scale, then made his studies from nature, either in separate
                    drawings or in a general delineation of the entire composition. In like manner
                    he considered accessories and details, and made careful studies of drapery. Some
                    artists modelled the whole subject so as to observe the light and shade. This
                    done, the paper for the cartoon was stretched and squared. Pupils were sometimes
                    employed to transfer the sketches to this the working drawing. How carefully
                    such cartoons were sometimes executed is described in the most interesting
                    manner in the history of that famous one which Michelangelo drew with such
                    infinite pains. The wall to be painted was then squared like the cartoon, which
                    was cut into pieces of a convenient size, and so was fitted by the help of the
                    squares to the freshly laid intonaco. The outline was then transferred to the
                    yielding plaster either by the help of the pounce bag, the cartoon having been
                    pricked, or it was marked through the paper with the stylus. It is profoundly
                    interesting to observe the different methods followed by the old masters in
                    preparing the outline. The two greatest of all, Michelangelo and Raphael, were
                    scrupulously careful. They transferred the forms to the wet intonaco with the
                    pounce, after which Michelangelo marked them in some places with a very sharp
                    cutting point. Soddoma, a great painter, was on the contrary very careless in
                    the preparation of his cartoon and its transfer to the plaster. He frequently
                    altered the drawing whilst painting. Bernardino Luini was content with mere
                    indications of the contours. Pordenone indicates a fiery spirit in his mode of
                    dashing them in with any sharp instrument at hand.</p>
                <p>The history of the practice of fresco-painting now reached its apex in the works
                    of Michelangelo and Raphael; those of a long line of great mural painters have
                    illustrated in various ways most of the technical processes of this difficult
                    but noble art. Michelangelo was unwilling to paint; he remarked to Pope Julius,
                    “It is not my profession;” yet his frescos may be taken as perfect types of what
                    ought to be aimed at by every practitioner, so far as method is concerned, apart
                    from the retouching in distemper. The following apparently was his mode of
                    painting. The local colour was laid on and modelled into the cool shadow—(the
                    use of terra vert in shadow had now disappeared, and grey taken its place)—with
                    that perfect knowledge of form and truth of gradation habitual to Michelangelo,
                    and observable in all his drawings. The lights were then painted with a full
                    brush and softened into the half tints; then the darker parts of the shadows
                    were added. It is observable in the execution of this great artist that he
                    modelled the colour in fresco with all the breadth and impasto which slow drying
                    oil paint makes possible. This distinguishes at a glance his work from that of
                    his assistants, which is laboriously stippled. It has been ascertained beyond a
                    possibility of doubt that Michelangelo was not satisfied with pure
                    fresco-painting; but he did not repaint with distemper,—he merely glazed with a
                    thin coating of a blackish grey mixed with size, which he applied in some places
                    with washes, in others with stippling. This is very different from the older
                    methods of painting over the fresco with solid distemper colour.</p>
                <p>In the celebrated mural paintings of Raphael in the Vatican changes of method are
                    very observable; yet it may reasonably be inferred that the great artist’s wish
                    was to paint in pure fresco. A century before the execution of these works,
                    Masaccio had shown what great results could be achieved without having recourse
                    to extensive retouchings, and Raphael carefully studied his frescos. In his
                    exquisite early fresco in San Severo in Perugia he showed that he adhered to
                    these principles. In his famous Vatican frescos he at first partially adhered to
                    the mixed method: besides moderate retouching in the usual manner, he prepared
                    by a coat of red in fresco for painting blue in distemper; but when he executed
                    the noble picture of the School of Athens, he evidently desired to get rid of
                    this old system, and he painted the blues without preparation on the damp
                    intonaco. It was well known from an early period of the art that ultramarine
                    resisted the caustic action of lime. Whatever the blue which Raphael used on
                    this occasion, it has faded more than the other colours in the picture, which is
                    therefore now out of harmony, and his experiment so far failed. At other times
                    the contrary result is observable. In the Aurora by Guido it is the other
                    colours which have faded, and the blues are now too strong, showing that
                    ultramarine if carefully prepared stands better than other colours. Guercino is
                    the artist who has introduced blue in pure fresco with most technical skill, and
                    consequently his works retain a harmony which is very rare. Raphael evidently
                    aimed at pure fresco-painting, but may have been dissatisfied with the results;
                    for he allowed the greatest latitude to his pupils, who employed distemper and
                    apparently other vehicles copiously, when executing portions of their master’s
                    works. When he died, charged as they were with the completion of the Stanze, and
                    provided with his designs, they at once commenced on one of the walls of the
                    Hall of Constantine to paint in oil, as if they had been converted by their
                    master’s rival Sebastian del Piombo. Such was the admiration excited by these
                    works that Cardinal Dovizza da Bibbiena wrote,—“The pupils of Raphael have
                    executed a specimen of a figure in oil on the wall, which was a beautiful work
                    of art, so much so that no one would look at the rooms painted in fresco by
                    Raphael”</p>
                <p>These were idle discussions and idle experiments; each branch of art has its
                    field of operation, and it is to be regretted<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0810-0775"/> that tho old masters generally were not satisfied
                    with the effect of pure fresco-painting. Masaccio triumphantly illustrated its
                    true powers. In the Brancacci chapel at Florence the perfection to which tho
                    noble art may be carried without extraneous aid is amply illustrated. In the
                    efforts made to give fresco the richness of colour and force of chiaroscuro of
                    oil-painting, its finest qualities were in fact destroyed. In the attempt there
                    is a manifest confusion of ideas. Fresco-painting is in a special manner the
                    hand-maiden of architecture, with which it harmonizes and to which it adapts
                    itself in a manner from which oil-painting seeks to escape. Oil-painting asserts
                    itself, fresco aims rather to adorn and complete the architecture with which it
                    is associated; but its history shows that not all artists understood its true
                    limits or its real mission.</p>
                <p>Some lessons taught us by the results now ascertainable of the technical
                    processes of the old masters may be summed up. The importance of careful
                    construction of the wall so as to prevent the action of damp is evident.
                    Undoubtedly the best walls are those of brick with facings in the ancient Roman
                    manner. The ruinous consequences of badly constructed roofs have been shown by
                    the state of the mural paintings at Assisi. That pure fresco is a much more
                    durable art than the mixed method of fresco and distemperpainting is obvious. Of
                    distempers used, those containing animal matter are the worst, especially that
                    prepared from eggs, for when they are assailed by damp, black fungi spread over
                    such pictures and ruin them. It is needless now to point to the disastrous
                    results which must follow the use of white lead; for as a pigment in
                    tempera-painting its great defect is known to all artists. The employment of
                    pozzolana in the preparatory coats of plaster may appear to be favourably
                    supported by ancient examples. Pozzolana is a volcanic ash, which, mixed with
                    lime, forms tho famous Roman cement, and has admirable qualities; but it must
                    not be forgotten how Michelangelo suffered from using it, and how mould spread
                    on his frescos. The ancient masters prepared intonaco in two ways,—with lime and
                    sand, and with lime and marble dust. If the sand used is quartz, the mixture is
                    insoluble, and the fresco painted upon it will be permanent. If marble dust, on
                    the contrary, be preferred, as it was by many old masters from its beauty, it is
                    soluble, and it facilitates the formation of sal nitre on the surface, a common
                    enemy and a dangerous one of frescos, for it destroys the colours. It is
                    important that lightning conductors should be provided; as at Assisi the action
                    of the electric fluid on the frescos of the vaults, where it has played over the
                    surface, has blackened them.</p>
                <p>The Germans, who have done much for the restoration of fresco in the present
                    century, have added to the list of colours formerly in use, and in doing so have
                    been aided by modern chemistry. They have also experimentally fixed the time
                    requisite for the preparation of the lime for the intonaco, and have greatly
                    improved the structure of walls intended to be painted. They have restored the
                    ancient method of lining walls internally with brick; they have interposed
                    sheets of lead between the bases of those walls and the foundations, and prevent
                    the descent of damp from above in the same way. They consider it enough to keep
                    the lime to be used for from ten to twelve months, whether for the intonaco or
                    for painting with; and the following is a list of the colours which they have
                    added to those employed by the old masters :—Raw and burnt terra di siena, all
                    kinds of burnt ochres, a lake-coloured-burnt vitriol, a purple burnt vitriol,
                    raw and burnt umber, Cologne earth burnt forming an excellent black, chrome
                    green, cobalt green, and for blue cobalt as now prepared, or imitations of
                    it.</p>
                <p>The frescos of the Venetian masters, and those of Antonio Allegri da Correggio,
                    add little to our knowledge of the technical processes of mural painting. As
                    might be expected, tho works of the Venetians, which are comparatively few in
                    number, show more attention to colour than to form, and they are slight in
                    execution. The most brilliant are those by Paul Veronese, whose ideas of colour
                    and effect in a special manner fitted him to deal with the conditions of
                    monumental art. Correggio illustrates, as might be expected, the magic effects
                    of sunlight alternating with shade, and the beauty of form and feature which
                    distinguish the immortal artist. Technically, his processes resemble those of
                    other Italian masters, and his works have suffered in the same manner and from
                    the same causes.</p>
                <p>Enough, it is hoped, has been said to explain the processes of fresco-painting as
                    practised by the greatest masters of tho art. Some of these have led to their
                    decay, but a combination of ignorance and carelessness on the part of the
                    Italians themselves has been the chief cause of the widespread ruin of the
                    greatest examples of the art of painting which the genius of any nation has
                    produced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern Fresco-Painting.—</hi> The practice of painting in
                    fresco has been continued to the present time in Italy; it has been employed not
                    only for the decoration of churches, public buildings, and private residences,
                    but also for painting exteriors. The traditional habit of painting the exteriors
                    of houses prevalent in Genoa and its neighbourhood for centuries, and less
                    frequently in other parts of Italy, still continues, although in an incompetent
                    manner and by painters of a much moro ordinary class than formerly. For the
                    execution of interior work excellent fresco-painters are readily found, and the
                    Italians of the present day are in no respect inferior to their predecessors in
                    practical skill, however little they may equal them in the high characteristics
                    of art. Modem Italian masters paint in pure fresco with much force of colour,
                    satisfactory execution, and excellent finish; they repudiate the old system of
                    retouching with distemper colours, whilst apart from the practice of fresco they
                    are probably the best painters in distemper in Europe. In this art they paint
                    like the old masters with the egg vehicle, but as a separate art of mural
                    painting, and never as an adjunct to fresco.</p>
                <p>Towards the commencement of the present century several German artists resident
                    in Rome studied tho art of fresco with much zeal, and laid the foundation of the
                    modem school of fresco-painters in Germany. Some of them acquired a great amount
                    of technical skill, and followed the system of the old masters, by training
                    pupils as assistants with satisfactory results, and thus were enabled to
                    undertake public work with comparative facility and at a reasonable expense. As
                    already noticed, they improved the art in important technical respects, as well
                    as the structure of edifices to be painted, and settled the best methods for
                    preparing the lime for plastering with, and for painting.</p>
                <p>In France the art of fresco-painting has not been successfully developed. French
                    artists who practice mural painting with great ability prefer oil or
                    wax-painting, an ancient method which they as well as the Italians and Germans
                    have with much care and ingenuity endeavoured to revive. They have not been able
                    to restore the ancient encaustic, but they have devised useful and beautiful
                    modes of mural painting and decoration.</p>
                <p>A zealous attempt was made in England to promote the art of mural painting in
                    fresco, in connexion with the decoration of the new Houses of Parliament in
                    London. Careful inquiries were made in Germany and Italy, and a valuable amount
                    of information was gathered and published; and, after various experiments,
                    artists of distinction and ability were employed to paint in fresco in the House
                    of Lords and in other parts of the new national edifice. Notwithstanding the
                    difficulties which beset them in tho practice of an art so new to their
                    experience and so different from their usual habits, a considerable amount of
                    success was achieved, highly creditable to them and to their zeal and
                    perseverance. But fresco-painting has not been domiciled in Great Britain, nor
                    has any great school of mural painters been formed. The excellent artists
                    employed did not form schools as in Germany or in Italy, or as in France in a
                    different branch of art; and without the aid of trained assistants public
                    painting is impossible at a cost which can be brought within reasonable
                    limits.</p>
                <p>Before the revival of fresco-painting in London, Mr Zephaniah Bell, a Scottish
                    artist, who had studied the art in Italy, painted some clever and forcible
                    frescos at Muirhouse, near Edinburgh, which after the lapse of about forty-five
                    years are still, with the exception of the yellows, fresh and in excellent
                    condition.</p>
