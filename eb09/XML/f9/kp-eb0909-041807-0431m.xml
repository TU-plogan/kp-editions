                    (1754-1794), an eminent German naturalist and writer on scientific subjects, was
                    born at Nassenhuben, a small village near Dantzic, in November 1754. His father,
                    Johann Reinhold Forster, a man of great scientific attainments but an
                    intractable temper, was at that time pastor of the place; the family are said to
                    have been of Scotch extraction. In 1765 the elder Forster was commissioned by
                    the empress Catherine to inspect the Russian colonies in the province of
                    Saratov, which gave his son an opportunity of acquiring the Russian language and
                    the elements of a scientific education. After a few years the father quarrelled
                    with the Russian <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0432-0419"/> Government, and suddenly embraced the resolution
                    of proceeding to England, where he obtained a professorship of natural history
                    and the modern languages at the famous nonconformist academy at Warrington. His
                    violent temper soon compelled him to resign this appointment, and for two years
                    he and his sou earned a precarious livelihood by translations in London,—a
                    practical education, however, exceedingly useful to the younger Forster, who
                    became a thorough master of English, and acquired many of the ideas which
                    chiefly influenced his subsequent life. At length the turning point in his
                    career came in the shape of an invitation for him and his father to accompany
                    Captain Cook in his third voyage round the world. Such an expedition was
                    admirably calculated to call forth Forster’s peculiar powers. He attained no
                    remarkable distinction as an original discoverer or investigator, but his
                    insight into nature was accurate and penetrating; he conceived of her as a
                    living whole, and reproduces her vitality in his animated pages. His account of
                    Cook’s voyage is almost the first example of the glowing yet faithful
                    description of natural phenomena which has since made a knowledge of them the
                    common property of the educated world,—a prelude to Humboldt, as Humboldt to
                    Darwin and Wallace. The publication of this great work was, however, impeded for
                    some time by differences with the Admiralty, during which Forster proceeded to
                    the Continent to obtain an appointment for his father as professor at Cassel,
                    and found to his surprise that it was conferred upon himself. The elder Forster,
                    however, was soon provided for elsewhere, being appointed professor of natural
                    history at Halle. At Cassel Forster formed an intimate friendship with the great
                    anatomist Soemmerring, and about the same time made the acquaintance of Jacobi,
                    who inspired him with a mystical spirit from which he subsequently emancipated
                    himself. These were the days of secret societies, masonic lodges, and
                    conventions of illuminati. Forster was for a long time deeply implicated in
                    their proceedings, the purpose of which remains obscure. The want of books and
                    scientific apparatus at Cassel induced him to resort frequently to Göttingen,
                    where he betrothed himself to Therese Heyne, the daughter of the illustrious
                    philologist, a clever and cultivated but heartless woman, who became the evil
                    genius of his life. To be able to marry he accepted (1784) a professorship at
                    the university of Wilna, where he found himself greatly misplaced. The penury
                    and barbarism of Polish circumstances are graphically described in his and his
                    wife’s letters of this period. After a few years’ residence at Wilna he resigned
                    his appointment to participate in a scientific expedition projected by the
                    Russian Government, and upon the relinquishment of this undertaking became
                    librarian to the elector of Mayence. In 1790 he published his travels in the
                    Netherlands, with special reference to the art of the country—a work displaying
                    the same power of exposition in aesthetic matters as he had previously shown in
                    the description of the aspects of nature. This was his last work. The
                    principality of Mayence was now involved in the vortex of the French Revolution,
                    and Forster unhappily suffered himself to be drawn into a position incompatible
                    either with fidelity to. his master the elector, or allegiance to his country.
                    With his liberal sympathies and deficiency in political insight, he might be
                    excused for welcoming the French as deliverers, but in promoting the actual
                    incorporation of Mayence with France, he justly incurred the execration of
                    patriotic Germans, notwithstanding the unquestionable purity of his intentions.
                    Domestic sorrows were added to public calamities: Forster found himself not only
                    deserted by his wife but deprived of his children. It is difficult to determine
                    whether his apparent resignation should be ascribed to romantic self-sacrifice
                    or to the apathy of an exhausted spirit. The situation was nearly the same as
                    that of George Sand’s <hi rend="italic">Jacques,</hi> and the catastrophe not
                    very dissimilar. Forster died suddenly and opportunely, January 1794, in Paris,
                    whither he had gone as deputy from Mayence in the worst days of the Reign of
                    Terror. His personal character was most amiable; he was high-minded,
                    disinterested, ingenuous to a fault; but he was weak, impulsive, ill-starred
                    throughout his life, and totally unequal to the difficult circumstances in which
                    he ultimately found himself. As an author he stands very high; he is almost the
                    first and almost the best of that valuable class of writers who have made
                    science and art familiar by representing them in their essential spirit,
                    unencumbered with technical details. Schlegel remarks that no other German prose
                    writer carries his reader so far, leaving him not merely enriched with positive
                    knowledge but animated with the passion for further progress; that the books of
                    no other such writer convey so lively an impression of having been composed
                    outside the study in the free air; and that no other is animated by so constant
                    a sense of the infinite perfectibility of human nature.</p>
                <p>Forster’s writings have been frequently collected. The most important have been
                    mentioned above, but there are numerous minor essays of great value and artistic
                    completeness. His correspondence with his friend Soemmerring has been recently
                    published by Hettner, and is full of interest. The biography by Moleschott is
                    very agreeably written, but is rather a delineation of a typical naturalist than
                    of the actual man, and its account of Forster's Íiolitical career is vitiated by
                    the writer’s own deficiency in patriotic eeling. The other side of the question
                    is presented with unnecessary asperity in Klein’s <hi rend="italic">George
                    Forster in</hi><hi rend="italic">Mayence.</hi> There are excellent critical
                    estimates by Schlegel and Gervinus, the latter prefixed to the seventh volume of
                    Forster’s writings. (R. G.)</p>
