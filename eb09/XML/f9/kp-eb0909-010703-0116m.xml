                    level of the roofs is an exaggeration, and the city affords an asylum to the
                    people of the surrounding country when the district is under water. The distance
                    from Bologna by rail is about 29 miles, and from Venice 70. As it long occupied
                    an important strategical position as a frontier post of the papal states,
                    Ferrara is strongly fortified by walls, bastions, ditches, and a pentagonal
                    citadel. Within the circuit of its defences, which extend for nearly 5 miles, a
                    large part of the area is unoccupied. In the very centre of the city stands the
                    old ducal castle or palace, surrounded by a moat, and crowned with heavy
                    machicolations and battlements. During the papal period it was the residence of
                    the legate, and it is now the seat of the local authorities. The cathedral of
                    San Paolo is a large building originally dating from the 12th century, but
                    gutted and restored in the 17th. The west front, of which a view is given in Mr
                    Street’s <hi rend="italic">Brick and Marble Architecture,</hi> is a great screen
                    with “three gables of about equal height covered with arcading, which increases
                    in depth and richness of moulding and shadow to the top, where there are very
                    fine open arched galleries.” Of the other churches it is sufficient to mention
                    S. Francesco, S. Benedetto, S. Domenico, and S. Maria del Vado, which contain
                    paintings by Garofalo, Dosso Dossi, Bonone, and other native artists. The
                    palaces are for the most part of small architectural interest: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palazzo dd Diamanti</hi> owes its name merely to the facets into
                    which the stones of the front are carved. The theatre is one of the largest in
                    Italy; and the university, or <hi rend="italic">Studio Publico,</hi> has a rich
                    numismatic collection and a library of 100,000 volumes and 1100 MSS., numbering
                    among its curiosities autographic portions of Ariosto’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso,</hi> letters of Tasso, and the original
                    of Guarini’s <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido.</hi> Γbe house of the first of these
                    poets is still shown in a street which bears his name; and the hospital of S.
                    Anna is regularly visited as the scene of Tasso’s incarceration. Almost all the
                    interest of the city lies in its past, but it shows signs of revival since the
                    unification of Italy. A large factory for scutching and spinning hemp was
                    established in 1874; there are two foundries and a small establishment for the
                    manufacture of brass instruments; and the preserving of peaches is a fairly
                    important industry. A local bank was founded in 1862 with a nominal capital of
                    .£83,000. Besides the university, which is free, the educational establishments
                    comprise an industrial and professional institute, a technical school, a
                    communal gymnasium, a lyceum named after Ariosto, and a gymnasium and lyceum
                    attached to the archiepiscopal seminary. The population in 1871 was 28,509, or,
                    including the suburbs of San Luca and San Giorgio, 33,327. Ferrara possibly owes
                    its existence to the invasion of Italy by Attila, and the destruction of
                    Aquilea. It was walled by the exarch of Ravenna in 585, and became the seat of a
                    bishop in 657. In the beginning of the 13th century, it passed into the hands of
                    the Este family, which continued to hold it, sometimes under the pope and
                    sometimes as independent lords, till the extinction of the main line by the
                    death of Alphonso II. in 1597. During the latter part of this period Ferrara was
                    the seat of one of the most cultured of the Italian courts, and its name has
                    become for ever associated with the history of Italian literature. Its
                    population is said to have amounted to 80,000. In 1598 it was incorporated with
                    the papal states by Clement VII. During the period of the French supremacy in
                    Italy, it formed part, first of the Cisalpine republic, and secondly of the
                    kingdom of Italy; but the treaty of Vienna restored it to the pope, and granted
                    the Austrians the right of maintaining a garrison. In 1859 it was incorporated
                    in the general kingdom of Italy.</p>
