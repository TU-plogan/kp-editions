                    they are chiefly indigenous. They have alternate leaves, and abound in a milky

                    well-known figs of commerce, is a bush or small tree, rarely more than 18 or 20
                    feet high,—with broad, rough, deciduous leaves, very deeply lobed in the
                    cultivated varieties, but in the wild plant sometimes nearly entire. The green,
                    rough branches bear the solitary, nearly sessile receptacles in the axils of the
                    leaves. The male flowers are placed chiefly in the upper part of the cavity, and
                    in most varieties are few in number. As it ripens, the receptacle enlarges
                    greatly, and the numerous single-seeded pericarps become imbedded in it. The
                    fruit of the wild fig never acquires the succulence of the cultivated kinds. The
                    fig seems to be indigenous to Asia Minor and Syria, but now occurs in a <pb

                    the Mediterranean. From the ease with which the nutritious fruit can be
                    preserved, it was probably one of the earliest objects of cultivation, as may be
                    inferred from the frequent allusions to it in the Hebrew Scriptures. From a
                    passage in Herodotus the fig would seem to have been unknown to the Persians in
                    the days of the first Cyrus; but it must have spread in remote ages over all the
                    districts around the Aegean and Levant. The Greeks are said to have received it
                    from Caria (hence the specific name); but the fruit so improved under Hellenic
                    culture that Attic figs became celebrated throughout the East, and special laws
                    were made to regulate their exportation. From the contemptuous name given to
                    informers against the violation of those enactments, <hi rend="italic"
                        >συκοφάνται</hi><hi rend="italic">(σvκov</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >φaivω),</hi> our modern word sycophant is traced. The fig was one of the
                    principal articles of sustenance among the Greeks; the Spartans especially used
                    it largely at their public tables. From Hellas, at some prehistoric period, it
                    was transplanted to Italy and the adjacent islands. Pliny enumerates many
                    varieties, and alludes to those from Ebusus (the modern Iviça) as most esteemed
                    by Roman epicures; while he describes those of home growth as furnishing a large
                    portion of the food -of the slaves, particularly those employed in agriculture,
                    by whom great quantities were eaten in the fresh state at the periods of
                    fig-harvest. In Latin myths the plant plays an important part. Held sacred to
                    Bacchus it was employed in religious ceremonies; and the fig-tree that
                    overshadowed the twin founders of Rome in the wolf’s cave, as an emblem of the
                    future prosperity of the race, testified to the high value set upon the fruit by
                    the nations of antiquity. The tree is now cultivated in all the Mediterranean
                    countries, but the larger portion of our supply of figs comes from Asia Minor,
                    the Spanish Peninsula, and the south of France. Those of Asiatic Turkey are
                    considered the best. The varieties are extremely numerous, and the fruit is of
                    various colours, from deep purple to yellow, or nearly white. The trees usually
                    bear two crops,—one in the early summer from the buds of the last year, the
                    other in the autumn from those on the spring growth; the latter forms the chief
                    harvest. Many of the immature receptacles drop off from imperfect fertilization,
                    which circumstance has led, from very ancient times, to the practice of <hi
                        rend="italic">caprification.</hi> Branches of the wild fig in flower are
                    placed over the cultivated bushes. Certain hymenopterous insects, of the genera
                        <hi rend="italic">Blastophaga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sycophαga,</hi>
                    which frequent the wild fig, enter the minute orifice of the receptacle,
                    apparently to deposit their eggs; conveying thus the pollen more completely to
                    the stigmas, they ensure the fertilization and consequent ripening of the fruit.
                    By some the nature of the process has been questioned, and the better maturation
                    of the fruit attributed merely to the stimulus given by the puncture of the
                    insect, as in the case of the apple; but the arrangement of the unisexual
                    flowere in the fig renders the first theory the more probable. In some districts
                    a straw or small twig is thrust into the receptacle with a similar object. When
                    ripe the figs are picked, and spread out to dry in the sun,—those of better
                    quality being much pulled and extended by hand during the process. Thus
                    prepared, the fruit is packed closely in barrels, rush baskets, or wooden boxes,
                    for commerce. The best kind, known as elemi, are shipped at Smyrna, where the
                    pulling and packing of figs form one of the most important industries of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>This fruit still constitutes a large part of the food of the natives of western
                    Asia and southern Europe, both in the fresh and dried state. A sort of cake made
                    by mashing up the inferior kinds serves in parts of the Archipelago as a
                    substitute for bread; mixed with almonds, a similar preparation is sold in the
                    streets of our large towns, and eaten as a luxury by the poor, under the name of
                    “fig-cake.” Alcohol is obtained from fermented figs in some southern countries;
                    and a kind of wine, still made from the ripe fruit, was known to the ancients,
                    and mentioned by Pliny under the name of <hi rend="italic">sycites.</hi>
                    Medicinally the fig is employed as a gentle laxative, when eaten abundantly
                    often proving useful in chronic constipation; it forms a part of the well-known
                    “confection of senna.” Cut open, the fruit is a popular cataplasm for boils and
                    sores, an application as old as the days of Hezekiah. It is recommended as a
                    demulcent in disorders of the throat, being given in the form of decoction. The
                    milky juice of the stems and leaves is very acrid, and has been used in some
                    countries for raising blisters. The wood is porous and of little value; though a
                    piece, saturated with oil and spread with emery, is in France a common
                    substitute for a hone.</p>
                <p>The fig is grown for its fresh fruit (eaten as an article of dessert) in all the
                    milder parts of Europe, and in the United States, with protection in winter,
                    succeeds as far north as Pennsylvania. In England it is usually trained against
                    a wall, and sheltered with mats or branches in severe frosts, though in some
                    warm places near the southern coast small plantations of standard bushes exist;
                    oneW the oldest is probably that at Tarring, near Worthing. The tree is
                    propagated by cuttings or layers; it requires care in pruning, and the immature
                    fruit, formed’ late in summer, should be removed to strengthen the shoots. The
                    crop ripens in August and September. The fig was introduced into England by
                    Cardinal Pole, from Italy, early in the 16 th century.</p>
                <p>The Sycamore Fig, <hi rend="italic">Ficus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sycomorus,</hi>
                    is a tree of large size, with heart-shaped leaves, which, from their fancied
                    resemblance to those of the mulberry, gave origin to the name <hi rend="italic"
                        >Συκόμορος.</hi> From the deep shade cast by its spreading branches, it is a
                    favourite tree in Egypt and Syria, being often planted along roads and near
                    houses. It bears a sweet edible fruit, somewhat like that of the common fig, but
                    produced in racemes on the older boughs. The apex of the fruit is sometimes
                    removed, or an incision made in it, to induce earlier ripening. The ancients,
                    after soaking it in water, preserved it like the common fig. The porous wood is
                    only fit for fuel.</p>
                <p>The Sacred Fig, Pippul, or Bo, <hi rend="italic">Ficus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >religiosa,</hi> a large tree with heart-shaped, long-pointed leaves on
                    slender footstalks, is much grown in southern Asia. The leaves are used for
                    tanning, and afford lac, and some caoutchouc is obtained from the juice; but in
                    India it is chiefly planted with a religious object, being regarded as sacred by
                    both Brahmans and Buddhists. The formerbelieve that the last avatar of Vishnu
                    took place beneath its shade. A gigantic bo, described by Emerson Tennent as
                    growing near Anarajapoora, in Ceylon, is, if tradition may be trusted, one of
                    the oldest trees in the world. It is said to have been a branch of the tree
                    under which Gautama Buddha became endued with his divine powers, and has always
                    been held in the greatest veneration. The figs, however, hold as important a
                    place in the religious fables of the East as the ash in the myths of
                    Scandinavia.</p>

                    Tree, the large, oblong, glossy leaves, and pink buds of which are so familiar

                    Indies. It grows to a large size, and iβ remarkable for the snake-like roots
                    that extend in contorted masses around the base of the trunk. The small fruit is

                <p>The trade in the edible fig is one of loDg standing, and of considerable
                    importance in the regions devoted to the cultivation of the tree. Figs are
                    easily preserved by simply drying in the sun, the grape sugar which they contain
                    in abundance being thus rendered available for their preservation<pb break="no"

                    undried figs in tins has been adopted, but the amount used in that form is as
                    yet insignificant compared with the quantities preserved by drying. Of the dried
                    and pressed fruit the import into Great Britain alone averages from six to seven
                    thousand tons annually, the following being the official returns for the five
