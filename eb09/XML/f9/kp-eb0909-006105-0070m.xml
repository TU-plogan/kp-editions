                    states for mutual aid, and the promotion of interests common to all, is a
                    procedure so consistent with selfinterest that examples of it can be adduced
                    from very early times. Had a federal union of Hellenic states been effected at
                    the close of the Persian war, results would have been achieved which were vainly
                    aimed at subsequently,—as by Athens herself, after the capture of Olynthus by
                    Philip of Macedon. The effort to effect a union of states for the common good
                    then failed; but at length, in the century following the death of Alexander, the
                    Aetolian and Achaean confederacies were formed, and a spirit of unity was
                    inspired which, if less tardily manifested, might have long perpetuated Hellenic
                    freedom. For the first time a federative spirit contended effectively with the
                    isolation which had so long animated the policy of the ancient world.</p>

                    republics of Italy, standing for centuries almost within sight of each other
                    without a thought of union except by conquest of the weaker by the stronger. The
                    Panhellenic festivals long served to perpetuate a fraternal pride in the
                    community of Hellenic blood, but they begot no results of sustained political
                    unity. But when Macedonian ambition raised up a military empire on their own
                    frontier stronger and far more dangerous than that of Persia, the statesmen of
                    Greece learned the necessity of confederation for the safety of their autonomous
                    governments. Of the unions which followed, the two most celebrated were the
                    Aetolian league and the confederacy of Achaeans. The constitution of the
                    Aetolian league, though democratic, included an aristocratic or privileged
                    class. It was a league of districts rather than of cities, with chiefs of the
                    hill tribes and leading citizens attending the annual assemblies at Thermus, and
                    might not inaptly be compared to the Swiss confederacy of city and forest
                    cantons. The Spartans alone compared with the Aetolians in their prolonged
                    maintenance of the power of independent action and self-government.</p>
                <p>The Achaean league differed from that of the Aetolians in being one of cities.
                    Grote speaks of it as never attaining to anything better than a feeble and puny
                    life. But it gave good evidence of the benefits of federation. From remote times
                    twelve towns had acknowledged confederate rights and obligations; in 275 B.c.
                    other cities joined; and the importance of the confederacy continued to increase
                    till 251 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Aratus became strategus, and
                    brought his native Sicyon into the union. Upwards of seventy cities, while still
                    controlling their own local affairs, were by this means associated under one
                    federal government. The federal capital was at Aegium, and each city sent
                    deputies annually thither till 194 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when
                    Philopoemen introduced the system of meeting by rotation in the principal
                    cities, a procedure originating in jealousy, and the inevitable source of
                    weakness.</p>
                <p>Among the later European confederations the Swiss republic attracts most
                    attention. As now constituted it consists of twenty-two sovereign states or
                    cantons. The government is vested in two legislative chambers, a senate or
                    council of state, and a national council, constituting unitedly the federal
                    assembly. The executive council of seven members elects the president and
                    vice-president for a term of three years. Before the French Revolution the
                    German empire was a complex confederation, with the states divided into
                    electoral colleges, consisting—(1) of the ecclesiastical electors and of the
                    secular electors, including the king of Bohemia; (2) of the spiritual and
                    temporal princes of the empire next in rank to the electors; and (3) of the free
                    imperial cities. The emperor was elected by the first college alone. This
                    imposing confederation came to an end by the conquests of Napoleon; and the
                    Confederation of the Rhine was established in 1806 with the French emperor as
                    protector. But its principles were violated by its so-called protector, and in
                    1815 the Germanic confederation was established by the Congress of Vienna, which
                    in its turn has been displaced by the present German empire. This, in its new
                    organization, has conferred on Germany the long-coveted unity and coherence the
                    lack of which had been a source of weakness. The constitution dates, in its
                    latest form, from the treaties entered into at Versailles in 1871. A federation
                    was then organized with the king of Prussia as president, under the hereditary
                    title of emperor of Germany. Delegates of the various confederated Governments
                    form the Bundesrath; the Reichstag, or popular assembly, is directly chosen by
                    the people; and the two assemblies constitute the federal parliament. This body
                    has power to legislate for the whole empire in reference to all matters
                    connected with the army, navy, postal service, customs, coinage, &amp;c., all
                    political laws affecting citizens, and all general questions of commerce,
                    navigation, passports, &amp;c. The emperor represents the confederacy in all
                    international relations, with the chancellor as first minister of the empire,
                    and has power, with consent of the Bundesrath, to declare war in name of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>The United States of America more nearly resembles the Swiss confederacy, though
                    retaining marks of its English origin. The original thirteen States were
                    colonies wholly independent of each other. By the Articles of Confederation and
                    Perpetual Union between the United States of America, drawn up by Congress in
                    1777, the States bound themselves in a league of common defence; a common
                    citizenship was recognized for the whole union; but each State reserved its
                    sovereignty along with every power not expressly delegated to Congress, and the
                    jealousy in regard to State’s rights has never been entirely laid aside. The
                    theory of the confederacy is that of a federal republic formed by the voluntary
                    union of sovereign States. The powers of the central government are determined
                    by a written constitution, and are intrusted to three distinct
                    authorities—executive, legislative, and judicial. The president, elected for a
                    term of four years by electors chosen for that purpose by each State, is the
                    representative head of the republic. The vice-president, <hi rend="italic">ex
                    officio</hi> president of the senate, assumes the presidency in case of
                    resignation or death. Legislative power is vested in the Senate, composed of two
                    members elected by each state for a term of six years; and in the Congress,
                    consisting of representatives in numbers proportionate to the population of each
                    State, holding their seats for two years. The supreme judicial authority, which
                    forms the final court of appeal on all constitutional as well as legal
                    questions, consists of a chief justice and eight judges, appointed for life by
                    the president, subject to confirmation by the senate.</p>
                <p>The essential principle involved in confederation is that it is a union of
                    sovereign states. With a view to the common interests of all, they agree to
                    abrogate certain functions of sovereignty in their separate capacity, in order
                    that these shall be jointly exercised for the common good by the body which they
                    concurrently vest with such sovereign functions; but all other sovereign rights
                    are reserved. This differs essentially from the incorporation of two or more
                    states into a united commonwealth, as in the union of England and Scotland. The
                    new empire of Germany illustrates the former, the new kingdom of Italy the
                    latter. In view of the sovereign rights reserved by the several members of a
                    federal union of states, each may be presumed to have the right to withdraw from
                    the confederation. State rights, including that of secession, were strongly
                    asserted during the civil wars between the northern and southern States of
                    America; but the result has naturally been to subordinate the will of individual
                    States to the higher interests of the confederacy as a whole. The written
                    constitution of the United States is subject to amendment at any time, by
                    consent of two-thirds of both representative bodies; or by a convention
                    specially called by the legislatures of two-thirds of the several States for the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>The extension of responsible constitutional government by Great Britain to her
                    chief colonies, under a governor or viceregal representative of the crown, has
                    been followed in British North America by the union of the Canadian, maritime,
                    and Pacific provinces under a federal government,—with a senate, the members of
                    which are nominated by the crown, and a house of commons elected by the
                    different provinces according to their relative population. The governor-general
                    is appointed by the crown for a term of seven years, and represents the
                    sovereign in all matters <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n72/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0072-0063"/> of federal government. The lieutenant-governors
                    of the provinces are nominated by him; and all local legislation is carried on
                    by the provincial parliaments. The remarkable confederation of the Dominion of
                    Canada which has thus originated presents the unique feature of a federal union
                    of provinces practically exercising sovereign rights in relation to all local
                    self-government, and sustaining a constitutional autonomy, while cherishing the
                    colonial relationship to Great Britain. History has no parallel to this novel
                    fact of a free people, the occupants of vast regions stretching from the
                    Atlantic to the Pacific, enjoying all constitutional rights, electing their own
                    parliaments, organizing an armed militia, controlling customs, emigration, and
                    all else that pertains to independent selfgovernment, while they continue to
                    cherish the tie which binds them to the mother country, and to render a loyal
                    homage to the representative of the crown. The harmonious relations resulting
                    from this application of the system of federal government to the British
                    American provinces has suggested the extension of the same principle to the
                    coloniee of South Africa, and may be regarded as the basis of a colonial system
                    by means of which the vast colonial dependencies of Great Britain may perpetuate
                    their relations with the mother country, while enjoying all the blessings of its
                    well-regulated freedom, or may be trained to emulate its example as independent
                    states. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. w.)</hi></p>
