                    a family that had suffered much in former days of religious persecution. Both
                    were members of the Church of England, and took great pains in the training of
                    their children. George from his childhood “appeared of another frame than the
                    rest of his brethren, being more religious, inward, still, solid, and observing
                    beyond his years;” and he himself declares, “When I came to eleven years of age
                    I knew pureness and righteousness; for while a child I was taught how to walk to
                    be kept pure.” Some of his relations wished that he should be educated for the
                    church; but his father, after he had barely learned to read and write, lost no
                    time in apprenticing him to a certain shoemaker, who also dealt in wool and
                    cattle. In this service he remained till his nineteenth year, and acquired some
                    proficiency in all the branches of his master’s somewhat miscellaneous business;
                    according to Penn, “He took most delight in sheep,” but he himself simply says,
                    “A good deal went through my hands. . . . People had generally a love to me for
                    my innocency and honesty.” In 1643, being upon business at a fair, and having
                    accompanied some friends to the village public-house, he was deeply scandalized
                    by a proposal to “drink healths,” and abruptly withdrew in great grief of
                    spirit. “When I had done what business I had to do I returned home, but did not
                    go to bed that night, nor could I sleep, but sometimes walked up and down, and
                    sometimes prayed and cried to the Lord, who said unto me, ‘ Thou seest how young
                    people go together into vanity and old people into the earth; thou must forsake
                    all, both young and old, and keep out of all, and be a stranger unto all’ Then,
                    at the command of God, on the ninth day of the seventh month, 1643, I left my
                    relations and broke off all familiarity or fellowship with old or young.” Thus
                    briefly he describes what appears to have been the greatest moral crisis in his
                    life. Of the four years which followed •—the “times of the first workings of the
                    Lord in him ”— he has left but a confused account They were cn the whole years
                    of great perplexity and distress, though sometimes “I had intermissions, and was
                    sometimes brought into such a heavenly joy that I thought I had been in
                    Abraham’s bosom.” He did not continue for many months <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0532-0501"/> to adhere to the letter of the command he
                    believed himself to have received; he soon began to have some misgivings as to
                    the propriety of his action in having forsaken his relations, and, apparently
                    without waiting for any new revelation, he ultimately conceded so much to the
                    claims of natural affection as occasionally to visit those whom he had formerly
                    thought it his duty to leave. Still, throughout this period his wanderings were
                    very numerous, and covered a very wide area. He would go from town to town,
                    “travelling up and down as a stranger in the earth, which way the Lord inclined
                    my heart; taking a chamber to myself in the town where I came, and tarrying
                    sometimes a month, more or less, in a place;” and the reason he gives for this
                    migratory habit is that he was “afraid both of professor and profane, lest,
                    being a tender young man, he should be hurt by conversing much with either.” The
                    same fear often led him to shun all society for days at a time; but frequently
                    lie would apply to “professors” for spiritual direction and consolation. These
                    applications, however, never proved successful; he invariably found that his
                    advisers “possessed not what they professed.” Some recommended marriage, others
                    enlistment as a soldier in the civil wars; one “ancient priest” bade him take
                    tobacco and sing psalms; another of the same fraternity, “in high account,”
                    advised physic and blood-letting. About the beginning of 1646 îiis thoughts
                    began to take more definite shape; or, as he himself expresses it, he began to
                    receive more revelations. For example, as he was one day approaching the gate of
                    Coventry, “the Lord opened to him” that none were true believers but such as
                    were born of God and had passed from death unto life; and this was soon followed
                    by other “openings” to the effect that “being bred at Oxford or Cambridge was
                    not enough to fit and qualify men to be ministers of Christ,” and that “God who
                    made the world did not dwell in temples made with hands.” “I had also great
                    openings concerning the things written in the Revelations.” He also experienced
                    deeper manifestations of Christ within his own soul. “When I myself was in the
                    deep, shut up under all [the burden of corruptions], I could not believe that I
                    should ever overcome; my troubles, my sorrows, and my temptations were so great
                    that I thought many times I should have despaired, I was so tempted. But when
                    Christ opened to me how He was tempted by the same devil, and overcame him and
                    bruised his head, and that through Him, and His power, light, grace, and spirit,
                    I should overcome also, I had confidence in Him; so He it was that opened to me,
                    when I was shut up and had no hope nor faith. Christ, who had enlightened me,
                    gave me His light to believe in; He gave me hope which He Himself revealed in
                    me; and He gave me His spirit and grace, which I found sufficient in the deeps
                    and in weakness.” With the knowledge he had thus received, Fox, towards the end
                    of the year 1647, felt himself constrained to begin the work of his life as an
                    itinerant preacher, the positive element in his teaching being to the effect
                    that men ought to give sincere and earnest heed to the inner light—the light of
                    Christ— which God had placed in every human heart. The scenes of his early
                    labours and early successes were in the neighbourhood of Dukinfield and
                    Manchester, where he had “great openings and prophecies,” and succeeded in
                    establishing his influence over a considerable number of followers. From this
                    date his creed grew rapidly in point of explicitness, especially on its negative
                    and practical sides. For example, in 1648 it was revealed to him by the inner
                    light that he was not to take off his hat to any person, high or low; that he
                    was to use in addressing any single individual of whatever rank no other
                    pronouns than the simple “thou” and “thee”; that he was not to bid people good
                    morning or good evening; and that he was not to “bow or scrape with his leg to
                    any one.” Increasingly persuaded of the truth and importance of his message, he
                    daily became bolder in the delivery of it. Iu the year 1649, as he was walking
                    towards Nottingham on a first-day morning accompanied by some friends, he heard
                    the bell of the “steeple house” of the city, and was admonished by an inward
                    voice to go forward and cry against the great temple and the worshippers in it.
                    Entering the church he found the preacher engaged in expounding the words, “We
                    have also a more sure word of prophecy,” from which the ordinary Protestant
                    doctrine of the supreme authority of Scripture was being enforced in a manner
                    which appeared to Fox so defective or erroneous as to call for his immediate and
                    most energetic protest. Lifting up his voice against the preacher’s doctrine, he
                    declared that it is not by the Scripture alone, but by the divine light by which
                    the Scriptures were given, that doctrines ought to be judged. The result of the
                    disturbance which not unnaturally ensued was that he was seized by the
                    constables and carried off to prison, where he was detained for some time, and
                    from which be was released only by tho favour of the sheriff, whose sympathies
                    he had succeeded in enlisting. A similar adventure at Derby ended less
                    favourably. For raising a discussion which seemed not unlikely to end in a
                    breach of the peace in the church there, he was brought before the magistrates,
                    and after examination, committed along with one of his comrades to the house of
                    correction as a blasphemer;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It was about this time that the epithet “Quaker” was first bestowed upon Fox
                    and his friends (by Justice Bennett of Derby, it is said) because “they bade the
                    people tremble at the word of the Lord.” It soon passed into common use, and is
                    to be found even in the Records of the House of Commons as early as
                    1654.</p></note> and not till the beginning of 1651, after he had been a
                    prisoner for almost a year, did he succeed in regaining his freedom. It would be
                    here out of place to follow with any minuteness the details of his subsequent
                    imprisonments, such as that at Carlisle in 1653, at London in 1654, at
                    Launceston 1656, at Lancaster in 1660 and again in 1663, at Scarborough in 1666,
                    and at Worcester in 1674. They are related with a certain monotony, which is yet
                    far from being tedious or uninteresting, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi>
                    fortunately an easily accessible book. Suffice it to say that during these terms
                    of imprisonment his pen was not idle, as is amply shown by the very numerous
                    letters, pastorals, and exhortations which have been preserved by his followers;
                    while during his intervals of liberty he was unwearied in the work of preaching
                    and making disciples. While his labours were for the most part confined to the
                    midland and northern counties of England, he found time in 1657 for a tour
                    through Scotland, which, in his opinion, was not altogether without result. In
                    1669 he married the widow of a Welsh judge, Margaret Fell, who, with her family,
                    had been among his earliest converts; but almost immediately afterwards his
                    proselytizing ardour impelled him to proceed alone to Barbados, Jamaica, and the
                    American continent. In all places visited by him there he met with a good
                    reception, and was successful in making many converts. Shortly after his return
                    in 1673 he was, as has been already noted, apprehended in Worcestershire for
                    attending meetings that were forbidden by the law. He was ultimately set at
                    liberty on account of errors in the indictment which had been drawn up against
                    him, but this was not until after he had suffered a captivity of nearly fourteen
                    months. In 1677 he visited Holland along with his followers Barclay and Penn;
                    and this visit he renewed in 1684, extending his tour through a considerable
                    part of North Germany. The later years of his life were spent mostly in London,
                    where he continued to give public addresses, comparatively unmolested, until
                    within a few days of his death, which took place November 13, 1690.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n533/mode/1up"

                <p>In personal appearance Fox was tall and strongly built, “graceful in countenance,
                    manly in personage, grave in gesture;” in manner he was courteous and
                    unaffected, “civil, beyond all forms of breeding,” and “tender, compassionate,
                    and pitiful;” essentially, he was “a heavenly-minded man, zealous for the name
                    of the Lord, and preferred the honour of God before all things;” “a man that God
                    endued with a clear and wonderful depth, a discerner of others’ spirits, and
                    very much a master of his own.” These and similar characterizations by his
                    friendly contemporaries, who, for the rest, do not pretend that he was in any
                    way remarkable either for grasp of intellect or for profundity in learning,
                    surely deserve some weight as against the somewhat prevalent opinion that Fox
                    was nothing more than a vulgar charlatan whom we have “no reason for placing
                    morally or intellectually above Ludowick Muggleton or Joanna Southcote”
                    (Macaulay). The mere fact that he was able to attract to himself so considerable
                    a body of respectable followers, including such men as Ellwood, Barclay, and
                    Penn, is sufficient to prove that he possessed in a very eminent degree the
                    power of conviction, persuasion, and moral ascendency; while of his personal
                    uprightness, single-mindedness, and sincerity there ought to be no question.</p>
                <p>The writings of Fox have been collected in three volumes folio,— the first
                    containing his journal, the second his correspondence, and the third all that he
                    has written in vindication of his doctrines. The <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>
                    is especially interesting; of it Sir James Mackintosh has said that “it is one
                    of the most extraordinary and instructive naιτatives in the world, which no
                    reader of competent judgment can peruse without revering the virtue of the
                    writer.” Of other works attributed to him, perhaps the most curious is that
                    originally published in London in 1660, entitled <hi rend="italic">A battle door
                    for teachers and professors to learn singular and plural; you to many and thou
                    to one; singular, one, thou; plural, many, you.</hi> According to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal,</hi> however, this performance is not to be attributed
                    solely to Fox. “J. Stubbs and Benjamin Furly took great pains in compiling it,
                    which I set them upon, and some things I added to it.” Indeed, it has sometimes
                    been seriously doubted whether he was the real author of any of the publications
                    which have been attributed to him; but this doubt, which proceeds merely upon
                    the fact of his very imperfect literary education, seems to be conclusively
                    settled by the clause in his will (which document may bø seen in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Harleian Miscellany,</hi> vii. 599) referring to his “Bookes,
                    Episeles, and Papers.” The <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> was originally
                    published in London in 1694, and has frequently been reprinted. A very useful
                    edition is the seventh, with notes biographical and historical by Wilson
                    Armistead, London, 1852. Several Memoirs of Fox have recently appeared,—one by
                    J. Marsh in 1846; another by Janney, with dissertations on his views concerning
                    the doctrine, testimonies, and discipline of the Christian church (Philadelphia,
                    1852); a third by the Rev. John Selby Watson (London, 1860). For details of the
