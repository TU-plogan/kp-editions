                    Franc-maçonnerie, <hi rend="italic">Ger.</hi> Freimaurerei), is the name given
                    to that system of ritual and rules which Freemasons observe. It may also be
                    applied to the masonic art, or the practice of masonic ritual and rule. The
                    institution is not older than the beginning of the 18th century, but it has been
                    lately said to include more than 10,000 lodges and more than 1,000,000 members.
                    Before considering the history and actual position of the modern society itself,
                    however, a few words are due to the really interesting and much-debated question
                    of its origin and antecedents. It is, of course, easy to point out vague
                    analogies between Freemasonry and the great secret organizations having social
                    aims, which existed in antiquity. The Pythagoreans, the Eleusinians, the
                    Essenes, and the Carmathites and Fedavi (the mystic Rationalists of Islam) have
                    all been appealed to by uncritical masonic writers in the hope of giving to
                    their craft the doubtful authority and prestige of ancient descent. If the
                    resemblances were more numerous and striking than they are, they would not prove
                    an historical connexion between organizations so widely removed from one another
                    in time, and they would admit of explanation by the general doctrine of
                    psychical identity, one of the most important results of anthropological
                    science. Besides this, the superficial resemblances are accompanied by radical
                    differences. The mere conception of Freemasonry implies cosmopolitan
                    brotherhood, and was therefore impossible in the ancient world. If indeed the
                    genuine legends of the craft were followed, its origin would be traced to the
                    creation, the flood, or at least the building of Solomon’s temple. Accordingly,
                    one of the most popular and voluminous masonic writers of the 19th century, the
                    Rev. George Oliver, informs the world that Moses was a grand master, Joshua his
                    deputy, and Aholiab and Bezaleel grand wardens. Again, a likeness, sometimes
                    real and sometimes fanciful, between the sets of symbols and ceremonies used has
                    led many writers to see an organic connexion between Freemasonry and the
                    Assassins, the Rosicrucians, the Templars, the Illuminati, the Carbonari, and
                    the Hetairia, <pb break="no"

                    old and young, of the most widely differing aims. It is possible that
                    Freemasonry copied an older ritual, which was again imitated by younger
                    societies, who also endeavoured to utilize masonic lodges as stations for
                    proselytizing work. But these facts themselves show discontinuity of life. The
                    true historical precursors of the modern fraternity of Freemasons were the
                    mediaeval building corporations. Of these the most distinctive type is to be
                    found in the stone masons <hi rend="italic">{Steinmetzen)</hi> of Germany. It is
                    a further and more difficult question what were the relations between these
                    mediaeval societies and the Roman collegia not struck at by the law <hi

                    exchequer, an archive, patrons, religious ceremonies, an oath, a benefit and
                    burial fund, and a register. They had such officers as magistri, decuriones,
                    tabularii, censores, and they instructed their apprentices to a certain extent
                    in secret. No doubt such <hi rend="italic">sodalitia</hi> existed for centuries
                    in Gaul and Britain, and they may have deposited in the civilization of these
                    countries some of their ideas and habits. Again, at a later period, there was a
                    distinct invitation sent from the West to the building corporations of
                    Byzantium; the movement westward was increased by the iconoclasm of Leo. But the
                    European building societies were undoubtedly distinct growths. The <hi
                    rend="italic">caementarii</hi> or <hi rend="italic">liberi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >muratores</hi> at first grouped themselves round the monasteries, especially of
                    the Benedictine order. The abbots were in many cases the architects who employed
                    the masons on ecclesiastical buildings and repairs. As architecture developed,
                    and with increasing wealth the church gradually undertook larger and nobler
                    works, these societies of craftsmen also assumed a more definite and more
                    durable form. The taste and science of Gothic architecture were to a large
                    extent the possession of the <hi rend="italic">Bauhütten,</hi> or wooden booths
                    where the stone-cutters during the progress of the work kept their tools,
                    worked, held their meetings, and probably also took their meals and slept. In
                    the 12th century there are distinct traces of a general association of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bauhütten</hi> throughout Germany, acknowledging one set of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordnungen</hi> or craft laws, one set of secret signs and
                    ceremonies <hi rend="italic">{Heimlichkeiten)</hi> and to a certain extent one
                    central authority in the Haupthütte of Strasburg.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The importance of this was first pointed out
                    in Abbé Grandidier’s letter, which forms App. xvii. to De Luchet’s <hi

                    Albertus Magnus (1205-1280) is supposed to have introduced many of the Jewish
                    and Arabian symbols which were popular in the craft. The privileges which a <hi
                    rend="italic">Bauhütte</hi> was able to give to its masters, parlierer
                    (speakers), and journeymen, were chiefly “a share in the administration of
                    justice, in the election of officers, in the banquets, and in works of charity.”
                    The trade customs and symbolic forms of these associations have been described
                    by Fallou in his <hi rend="italic">Mysterien der Freimaurer</hi> (1859), Winzer

                    however, probably applied to the apprentice even before initiation. See the <hi

                    trades at this time differed when a cathedral or palace was being built, the
                    architect being then master of the lodge with foremen under him; and when a
                    dwelling-house was built, the owner then engaging both masters and workmen.
                    There was thus a nearer approach to the modern factory system; and in fact the
                    well-known English statutes against combinations, congregations, and chapters of
                    workmen (34 Edw. III. c. 9, and 3 Hen. VI. c. 1) were directed against the
                    excessive wages of journeymen. The separate interests of this class found
                    expression in the contemporary French institution of Compagnonnage.<note

                    seems, even at an early date, to have been favourable to liberty of thought and
                    religious toleration. Hence they were prohibited by the council of Avignon in
                    1326. Tlιe authority of the <hi rend="italic">Haupthütte</hi> was recognized at
                    the great assemblies of Ratisbon and Strasburg in 1459, the statutes of which
                    received imperial confirmation. It was legally destroyed by an edict of 1731,
                    long before which time its practical vitality had ceased. England imported much
                    of her lodge organization and learning from Germany. The York charter, on which
                    she based her claim to a native system in the time of Athelstan, is a much later
                    document. This charter contains the famous legend of the craft which derives the
                    seven liberal sciences (masonry being a part of geometry) from the family of
                    Lamech. This science, preserved on a stone pillar from the flood, was taught by
                    Euclid to the Egyptians, and carried by Israel to the building of the temple.
                    Maymus Graecus brought it to Charles Martel and to England. The early history of
                    the English mason lodges has been illustrated by the works of Wm. J. Hughan,—

                    Freemason.</hi></p></note> The first instance of a gentleman or amateur being
                    “accepted” is that of the antiquary Elias Ashmole (afterwards Windsor Herald
                    under Charles II.) who, along with Colonel Manwaring, was entered at Warrington
                    in 1646. The causes which led to the introduction of a new class of members, and
                    gradually converted operative into speculative masonry, are well stated by
                    Findel, the learned editor of the German masonic journal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Bauhütte,</hi> whose <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Freemasonry</hi> (translated into English in 1869) is by far the most scientific
                    and complete work upon the subject. In the first place the old secrets of Gothic
                    masonry were rendered less valuable by the spread of Augustan and Renaissance
                    architecture, which Inigo Jones and his patron Lord Pembroke had been studying
                    on the Continent. Jones was patron of the Freemasons from 1607 to 1618. He
                    invited several Italian artists to join the body. Then the disorder of the civil
                    wars prevented meetings and broke up the masonic connexion. Again the growing
                    spirit of the Reformation in religion gave men a freedom of speech which
                    superseded the marks and caricatures in which the old masons exposed the vices
                    of the church. Toleration was soon a political fact. Science, too, <pb

                    interrogation of nature was preferred to legend and allegory. At the same time a
                    perfectly distinct current of ideas was originated by the Arabian mysticism of
                    Paracelsus and Rosenkreuz, which, after being popularized on the Continent by
                    one of its most decided opponents, Valentine Andreae, was preached to the people
                    of England by Robert Fludd in his <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Theologico Philosophicus.</hi> Works like Bacon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">New Atlantis</hi> and Dupuy’s “History of the Condemnation of the
                    Templars” (in his <hi rend="italic">Traitez concernant P Histoire de
                    France,</hi> 1651) fostered the idea of a new humanitarian society, and at the
                    same time suggested the adoption of ancient symbols of fellowship. The same
                    thing is seen in the <hi rend="italic">Pantheisticon</hi> of Toland. It was
                    under the impulse thus communicated that a general assembly of masons was held
                    in 1663, at which the old catechisms were revised, and a series of new statutes
                    passed. The reconstruction of London after the fire, the building of St Paul’s,
                    and the patronage of Sir Christopher Wren, kept up the interest in the movement;
                    and at last a formal resolution was passed that the masonic privileges should no
                    longer be confined to operative masons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">England.—</hi> Modern or speculative masonry may be said to
                    have begun in London on June 24, 1717, “the high noon of the year, the day of
                    light and of roses,” when the four London lodges,having erected themselves into
                    a grand lodge, named their first grand master. The leading spirits in this
                    revival were Desaguliers, the well-known popularizer of natural science, and
                    James Anderson, a Scotch Presbyterian minister, who compiled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Constitutions,</hi> containing the ancient regulations and
                    charges of the craft. This book is quite uncritical. It is said that the
                    mechanical tastes and the Huguenot principles of Desaguliers are both traceable
                    in the subsequent organization of the society. From this time new lodges could
                    be formed only by warrant from the grand lodge, but they were empowered to
                    create masters and fellow crafts. In 1721 the duke of Montagu was elected grand
                    warden. He was the first noble who obtained that office. In the strange society
                    of Gormogones, subject to the “sub-oecumenical volgi” at Rome, it is supposed
                    that the Jesuits made a final effort to secure English Freemasonry as a channel
                    for their political influence. At this time, also, the committee of charity was
                    formed, which has since raised and expended very large sums for the relief of
                    distressed brethren, and built the boys’ and girls’ masonic schools at Battersea
                    Rise and Tottenham. Provincial grand masters were appointed, and charters
                    granted to many foreign lodges. In the latter part of the 18th century the
                    ancient York Lodge, backed by several old masons who had been indulging in
                    irregular initiations, put forward a rival claim to be grand lodge or supreme
                    authority. This claim was rested on the fable of an assembly at York in the year
                    926. The York people had also a new ritual, described in the <hi rend="italic"

                    makes an exception in favour of the masonic lodges, which, according to the Act,
                    meet chiefly for benevolent purposes. In 1813 a union was at lust brought about
                    by the dukes of Sussex, Kent, and Athole between the rival grand lodges of
                    London and York, henceforth known as the United Grand Lodge of England. This
                    patronage of aristocratic blood gave an impetus to Freemasonry, and in 1832 Mr

                    succeeded in founding the Freemason’s Asylum. The brotherhood showed their good
                    sense in deciding about this time that Jews might become members of the craft.
                    They also built a hall, established their archaeological institute and “The

                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> The first Irish lodge of speculative masonry
                    seems to have been opened at Dublin in 1730. The English constitutions were
                    adopted wholesale. Nothing of interest occurs in the Irish history. A
                    characteristic liking is shown for the most sonorous of the high degrees :—the
                    knights of the sword, the east, and the sun, the rosicrucian or mason prince,
                    the kadosh or philosophical mason, and the grand general inspector. Power to
                    grant these degrees was absurdly enough obtained from “Mother Kilwinning,” a
                    Scotch lodge which has always laid claim to a fabulous antiquity. The disputes
                    between the grand chapter and grand consistory of Dublin have been frequent and
                    violent. Ireland has now 350 lodges. The grand lodge, which supports two orphan
                    schools, has an in come of about £4000. A statement of the Ultramontane argument
                    in modern Ireland will be found in Gargano’s <hi rend="italic">Irish and English
                    Freemasons,</hi> Dublin, 1878, which is largely founded on Mgr. Dupanloup’s <hi

                    against Church and State.</hi> Gargano strongly urges the injustice done by the
                    secret preference given by masons to one another in the ordinary civil and
                    commercial relations of life. His book also contains an explanation of the
                    pass-grip and real-grip for the three ordinary degrees, and for the mark master,
                    the royal arch, and the knight templar, and a minute description of the modern
                    initiation, with the text of the oaths.</p>

                    resembles what took place in England. Before the 16th century there is not much
                    trace of special legislation about masons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>As may be seen from the “marks” on Melrose Abbey, the older
                    Scotch churches owe much to the skill of the Frenchman John Moreau and other
                    foreign masons.</p></note> Like the other crafts they enjoyed, under the Act of
                    1424, the right of nominating their own deacon or master-man. The deacon gave
                    place to the warden, who represented rather the public than the trade interest.
                    In 1493 the masons and wrights are denounced as oppressors of the lieges,
                    because they had agreed that “they sail have fee alsweill for the halie day as
                    for the wark day,” and “that quair ony be-giennis ane mannis warke ane uther
                    sail not end it.” A severe blow was struck against their privileges by an Act of

                    jurisdiction from the trade visitors to the deacons, and confirmed their ancient
                    right of self-regulation. In 1598-9 we have the celebrated statutes and
                    ordinances to be observed “by all master masons, set down by William Shaw,
                    master of work to his majesty, and general warden of the craft.” These
                    documents, one of which was preserved in the charter chest of the Eglinton
                    family, are printed in Mr Murray Lyon’s learned <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Freemasonry in Scotland,</hi> Edin., 1873. They are confined to trade
                    regulation, and do not deal with benefits. They fix the number of apprentices,
                    the examination on entrance, the subscription to the box, the election of
                    officers, provision for the safety of craftsmen, &amp;c. The “Old Buik” of the
                    Kilwinning Lodge was not really a Scotch document. It was a version of the
                    English masonic legend and charges. The ceremony of initiation was at this time
                    very simple; but the speaking plack, the dinner, and the pitcher of ale were
                    exacted. The system of degrees was not developed. There was probably a
                    pass-word, such as the squaremen word used in the “brithering” of the wrights
                    and slaters. The individual “marks” chosen by entrants were carefully
                    registered, but they did not indicate status. The mark degree, revived in 1869,
                    and made the subject of a conference in 1871, was not known before 1789. In
                    fact, the apprentices were originally present at and concurred in most of the
                    business of the lodge. This word “lodge” occurs for the first time in a “statute
                    anent the government of the master mason of the College Kirk of St Giles,” 1491,
                    which is to be found in the burgh records of Edinburgh. It would appear that the
                    deacon of the civil trade incorporation was often <hi rend="italic">ex
                    officio</hi> head of the lodge. The quarter-master and the intender or
                    instructor were also officers in the old lodge. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cowans,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Statutes.</hi> The traces of female membership are explained by
                    the custom of the widows and daughters of freemen being admitted, at least to
                    finish the contracts of the deceased. The Hay MSS. in the Advocates’ Library
                    contain two charters or letters of jurisdiction, dated in 1601 and 1628, by the
                    freemen masons and hammermen in favour of the St Clairs of Rosslyn, in virtue of
                    which the head of that family for a long time acted as the patron, protector,
                    and judge of the early masonic lodges. This has sometimes been inaccurately
                    represented as a heritable conveyance of a grand mastership. As in England,
                    there are traces of amateurs or non-operative members being gradually admitted
                    to full privileges even in the 17th century, though such persons were charged
                    higher entrance fees. This was called the theorie or geomatic as opposed to the
                    domatic or operative element. Boswell of Auchinleck was a member so early as
                    1600. The first years of the 18th century were marked by movements of
                    insubordination among the journeymen, who considered themselves entitled to a
                    larger share of control over the common purse. The original theory of the lodge
                    was that only masters, and not fellowcrafts or apprentices, were members. In
                    1721 the enthusiastic Desaguliers appeared in Edinburgh; and on November 30,
                    1736, the first general assembly of symbolical masons was held, and a grand
                    lodge for Scotland formed. The representative of the St Clair family then
                    resigned his hereditary office and was elected first grand master. St Andrew’s
                    day was substituted for the day of St “John the Baptist. Provincial grand
                    masters were soon added, and there was a general adhesion of Scotch lodges to
                    the new organization. The subsequent history of the brotherhood is not eventful.
                    In Scotland they have been more remarkable for conviviality, or “refreshment,”
                    as it is technically called, than for comprehensive charity. Their gloves,
                    aprons, sashes, and jewels are well known in festival or funeral processions.
                    Their political relations have been peaceful. In 1757 the Associate Synod
                    excommunicated all persons taking the secret oath, but this was only a part of
                    the general defiance which Cameronianism gives to civil duty. In 1800, when
                    intercourse with some Irish regiments had introduced the templar degrees to some
                    of the Ayrshire lodges, an attempt was made by the law officers of the crown to
                    convict certain templars at Maybole of sedition and the administration of
                    unlawful oaths. The case only resulted in the disclosure of the extremely absurd
                    ceremonies connected with the two degrees of this royal order, viz., Heredom of
                    Kilwinning and Rosy Cross. One of them consisted in drinking porter out of a
                    human skull. Again, when political feeling ran high at the beginning of the
                    present century, the authority of the grand lodge was seriously shaken by the
                    revolt of the associated lodges headed by Canongate Kilwinning. The Court of
                    Session, Lawson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Gordon, July 7, 1810, F. C., refused
                    to recognize a masonic lodge as a corporation, and in another case they rejected
                    the argument that lodges certified by the grand lodge were alone entitled to the
                    protection of the excepting clause in the Act of 1799. The quarrel was speedily
                    arranged. In 1811 a supreme grand royal arch chapter of Scotland was founded at
                    Edinburgh, but its degrees were denounced and have never been recognized by the
                    grand lodge. Scotland has altogether 400 lodges.<note anchored="true"

                    by the <hi rend="italic">Philalèthes,</hi> of which Court de Gebelin, the
                    Camisard historian, was a member.</p></note> was still, however, keenly felt,
                    and in 1781 the Grand Orient adopted four of the higher degrees, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">élu,</hi><hi rend="italic">chevalier</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d'</hi><hi rend="italic">orient,</hi><hi rend="italic">écossais,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">chevalier rosecroix.</hi> All this while an active hostility was
                    kept up between the Orient and the original Grand Lodge, each of which was
                    supported by a separate Rosicrucian organization besides its own proper lodges.
                    The work of both was suspended during the Revolution, but in 1799 a national
                    union was effected by Roettiers. No sooner, however, was this done, and the
                    statutes, originally based on the English constitutions, thoroughly revived,
                    than French masonry again suffered from an invasion of mysticism,—first, in the
                    form of the Scottish Philosophic Rite (including such profundities as the
                    luminous ring and the white and black eagle), and, secondly, in the American
                    Ancient and Accepted Scotch Rite of 33 degrees, which the charlatan De
                    Grasse-Tilly expounded with great success, but which in 1804 was amalgamated
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Grand Orient,</hi> the great marshals Masséna and
                    Kellermann being then the leading members of the two bodies. The union did not
                    last, as Napoleon disliked the constitution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Supreme</hi><hi rend="italic">Conseil,</hi> which was largely influenced by the
                    aristocracy. His brother Joseph, assisted by Murat and Cambacérès, was allowed
                    to take office in the older organization. An order of templars appeared in 1804,
                    and was followed by the absurd <hi rend="italic">Bite Misraim,</hi> which
                    contains 90 degrees of the most fantastic kind. The French clergy in their
                    denunciations of Freemasonry set an example of bigotry, which the masons
                    themselves followed in their treatment of Clavel, author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Pittoresque de la Franc-maçonnerie,</hi> one of the few rational books
                    on the subject in the language. During the reactionary Catholic policy of the
                    grand master Murat the younger (1852-62), the liberties of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orient</hi> were greatly interfered with and its funds almost exhausted. Since
                    then it has slowly recovered. It has now 292 lodges: and <hi rend="italic

                <p>Space does not admit of a detailed description of the advances of Freemasonry in
                    other parts of Europe and in America. In Germany, where the chief lodge at
                    Berlin is known as the grand royal mother lodge, <hi rend="italic">Zu den drei
                    Welt-Kugeln,</hi> it was patronized by Frederick the Great, and opposed by Maria
                    Theresa. Its relations with the Illuminati of Weishauptare of extreme historical
                    interest; and the question of the higher degrees was discussed at the great
                    conference of Wilhelmsbad in 1782. The cause was helped by the adhesion of such
                    great men as Lessing in his <hi rend="italic">Ernst</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >und</hi><hi rend="italic">Falk,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gespräche für

                    songs, and whose <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> is a favourite book
                    among the craft. Germany has now 314 lodges, some of them, however, un der the
                    Swedish rite. The critical history of the institution and much of its general
                    literature has been written there. The chief historians are Schröder, Krause,
                    Fessler, and Findel. Kloss has published a bibliography which is supplemented by
                    the American Barthelmess and by Findel. Marbach, Ritterhaus, and Löwe are the
                    poets of the order in Germany, as Morris is in America. One of the most recent
                    German publications is <hi rend="italic">Sarsena,</hi><hi rend="italic">oder der
                    Vollkommene Baumeister,</hi> Leipsic, 1874. As regards America it is sufficient
                    to refer to the great anti-masonic movement of 1826, which was caused by the
                    kidnapping and supposed murder by masons of a man called Morgan of Batavia, and
                    which continued for some time to influence the presidential elections.
                    Convictions for abduction were obtained. There have for more than a century been
                    negro lodges in the United States. In Brazil in 1876 the hostility between
                    masonry and the Catholic Church was shown in the production of the play <hi
                    rend="italic">Os Mason e os Jesuitas,</hi> in which the dishonesty of the priest
                    is contrasted with the manly virtue of the mason.</p>
                <p>As regards the future of Freemasonry, it is impossible, at least for outsiders,
                    to say much. The celebration of the brotherhood of man, and the cultivation of
                    universal goodwill in the abstract, seem rather indefinite objects for any
                    society in this unimaginative age. There is, on the one hand, a tendency to
                    degenerate into mere conviviality; while, if schools, or asylums, or other
                    charities are supported, to that extent of course the society becomes local and
                    even exclusive in its character. Tn the meantime, masonry is to blame for
                    keeping afloat in the minds of its members many of the most absolutely puerile
                    ideas. A more accurate knowledge of its own singular and not undignified history
                    would tend more than anything else to give worth and elevation to its aims. No
                    one now believes the stupid slander that freemasons are engaged in any definite
                    conspiracy against the state, religion, or social order. There is, however,
                    something in their fundamental principles, the fraternity of men and their
                    indifference to theological belief, and also in their recent movements, which
                    perhaps justifies the suspicion, and even hatred, with which they are regarded
                    by the Ultramontane party. Masonry in each country of course takes its colouring
                    from the state of thought and feeling by which it is surrounded. But it cannot
                    be disputed that the German, Dutch, Belgian, and French magazines of the craft
                    occasionally exhibit a tone which is not favourable to Christianity regarded as
                    a special revelation. The tendency of political opinion in such an association
                    is also necessarily democratic; and while it would be absurd to make the
                    brotherhood answerable for the opinions of Mazzini or the outrages of the
                    commune, and while the majority of brethren are loyal subjects, and probably
                    also orthodox Christians (in the theological sense), the institution itself
                    undoubtedly “makes for” liberty in matters both civil and spiritual.</p>
                <p>The singular myth that modern freemasonry is derived through Scotland from the
                    historical order of the Templars has been treated in great detail and finally
                    destroyed byWilcke in his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> of the Order, 2 vols.,
                    Halle, 1860. The claim was rested on (1) the <hi rend="italic">Charta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">transmissionis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tabula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aurea</hi><hi rend="italic">Larmenii,</hi> alleged to have been
                    written in 1324 by Larmenius, the successor of grand-master Molay, who suffered
                    in the persecution; (2) an old parchment copy of Templar statutes; (3) several
                    alleged relics of the martyred Templars—all preserved in the archives of the
                    Masonic Templars at Paris. An abstract of the controversy will be found in the
                    appendix to FindeΓs <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> which also contains the form
                    of examination of a German Steinmetz, the Constitutions of the Masons of
                    Strasburg (1459), including the Statutes of Parlirers and Fellows, and the
                    Regulations of Apprentices; the Examination of the English Masons; a series of
                    the old English Charges or Exhortations; the General Regulations of 1721; and
                    the spurious Cologne Charter. The appendix of Mr Fort’s work contains the <hi

                    stonecutters named Claudius, Nicostratus, Sinforiamus, and Simplicius, to whose
                    memory the small church <hi rend="italic">Quattro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Santi</hi><hi rend="italic">Coronati</hi> at Rome was sacred. In the second
                    part of Mr Fort’s work will be found an accumulation of interesting facts
                    relating to the early organization of masonic societies, their ceremonies,
                    crypts and lodges, or places of meeting, and costumes; the payment of wages by
                    warden, and the power of superintendence by master; the symbolic meaning of the
                    hammer, the columns, the cord, the shoe; and the various uses of marks.</p>
                <p>The word freemason has been derived from the Norman French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frère Maçon,</hi> brother mason, and also from the expression freestone mason.
                    The origin of the word mason is itself uncertain. The low Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">macio</hi> may be the German <hi rend="italic">Metz</hi>; but Diez
                    regards it as a modification of <hi rend="italic">marcio,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">marcus,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> hammer. Littré suggests that
                    the Latin <hi rend="italic">maceria,</hi> a stone wall, may contain a radical
                    <hi rend="italic">mac,</hi> from which <hi rend="italic">macio</hi> has been
                    formed. This is rendered more probable by the Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >macine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">maeigno,</hi> a stone lap mill, where the root
                    idea of mace or hammer, used for pounding corn, is referred to. Tiler, the name
                    of a masonic officer stationed at the door of the lodge, obviously comes from
                    <hi rend="italic">tailleur de pierre,</hi> the lapidicine of several mediaeval
                    charters. (W. C. S.)</p>
