                <p><label type="entry">FINLAND</label> (Finnish <hi rend="italic">Suomi,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Suomenmaa,</hi> the Swampy Region, of which Finland—Fen Land—is
                    said to be a Swedish translation), a grand-duchy forming an administrative
                    division or government of Russia, lies between 59° 48' and 70° 6' N. lat., and
                    20° 29' and 32° 47' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Norway, on the E. by the
                    governments of Archangel and Olonetz, on the S. by the Gulf of Finland, and on
                    the W. by the Gulf of Bothnia. Its greatest length is 717 miles, greatest
                    breadth 378 miles, the average breadth being about 185 miles; the area is
                    144,221 square miles. The surface is a labyrinthine mixture of land and water;
                    and the sea-coast, especially in the south and south-west, presents the same
                    succession of fiords and rocky headlands that characterizes the coasts of Norway
                    and Sweden. The fiords of Finland, however, seldom exceed a few miles in extent.
                    The coast is studded with innumerable small islands and rocks called skår; some
                    of these islands, as those of Sveaborg, have been converted into fortresses of
                    great strength. The intricate archipelago of islets and granite and limestone
                    rocks in the Bothnian gulf renders the navigation extremely dangerous. The lakes
                    occupy about 12 per cent, of the area, the marshes 20 per cent., so that Finland
                    is more abundantly supplied with water than any other country in the world. The
                    land appears to have been formerly a sea-bed, which was gradually elevated and
                    is still rising at the rate of about 3’4 feet on the Gulf of Bothnia, and 1’9
                    feet on the Gulf of Finland in a hundred years. The surface consists of
                    primitive rocks, as gneiss, porphyritic and synetic granite, diorite, gabbro,
                    and hyperesthene, and of formations allied to the older metamorphic and the
                    Cambrian. Neither fossils nor coal have been found. Geologists suppose that the
                    land, a low table-land, continuous along its north-western and southern borders
                    with two low and flat border-ridges, was long ago covered with an immense
                    ice-sheet, which, creeping from Scandinavia, crossed the Gulf of Bothnia,
                    traversed southern Finland in a direction south by east, crossed the Gulf of
                    Finland, and crept further on in the Baltic provinces. The numberless striae,
                    the positions and directions of which exclude any suspicion of their having been
                    traced by floating ice, the striation on the islands of the shallow gulfs,
                    together with that of the Onega basin, the Neva valley, and the Baltic
                    provinces, the uninterrupted sheet of till, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of a
                    true unstratified and unwashed morainic deposit covering Finland, the numberless
                    moraines parallel to the glacial striae, and hundreds of other evidences seem to
                    settle the existence of such an ice-sheet beyond doubt. As to traces of marine
                    formations, there are none above a level of about 100 or 120 feet; only
                    lacustrine deposits cover the till above this level.</p>
                <p>The greater portion of the interior is, as has been said, a vast table-land,
                    averaging in height from 350 to 400 feet, and interspersed will hills of no
                    great elevation. Heights of considerable elevation are found only in the most
                    northerly part, where the highest summit, Haldefjäll (Lappish Haldischok), rises
                    to 4124 feet in the north-west on the Norwegian border. Other single mountains
                    reach from 2000 to 3000 feet, and the higher ridges 1000 feet. The land falls
                    towards the south. The principal central ridge Maanselkå (⅛.e., land-ridge),
                    about 1300 feet high, the watershed between the Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of
                    Bothnia, forms the boundary between Russia and Finland from 68° to 64° N. lat.,
                    running thence under the name of Suomen-selkå (⅛.e., Finland-ridge) towards the
                    south-west as far as the Gulf of Bothnia, 62° N. lat. »Several spurs run off
                    from this ridge towards the south, forming watersheds, but rising little above
                    the general level of the table-land. The largest plain lies on the narrow middle
                    part of the Gulf of Bothnia.</p>
                <p>By the above-mentioned ridges Finland is divided into five great basins. In the
                    south-eastern basin, besides Lake Ladoga on the border, lies Lake Saima, along
                    with 120 larger and several thousand smaller lakes, discharging by the river
                    Wuoksen into Lake Ladoga; in the middle or southern basin is Lake Påijâne,
                    discharging by the river Kymmene into the Gulf of Finland; in the south-west
                    basin the waters unite near the town of Tammerfors in the little lake Pyhåjârvi,
                    and discharge by the river Kumo into the Bothnian Gulf; in the north-west is the
                    Ulea basin, with an outflow by the rivers Uleå, Kemi, and Torneå into the same
                    gulf; the north basin contains Lake Enare (nearly 1000 square miles), covered
                    with ice for ten months in the year, and sending its waters into the Arctic
                    Ocean. The rivers are full of rapids, and rarely navigable, but serve for
                    floating down large quantities of timber from the extensive woods of the
                    interior, and also furnish motive power for many mills. The lakes are united by
                    canals.</p>
                <p>The climate of Finland is severe, but generally healthy. The mean yearly
                    temperature in the north is 27 ’ 5° Fahr.; at Helsingfors, 38 ’ 7°. The average
                    annual rainfall is 20 inches.</p>

                <p>Immense forests cover one-half of the area of the country, reaching on the north
                    as far as Lake Enare. They consist chiefly of pine, spruce fir, and birch, the
                    oak growing wild only in the south, where also are found apples, pears, and
                    cherries. Rye is cultivated as far as the Arctic Circle, barley mostly in the
                    north to Lake Enare, oats as far as 65° N. lat., wheat but little and only in
                    the south, buckwheat and flax to 64° N. lat., hemp to 66°, and potatoes
                    everywhere. The flora includes 1080 phanerogams and 1800 cryptogams. Of wild
                    animals the bear, wolf, fox, ermine, hare, and squirrel are the most common,
                    with the lynx, elk, rein-deer; and seals in the sea and in Lakes Ladoga and
                    Saima. Among birds, are the woodcock, moorcock, blackcock, white ptarmigan,
                    partridge, swan, goose, duck. The fish include the salmon, perch, pike, and
                    other common kinds.</p>

                <p>The yearly increase of the population is at the rate of 1O5 per cent.; the
                    density is one person to 148*6 acres. The population of the 35 towns was, in
                    1875, 148,355, or 7 ’ 7 per cent, of the whole. Of the population 98 per cent,
                    belong to the Lutheran Church, somewhat less than 2 per cent, to the
                    Greco-Russian Church, while Roman Catholics and Jews together number only about
                    1230; in 1870 there were 86 Mahometans. Of the whole population, 85 per cent,
                    are Finns proper 14 per cent, are Swedishspeaking farmers and peasants, chiefly
                    in the governments of Nyland, Åbo, and Wasa, on the coasts and islands; Russians
                    number about 6000, besides the military, mostly in the towns; Germans 1200, in
                    Helsingfors and Wiborg; gipsies about 1000; and, to the furthest north, Lapps
                    600. Agriculture occupies about 80 per cent, of the population; trade, shipping,
                    and manufactures, 7 per cent.; the professions, Γ5 percent.; military, 1 per
                    cent. The proportion of men to women is 1000 to 1056. Tlιe average number of
                    illegitimate births is 7 per cent. The mean duration of life is 37 years, being
                    35 6 among men and 38 ’ 4 among women. The epidemic diseases are typhus, nervous
                    fever, and, in dry summers, diarrhoea. Of the deaths 3 per cent., or 1179
                    (1874), were violent. Nearly 7000 are whole or half blind. There is some
                    emigration to Russia and the north of Norway, and thence to the United States,
                    chiefly to Michigan.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation is agriculture, for which the soil in the south-west and on
                    the coast of Wasa is best adapted. Modern methods of agriculture are found only
                    in the south, the hoe being the principal implement in the east. The area under
                    cultivation is about 2,000,000 acres,—of which 700,000 are occupied with rye,
                    300,000 with barley, 240,000 with oats, and 600,000 are fallow. Sometimes,
                    especially in the north, the night-frosts destroy the crops, and then meal has
                    to be largely imported from Russia. There are ten agricultural schools, two of
                    which are of a higher class. Of the land 35 million acres belong to the crown, 6
                    millions to the upper classes, and 50 millions to the peasantry. Serfdom never
                    existed in the country.</p>
                <p>Of the exports about one-half is timber, though the forests are much thinned by
                    fires, uprooting, and extravagance. Of the land under wood (64 per cent.) 39 per
                    cent, belongs to the crown, under the superintendence of forestmasters, there
                    being one school of forestry. In 1876 there were upwards of 200 saw-mills, the
                    export amounting to 41,536,169 cubic feet—planks, boards, battens, &amp;c.,
                    besides 7,432,617 cubic feet of round timber.</p>
                <p>Cattle-breeding is successful on account of the many natural meadows, the good
                    pasturage, and abundance of water. Government gives premiums for riding and
                    draught horses, and for improvement in the breeds of horses and cattle. The
                    value of butter and other dairy produce exported in 1875 amounted to nearly
                    £800,000; of horses 250,000, horned cattle 100,000, sheep 900,000, swine
                    190,000, and rein-deer 60,000 were exported.</p>
                <p>The herring fishery is of some importance, while the rivers yield considerable
                    quantities of salmon, and the lakes white-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(shoregonus</hi><hi rend="italic">albus).</hi> The export of fish in 1876 was
                    valued at over £100,000.</p>
                <p>Granite, marble, felspar, and quartz are quarried to the north of Lake Ladoga,
                    and porphyry on the island of Hoglaud. There is also an extensive granite quarry
                    at Pytterlahti near Fredrikshamn. Iron-mining and smelting are important
                    industries. In 1876 68,000 tons of iron ore were raised; 21 iron-works turned
                    out 26,000 tons of cast-iron. Besides this, 13 refining works turned out 16,000
                    tons of bar-iron. The iron exports in 1874 amounted to 19,230 tons, and the
                    imports were 47,270 tons, half of which consisted of ore; while in 1876 the iron
                    export amounted to only 12,000, and the import to 31,000 tons. Copper and tin
                    .are found, and in Lapland a little gold. Lime is obtained nearly
                    everywhere.</p>
                <p>Finland has about 420 manufactories of various kinds, giving employment to about
                    11,000 workpeople. The principal articles manufactured are metal goods, cotton
                    goods, woollen cloth, paper, candles, soap, tobacco, sugar, brandy, beer,

                <p>The value of the whole exports in 1876 amounted to £3,948,200, timber
                    representing about one-half, cattle one-seventh, grain about 1 per cent., iron
                    and steel goods about 7 per cent., woven goods 7 per cent., paper 2⅛ per cent.,
                    fish and game nearly 3 per cent., tar 3⅜ per cent., butter, &lt;fcc., 21 per
                    cent. The imports were valued at £5,541,710; of this 15 per cent, represented
                    woven goods, grain 17∣ per cent., iron and steel 8⅜ percent., coffee 7 per
                    cent., sugar 6 per cent., cotton 4⅜ per cent., tobacco 2⅛ per cent., salt 2 per
                    cent., wine and spirits 3⅜ per cent. In 1876 the exports showed an increase in
                    timber, tar, butter, grain, and hides, and a falling off in woollen goods and
                    iron. In the import list a falling off took place in all articles except cotton,
                    petroleum, and coffee. In 1876 the custom-house receipts were £424,603, showing
                    a falling off of about one-tenth as compared with 1875. In the imports Russia
                    holds the first place, Germany being second, Great Britain third, and Norway and
                    Sweden fourth. Russia also comes first in the export list, Great Britain second,
                    and Germany and Norway and Sweden respectively third and fourth. The shipping
                    that entered the various ports numbered 9364 vessels of all kinds, of 1,314,999
                    registered tons; 9220 vessels of 1,310,679 tons cleared the ports. The Finnish
                    merchant shipping in 1875 numbered 1900 vessels of more than 18∣ tons (280,000
                    tons in all); 125 of these (7103 tons) were steamers. A considerable amount of
                    shipbuilding is carried on on the west coast.</p>
                <p>The total length of the state railways is 524 miles, which, with a private
                    railway of 21 miles, connect the capital Helsingfors with Åbo, Hangδ,
                    Tammerfors, Tavastehus, Borgå, Wiborg, and St Petersburg. The longest canal is
                    that known as the Saima canal, 37 miles long, connecting Lake Saima with the
                    Gulf of Finland; besides this there are several smaller canals rendering <pb

                <p>The education of Finland is carried on in one university (Helsingfors), 14

                    These include both state and private schools. For popular instruction there are
                    three normal seminaries and 448 primary schools, most of them Finnish, 67 being
                    Swedish, <hi rend="italic">5</hi> mixed Finnish and Swedish, and 2 Russian.
                    Besides these there seem to be a number of peripatetic teachers who teach many
                    that do not attend school. In 1875 24 publishers issued 154 books, which had a
                    sale of a million and a quarter copies. There are 55 journals of various kinds,
                    one-half being Finnish.</p>
                <p>The czar of Russia is grand-duke of Finland, the external affairs of both
                    countries being the same. So far as internal administration is concerned,
                    Finland is an independent state. The constitution dates from 1772-1789, and is
                    based besides upon the pledge of the czar Alexander I. in 1809 (when Swedish
                    Finland was annexed), renewed by his successors, and upon the decree of the diet
                    of date 1869. The czar decides as to war and peace, and as to treaties, has the
                    right of pardon, appoints the officials of the country, who, however, must be
                    natives, and is the last appeal in law. The government of the country and the
                    administration of justice are carried on by the Imperial Senate for Finland,
                    consisting of eighteen members appointed by the czar, under the presidency of
                    the governor-general of Finland. The particular affairs on which the czar has to
                    decree are laid before him by the state secretary for Finland. The legislative
                    function is exercised by the czar and diet or landtag <hi rend="italic"
                    >(foeim),</hi> without the consent of which no law can be either ordained or
                    repealed, no new taxes imposed, or soldiers levied. The diet is called together
                    every five years, and consists of the representatives of the nobility, clergy,
                    citizens, and peasantry. The nobility are represented by the heads of the noble
                    families admitted into the House of Nobles; the other deputies are elected, the
                    bishops being admitted on account of their office. The official language is
                    Swedish. For administrative purposes Finland is divided into eight låns or
                    governments, the names of which are given above. An older division was the
                    districts of Finland proper, Åland, Sata-Kunta, Nyland, Tavastland, Karelen,
                    Savolaks, Osterbotten, and Lapland. The låns are divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >harads</hi> or districts, and these into parishes or communes, of which there
                    are 480, and which have the management of their own internal affairs. The
                    administration of the law lies in the first place with the senate, in the second
                    place with the high courts established in Âbo, Nikolaistad, Wasa, and Wiborg,
                    and finally with the district courts in the country and the municipal courts in
                    the towns. The established religion is that of the Evangelical Lutheran Church,
                    under the archbishop of Åbo and the bishops of Borgå and Kuopio. There is an
                    ecclesiastical assembly or convocation every ten years, with thirty-four
                    clerical and fifty lay representatives, There is complete religious freedom for
                    other bodies. The Greco-Russian parishes are under the metropolitan in St
                    Petersburg.</p>
                <p>The public income of the country in 1877 was £1,267,732, and the expenditure
                    £1,267,738, while on January 1, 1878, the debt was £2,462,470. Besides the
                    national bank of Finland, there are two private banks, thirty-nine savings’
                    banks, and three fire insurance establishments. The military force of Finland
                    consists of one battalion of riflemen. The Finnish coinage consists of a <hi
                    rend="italic">markka</hi> or silver mark of 100 <hi rend="italic">penni,</hi>
                    equal to about 9∣d. In 1878 a new gold coinage was issued, consisting of two
                    pieces of 20 and 10 francs or markka respectively. The Finnish mile is equal to
                    10 versts or 6’64 English miles. The fathom of 3 ells of 2 Finnish feet is equal
                    to 1 ’ 9483 English yards. The <hi rend="italic">tunland</hi> contains 1 ’ 21983
                    acres. The “ship-pound” contains 374*85 ft avoirdupois, the Finnish lb being

                    imperial gallon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> It was probably at end of the 7th or beginning
                    of the 8th century that the Finns took possession of what is now Finland, though
                    it was only when Christianity was introduced, about 1157, that they were brought
                    into contact with civilized Europe. They probably found the Lapps in possession
                    of the country. The early Finlanders do not seem to have had any governmental
                    organization, but to have lived in separate communities and villages independent
                    of each other. Their mythology consisted in the deification of the forces of
                    nature, as “Ukko,” the god of the air, “Tapio,” god of the forests, “Ahti,” the
                    god of water, &amp;c. These early Finlanders seem to have been both brave aud
                    troublesome to their neighbours, and their repeated attacks on the coast of
                    Sweden drew the attention of the kings of that country. King Eric IX. (St Eric),
                    accompanied by the bishop of Upsala, Henry (an Englishman, it is said), and at
                    the head of a considerable army, invaded the country in 1157, when the people
                    were conquered and baptized. King Eric left Bishop Henry with his priests and
                    some soldiers behind to confirm the conquest and complete the conversion. After
                    a time he was killed, canonized, and as St Henry became the patron saint of
                    Finland. As Sweden had to attend to her own affairs, Finland was gradually
                    reverting to independence and paganism, when in 1209 another bishop and
                    missionary, Thomas (also an Englishman), arrived, and recommenced the work of St
                    Henry. Bishop Thomas nearly succeeded in detaching Finland from Sweden, and
                    forming it into a province subject only to the pope. The famous Birger Jarl
                    undertook a crusade in Finland in 1249, compelling the Tavastians, one of the
                    subdivisions of the Finlanders proper, to accept Christianity, and building a
                    castle at Tavastehus. It was Torkel Knutson who conquered and connected the
                    Karelian Finlanders in 1293, and built the strong castle of Wiborg. Almost
                    continuous wars between Russia and Sweden were the result of the conquest of
                    Finland by the latter. In 1323 it was settled that the river Rajajoki should be
                    the boundary between Russia and the Swedish province. After the final conquest
                    of the country by the Swedes, they spread among the Finlanders their
                    civilization, gave them laws, accorded them the same civil rights as belonged to
                    themselves, and introduced agriculture and other beneficial arts. The Reformed
                    religion was introduced into Finland by Gustavus Vasa about 1528, and King John
                    III. raised it to the dignity of a grand-duchy. The country suffered, sometimes
                    deplorably, in most of the wars waged by Sweden, especially with Russia and
                    Denmark. His predecessor having created an order of nobility,—counts, barons,
                    and nobles, Gustavus Adolphus in the beginning of the 17th century established
                    the diet of Finland, composed of the four orders of the nobility, clergy,
                    bourgeois, and peasants. Gustavus and his successor did much for Finland by
                    founding schools and gymnasia, building churches, encouraging learning, and
                    introducing printing. During the reign of Charles XI. (1692—1696) the country
                    suffered terribly from famine and pestilence; in the diocese of Âbo alone 60,000
                    persons died in less than nine months. Finland has been visited at different
                    periods since by these scourges; so late as 1848 whole villages were starved
                    during a dreadful famine. Peter the Great cast an envious eye on Finland and
                    tried to wrest it from Sweden; in 1710 he managed to obtain possession<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0228-0219"/> of the towns of Keksholm and Villmanstrand; and
                    by 1716 all the country was in his power. Meantime the sufferings of the people
                    had been great; thousands perished in the wars of Charles XII. By the peace of
                    Nystad in 1721 the province of Wiborg, the eastern division of Finland, was
                    finally ceded to Russia. But the country had been laid very low by war,
                    pestilence, and famine, though it recovered itself with wonderful rapidity. In
                    1741 the Swedes made an effort to recover the ceded province, but through
                    wretched management suffered disaster, and were compelled to capitulate in
                    August 1742, ceding by the peace of Âbo, next year, the towns of Villmanstrand
                    and Fredrikshamn. Nothing remarkable seems to have occurred till 1788, under
                    Gustavus III., who began to reign in 1771, and who gave the Finlanders those
                    fundamental laws by which they are still essentially governed. The country was
                    divided into six governments, a second superior court of justice was founded at
                    Wasa, many new towns were built, commerce flourished, and science and art were
                    encouraged. Latin disappeared as the academic language, and Swedish was adopted.
                    In 1788, however, war again broke out between Sweden and Russia, and was carried
                    on for two years without much glory or gain to either party, the main aim of
                    Gustavus being to recover the lost Finnish province. In 1808, under Gustavus
                    IV., peace was again broken between the two countries, and the war ended by the
                    cession in 1809 of the whole of Finland and the Aland Islands to Russia, which
                    has ever since maintained her supremacy. The Finlanders themselves fought
                    bravely against Russia, and it is said that bribery had not a little to do with
                    the result. The emperor Alexander I. convoked the diet at Borgo in 1809, when he
                    issued a manifesto undertaking to preserve the religion, laws, and liberties of
                    the country. This pledge has been taken by his successors, and probably Finland
                    is the freest and best governed part of the Russian empire. A senate was created
                    and a governor-general named. The province of Wiborg was reunited to Finland in
                    1811, and Åbo remained the capital of the country till 1821, when the civil and
                    military authorities were removed to Helsingfors, and the university in 1827.
                    The diet, which had not met for 56 years, was convoked by Alexander IT. at
                    Helsingfors in 1863, and has met every five years since. Since 1860 Finland has
                    been allowed the use of a coinage peculiar to itself. Under Alexander II.
                    Finland has been on the whole prosperous and progressive. The use of the Finnish
                    tongue is everywhere encouraged, though the upper classes mostly use Swedish,
                    and the study of the Russian language was made compulsory in all the state
                    schools in 1872.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ethnology and Language.—</hi> The term Finns has a wider
                    application than Finland, being, with its adjective Finnic or Finno-Ugric or
                    Ugro-Finnic, the collective name of the westernmost branch of the great
                    Uralo-Altaic family, dispersed throughout Finland, Lapland, the Baltic provinces
                    (Esthonia, Livonia, Courland), parts of Russia proper (south of Lake Onega),
                    both banks of middle Volga, Perm, Vologda, West Siberia (between the Ural
                    Mountains and the Yenissei), and Hungary. It consists of five groups :—(1) the
                    Finns proper; (2) the Lapps; (3) the Permian Finns; (4) Volga Finns; (5) Ugrian
                    Finns. (1) The first group comprises the Suomi or Suomelaisset, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Fen-men, who occupy nearly all Finland except a portion
                    on the Gulf of Bothnia, about Wasa, where Swedish is spoken; next, the
                    Karelians, who extend from Russian Lapland south to the Gulf of Finland and Lake
                    Ladoga, and east to the White Sea and the shores of Lake Onega; thirdly, the
                    Chudic, a Slav term often applied to the whole group, but now restricted to the
                    Veps or northern Chud and the Votic or southern Chud, dwelling in scattered
                    communities round the shores of Lake Onega; and lastly, the Baltic Finns,
                    including the Este or Esthonian, occupying the greater part of the southern
                    coast of the Gulf of Finland and the northern half of Livonia, and the Livonian
                    or Krevinian occupying a small corner in the north-west of Courland. (2) The
                    Lapps occupy the extreme north-west of Russia, and some parts of northern Sweden
                    and Norway. (3) The Permian Finns comprise the Siryenians, occupying an
                    extensive region between 60° N. hit. and the Arctic circle and 50’ E. long, and
                    the Ural Mountains, but mainly in the section of the government of Vologda; the
                    Permian proper, formerly diffused throughout Perm, Viatka, Oufa, &amp;c., now
                    surviving in isolated communities mainly about the upper Kama; and the Votyak,
                    occupying a relatively compact territory in Viatka as" far north as Glazov on
                    the river Tchepsa. (4) The Volga Finns include the Cheremissian on the left bank
                    of the Volga, from a little west of Kazan to near Nijni-Novgorod; and the
                    Mordvinian, divided into small communities on both banks of the Volga, about
                    Simbirsk, Samara, Stavropol, and Tambov. (5) The Ugrian Finns include the
                    Voguls, extending from the Ural Mountains cast to near the river Obi and south
                    to Tobolsk; the Ostyaks, from the Voguls east to the river Yenissei, between
                    Turuchansk and Yenisseisk, and from the Arctic circle to 59’ N. lat.; and the
                    Magyars of Hungary. These five groups form one linguistic family, to which
                    Samoyede is related. The richest and most highly cultivated languages of the
                    family are the Suomi and Magyar. The dialects are all distinctly agglutinative
                    forms of speech, with decided tendencies towards true inflexion, so much so that
                    in many grammatical endings the essential difference between agglutination and
                    inflexion becomes obscured. As in other Uralo-Altaic tongues, progressive
                    vowel-harmony forms a characteristic feature of the Finnic group. Rask
                    considered the Finnish language the most sonorous and harmonious of tongues. It
                    is maintained by some that the Finnic languages represent the oldest forms among
                    the Uralo-Altaic groups. There is strong evidence that the Finns, or a closely
                    allied race, must have at one time, probably prehistoric, been spread over a
                    considerable area of central if not of western Europe.</p>
                <p>Originally nomads (hunters and fishers), all the Finnic people except the Lapps
                    and Ostyaks have long yielded to the influence of civilization, and now
                    everywhere lead settled lives as herdsmen, agriculturists, traders, &amp;c.
                    Physically the Finns are a strong, hardy race, of low stature, with almost round
                    head, low forehead, flat features, prominent cheek bones, eyes mostly grey and
                    oblique (inclining inwards), short and flat nose, protruding mouth, thick lips,
                    neck very full and strong, so that the occiput seems flat and almost in a
                    straight line with the nape; beard weak and sparse, hair no doubt originally
                    black, but, owing to mixture with other races, now brown, red, and even fair;
                    complexion also somewhat brown. Tlιe Finns are morally upright, hospitable,
                    faithful, and submissive, with a keen sense of personal freedom and
                    independence, but also somewhat stolid, revengeful, and indolent. Many of these
                    physical and moral characteristics they have in common with the so-called
                    “Mongolian” race, to which they are no doubt ethnically, if not also
                    linguistically, related.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> Finland can boast of a varied literature more
                    or less indigenous, the great monument of which is, however, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalewala,</hi> a sort of epic poem, which, until the present
                    century, existed only in fragments in the memories and on the lips of the
                    peasantry. A collection of these scattered songs was published in 1822 by Dr
                    Zacharias Topelius, but it was not till 1835 that anything like a complete and
                    systematically arranged collection was given to the world by Dr Elias Lönnrot.
                    For years Dr <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0229-0220"/> Lönnrot wandered from place to place in the most
                    remote districts, living with the peasantry, and taking down from their lips all
                    that they knew of their popular songs. After unwearied diligence he was
                    successful in collecting 12,000 lines. These he arranged as methodically as he
                    could into thirty-two runes or cantos, which he published exactly as he heard
                    them sung or chanted. Continuing his researches, Dr Lönnrot published in 1849 a
                    new edition of 22,793 verses, in 50 runes. The importance of this indigenous
                    epic, as it may be fairly styled, was at once recognized in Europe, and
                    translations were made into Swedish, German, and French. A few specimens have
                    also been translated into English by the late Professor A. Porter, of Yale
                    College, and published at New York (1868). The best foreign editions are those
                    of Castren in Swedish (1844), Leouzon le Duc in French (1845 and 1868),
                    Schiefner in German (1852). The poem has besides given rise to a considerable
                    amount of critical literature, which is worthy of the attention of the
                    comparative mythologist The poem is written in eight-syllabled trochaic verse,
                    and an idea of its style may be obtained from Longfellow’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hiawatha,</hi> which is a pretty true imitation of the Finnish epic. Of the
                    merits and importance of the poem Professor MaxMüller, than whom there could be
                    no better judge, speaks thus :—-“From the mouths of the aged an epic poem has
                    been collected, equalling the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in length and
                    completeness; nay—if we can forget for a moment all that <hi rend="italic"
                    >we</hi> in our youth learned to call beautiful—not less beautiful. A Finn is
                    not a Greek, and a Wainamoinen was not a Homer. But if the poet may take his
                    colours from that nature by which he is surrounded, if he may depict the men
                    with whom he lives, <hi rend="italic">Kalewala</hi> possesses merits not
                    dissimilar from those of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> aud will claim its
                    place as the fifth national epic of the world, side by side with the Ionian
                    songs, with the <hi rend="italic">Mahabhárata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shahnámeh,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungef</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kalewala</hi> is concerned entirely with the mythology or folk-lore of the
                    people. In the story there is a certain unity of plot, though the various parts
                    are not perfectly homogeneous, and are evidently the product of different minds
                    at different times, the various songs having evidently received additions in
                    course of time. Indeed, it is probable that the origin of the songs must be
                    sought for in a time when the various branches of the Finns were not so
                    scattered as they are now, certainly before their conversion to Christianity,
                    though in the conclusion there seem to be one or two allusions to Christian
                    subjects. The poem takes its name from the three heroes of Kaleva, the land of
                    plenty and happiness, Wåinämôinen, Ilmarinen, and Lemmin-Kâinen; it is the
                    struggles of these with Louhi, Hüse, Yorukahainen, and others from Pohjola, a
                    land of the cold north, and from Luonela, the land of death, that are sung. The
                    poem begins with the creation of the world, and after many varied events, ends
                    in the triumph of Wâinämôinen and his followers. At the time that Dr Lönnrot
                    collected the Kalewala songs he also collected a considerable quantity of lyric
                    poetry, which he published under the name of <hi rend="italic">Kantele-tar,</hi>
                    from the name of the national instrument to which they are sung— <hi
                    rend="italic">Kantele,</hi> a species of harp with five strings. Of recent poets
                    the most popular seems to be Paavo Korrhoinen, a peasant whose productions are
                    characterized by sharp and biting sarcasm. His songs were published at
                    Helsingfors in 1848. Other modern poets are Marteska, Kettunen, Ilahainen,
                    Oksaselta. The Finns are strong in proverbs, Lönnrot having published a
                    collection of upwards of 7000, with about 2000 charades, while considerable
                    collections of legends and tales have been published.</p>
                <p>The first book printed in Finnish was in the middle of the 16th century, and was
                    probably the <hi rend="italic">Abecedarium</hi> (1543) of Miphael Agricola,
                    bishop of Åbo. A translation of the New Testament by the same bishop appeared in
                    1543, at</p>
                <p>Stockholm. The whole Bible was not translated into Finnish till 1642. Even during
                    last, but especially during the present century, there has been considerable
                    literary activity in Finland, so that now books in almost every branch of
                    research are found in the language, mainly translations or adaptations. We meet
                    with, during the present century, a considerable number of names of poets and
                    dramatists, no doubt very minor, as also painters, sculptors, and musical
                    composers. At the Paris International Exhibition of 1878 several native Finnish
                    painters and sculptors exhibited works which would do credit to any country; and
                    both in the fine and applied arts Finland occupied a position thoroughly
                    creditable. An important contribution to a history of Finnish literature is
                    Krohn’s <hi rend="italic">Suomenkielinen runollisuns ruotsinvallan aikana</hi>
                    (1862). Finland is wonderfully rich in periodicals of all kinds, the
                    publications of the Finnish Societies of Literature and of Sciences and other
                    learned bodies being specially valuable. The Finnish Literary Society has within
                    the last few years published a new edition of the works of the father of Finnish
                    history, Henry Gabriel Porthan (died 1804). A valuable handbook of Finnish
                    history was published at Helsingfors in 1869- 73, by Yrjö Koskinen, aud has been
                    translated into both Swedish and German. The author, however, is understood to
                    be really a Swede, whose name is Georg Foreman, the above form being a Finnish
                    translation. Other works on Finnish history have also appeared within the last
                    four or five years. Some important works in Finnish geography have also appeared
                    during the same period. In language we have Lönnrot’s great Finnish-Swedish
                    dictionary, now being published by the Finnish Literary Society. In this
                    connexion the student may be glad to know of Dr Donner’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comparative Dictionary of the Finno-Ugric Languages</hi> (Helsingfors and
                    Leipsic), in German. In other departments works of importance have not been
                    infrequent during the present decade; most of them apparently are in Swedish. A
                    valuable sketch of recent Finnish literature will be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Russische</hi><hi rend="italic">Revue</hi> (iv. Jahrgang, 4 and 6
                    Hefte). <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> s. κ.)</p>
