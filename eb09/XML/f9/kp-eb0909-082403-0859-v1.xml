                    distance into the forest and leave them to be devoured by beasts of prey; while
                    others still, like the Kamtchadales, refine upon this practice, and keep special
                    dogs for the purpose of consuming the dead, reconciling themselves to this
                    custom by the doctrine that they who are eaten by dogs here will drive fine dogs
                    in the other world. Probably the straits of. war explain the practice of the
                    Latookas of Zanzibar, who bury their dead, but make it a rule to leave those
                    slain in battle to be devoured by wild beasts where they lie. The custom of
                    exposure has survived among cultured nations in the case of the Parsees, who
                    bring their dead to certain round towers, called towers of silence^ to be eaten
                    by vultures which make these towers their dwelling-places. There is evidence
                    that a more startling mode of disposal still is sometimes practised. Certain
                    tribes of the ancient Scythians are said to have eaten their dead and Burton
                    says that at Dahomey the body of a person killed by lightning is not buried like
                    others, but is hacked in pieces and eaten by the priests. Skertchley says they
                    do not actually eat it, but only make believe to do so; but the make-believe is
                    probably a survival of what was once the reality.</p>
                <p>Next to exposure, burial is the simplest method of disposal, and it is the most
                    widespread, being common alike to the lowest and the highest forms of culture.
                    Burial likewise has its varying customs, from laying the body in natural holes
                    or caves to erecting over it majestic temples. A common practice is simply to
                    lay the body out on the ground and pile stones, or, as among the Moors, prickly
                    thorns, over it, to keep off beasts. The use of the coffin is no sure test of
                    culture, for while some of the rudest peoples lay the dead in a hollowed trunk
                    or a boat, the Mahometan nations use nothing of the kind. Nor is the possession
                    of fixed burying places a better index to the stage of development, for while
                    many primitive tribes have stated burial places, the more advanced Mexicans had
                    none. Some American tribes bury their children in a separate graveyard from
                    adults, and others bury them by the wayside that their souls may enter into
                    persons passing by.</p>
                <p>Refinements upon ordinary burial are the practices of first burning the dead, or
                    embalming them, or drying them on trees or artificial scaffolds, before burying
                    them. That plain burial is the earlier custom, and that these other more
                    elaborate and costly fashions are later eu∙ graftments upon it, seems to be
                    proved by the fact that many nations adopt more than one custom, and that, while
                    they only bury their women, they first bum or dry their men. The ancient
                    Colchians suspended the corpses of men in trees, but their women they buried.
                    The Gonds and Bhils of India, who have adopted under Hindu influences the
                    practice of burning, still bury their women, while the Todas burn all now,
                    except children the victims of infanticide, whom they bury. The Muddikers, who
                    bury, burn lepers, probably from sanitary reasons; and certain tribes who burn
                    bury the lightning-struck on the spot where they fall. The Kalmucks follow all
                    modes: their usual custom is exposure; but they also burn, or bury, or throw the
                    corpse into the water, or under a heap of stones, or build a hut over it,
                    according to what the priest declares to be most suitable to the condition of
                    the deceased.</p>
                <p>Another point of interest in burying is the position of the body in the grave.
                    Some bury their dead lying, others sitting, and there is a remarkable consensus
                    of custom for the practice of laying the body east and west, sometimes with the
                    head to the east and sometimes to the west. This custom is evidently due
                    originally to solar symbolism, and the head is turned to the east or to the
                    west, according as the dead are thought of in connexion with the sunrise, the
                    reputed home of deity, or with the sunset, the reputed region of the dead. This
                    practice, however, though nearly universal, is not absolutely so, for some
                    tribes lay their dead north and south; and others, like the Bongos, bury men
                    with the face to the north and women with the face to the south; while if one of
                    the Wanyamwesi in Africa happens to die abroad, he is buried facing his native
                    village.</p>
                <p>The necessary act of disposing of the corpse has always been accompanied by
                    ceremonies expressive (1) of affection for the deceased or grief for his loss;
                    (2) of present interest in and solicitude for his welfare; (3) of a certain
                    mysterious fear of him in his present state; and (4) of affectionate remembrance
                    of him. These ceremonies vary much under different changes of culture, yet have
                    all the same central elements.</p>
                <p>Among primitive nations the most common ceremonial expressions of grief are
                    simple exaggerations of the natural expressions of the emotions,—a carelessness
                    as to usual comforts, and a positive distracting agony. Fasting, neglecting the
                    hair, wearing rags or sackcloth, sitting in ashes, daubing <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n860/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0860-0825"/> oneself with mud or pigment, are almost
                    universal examples of the one; while wringing the hands, tearing the hair,
                    shaving the head, beating the breast, are common examples of the other. The New
                    Zealanders daub themselves with red pigment and gash their bodies with broken
                    shells. The Hawaiaus gash themselves, knock out front teeth, cut off a finger
                    joint or an ear, and on the death of a king the nation feigns universal madness,
                    and murders, robs, and commits all manner of crimes, as a ceremonial expression
                    of a sorrow which has driven them frantic. Singing laments, playing plaintive
                    music, dancing funeral dances, are not unusual expressions of grief, though it
                    is probable that the music continuously kept up at the wakes of the Celts and
                    other nations was meant to ward off evil spirits.</p>
                <p>The most interesting funeral rites, however, are those which express men’s ideas
                    of the present state, and their solicitude for the present welfare, of the
                    deceased. There is no nation which does not believe that the soul continues to
                    exist after its separation from the body, in another world like the present, but
                    invisible. Many of the funeral rites of the nations are determined by the belief
                    that death is a journey of the soul from this world to that other, and are meant
                    to provide necessary entertainment for the dead on the way, or even after
                    arrival. Meat, drink, weapons, light, musical instruments, horses, money,
                    servants, wives, are among the most usual things buried with the body. The Gonds
                    even leave toothpicks with it. The Aztecs laid a waterbottle beside the dead to
                    be used on the way to Mictlan, the land of the dead. The North American Indian
                    buries with the dead a kettle and provisions, bow and arrows, a pair of
                    moccasins, with a spare piece of deerskin to patch them if they wear out, and
                    sinews of deer to sew the patches on with. The Laplanders lay beside the corpse
                    flint, steel, and tinder to supply light for the dark journey. The Chippewas
                    light fires on the grave for four nights after the funeral, for guidance on the
                    journey, which they think lasts four days. The Karens give the deceased at the
                    grave explicit instructions as to the relations of things in space being
                    reversed in the next world. Taking a stick, they throw it to the north and say
                    that is the south, and taking another, they throw it to the south and say that
                    is the north. The Mexicans gave several slips of paper to the deceased, to serve
                    as passports, taking him in succession past a precipice, a serpent, and a
                    crocodile. The obolus which the Greeks put in the dead man’s mouth to pay
                    Charon, and the coin the Irish place in his hand, are well known. It is a fine
                    touch of the Greenlanders to bury with a child a dog to guide him, for they say
                    a dog will find his way anywhere. The North American Indian buries his
                    “medicine” with him to take him to the happy huntinggrounds. The Norse warrior
                    had his horse and armour laid in the grave with him that he might ride to
                    Valhalla in full panoply.</p>
                <p>Graver sacrifices, of animals, wives, and slaves, for the permanent use of the
                    deceased in the next world, have pre vailed at one period or another among most
                    nations of Asia, Africa, and America. They are conspicuously absent from the
                    Semitic peoples, though even among them a trace is found in the Arab custom of
                    leaving the dead man’s camel to die on his grave. Of human funeral sacrifices,
                    Hindu suttee is the best known instance. The Fijians strangle wives, slaves, and
                    friends to attend the deceased. The Dyaks of Borneo make head-hunting a main
                    business of this life, under the impression that every person whose head they
                    secure will serve them in the next. A kind of suttee by symbol still survives in
                    certain nations when the sacrifice itself is abolished. The Chinese make paper
                    images of sedan bearers and the like, and fly them in the wind over the grave,
                    thus despatching them after the dead man to serve him; and the Japanese, with
                    whom at one time it was the custom for 20 or 30 slaves to kill themselves by <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,t</hi> hari-kari” with the dead, substitute images in
                    modern times; and the Quakeolths of North America rested the widow’s head on the
                    burning corpse, and then dragged her out half dead. Treasure buried with the
                    dead was meant also for their use. In Madagascar as much as 11,000 dollars were
                    laid in the tomb of a prince. The principle that lies at the root of those
                    sacrifices is the prevalent belief in object souls as well as animal souls. The
                    soul of the warrior rode upon the soul of his horse, and wielded the soul of bis
                    weapon.</p>
                <p>Many of the primitive funeral rites seem dictated by a certain awe or fear of the
                    ghost, and a wish to get it well away. Lane mentions a practice among modern
                    Egyptians of turning the corpse round and round so as to make it giddy, that it
                    might not know where it was going. For the same end, apparently, the Santals
                    carry the body three times round the pile. The Karens walk round the bier in
                    opposite directions three.times, each time exchanging candles they have in their
                    hands, and then bid the ghost depart in peace, and to make more sure of his
                    departure, destroy the village where the death occurred. From a similar desire
                    to confuse the ghost, the Greenlanders take the body out by a window instead of
                    the door, and the Siamese break out a new opening in the wall to take it
                    through, and then carry it three times round the garden. The Siberians fling a
                    red-hot stone after the corpse, and the Brandenburg peasants pour out a pail of
                    water after it, to prevent it returning. The Pomeranians leave some straw behind
                    in the graveyard that the soul may rest contented there; while the Bongos on
                    leaving the burial place shoot arrows at a votive stake they erect on the grave,
                    and leave the arrows sticking in the wood. The Australians take off the nails of
                    the corpse and tie its hands, lest it scrape its way out again.</p>
                <p>The affectionate commemoration of the deceased takes many forms, from simply
                    mourning for a definite period up to periodical funeral feasts, the erection of
                    memorial images, the preservation of the relics as instruments of superhuman
                    power, and the worship of the Manes. The natives of Dahomey keep up intercourse
                    with the departed by killing a slave from time to time, whose soul is supposed
                    to go to the dead with the news of the living. The Guinea negroes used to keep
                    the bones of their friends in chests and go occasionally and hold conversation
                    with them. The Mandan women in North America take food year by year to their
                    dead kinsfolk, whose skulls have been preserved in circles of 100 on the
                    prairie. Funeral feasts prevail extensively in America, Africa, and Asia, and
                    arise partly, like our own anniversary dinners, from a simple desire to do
                    honour to the dead, but partly also from the belief that the dead participate in
                    the good cheer. They are not merely commemorative but communion meals. Funeral
                    games were probably, like the elaborate dressing of the dead in Brazil and other
                    places in the robes of their patron saints or deities, merely designed to show
                    respect.</p>
                <p>To come now to the more cultured peoples, the Greeks either buried or burnt their
                    dead. The body was anointed, crowned with flowers, dressed handsomely and
                    usually in white, laid out in a bed of state with an obolus in its mouth for
                    Charon and a honeycake for Cerberus. These offices were performed by the female
                    relations. The kinsfolk gathered round the bed, and lamented and tore their
                    clothes and hair. On the third day after death the body was carried out by the
                    friends in a coffin, usually of earthen ware, before sunrise,—men walking before
                    it, women, attended by the hired mourners, behind,—and was buried outside the
                    town. A monument with inscription was raised over the grave. All who took part
                    in the funeral needed to be purified before they could again enter the temples
                    of the gods. Funeral sacrifices were offered on the third, ninth, and thirtieth
                    days after. On the last of these days stated <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0861-0826"/> mourning ended, and the relatives might
                    appear in public again. It was customary afterwards to visit the tomb and leave
                    garlands, and burn meals as offerings to the dead.</p>
                <p>The Roman ceremonies were analogous. Burial was the earlier custom. Burning was
                    not general till the republic, but was universal under the empire; the
                    preparation of the body for burial or cremation was performed by a hired body
                    called <hi rend="italic">pollinctores.</hi> The corpse was dressed in its
                    best,—if a magistrate, in official robes; and if he had while alive been
                    crowned, then wearing the crown. In early times the burial took place at night,
                    but in later times this was the practice only of the poor who could not afford a
                    funeral display. On the eighth day the body was carried to the grave in a stone
                    coffin on a wooden, or in some cases a golden, bier, amid music and lamentation,
                    and sometimes mimic representations of the life and merits of the deceased by
                    professional players. The sons of the deceased went veiled, and the women beat
                    their breasts. When the body was burned, oil, perfumes, ornaments, and
                    everything supposed to be agreeable to the deceased were thrown into the fire.
                    On returning from the funeral friends were purified by sprinkling themselves
                    with water or stepping over a fire. Mourning lasted nine days, and on the ninth
                    a funeral sacrificial feast was celebrated, sometimes with games and
                    gladiatorial combats.</p>
                <p>The funeral rites of ancient Egypt were too elaborate to be described here. Their
                    chief peculiarities were the embalming of the body and the judgment of the dead
                    before burial. It is an error to suppose the embalming took place in order to
                    preserve the body for a future state, for there is no evidence that the
                    Egyptians believed in the resurrection of the body, and embalming could not have
                    reference to that belief if they did, for the whole body was not preserved, but
                    some of the most important internal parts were taken out first; besides, they
                    embalmed not only men, but the lower animals also. The mummy was often kept in
                    the house a whole year before being buried, and during that interval feasts were
                    held in honour of the dead, and the tomb was being prepared. Then the case was
                    taken out, set on a hearse, taken by a sledge to the sacred lake of the nome,
                    across which it was carried in a boat by a boatman called Charon, and then
                    deposited in the tomb on the other side. Before being allowed to cross, however,
                    the judgment of the dead took place before forty-two judges summoned for the
                    purpose; any one was allowed to bring forward any accusation against the
                    deceased, and if he had led an evil life burial was refused. If there was no
                    accusation, then the relatives ceased lamenting and pronounced encomiums,
                    enlarging not on his descent, as among the Greeks, but on his personal merits.
                    The denial of burial was not perpetual, however, its duration being measured by
                    the extent of the crimes of the deceased. A gold or silver plate was put into
                    the mouth of the mummy, not as a fee to the ferryman, but as a passport or
                    certificate of good character.</p>
                <p>The Russians have a similar custom of putting a passport (in their case a paper
                    one) into the hand of the deceased as a testimonial of his virtue, to be shown
                    to Peter at the gate of heaven. More curious still are the custom of the Badages
                    of the Nilgherry Hills, who let loose a scape calf at the grave to take away the
                    dead man’s sins, and the practice mentioned by Brand as prevailing in Wales at
                    one time, of employing sin-eaters, men who receive a loaf over the corpse, and
                    eating it take upon them all the sins of the deceased.</p>
                <p>Γhe Mahometans bury their dead usually on the day of death. The prophet forbade
                    wailing, but this prohibition is generally neglected. Even hired wailing women
                    are employed by some, who wail during all the time the corpse is in the house
                    and on the way to the grave; parts of the Koran are recited by religious
                    officials in the house. In the funeral procession the male relatives go in front
                    of the bier, and are preceded by four or six poor old men, mostly blind, who
                    chant the profession of faith, and followed by four or six schoolboys who chant
                    passages from a poem descriptive of the last judgment; while the female
                    relatives come behind the bier, accompanied by the w ailing women with their
                    tambourines, and cry and shriek, and celebrate the praises of the deceased. If
                    the dead man was rich, then several camels follow bearing bread and water to
                    give the poor at the tomb, and last of all comes a buffalo to be slaughtered
                    there for the same purpose. The bier is then brought to the mosque, laid in the
                    usual place of prayer, with the right side towards Mecca; and the imam standing
                    at its left side, with the people behind him, recites the funeral service, after
                    which he calls upon those present to give their testimony respecting the dead,
                    and they reply, “He was of the virtuous.” The body is then laid in the tomb, and
                    is there instructed in the answers to be given to questions, such as Who is God,
                    and who is his apostle <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> which the angels are expected to
                    put.</p>
                <p>Christian rites are marked by high reverence for the body, due to the belief in
                    its future resurrection. Under Christian influence cremation gradually
                    disappeared from Europe, northern and southern alike, and burial became
                    universal, as being more expressive of the truth' held so precious. Christians
                    bury in separate places of their own, which, except among Presbyterians and
                    other sections of Protestants, have been usually consecrated for the purpose by
                    a special ceremony. Interment in churches of favourite martyrs and apostles was
                    at one time much sought after, and had to be repeatedly forbidden by
                    ecclesiastical councils. Bishops and distinguished churchmen or laymen were
                    sometimes allowed to be buried in the church, only not near the altar. Among the
                    early Christians the washing and anointing ot the body for the burial were not
                    done by hired persons, but were counted a work of love, done by friend for
                    friend, and by the charitable for the poor and the stranger. The body was
                    swathed in white, decked sometimes with the insignia of office or personal
                    ornaments, placed in a coffin and laid out in the church or in the chamber of
                    death for friends to come and take a last look at it. Three or four days usually
                    elapsed between the death and burial, and vigils were held with prayers and
                    hymnsinging. Hired mourners were forbidden. The funeral took place by day, for,
                    Christian death being a victory, it was meant to give the procession the aspect
                    of a triumph; for which reason those who took part in it carried branches, not
                    of cypress, as among the Romans, but of palm and olive. Evergreen leaves were
                    strewn on the coffin, but the practice of crowning the head with wreaths was
                    forbidden, as savouring of idolatry. Lamps and torches, however, were sometimes
                    carried. The body was borne on a bier, and covered with a pall costly in
                    proportion to the rank of the deceased. It was laid in the grave with face
                    upward and feet to the east, in token of the resurrection at the coming again of
                    the Sun of Righteousness. A service took place at the grave, and, as a rule,
                    does so still among most Christians. In Scotland this was abolished at the
                    Reformation, as being liable to be mingled with superstitious ideas, and a
                    service and exhortation in the church were recommended instead, but this is
                    seldom practised. Christian burial in consecrated ground, and with a religious
                    service, was denied by canon law to all who were not Christians, to
                    excommunicated persons, suicides, criminals, usurers, schismatics, heretics,
                    and, among Roman Catholics, even unbaptized children of Christian parents. The
                    eucharist was celebrated at the grave as early as the 4th century; and for some
                    centuries, in spite of repeated prohibition by ecclesiastical councils, the
                    practice prevailed in West Africa, Gaul, and the East, of placing the
                    consecrated bread itself, steeped in wine, in the lips of the dead. Another
                    practice, which has indeed the sanction of Basil, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n862/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0862-0827"/> was not uncommon, that of burying tho
                    eucharistie bread with the dead. Special prayers were offered for the soul of
                    the departed, and the priests, and afterwards other friends, gave the corpse tho
                    last kiss of peace. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cremation.</hi></p>
