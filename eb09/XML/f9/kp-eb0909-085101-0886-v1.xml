                <p><label type="entry">FÜRSTENBERG</label>, the name of two noble houses of
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>I. The more important is in possession of a mediatized principality in the
                    district of the Black Forest and the Upper Danube, which comprises the countship
                    of Heilegen-berg, about 7 miles to the N. of the lake of Constance, the
                    landgravates of Stühlingen and Baar, and the lordships of Jungnau,
                    Trochtelfingen, Hausen, and Möskirch or Mess-kirch. The territory is
                    discontinuous; and as it lies partly in Baden, partly in Würtemberg, and partly
                    in the Prussian province of Sigmaringen, the head of the family is an hereditary
                    member of the first chamber of Baden and of the chamber of peers in Würtemberg
                    and in Prussia. The relations of the principality with Baden are defined by the
                    treaty of May 1825, and its relations with Würtemberg by the royal declaration
                    of 1839. The <hi rend="italic">Stammort</hi> or ancestral seat of the family is
                    Fürstenberg in the Black Forest, about 13 miles N. of Schaffhausen, but the
                    principal residence of the present representatives of the main line is at
                    Donaueschingen. The Fürstenbergs are descended from the counts of Urach, in the
                    valley of the Ems, to the east of Tübingen,—Henry I., the youngest son of Egon
                    VI. of Urach, ranking as the founder of the family. He was bom about 1215,
                    signalized himself as a supporter of the house of Hapsburg (which in the person
                    of Rudolf, a relative of his own, ascended the throne in 1273), and died in
                    1284. On the death of Frederick III. in 1559, the family broke up into two
                    lines, the Heiligenberg and the Kinzigerthal. To the former, which became
                    extinct in 1716, belonged the well-known William Egon of Fürstenberg, who, in
                    spite of his elevation to the rank of elector by the emperor Leopold, played
                    into the hands of the French, had to leave Germany, and as a reward for his
                    services was made archbishop of Strasburg in 1682. The latter furnished a large
                    number of military and diplomatic servants to the German states. The various
                    possessions of the family were united in 1744 under Joseph William Ernest, who
                    was born in 1699 and died in 1762; and to him his descendants were indebted for
                    the right that they all possess of taking the title of prince. On the failure of
                    the male issue of his elder son in 1804, the inheritance passed to the
                    representative of a younger Bohemian branch, Charles Egon, a prince memorable
                    for the liberal spirit by which he was actuated, and for the number of his
                    benevolent and scientific foundations, such as the infirmary at Donaueschingen
                    and the blind asylum at Neidingen. The family is at present (1879) represented
                    by his son Charles Egon. There are two subordinate branches, the Pürglitz with
                    its chief residence at Lana in Bohemia, and the Königshof with its chief
                    residence at Königshof in Bohemia.</p>
                <p>II. The second Fürstenberg family has its possessions in Westphalia and the
                    country of the Rhine, and takes its name from the castle of Fürstenberg on the
                    Ruhr, which is said to have been built by count Dietrich or Theodoric of
                    Oldenburg, in the 11th century. The two most remarkable men whom it has produced
                    are Francis Frederick William and Francis Egon. The former (1729-1811) became
                    ultimately minister of the prince-bishop of Münster, and effected a great number
                    of important reforms in the administration of the country; the latter
                    (1797-1859) was an enthusiastic patron of art, zealously advocating the
                    completion of the Cologne cathedral, and erecting the beautiful church of
                    Apollinaris, near Remagen on the Rhine.</p>
