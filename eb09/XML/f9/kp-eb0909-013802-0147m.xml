                    and distinguished himself by his facility in the acquisition of knowledge. Not
                    only literature, but the physical sciences, as then taught, had a charm for him;
                    and he is said to have made considerable progress in medicine under the tuition
                    of his father. He was of a tranquil temperament, sensitive to music and poetry,
                    and debarred by weak health from joining in the more active pleasures of his
                    fellow students. "When he had attained the age of eighteen or nineteen years,
                    Cosimo received him into his household, and determined to make use of his rare
                    disposition for scholarship in the development of a long cherished project.
                    During the session of the council for the union of the Greek and Latin churches
                    at Florence in 1439, Cosimo had made acquaintance with Gemistos Plethon, the
                    Neo-Platonic sage of Mistra, whose discourses upon Plato and the Alexandrian
                    mystics so fascinated the learned society of Florence that they named him the
                    second Plato. It had been the dream of this man’s whole life to supersede both
                    forms of Christianity by a semi-pagan theosophy deduced from the writings of the
                    later Pythagoreans and Platonists. When, therefore, he perceived the impression
                    he had made upon the first citizen of Florence, Gemistos suggested that the
                    capital of modem culture would be a fit place for the resuscitation of the once
                    so famous Academy of Athens. Cosimo took this hint. The second half of the 15th
                    century was destined to be the age of Academies in Italy, and the regnant
                    passion for antiquity satisfied itself with any imitation, however grotesque, of
                    Greek or Roman institutions. In order to found his new Academy upon a firm basis
                    Cosimo resolved, not only to assemble men of letters for the purpose of Platonic
                    disputation at certain regular intervals, but also to appoint a hierophant and
                    official expositor of Platonic doctrine. He hoped by these means to give a
                    certain stability to his projected institution, and to avoid the superficiality
                    of mere enthusiasm. The plan was good; and with the rare instinct for character
                    which distinguished him, he made choice of the right man for his purpose in the
                    young Marsilio.</p>
                <p>Before he had begun to learn Greek, Marsilio entered upon the task of studying
                    and elucidating Plato. It is known that at this early period of his life, while
                    he was yet a novice, he wrote voluminous treatises on the great philosopher,
                    which he afterwards, however, gave to the flames. In the year 1459 John
                    Argyropoulos was lecturing on the Greek language and literature at Florence, and
                    Marsilio became his pupil. He was then about twenty-three years of age. Seven
                    years later he felt himself a sufficiently ripe Greek scholar to begin the
                    translation of Plato, by which his name is famous in the history of scholarship,
                    and which is still the best translation of that author Italy can boast. The MSS.
                    on which he worked were supplied by his patron Cosimo de’ Medici and by Amerigo
                    Bench While the translation was still in progress Ficino from time to time
                    submitted its pages to the scholars, Angelo Poliziano, Cristoforo Landino,
                    Demetrios Chal-chondylas, and others; and since these men were all members of
                    the Platonic Academy, there can be no doubt that the discussions raised upon the
                    text and Latin version greatly served to promote the purpose of Cosimo’s
                    foundation. At last the book appeared in 1482, the expenses of the press being
                    defrayed by the noble Florentine, Filippo Valori. About the same time Marsilio
                    completed and published his treatise on the Platonic doctrine of immortality <hi

                    rend="italic">Immortalitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Animce),</hi> the work by
                    which his claims to take rank as a philosopher must be estimated. This was
                    shortly followed by the translation of Plotinus into Latin, and by a voluminous
                    commentary, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0148-0139"/> former finished in 1486, the latter in 1491, and
                    both published at the cost of Lorenzo de’ Medici just one month after his death.
                    As a supplement to these labours in the field of Platonic and Alexandrian
                    philosophy, Marsilio next devoted his energies to the translation of Dionysius
                    the Areopagite, whose work on the celestial hierarchy, though recognized as
                    spurious by the Neapolitan humanist, Lorenzo Valla, had supreme attraction for
                    the mystic and uncritical intellect of Ficino.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to value the services of Marsilio Ficino at their proper worth. As
                    a philosopher, he can advance no claim to originality, his laborious treatise on
                    Platonic theology being little better than a mass of ill-digested erudition. As
                    a scholar, he failed to recognize the distinctions between different periods of
                    antiquity and various schools of thought. As an exponent of Plato he suffered
                    from the fatal error of confounding Plato with the later Platonists. It is true
                    that in this respect he did not differ widely from the mass of his
                    contemporaries. Lorenzo Valla and Angelo Poliziano, almost alone among the
                    scholars of that age, showed a true critical perception. For the rest, it was
                    enough that an author should be ancient to secure their admiration. The whole of
                    antiquity seemed precious in the eyes of its discoverers ,∙ and even a thinker
                    so acute as Pico di Mirandola dreamed of the possibility of extracting the
                    essence of philosophical truth by indiscriminate collation of the most divergent
                    doctrines. Ficino was, moreover, a firm believer in planetary influences. He
                    could not separate his philosophical from his astrological studies, and caught
                    eagerly at any fragment of antiquity which seemed to support his cherished
                    delusions. It may here be incidentally mentioned that this superstition brought
                    him into trouble with the Roman church. In 1489 he was accused of magic before
                    Pope Innocent VTII., and had to secure the good offices of Francesco Soderini,
                    Ermolao Barbaro, and the archbishop Rinaldo Orsini, in order to purge himself of
                    a most perilous imputation. What Ficino achieved of really solid, was his
                    translation. The value of that work cannot be denied; the impulse which it gave
                    to Platonic studies in Italy, and through them to the formation of the new
                    philosophy in Europe, is indisputable. Ficino differed from the majority of his
                    contemporaries in this that, while he felt the influence of antiquity no less
                    strongly than they did, he never lost his faith in Christianity, or contaminated
                    his morals by contact with paganism. For him, as for Petrarch, St Augustin was
                    the model of a Christian student. The cardinal point of his doctrine was the
                    identity of religion and philosophy. He held that philosophy consists in the
                    study of truth and wisdom, and that God alone is truth and wisdom,—so that
                    philosophy is but religion, and true religion is genuine philosophy. Religion,
                    indeed, is common to all men, but its pure form is that revealed through Christ;
                    and the teaching of Christ is sufficient to a man in all circumstances of life.
                    Yet it cannot be expected that every man should accept the faith without
                    reasoning; and here Ficino found a place for Platonism. He maintained that the
                    Platonic doctrine was providentially made to harmonize with Christianity, in
                    order that by its means speculative intellects might be led to Christ. The
                    transition from this point of view to an almost superstitious adoration of Plato
                    was natural; and Ficino, we know, joined in the hymns and celebrations with
                    which the Florentine Academy honoured their great master on the day of his birth
                    and death. Those famous festivals in which Lorenzo de’ Medici delighted had
                    indeed a pagan tone appropriate to the sentiment of the Renaissance; nor were
                    all the worshippers of the Athenian sage so true to Christianity as his devoted
                    student.</p>
                <p>Of Ficino’s personal life there is but little to be said. In order that he might
                    have leisure for uninterrupted study, Cosimo de’ Medici gave him a house near S.
                    Maria Nuova in Florence, and a little farm at Montevecchio, not far from the
                    villa of Careggi. Ficino, like nearly all the scholars of that age in Italy,
                    delighted in country life. At Montevecchio he lived contentedly among his books,
                    in the neighbourhood of his two friends, Pico at Querceto, aud Poliziano at
                    Fiesole, cheering his solitude by playing on the lute, and corresponding with
                    the most illustrious men of Italy. His letters, extending over the years
                    1474-1494, have been published, both separately and in his collected works. From
                    these it may be gathered that nearly every living scholar of note was included
                    in the list of his friends, and that the subjects which interested him were by
                    no means confined to his Platonic studies. As instances of his close intimacy
                    with illustrious Florentine families, it may be mentioned that he held the young
                    Francesco Guicciardini at the font, and that he helped to cast the horoscope of
                    the Casa Strozzi in the Via Tornabuoni.</p>
                <p>At the age of forty Ficino took orders, and was honoured with a canonry of S.
                    Lorenzo. He was henceforth assiduous in the performance of his duties, preaching
                    in his cure of Novoli, and also in the cathedral and the church of the Angeli at
                    Florence. He used to say that no man was better than a good priest, and none
                    worse than a bad one. His life corresponded in all points to his principles. It
                    was the life of a sincere Christian and a real sage,—of one who found the best
                    fruits of philosophy in the practice of the Christian virtues. A more amiable
                    and a more harmless man never lived; and this was much in that age of discordant
                    passions and lawless licence. In spite of his weak health, he was indefatigably
                    industrious. His tastes were of the simplest; and while scholars like Filelfo
                    were intent on extracting money from their patrons by flattery and threats, he
                    remained so poor that he owed the publication of all his many works to private
                    munificence. For his old patrons of the house of Medici Ficino always cherished
                    sentiments of the liveliest gratitude. Cosimo he called his second father,
                    saying that Ficino. had given him life, but Cosimo new birth,—the one had
                    devoted him to Galen, the other to the divine Plato,—the one was physician of
                    the body, the other of the soul. With Lorenzo he lived on terms of familiar,
                    affectionate, almost parental intimacy. He had seen the young prince grow up in
                    the palace of the Via Larga, and had helped in the development of his rare
                    intellect. In later years he did not shrink from uttering a word of warning and
                    advice, when he thought that the master of the Florentine republic was too much
                    inclined to yield to pleasure. A characteristic proof of his attachment to the
                    house of Medici was furnished by a yearly custom which he practised at his farm
                    at Montevecchio. He used to invite the contadini who had served Cosimo to a
                    banquet on the day of Saints Cosimo and Damiano (the patron saints of the
                    Medici), and entertained them with music and singing. This affection was amply
                    returned. Cosimo employed almost the last hours of his life in listening to
                    Ficino’s reading of a treatise on the highest good; while Lorenzo, in a poem on
                    true happiness, described him as the mirror of the world, the nursling of sacred
                    muses, the har-monizer of wisdom and beauty in complete accord. Ficino died at
                    Florence in 1499.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already noticed, Ficino composed a treatise on the Christian
                    religion, which was first given to the world in 1476, a translation into Italian
                    of Dante’s <hi rend="italic">De Monarchia,</hi> a life of Plato, and numerous
                    essays on ethical and semi-philosophical subjects. Vigour of reasoning and
                    originality of view were not his characteristics as a writer; nor will the
                    student who has raked these dust heaps of miscellaneous learning and
                    old-fashioned mysticism discover more than a few sentences of genuine enthusiasm
                    and simple-hearted aspiration to repay his <pb break="no"

                    letters, prolegomena, and prefaces do we find the man Ficino, and learn to know
                    his thoughts and sentiments unclouded by a mist of citations; these minor
                    compositions have therefore a certain permanent value, and will continually be
                    studied for the light they throw upon the learned circle gathered round Lorenzo
                    in the golden age of humanism.</p>
