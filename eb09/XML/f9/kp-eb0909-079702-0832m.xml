                    (1337-14101). The personal history of Froissart, the circumstances of his birth
                    and education, the incidents of his life, must all be sought in his own verses
                    and chronicles. He possessed in his own lifetime no such fame as that which
                    attended the steps of Petrarch; when he died it did not occur to his successors
                    that a chapter might well be added to his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>
                    setting forth what manner of man he was who wrote it. The village of Lestines,
                    where he was curé, has long forgotten that a great writer ever lived there. They
                    cannot point to any house in Valenciennes as the lodging in which he put
                    together his notes and made history out of personal reminiscences. It is not
                    certain when or where he died, or where he was buried. One church, it is true,
                    doubtfully claims the honour of holding his bones. It is that of St Monegundaof
                    Chimay.</p>
                <p>Gallorum sublimis honos et fama tuorum, Hic Froissante, jaces, <hi rend="italic"
                    >si modo forte jaces.</hi></p>
                <p>It is fortunate, therefore, that the scattered statements in his writings may be
                    so pieced together as to afford a tolerably connected history of his life year
                    after year. The personality of the man, independently of his adventures, may be
                    arrived at by the same process. It will be found that Froissart, without meaning
                    it, has pourtrayed himself in clear and well-defined outline. His forefathers
                    were <hi rend="italic">jurés</hi> of the little town of Beaumont, lying near the
                    river <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0833-0798"/> Sambre, to the west of the forest of Ardennes.
                    Early in the 14th century the castle and seigneurie of Beaumont fell into the
                    hands of Jean, younger son of the count of Hainault. With this Jean, sire de
                    Beaumont, lived a certain canon of Liège called Jean le Bel, who, fortunately,
                    was not content simply to enjoy life. Instigated by his seigneur he set himself
                    to write contemporary history, to tell “la pure veriteit de tout li fait
                    entièrement al manire de chroniques.” With this view, he compiled two books of
                    chronicles. And the chronicles of Jean le Bel were not the only literary
                    monuments belonging to the castle of Beaumont. A hundred years before him
                    Baldwin D’Avemes,the then seigneur, had caused to be written a book of
                    chronicles or rather genealogies. It must therefore be remembered that when
                    Froissart undertook his own chronicles, he was not conceiving a new idea, but
                    only following along familiar lines.</p>
                <p>Some 20 miles from Beaumont stood the prosperous city of Valenciennes, possessed
                    in the 14th century of important privileges and a flourishing trade, second only
                    to places like Bruges or Ghent in influence, population, and wealth. Beaumont,
                    once her rival, now regarded Valenciennes as a place where the ambitious might
                    seek for wealth or advancement, and among those who migrated thither was the
                    father of Froissart. He appears from a single passage in his son’s verses to
                    have been a painter of armorial bearings. There was, it may be noted, already
                    what may be called a school of painters at Valenciennes. Among them were Jean
                    and Colin de Valenciennes and André Beau-Neveu, of whom Froissart says that he
                    had not his equal in any country.</p>
                <p>The date generally adopted for his birth is 1337. In after years Froissart
                    pleased himself by recalling in verse the scenes and pursuits of his childhood.
                    These are presented in vague generalities. There is nothing to show that he was
                    unlike any other boys, and, unfortunately, it did not occur to him that a
                    photograph of a schoolboy’s life amid bourgeois surroundings would be to
                    posterity quite as interesting as that faithful portraiture of courts and
                    knights which he has drawn up in his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle.</hi> As it is,
                    we learn that he loved games of dexterity and skill rather than the sedentary
                    amusements of chess and draughts, that he was beaten when he did not know his
                    lessons, that with his companions he played at tournaments, and that he was
                    always conscious—a statement which must be accepted with suspicion—that he was
                    born</p>
                <p>“Loer Dieu et servir le monde.”</p>
                <p>In any case he was born in a place, as well as at a time, singularly adapted to
                    fill the brain of an imaginative boy. Valenciennes, at the present day a dull
                    town, was then a city extremely rich in romantic associations. Not far from its
                    walls was the western fringe of the great forest of Ardennes, sacred to the
                    memory of Pepin, Charlemagne, Roland, and Ogier. Along the banks of the Scheldt
                    stood, one after the other, not then in ruinsj but bright with banners, thegleam
                    of armour, and the liveries of the men at arms, castles whose seigneurs, now
                    forgotten, were famous in their day for many a gallant feat of arms. The castle
                    of Valenciennes itself was illustrious in the romance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perceforest∙.</hi> there was born that most glorious and most luckless hero,
                    Baldwin, first emperor of Constantinople. All the splendour of mediaeval life
                    was to be seen in Froissart’s native city: on the walls of the Salle le Comte
                    glittered—perhaps painted by his father—the arms and scutcheons beneath the
                    banners and helmets of Luxembourg, Hainault, and Avesnes; the streets were
                    crowded with knights and soldiers, priests, artisans, and merchants·; the
                    churches were rich with stained glass, delicate tracery, and precious carving;
                    there were libraries full of richly illuminated manuscripts on which the boy
                    could gaze with delight; every year there was the/éteof the∕&gt;wy <hi
                    rend="italic">d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Amour de Valenciennes,</hi> at which he
                    would hear the verses of the competing poets; there were festivals, masques,
                    mummeries, and moralities. And, whatever there might be elsewhere, in this happy
                    city there was only the pomp, and not the misery, of war; the fields without
                    were tilled, and the harvests reaped, in security; the workman within plied his
                    craft unmolested for good wage. But the eyes of the boy were turned upon the
                    castle and not upon the town; it was the splendour of the knights which dazzled
                    him, insomuch that he regarded and continued ever afterwards to regard a prince
                    gallant in the field, glittering of apparel, lavish of largesse, as almost a
                    god.</p>
                <p>The moon, he says, rules the first four years of life; Mercury the next ten;
                    Venus follows. He was fourteen when the last goddess appeared to him in person,
                    as he tells us, after the manner of his time, and informed him that he was to
                    love a lady, “belle, jone, et gente.” Awaiting this happy event, he began to
                    consider how best to earn his livelihood. They first placed him in some
                    commercial position—impossible now to say of what kind—which he simply calls “la
                    marchandise.” This undoubtedly means some kind of buying and selling, not a
                    handicraft at all. He very soon abandoned merchandise—“car vaut mieux science
                    qu’ argens ”—and resolved on becoming a learned clerk. He then naturally began
                    to make verses, like every other learned clerk. Quite as naturally, and still in
                    the character of a learned clerk, he fulfilled the prophecy of Venus, and fell
                    in love. He found one day a demoiselle reading a book of romances. He did not
                    know who she was, but stealing gently towards her, he asked her what book she
                    was reading, lt was the romance of <hi rend="italic">Cleomades.</hi> He remarks
                    the singular beauty of her blue eyes and fair hair, while she reads a page or
                    two, and then—one would almost suspect a reminiscence ,of Dante—</p>
                <p>“Adont laissâmes nous le lire.”</p>
                <p>He was thus provided with that essential for soldier, knight, or poet, a
                    mistress,—one for whom he could write verses. She was rich and he was poor; she
                    was nobly born and he obscure; it was long before she would accept the devotion,
                    even of the conventional kind which Froissart offered her, and which would in no
                    way interfere with the practical business of her life. And in this hopeless way,
                    the passion of the young poet remaining the same, and the coldness of the lady
                    being unaltered, the course of this passion ran on for some time. Nor was it
                    .until the day of Froissart’s departure from his native town that she gave him
                    an interview and spoke kindly to him, even promising, with tears in her eyes,
                    that “Doulce Pensée” would assure him that she would have no joyous day until
                    she should see him again.</p>
                <p>He was eighteen years of age; he had learned all that he wanted to learn; he
                    possessed the mechanical art of verse; he had read the slender stock of
                    classical literature accessible; he longed to see the world. He must already
                    have acquired some distinction, because, on setting out for the court of
                    England, he was able to take with him letters of recommendation from the king of
                    Bohemia and the count of Hainault to Queen Philippa, niece of the latter. He was
                    well received by the queen, always ready to welcome her own countrymen; he wrote
                    ballades and virelays for her and her ladies. But after a year he began to pine
                    for another sight of “la très douce, simple, et quoie,” whom he loved loyally.
                    Good Queen Philippa, perceiving his altered looks and guessing the cause, made
                    him confess that he was in love and longed to see his mistress. She gave him his
                    <hi rend="italic">congé</hi> on the condition that he was to return. It is clear
                    that the young clerk had already learned to ingratiate himself with princes.</p>
                <p>The conclusion of his single love adventure is simply and unaffectedly told in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Trettie de</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Espinette</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Amoureuse.</hi> It was a passion conducted on the well-known lines of

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0834-0799"/> love; the pair exchanged violets and roses, the
                    lady-accepted ballads; Froissart became either openly or in secret her
                    recognized lover, a mere title of honour, which conferred distinction on her who
                    bestowed it, as well as upon him who received it. But the progress of the amour
                    was rudely interrupted by the arts of “Malebouche,” or Calumny. The story,
                    whatever it was, that Malebouche whispered in the ear of the lady, led to a
                    complete rupture. The <hi rend="italic">damoi-selle</hi> not only scornfully
                    refused to speak to her lover or acknowledge him, but even seized him by the
                    hair and pulled out a handful. Nor would she ever be reconciled to him again.
                    Years afterwards, when Froissart writes the story of his one love passage, he
                    shows that he still takes delight in the remembrance of her, loves to draw her
                    portrait, and lingers with fondness over the thought of what she once was to
                    him.</p>
                <p>Perhaps to get healed of his sorrow, Froissart began those wanderings in which
                    the best part of his life was to be consumed. He first visited Avignon, perhaps
                    to ask for a benefice, perhaps as the bearer of a message from the bishop of
                    Cambray to pope or cardinal. It was in the year 1360, and in the pontificate of
                    Innocent VI. From the papal city he seems to have gone to Paris, perhaps charged
                    with a diplomatic mission. In 1361 he returned to England after an absence of
                    five years. He certainly interpreted his leave of absence in a liberal spirit,
                    and it may have been with a view of averting the displeasure of his kind-hearted
                    protector that he brought with him as a present a book of rhymed chronicles
                    written by himself. He says that notwithstanding his youth, he took upon himself
                    the task “à rimer et à dicter”— which can only mean to “turn into verse ”—an
                    account of the wars of his own time, which he carried over to England in a book
                    “tout compilé,”—complete to date,—and presented to his noble mistress Philippa
                    of Hainault, who joyfully and gently received it of him. Such a rhymed chronicle
                    was no new thing. One Colin had already turned the battle of Crécy into verse.
                    The queen made young Froissart one of her secretaries, and he began to serve her
                    with “beaux dittiés et traités amoureux.”</p>
                <p>Froissart would probably have been content to go on living at ease in this
                    congenial atmosphere of flattery, praise, and caresses, pouring out his virelays
                    and chansons according to demand with facile monotony, but for the instigation
                    of Queen Philippa, who seems to have suggested to him the propriety of
                    travelling in order to get information for more rhymed chronicles. It was at her
                    charges that Froissart made his first serious journey. He seems to have
                    travelled a great part of the way alone, or accompanied only by his servants,
                    for he was fain to beguile the journey by composing an imaginary conversation in
                    verse between his horse and his hound. This may be found among his published
                    poems, but it does not repay perusal. In Scotland he met with a favourable
                    reception, not only from King David but from William of Douglas, and from the
                    Earls of Fife, Mar, March, and others. The souvenirs of this journey are found
                    scattered about in the chronicles. He was evidently much impressed with the
                    Scotch; he speaks of the valour of the Douglas, the Campbell, the Ramsay, and
                    the Graham; he describes the hospitality and rude life of the Highlanders; he
                    admires the great castles of Stirling and Roxburgh, and the famous abbey of
                    Melrose. His travels in Scotland lasted for six months. Returning southwards he
                    rode along the whole course of the Roman wall, a thing alone sufficient to show
                    that he possessed the true spirit of an archaeologist; he thought that Carlisle
                    was Carlyon, and congratulated himself on having found King Arthur’s capital; he
                    calls Westmoreland, where the common people still spoke the ancient British
                    tongue, North Wales; he rode down the banks of the Severn, and returned to
                    London by way of Oxford—“Γescole d’Asque-Suffort.”</p>
                <p>In London Froissart entered into the service of King John of France as secretary,
                    and grew daily more courtly, more in favour with princes and great ladies. He
                    probably acquired at this period that art, in which he has probably never been
                    surpassed, of making people tell him all they knew. No newspaper correspondent,
                    no American interviewer, has ever equalled this mediaeval collector of
                    intelligence. From Queen Philippa, who ccnfided to him the tender story of her
                    youthful and lasting love for her great husband, down to the simplest
                    knight—Froissart conversed with none beneath the rank of gentlemen—all united in
                    telling this man what he wanted to know. He wanted to know everything: he liked
                    the story of a battle from both sides and from many points of view; he wanted
                    the details of every little cavalry skirmish, every capture of a castle, every
                    gallant action and brave deed. And what was more remarkable he forgot nothing.
                    “I had,” he says, “thanks to God, sense, memory, good remembrance of everything,
                    and an intellect clear and keen to seize upon the acts which I could learn.” But
                    as yet he had not begun to write in prose.</p>
                <p>At the age of twenty-nine, in 1366, Froissart once more left England. This time
                    he repaired first to Brussels, whither were gathered together a great concourse
                    of minstrels from all parts, from the courts of the kings of Denmark, Navarre,
                    and Aragon, from those of the dukes of Lancaster, Bavaria, and Brunswick. Hither
                    came all who could “rimer et dieter.” "What distinction Froissart gained is not
                    stated; but he received a gift of money as appears from the accounts, “uni
                    Fritsardo, dictori, qui est cum regina Angliae, dicto die, vi. mottones.”</p>
                <p>After this congress of versifiers, he made his way to Brittany, where he heard
                    from eye-witnesses and knights who had actually fought there details of the
                    battles of Cotſherel and Auray, the Great Day of the Thirty and the heroism of
                    Jeanne de Montfort. Windsor Herald told him something about Auray, and a French
                    knight, one Antoine de Beaujeu, gave him the details of Cocherel. From Brittany
                    he went southwards to Nantes, La Rochelle, and Bordeaux, where he arrived a few
                    days before the visit of Richard, afterwards second of that name. He accompanied
                    the Black Prince to Dax, and hoped to go on with him into Spain, but was
                    despatched to England on a mission. He next formed part of the expedition which
                    escorted Lionel duke of Clarence to Milan, to marry the daughter of Galeazzo
                    Visconti. Chaucer was also one of the prince’s suite. At the wedding banquet
                    Petrarch was a guest sitting among the princes.</p>
                <p>From Milan Froissart, accepting gratefully a <hi rend="italic">coite hardie</hi>
                    with 20 florins of gold, set out upon his travels in Italy. At Bologna, then in
                    decadence, he met Peter king of Cyprus, from whose follower and minister,
                    Eustache de Conflans, he learned many interesting particulars of the king’s
                    exploits. He accompanied Peter as far as Venice, where he left him after
                    receiving a gift of 40 ducats. With them and his <hi rend="italic">cotte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hardie,</hi> still lined we may hope with the 20 florins,
                    Froissart betook himself to Rome. The city was then at its lowest point: the
                    churches were roofless; there was no pope; there were no pilgrims; there was no
                    splendour; and yet, says Froissart sadly,</p>
                <p>“Ce furent jadis en Rome, Li plus ρreu et li plus sage homme Car par sens tons
                    les arts passèrent.</p>
                <p>It was at Rome that he learned the death of his friend King Peter of Cyprus, and,
                    worse still, an irreparable loss to him, that of the good Queen Philippa, of
                    whom he writes, in grateful remembrance—</p>
                <p>“Propices li soit Diex à l’âme! J’en suis bien tenus de pryer Et ses larghesces
                    escuyer, Car elle me fist et créa.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0835-0800"/> Philippa dead, Froissart looked around for a new
                    patron. Then he hastened back to his own country and presented himself, with a
                    new book in French, to the duchess of Brabant, from whom he received the sum of
                    16 francs, given in the accounts as paid <hi rend="italic">uni Frissardo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dictatori.</hi> The use of the word <hi rend="italic">uni</hi>
                    does not imply any meanness of position, but is simply an equivalent to the
                    modern French <hi rend="italic">sieur.</hi> Froissart may also have found a
                    patron in Yolande de Bar, grandmother of King René of Anjou. In any case he
                    received a substantial gift from some one in the shape of the benefice of
                    Lestines, a village some three or four miles from the town of Binche. Also, in
                    addition to his cure, he got placed upon the duke of Brabant’s pension list, and
                    was entitled to a yearly grant of grain and wine, with some small sum in
                    money.</p>
                <p>It is clear, from Froissart’s own account of himself, that he was by no means 3
                    man who would at the age of four or five and thirty be contented to sit down at
                    ease to discharge the duties of parish priest, to say mass, to bury the dea l,
                    to marry the villagers, and to baptize the young. In these days, and in that
                    country, it does not seem that other duties were expected. Preaching was not
                    required, godliness of life, piety, good works, and the graces of a modern
                    ecclesiastic were not looked for. Therefore, when Froissart complains to himself
                    that the taverns of Lestines got 500 francs of his money, we need not at once
                    set him down as cither a bad priest, or exceptionally given to drink. The people
                    of the place were greatly addicted to wine; the <hi rend="italic">taverniers de
                    Lestines</hi> proverbially sold good wine; the Flemings were proverbially of a
                    joyous disposition—</p>
                <p>“Ceux de Hainaut chantent à pleines gorges.”</p>
                <p>Froissart, the parish priest of courtly manners, no doubt drank with the rest,
                    and listened if they sang his own, not the coarse country songs. Mostly he
                    preferred the society of Gerard d’Obies, provost of Binche, and the little
                    circle of knights within that town. Or, for it was not incumbent on him to be
                    always in residence, he repaired to the court of Coudenberg, and became “moult
                    frère et accointé” with the duke of Brabant. And then came Gui de Blois, one of
                    King John’s hostages in London in the old days. He had been fighting in Prussia
                    with the Teutonic knights, and now, a little tired of war, proposed to settle
                    down for a time in his castle of Beaumont. This prince was a member of the great
                    house of Chatillon. He was count of Blois, of Soissons, and of Chimay. He had
                    now, about the year 1374, an excellent reputation as a good captain. In him
                    Froissart, who hastened to resume acquaintance, found a new patron. More than
                    that, it was this sire de Beaumont, in emulation of his grandfather, the patron
                    of Jean le Bel, who advised Froissart seriously to take in hand the history of
                    his own time. Froissart was then in his thirty-sixth year. For twenty years he
                    had been rhyming, for eighteen he had been making verses for queens and ladies.
                    Yet during all this time he had been accumulating in his retentive brain the
                    materials for his future work.</p>
                <p>He began by editing so to speak, that is, by rewriting with additions the work of
                    Jean le Bel; Gui de Blois, among others, supplied him with additional
                    information. His own notes, taken from information obtained in his travels, gave
                    him more details, and when in 1374 Gui married Marie de Namur, Froissart found
                    in the bride’s father, Robert de Namur, one who had himself largely shared in
                    the events which he had to relate. He, for instance, is the authority for the
                    story of the siege of Calais and the six burgesses. Provided with these
                    materials, Froissart remained at Lestines, or at Beaumont, arranging and writing
                    his chronicles. During this period, too, he composed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Espinette</hi><hi rend="italic">Amoureux,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Joli
                    Buisson de</hi><hi rend="italic">Jonesce,</hi> and his romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">M'eliador.</hi> He also became chaplain to the count of Blois, and
                    obtained a canonry of Chimay. After this appointment we hear nothing more of
                    Lestines, which he probably resigned.</p>
                <p>In these quiet pursuits he passed twelve years, years of which we hear nothing,
                    probably because there was nothing to tell. In 1386 his travels began again,
                    when he accompanied Guito his castle at Blois, in order to celebrate the
                    marriage of his son Louis de Dunois with Marie de Berry. He wrote a <hi
                    rend="italic">pastourelle</hi> in honour of the event. Then he attached himself
                    for a few days to the duke of Berry, from whom he learned certain particulars of
                    current events, aud then, becoming aware of what promised to be the most mighty
                    feat of arms of his time, he hastened to Sluys in order to be on the spot. At
                    this port the French were collecting an enormous fleet, and making preparations
                    of the greatest magnitude in order to repeat the invasion of William the
                    Conqueror, They were tired of being invaded by the English, and wished to turn
                    the tables. The talk was all of conquering the country and dividing it among the
                    knights, as had been done by the Normans. It is not clear whether Froissart
                    intended to go over with the invaders; but as his sympathies are ever with the
                    side where he happens to be, he exhausts himself in admiration of this grand
                    gathering of ships and men. “Any one,” he says, “who had a fever would have been
                    cured of his malady merely by going to look at the fleet.” But the delays of the
                    duke of Berry, and the arrival of bad weather, spoiled everything. There was no
                    invasion of England. In Flanders Froissart met many knights who had fought at
                    Rosebeque, and could tell him of the troubles which in a few years desolated
                    that country, once so prosperous. He set himself to ascertain the history with
                    as much accuracy as the comparison of various accounts by eye witnesses and
                    actors would allow. He stayed at Ghent, among those ruined merchants and
                    mechanics, for whom, as one of the same class, he felt a sympathy never extended
                    to English or French, perhaps quite as unfortunate, and he devotes no fewer than
                    300 chapters to the Flemish troubles, an amount out of all proportion to the
                    comparative importance of the events. This portion of the chronicle was written
                    at Valenciennes. During this residence in his birthplace his verses were crowned
                    at the “puys d’amour” of Valenciennes and Tournay.</p>
                <p>This part of his work finished, he considered what to do next. There was small
                    chance of anything important happening in Picardy or Hainault, and he determined
                    on making a journey to the south of France in order to learn something new. He
                    was then fifty-one years of age, and being still, as he tells us, in his prime,
                    “of an age, strength, and limbs able to bear fatigue,” he set out as eager to
                    see new places as when, 33 years before, he rode through Scotland and marvelled
                    at the bravery of the Douglas. What he had, in addition to strength, good
                    memory, and good spirits, was a manner singularly pleasing, and great personal
                    force of character. This he does not tell us, but it comes out abundantly in his
                    writings; and, which he does tell us, he took a singular delight in his book.
                    “The more I work at it,” he says, “the better am I pleased with it.”</p>
                <p>On this occasion he rode first to Blois; on the way he fell in with two knights
                    who told him of the disasters of the English army in Spain; one of them also
                    informed him of the splendid hospitalities and generosity of Gaston Phaebus,
                    count of Foix, on hearing of which Froissart resolved to seek him out. He
                    avoided the English provinces of Poitou and Guienne, and rode southwards through
                    Berry, Auvergne, and Languedoc. Arrived at Foix he discovered that the count was
                    at Orthez, whither he proceeded in company with a knight named Espaingde Lyon,
                    who, Froissart found, had not only fought but could describe.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n836/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0836-0801"/>
                <p>The account of those few days’ ride with Espaing de Lyon is the most charming,
                    the most graphic, and the most vivid chapter in the whole of Froissart. Every
                    turn of the road brings with it the sight of a ruined castle, about which this
                    knight of many memories has a tale or a reminiscence. The whole country teems
                    with fighting stories. Froissart never tires of listening nor the good knight of
                    telling. “Sainte Marie!” cries Froissart in mere rapture. “How pleasant are your
                    tales, and how much do they profit me while you relate them! And you shall not
                    lose your trouble, for they shall all be set down in memory and remembrance in
                    the history which I am writing.” Arrived at length at Orthez, Froissart lost no
                    time in presenting his credentials to the count of Foix. Gaston Phoebus was at
                    this time fifty-nine years of age. His wife, from whom he was separated, was
                    that princess, sister of Charles of Navarre, with whom Guillaume de Machault
                    carried on his innocent and poetical amour. The story of the miserable death of
                    his son is well known, and may be read in Froissart. But that was already a tale
                    of the past, and the state which the count kept up was that of a monarch. To
                    such a prince such a visitor as Froissart would be in every way welcome. Mindful
                    no doubt of those paid clerks who were always writing verses, Froissart
                    introduced himself as a chronicler. He could, of course, rhyme, and in proof he
                    brought with him his romance of <hi rend="italic">Méliador·,</hi> but he did not
                    present himself as a wandering poet. The count received him graciously, speedily
                    discovered the good qualities of his guest, and often invited him to read his
                    <hi rend="italic">Méliador</hi> aloud in the evening, during which time, says
                    Froissart, “nobody dared to say a word, because he wished me to be heard, such
                    great delight did he take in listening.” Very soon Froissart, from reader of a
                    romance, became <hi rend="italic">raconteur</hi> of the things he had seen and
                    heard; the next step was that the count himself began to talk of affairs, so
                    that the note-book was again in requisition. There was a good deal, too, to be
                    learned of people about the court. One knight recently returned from the East
                    told about the Genoese occupation of Famagosta; two more had been in the fray of
                    Otterbourne; others had been in the Spanish wars.</p>
                <p>Leaving Gaston at length, Froissart assisted at the wedding of the old duke of
                    Berry with the youthful Jeanne de Bourbon, and was present at the grand
                    reception given to Isabeau of Bavaria by the Parisians. He then returned to
                    Valenciennes, and sat down to write his fourth book. A journey undertaken at
                    this time is characteristic of the thorough and conscientious spirit in which he
                    composed his work; it ill ustrates also his restless and curious spirit. While
                    engaged in the events of the year 1385 he became aware that his notes taken at
                    Orthez and elsewhere on the affairs of Castile and Portugal were wanting in
                    completeness. He left Valenciennes and hastened to Bruges, where, he felt
                    certain, he should find some one who would help him. There was, in fact, at this
                    great commercial centre, a colony of Portuguese. From them he learned that a
                    certain Portuguese knight, Dorn Juan Fernand Pacheco, was at the moment in
                    Middelburg on the point of starting for Prussia. He instantly embarked at Sluys,
                    reached Middelburg in time to catch this knight, introduced himself, and
                    conversed with him uninterruptedly for the space of six days, getting his
                    information on the promise of due acknowledgment. During the next two years we
                    learn little of his movements. He seems, however, to have had trouble with his
                    seigneur Gui de Blois, and even to have resigned his chaplaincy. Froissart is
                    tender with Gui’s reputation, mindful of past favours, and remembering how great
                    a lord he is. Yet the truth is clear that in his declining years the once
                    gallant Gui de Blois became a glutton and a drunkard, and allowed his affairs to
                    fall into the greatest disorder. So much was he crippled with debt that he was
                    obliged to sell his castle and county of Blois to the king of France. Froissart
                    lays all the blame on evil counsellors. “He was my lord and master,” he says
                    simply, “an honourable lord and of great reputation; but he trusted too easily
                    in those who looked for neither his welfare nor his honour.” Although canon of
                    Chimay and perhaps curé of Lestines as well, it would seem as if Froissart was
                    not able to live without a patron. He next calls Robert de Namur his seigneur,
                    and dedicates to him, in a general introduction, the whole of his chronicles. We
                    then find him at Abbeville, trying to learn all about the negotiations pending
                    between Charles VI. and the English. He was unsuccessful, either because he
                    could not get at those who knew what was going on, or because the secret was too
                    well kept He next made his last visit to England, where, after forty years’
                    absence, he naturally found no one who remembered him. Here he gave King Richard
                    a copy of his “traités amoureux,” and got favour at court. He stayed in England
                    some months, seeking information on all points from his friends Henry
                    Chrysteadand Richard Stury, from the dukes of York and Gloucester, and from
                    Robert the Hermit</p>
                <p>On his return to France, he found preparations going on for that unlucky crusade,
                    the end of which he describes in his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle.</hi> It was
                    headed by the count of Nevers. After him floated many a banner of knights,
                    descendants of the crusaders, who bore the proud titles of duke of Athens, duke
                    of Thebes, sire de Sidon, sire de Jericho. They were going to invade the
                    sultan’s empire by way of Hungary; they were going to march south; they would
                    reconquer the holy places. And presently we read how it all came to nothing, and
                    how the slaughtered knights lay dead outside the city of Nikopoli. In almost the
                    concluding words of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> the murder of Richard
                    II. of England is described. His death ends the long and crowded <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> though the pen of the writer struggles through a
                    few more unfinished sentences.</p>
                <p>The rest is vague tradition. He is said to have died at Chimay; it is further
                    said that he died in poverty so great that his relations could not even afford
                    to carve his name upon the headstone of his tomb; not one of his friends, not
                    even Eustache Deschamps, writes a line of regret in remembrance; the greatest
                    historian of his age had a reputation so limited that his death was no more
                    regarded than that of any common monk or obscure priest. We would willingly
                    place the date of his death, where his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> stops,
                    in the year 1400; but tradition assigns the date of 1410. What date more fitting
                    than the close of the century for one who has made that century illustrious for
                    ever?</p>
                <p>Among his friends were Guillaume de Machault, Eustache Deschamps, the most
                    vigorous poet of this age of decadence, and Cuvelier, a follower of Bertrand du
                    Guesclin. These alliances are certain. It is probable that he knew Chaucer, with
                    whom Deschamps maintained a poetical correspondence; there is nothing to show
                    that he ever made the acquaintance of Christine de Pisan. Froissart was more
                    proud of his poetry than his prose. Posterity has reversed this opinion, and
                    though a selection of his verse has been published, it would be difficult to
                    find an admirer, or even a reader, of his poems. The selection published by
                    Buchon in 1829 consists of the <hi rend="italic">Dit</hi><hi rend="italic">dou
                    Florin,</hi> half of which is a description of the power of money; the <hi

                    and pleasantly drawn, accompanied by rondeaux and virelays; the <hi

                    to the recollections of his own youth ∙ and various smaller pieces.</p>

                <p>Thθ verses arθ monotonous; the thoughts are not without poetical grace, but they
                    are expressed at tedious length. It would be, however, absurd to expect in
                    Froissart the vigour and verve possessed by none of his predecessors. The time
                    was gone when Marie de France, Rutebaeuf, and Thibaut de Champagne made the 13th
                    century language a medium for verse of which any literature might be proud.
                    Briefly, Froissart’s poetry, unless the unpublished portion be better than that
                    before us, is monotonous and mechanical. The chief merit it possesses is in
                    simplicity of diction. This not infrequently produces a pleasing effect.</p>
                <p>As for the character of his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> little need be
                    said. There has never been any difference of opinion on the distinctive merits
                    of this great work. It presents a vivid and faithful drawing of the things done
                    in the 14th century. No more graphic account exists of any age. No historian has
                    drawn so many and such faithful portraits. They are, it is true, portraits of
                    men as they seemed to the writer, not of men as they were. Froissart was
                    uncritical; he accepted princes by their appearance. Who, for instance, would
                    recognize in his portrait of Gaston Phaebus de Foix the cruel voluptuary,
                    stained with the blood of his own son, which we know him to have been?
                    Froissart, again, had no sense of historical responsibility; he was no judge to
                    inquire into motives and condemn actions; he was simply a chronicler. He has
                    been accused by French authors of lacking patriotism. Yet it must be remembered
                    that he was neither a Frenchman nor an Englishman, but a Fleming. He has been
                    accused of insensibility to suffering. Indignation against oppression was not,
                    however, common in the 14th century; why demand of Froissart a quality which is
                    rare enough even in our own time? Yet there are moments when, as in describing
                    the massacre of Limoges, he speaks with tears in his voice.</p>
                <p>Let him be judged by his own aims. “Before I commence this book,” he says, “I
                    pray the Saviour of all the world, who created every thing out of nothing, that
                    He will also create and put in me sense and understanding of so much worth, that
                    this book, which I have begun, I may continue and persevere in, so that all
                    those who shall read, see, and hear it may find in it delight and pleasance.” To
                    give delight and pleasure, then, was his sole design.</p>
                <p>As regards his personal character, Froissart depicts it himself for us. Such as
                    he was in youth, he tells us, so he remained in more advanced life; rejoicing
                    mightily in dances and carols, in hearing minstrels and poems; inclined to love
                    all those who love dogs and hawks; pricking up his cars at the uncorking of
                    bottles,—“Car au voire prens grand plaisir;” pleased with good cheer, gorgeous
                    apparel, and joyous society, but no commonplace reveller or greedy
                    voluptuary,—everything in Froissart was ruled by the good manners which he set
                    before all else; and always eager to listen to tales of war and battle. As we
                    have said above, he shows, not only by his success at courts, but also by the
                    whole tone of his writings, that he possessed a singularly winning manner and
                    strong personal character. He lived wholly in the present, and had no thought of
                    the coming changes. Born when chivalrous ideas were most widely spread, but the
                    spirit of chivalry itself, as inculcated by the best writers, in its decadence,
                    he is penetrated with the sense of knightly honour, and ascribes to all his
                    heroes alike those qualities which only the ideal knight possessed.</p>
                <p>The first edition of Froissart was published in Paris. It bears no date; the next
                    editions are those of the years 1505,1514, 1518, and <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> 52°. The best and most complete edition is that of Buchon, 1824, Which is
                    a continuation of one commenced by Dacier. An abridgment was made in Latin, by
                    Belieferest, and published in 1672. An English translation was made by
                    Bourcluer, Lord Berners, and published in London, 1525. The translation now in
                    use is that made by Thomas Johnes, and originally published in 1802- <hi
