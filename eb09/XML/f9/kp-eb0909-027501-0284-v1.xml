                        Matthias,</hi> sumamed Illyricus (1520-1575), a celebrated German theologian
                    of the time of the Reformation, was bom at Albona in Illyria in 1520. Having
                    lost his father in early childhood, he owed his education almost wholly to his
                    own unaided perseverance. At the age of seventeen he had resolved to enter a
                    convent in order to devote his life to sacred learning; but on the advice of one
                    of his relations, who had imbibed Reformation principles, he abandoned his
                    intention, and pursued his studies successively at Basel, Tübingen, and
                    Wittenberg. At Wittenberg he fell for a time into religious despondency, and
                    sought the advice of Martin Luther, who was successful not only in removing his
                    doubts, but in inspiring him with much of his own Reformation zeal. In 1544 he
                    became professor of Old Testament literature at Wittenberg, and soon began to
                    take an active and prominent part in the theological discussions of the time. He
                    strenuously opposed the Augsburg Interim and also the compromise of Melanchthon,
                    known as the Leipsic Interim, and was compelled on that account to resign his
                    professorship. From Wittenberg he proceeded to Magdeburg, and in 1557 he was
                    appointed professor of theology at Jena, but soon became involved in a
                    controversy with his colleague Strigel on the power of the human will in
                    conversion. Being a strong upholder of the doctrine of man’s natural inability,
                    be was induced by controversial straits to fall unwittingly into the Manichaean
                    heresy of affirming that original sin was not an accident in human nature, but
                    now belonged to its substance; and as he would not submit to ecclesiastical
                    censure, he was compelled in 1562 to resign his office. After staying for five
                    years in retirement at Ratisbon, he accepted the charge of a congregation in
                    Antwerp, but was soon compelled by religious persecution to leave that city for
                    Strasburg. Here his views regarding original sin again exposed him to
                    ecclesiastical censure, and he went to Frankfort-on-the-Maine, in the hospital
                    of which city he died in 1575, having spent the latter years of his life in
                    great poverty. Though the keen and uncompromising controversial spirit of
                    Flacius ultimately deprived him of the sympathy of almost all his friends, he is
                    better known to posterity for his labours in hermeneutics and church history
                    than as a controversialist. He may almost be called the founder of the science
                    of hermeneutics, and in the department of church history he rendered important
                    service by tracing to their source the legends and superstitious traditions by
                    which, in the annals of the church, truth had in a great measure been either
                    concealed or superseded. Among his numerous works may be mentioned his <hi
